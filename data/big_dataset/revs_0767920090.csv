0,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092172-jennie,1,"This book pissed me off more than anything I've read in a long time. In fact, I think the last thing I hated this much was Sharp Teeth. And this piece of drivel was way worse. This crazy bitch makes Dr. Laura look like a raging feminist. I understand that this woman is a doctor and I get that she thinks she was doing the world a favor by explaining why women are the way they are. HOWEVER, she takes a very stereotypical view of women and does not make any allowances for women whose behavior is different. She provides a ""scientific"" excuse for women to be bad at math and science and says that women tend to leave math/science careers for jobs where they can be with people because that is what women value. Um, right. Her evidence for this? She has a friend (yes, one, one friend) who did this. This book was so bad and so stereotypical that I had to put it down numerous times. In fact I couldn't even finish it because I was having fantasies of setting it on fire. On top of her science being suspect and her tone being patronizing 1950s bullshit her style rather sucked too. I love books that take science and make it readable, but this was not one of them. She had a very chatty, we're all girlfriends here so I don't have to explain things kind of attitude with the reader. She was neither witty nor enaging and her commentary was dull.All in all what this book did for me was to understand why people burn and ban books. Not that she doesn't have a right to spew her drivel on the world, but damn, do I wish that no one would ever read it."

Dr. Brizendine proved that you are powerless over the hormones in your brain! It's ok!"" *pat,pat* ""Why don't you take a Xanax and zone out in front of an episode of Grey's?""This book irritated me beyond belief. I think any person with a decent education understands that brain chemistry is a huge factor in human behavior. However, Dr. Brizendine uses it as an excuse and cop-out for everything. Her attitude for handling life in the face of what she seems to think are insurmountable hormones, is to medicate it all away. Is your teenage daughter pouty and rebellious? Give her drugs! Don't bother to worry about the effects these drugs might have on her developing brain. After all, you just want her to stop being a problem so you can get back to your life, right? What? In generations past, the young girl would have been taught to deal with her raging emotions and she would have been expected to live by family guidelines whether she liked it or not? Pssshaw. That would be too much work! Instead, teach her that she is powerless over her fleeting whims and how she can use that as an awesome justification for doing whatever the heck she wants whenever she wants. Yes. Drug her. DRUG HER. The book goes on to justify:~Women putting up with shitty treatment from men.~Ignoring their husband's needs after children arrive~Being unreasonably emotional in any situation~Ending their marriages after their children leaveI think Dr. Brizendine's message could be summed up by saying, ""Women aren't responsible for their actions. And thus, you can discount them whenever you want."""
2,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/814477-veronica,0,"I stopped reading this book on page 68.It's amazing I made it that far. Part of me thinks I should finish the book because I should know what is inside. People not only like to come to me for gender advice, but also test my boundaries on ""gender roles."" A friend loaned me this book, I believe as a way to see what my expert opinion of it would be. I have no idea how she feels about it.It frightens me to think this was a NY Times Best Seller. Oh, the masses who read this and loved it!You know what made me finally put this book down?*It wasn't her pointing out that female and male brains work in different ways. *It wasn't her stating on page 8 that a female engineer quit her work to be in a more people-oriented career, thus giving more credibility to the idea that engineers don't work with people or for people.*It wasn't even when she dug up the old ""I gave my daughter a truck and she treated it like a baby"" clich√©.*It was almost when she says men look for visual clues (plump lips, smooth skin) to ensure fertility when looking for women to date.It was her slut shaming. In the chapter about how the female brain works in the areas of love and trust, she states: (Warning, put that cup down and swallow that bite) ""Social reputation is often a factor in male assessment, since the most reproductively successful males also need to pick women who will mate only with them. Men want to ensure their paternity but also to be able to count on a woman's mothers skills to make sure that their offspring thrive. If Melissa had immediately gone to bed with Rob or showed off to him about all the guys she has had, his Stone Age brain might have judged that she would be unfaithful or had a bad reputation."" Go ahead, read that passage again. Yes, you read it correctly. Cave men don't want slutty women to hook up with.There's a lot of research in here and a lot of medical terms that aren't clearly explained. But from all the things on gender that I have learned from reading outside and inside the classroom and the science background I have, I have to say that this person takes facts and uses a huge rubber band to tie it to normative behavior. Instead of this book, pick up Pink Brain, Blue Brain. Sure it's 2-3 times longer, but it doesn't traffic in stereotypes and certainly believes that we have evolved from the Stone Age. A reader suggested Cordelia Fine's ""Delusion of Gender"" as another alternative to ""The Female Brain."" http://www.cordeliafine.com/delusions...Have other suggestions? Keep them coming!"
3,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,4,"In The Female Brain, neuropsychiatrist Dr. Louann Brizendine uses clinical research and the experience of counseling patients to examine how the many various hormones flowing through a woman's body may affect their actions and behavior. It covers the emotional development and brain processes of women through the various stages of their lives, beginning at the beginning with childhood, moving through the tumultuous teens and the horror that is puberty and progress through womanhood into old age. The use of science to dissect human behavior is tricky since our moods, reactions, etc are slippery little fish. Brizendine's use of animal research raises validity questions (I.E. rats are not humans, so how can it apply?), however she is the first to admit that none of this is 100% pure, unadulterated fact. Just the same, there are some insights within The Female Brain that appear to be highly probable cause-effect truths, and even if they're not, this whole subject is still very fascinating! Hard science it is not. Not all the way through. This is a book for the layman. It's simplified and generalized. Sweeping statements are made about entire genders. Which is not to say the doctor believes ""all"" women do this or that. She just doesn't keep reminding the reader of the exceptions. Regardless, I found the entire book entertaining and, admittedly, quite a bit of it to be enlightening, as I imagine it might be to most men. Even some women would do well to give this a read, because how often do you hear yourself say something like, ""Sometimes I just don't understand my mother/daughter!""?"
4,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134134-david-rim,1,"The takeaway from this book is that the average woman is a hyper-sensitive control freak ruled by hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin, testosterone in the same way that some people feel they're controlled by the movement of the stars. These hormones in turn are determined by a combination of genetics and rearing but developed over time as a reaction to evolutionary necessities. All of which enforce behavior which you know of as a set of common stereotypes. There's not much scientific data to back up these claims but that doesn't stop Luann Brizendine, MD. This writing itself is awful -- an overly breezy example of the worst of pop science. It reads like a long magazine article written in a chatty style which among other things is directed towards an exclusively female audience. Worse, the science is poor, relying mostly on case study from private practice and completely irrelevant animal studies giving 0 background on studies. Just reporting findings is fine in these kind of books, but they should at least make a coherent argument. Example: Brizendine describes a rat experiment wherein researchers rubbed a local anesthetic on a mother rat's mammaries. Brizendine claims that the lack of sensation resulted in lack of bonding between pup and mother, and these poor rat pups as a consequence suffered from a host of problems later in the experiment. Therefore, a woman should breast-feed. Wow -- I think I need a little more information before I can accept that line of reasoning.On the other hand, I do think that brain chemistry is extremely important in determining our moods and behavior. I can buy the basic premise. The problem is that I'm not interested in why so many women exhibit stereotypical behavior. I'm more interested in the how. How does estrogen protect brain cells? How does oxytocin create feelings of relaxation? What is an emotion, and how do you know you're having one anyways? Is sadness for a woman the same thing as sadness for me? Really, I'm not interested in why women like rich, good looking, attentive guys (compared to what? poor, ugly, insensitve guys?). I'm more interested in how they know and how they evaluate what they see and feel and how that differs from the way I see myself. None of these questions even get asked. It's a crying shame. "
5,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/179382-audrey-babkirk-wellons,1,"Please do not believe what is said in this book before you check the references. Many of the assertions are false or a misinterpretation of facts. Here a linguistics professor from the University of Pennsylvania fact-checks a short passage from ""The Female Brain"" and finds no evidence to support the book's claims about women talking more than men: http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/langua... Delusions of Gender (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8...) also dismantles many of the harmful claims in ""The Female Brain."" I read this book years ago and believed it. I am sorry if my initial positive review caused anyone to likewise read it and believe the same distorted views about women. Many reviewers also took it at face value (see http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/langua...).This is how bad science gets spread ..."
6,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16227957-chloe,1,"The train wreck started with the initial characterization of the hormones. Establishing the hormones with a particular gender and giving them ‚Äújobs‚Äù that fit with gender roles does not bode well for the hope to see an objective look at the female brain without sexist stereotypes or gender roles muddling the examination of evidence.Then it got into the book. At the beginning, it casually implied that PMS is scientifically valid. I was disappointed in that since there are quite a few medical professionals that have come out to say that the hormonal effects on a woman‚Äôs emotional state before menstruation is pretty much a social construct. It would have been nice to see some facts and studies laid out about the opposing theories that exist, but no it picked a side, and presented it as if there was no debate. Even the prevalence of the common side effects among women around menstruation would have been nice, but this book is woefully barren of many figures for a science book. And sadly at times it is even without facts.Many times the author states a common pop culture bit of pseudo-science psychology that many have heard, but there is no real scientific evidence for it being true. The first ‚Äúfact‚Äù that had a lot of ‚Äútruthiness‚Äù to it was the fact about how many words men and women say in a day on average. ‚ÄúMen use about seven thousand words per day. Women use about twenty-thousand.‚Äù This is scientifically false. Men and women actually say the same amount of words per day, around seven thousand.The second ‚Äúfact‚Äù I had some real beef with was the statement that males are more likely to be on the autistic spectrum, and girls aren‚Äôt. That is a twisting of data and leaving out social behaviors and expectations out of identifying children on the autistic spectrum. The truth is boys are diagnosed more often than girls, however this does not mean that girls aren‚Äôt autistic. Typically the expression of autism is different between boys and girls, due to how the different genders are conditioned to socially interact, a boy with autism is more likely to have a angry outburst while the girl is more likely to be reserved and quiet. In the end the angry outburst gets more attention and therefore a diagnose occurs, while a quiet child is hardly seen as problematic, and therefore no source of that favorable behavior is sought.‚ÄúMen are on average twenty times more aggressive than women.‚Äù While this is the social construct that is in place in many societies, there is plenty of data that put in a power position, women are just as likely to be as aggressive as men can be. As more women are rising up in the ranks of businesses, guess what, rates of women sexually harassing male employees are going up as well. Also there is a lot of speculation about that the cases of husbands who get physically abused by the wives are drastically under reported, mainly due to the social stigma that men are the aggressors and women are the victims.‚ÄúGirls are motivated‚Äîon a molecular and neurological level‚Äîto ease and prevent social conflict.‚Äù How would that explain mean girls?Oh and here is a big one: ‚Äú85% of twenty- to thirty-year-old males think about sex every fifty-two seconds and women think about it once a day‚Äîup to three or four times on fertile days.‚Äù Not only is this statistically impossible, but it is incredibly sexist too. It reinforces the concept that females aren‚Äôt naturally sexual, and that men are naturally hyper-sexual. And it makes a woman who enjoys sex look abnormal. It is covert slut-shaming.And her justification about why less women enter into science and math professions totally ignores the documented fact of stereotype threat that goes into effect when women go against expected female behavior. If you give a test to boys and girls, both will perform similarly, however if before the test if the teacher says ‚Äúoh the boys always do well on this test,‚Äù there is a drastic bump in the boys‚Äô score and a drop in the girls‚Äô score. The same thing happens when women enter into male dominated fields, and the result less women enter into those fields, and less women remain in those fields.The thing is that most of these scientifically baseless ‚Äúfacts‚Äù are social fallacies that people started saying to justify sexist concepts about the genders. The fact that the author uses them, to support her theory, in my opinion, makes her the book lose all credibility. And as I said, since many of these statements she uses have no scientific merit, what about the references in the back?In most science books I read there are either footnotes or superscripts that connect a statement stated in the book to the corresponding source in the bibliography. In this book, while there is a bibliography, there is no connection from any statement made to the sources in the back. Which makes sense, since the original scientific papers and such, in no way supports what the author theorizes and definitely not the fallacies she uses.A big problem is that most of the book is anecdotal. She ends up presenting a very narrow view of experience to justify her theory. She explains the neurological structures of the brain, and then she goes into an anecdote as if it confirms what she thought about the expression of the brain structure. She doesn‚Äôt take into account social conditioning and pressure.It pains me to no end that this book not only masquerades as scientifically valid but people are just lapping up this neurosexism and recommending that everyone else drink the kool-aid, ultimately perpetuating sexist stereotypes and reaffirming gender roles that have been constructed.This book tells girls ""Of course you are the emotional irrational mess society says that you are! I can prove it with 'science'! Don't bother your pretty little emotional wreck of a head with math and science you are just not wired to understand it anyway.""For anyone who says that they loved this book, I would highly recommend the book Delusions of Gender by Cordelia Fine. Please for the love of sanity read this book and really try to understand the science behind claims and studies and don't just buy into it because it feels true without any real meat of evidence to add to the claims."
7,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811366-esmeralda-rupp-spangle,1,"""This crazy bitch makes Dr. Laura look like a raging feminist""Another Goodreads reviewer""My problems with this book were plentiful. It was, in general, pretty poorly written, but often scientists don't make the all time best writers. I find I can often forgive this shortcoming if their science is sound (and interesting), but sadly Louanne Brizendine seems to rely on her own personal experience from cases she has observed firsthand and vague, undocumented, anecdotal ""evidence"" almost exclusively. Rather than giving us the real cognitive science studies, she turns again and again to a few of her patients (which represents a statistically insignificant population) to extract subjective observations which go from becoming theories, to broad sweeping generalizations, to ""facts"" as you advance through the chapters. She uses repetitive, inaccurate, and irritatingly childish analogies that are poorly chosen- to illustrate unsound hypotheses. As I first started into this book I was very put off by what I felt were extremely sexist overtones- not against women, but against men. Again and again she uses descriptions of testosterone ""destroying"" part of the male brain and the ""default female"" fetus growing unabated, etc etc etc. She seems to do this several times, but I finally began to understand *why* she was glorifying the emotional adaptability, facial processing, and conflict resolution skills of women. It was because it *was* sexist, not just against men, but against women as well. Louanne Brizendine successfully made me end up feeling as though I had no real purpose beyond being a passive, estrogen filled receptacle, fated to mate, care for young, keep the cave clean, calm aggressive males, and give up the pursuits that actually interest me in favor of the biological inevitability of being a mommy. Perhaps I will breed and perhaps I will not, but a part of me wants to refuse to make babies solely to thwart this obnoxious assumption. The author barely touches at all on women who can not or do not have children, and only mentions them to note that their brains are not as efficient. Wow. She also maintains that women are not worse at math or science, they just prefer to be in more social environments- and though I'm taking it out of context a little, that nearly made me holler with incredulity and rage. Stereotype much Mrs. B? She also devotes a whole PAGE AND A HALF to sexual orientation (are you kidding me???), but for some reason felt the need to devote an ENTIRE chapter to the benefits of hormone replacement therapy after menopause, and goes on for so long about them I began to wonder if the drug companies that produce these medicines were paying her salary while she wrote this book. There are good, interesting, legitimate, useful facts in this book- and I did find some wonderfully informative tidbits. Things about why I have trouble relating my emotional states to the opposite sex, and what chemicals cause what behaviors. It helped me understand why I feel compelled to do certain things and why I so often have trouble understanding my partners seeming obliviousness to my emotional states. I had *fun* for the most part reading this book, and though I had to take almost everything with a grain of salt, I did feel as though I absorbed a great number of very helpful biological, neurological, neurochemical, and evolutionary facts that I would have been even happier to learn from a book that didn't make me feel like a sperm depository. "
8,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180436-katie,5,"Okay, this is serious. We ALL need to read this, and we need to get our significant others to read it, too. This author is a neuropsychiatrist and she analyzes how we (women) work (in easy to understand language) and why we do the things we do with regard to our moods, our biology and our evolutionary inclinations. It is infinitely interesting and lends an amazing insight into how we as women function on a daily basis. She also does a bit of the same for the male gender and it is really very eye-opening. I learned more about myself from this book than I did from an entire semester of Gynecology! And now I will stop jabbering and let you get to reading the book...really, I command you to read it. "
9,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666565-lori-carpenter,4,"Wow! Where to begin! Julie recommended this book to me. I'd suggest all women read it; especially those going through changes in life and these can be the obvious, like menopause, to your girls going through puberty. It will definitely keep me more patient and ""grounded"" as Ellie goes through puberty to remember not to take things personally and to remember what she is going through. I did find it interesting/comical that she listed each stage of life separately. Which is obvious, but I kept thinking about the peri-menopausal and menopausal women with a teenage daughter and thought she could have explored this dynamic more. It was fascinating to learn about the different areas of the brain that develop more fully in a female vs. male brain and how they are influenced by those damn hormones even before we are born. It's worth the read, explains past behaviors and gives you a head's up for the future. Just remember, we are all Stone Age beings at heart!"
10,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/211779-kate-higgins,5,"This book is amazing. I normally do not read books like this, but it is so worth it. Dr Brizendine describes the various stages of the female brain, from fetus through menopause and all the changes in between. I now find myself looking at Louisa and thinking how her brain is begging for reassurance that she's doing 'it' right. Then looking at myself, current owner of the 'mommy brain'. Amazing. I really appreciated how the author presented the material to explain actions of individuals while affirming that women are agents of their own actions, regardless of what's going on in the old brain. Beware: I found myself constantly turning to whoever was next to me at the time wanting to share interesting tidbits (did you know that women cry on average four times more than men do?!). I hear that may be annoying... "
11,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/669675-victoria,1,"You know an author is out to prove something when she states that she attended Harvard, Yale, and Berkeley within the first page of her book. Furthermore, you know she wants to be taken seriously when she keeps repeating this claim to fame every few pages and also reminds you of all the thousands of cases she has seen while working at her clinic. What you don't know, however, is why someone who claims to be so experienced relies solely on anonymous studies and personal anecdotes about herself, unidentified friends, and nameless patients (besides one biochemistry professor who was a pole dancer in college) as the basis for generalizations for the behavior of ALL women and men. Brizendine spends the majority of her book discussing such stories. When she tries to support her claims with scientific data, she is very specific; for instance, a Swiss experiment proved that oxytocin acts as a pleasure stimulant for the brain. Who conducted this experiment? When was it conducted? How many subjects were tested? Such information is conveniently left unmentioned throughout the book in order not to trouble readers' minds with cumbersome facts. Well, if that's the case, then an experiment conducted in NY proved that the brain is actually located in a person's neck and not the head. Brizendine did provide over 70 pages of notes and references, but readers are sure to be able to take the time to match anecdote with reference number when the references are alphabetized without any mention to the chapter they support. Many of the ""facts"" this books provides are also very questionable. Men think about sex once a minute while women think about it a maximum of three times per day? Do these chaste women turn on the television, ever? And I'm sure every teenage boy thinks about sex two hundred forty times during the four hours that he spends taking the SAT. (And yet, some boys STILL get perfect scores. They must be great prodigies indeed.) As another example, Brizendine states that women speak an average amount of 20000 words per day while men only speak 7000, a fact that Brizendine obtained from a self-help book written in 1997 called ``Talk Language: How to Use Conversation for Profit and Pleasure."" I‚Äôm sure years of meticulous research were made to prove THAT hypothesis.  Overall, on an academic scale of 1-10, I would give this book a 3. The basic premises of the book is that women and girls seek acceptance and are remarkably intuitive due to possessing low testosterone levels, while men are domineering, aloof, and incapable of reading other people‚Äôs body language when it does not indicate a direct threat to them. On an entertainment scale, however, I would give it an 8. I had such a great time watching Brizendine try to get me to take her seriously and every few pages evoked quite a few laughs. Some great quotes presented in this literary masterpiece:‚ÄúGirls who expect their boyfriends to chat with them the way their girlfriends do are in for a big surprise. Phone conversations can have painful lulls. The best she can often hope for is that he is an attentive listener. She may not realize he's just bored and wants to get back to his video game.""  ‚ÄúTestosterone has been shown to decrease talking as interest in socializing---except when it involves sports or sexual pursuit.""""Their [adolescent boys':] reluctance to talk to their parents comes out of magical thinking that grown-ups will read between their spoken lines and the look in their eyes and know that the subject of sex has taken them over, mind, body, and soul.‚Äù‚ÄúActivities such as caressing, kissing, hugging, gazing, and orgasm can replenish the chemical bond of love in the brain.""

12,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14572061-rosytown,2,"There are two things that you MUST know before reading this book.1 - The author received the 2006 Becky Award, which is given to 'people or organizations who have made outstanding contributions to linguistic misinformation'.2 - There are a myriad of doctors and experts (male and female) who dispute the science in this book. One such 'fact', regarding the usage of words per day has been removed in current printings due to it's inaccuracy.On the positive side of things, I found small pockets of the book mildly interesting. It flows well, employing a chronological format and it is well written (despite some typos).However, I can completely understand why many woman are outraged by such a book. It doesn't do much justice for the plight of women in this day and age. I'd like to believe that the strong, smart and capable women in my life are more than just constructs of their current hormonal flux. They would all be horrified to hear me speaking of them in such a way.As a man, I found the book irritating. The author paints a completely over simplified and often inaccurate version of modern men. I truly hope that readers are smart enough to disregard these obvious misrepresentations. On the back of the book - 'a man can't spot an emotion unless somebody cries or threatens bodily harm'. Enough said."

It will teach you how the female brain works, and why does it work the way it does.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and learned a lot by reading it. It contains enough science that you feel convinced yet not bored, and enough stories that entertain you along the way.To be honest, I didn't like it at first when she started talking about females as super human beings, and how we men are just simply limited (Hey, I have to be a little defensive!). However, as the book went along, it started having a more moderate and reasonable tone.I do recommend this book for women first and foremost, so that they know what they're and what they will be going through, and how to make use of it all. I recommend it to men if they really care about understanding their partners. Believe me, this scientific material is much more valuable to understanding how the other gender functions than a book like ""Men are from Mars and women are from Venus"".

But seriously, intelligence is relevant and this book is not about that. Instead, it's about the different ways in which both brains operate. In no way is this book fluff, which is what someone coming across the title, and in light of its mainstream success, might think. What this book is, is an attempt to understand the circuitry of the female brain; which, hasn't been thouroughly investigated until thirty years prior to now. Scientist simply couldn't, and didn't have the equipment, to understand the female brain in relation to the male brain. The book deals more in research and neorology than anything else--the references in the back take up a big portion of the book. It's clear in what was said in the introduction, that Louann Brizendine probably got a healthy advance for this book and that a lot of people were involved to make it happen. What we're left with is a book that's groundbreaking, informative, interesting, important, helpful, humorous, tells a story, and is just fun. I usually read a lot, and so saying I couldn't put this book down would be an understatement, but, I didn't try to read another book while reading this one. I usually read two books if their subject matter allows me to not keep with it the whole time. It's also amazing that the book has been edited down to only 189 pages. In the short time it took me to read it, I observed females and the way they interact in comparison to males. Sure enough, I could identify with a lot of things that were being discussed in the text. As Christiane Northrup, M.D., author of ""The Wisdom of Menopause"" suggests, ""Sassy, witty, reassuring, and great fun. All women--and the men who love them--should read this book."" "

20,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/367249-caitlin,1,"This book needs no parody. Brain science in the service of silliness and stereotype truths about women... ""With this accessible, fun guide, women will discover that they have a lean, mean communicating machine at their disposal -- and men will find that they finally have a key to understanding their relations with women"" etc etc. Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus plus amygdala drawings and synapses. Which wouldn't be a problem except so many damned people bought it!"
21,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/900442-megan,4,"I mostly really liked this book. It is a somewhat scientific book that describes the effect of hormones on the female brain from birth through death, specifically examining puberty, child-bearing and rearing, menopause, etc.I was left feeling like the worst parts of myself are all controlled by my hormones. And that the best parts of myself, are also a product of my hormones. It made me wonder what my personality would be left with once I didn't have any hormones? It was really educational and insightful. I particularly read the part on puberty and perio-menopause with great interest, since that's where the females in our household are right now. She describes men as mountains hormonally--veritably unchanging, and women as the storms that rage around those mountains, constantly changing. Every single day, women have a different hormonal/chemical mix in their brain than they did the day before. It's never the same.I'm finding myself recommending this book to everyone--female and male.A few things I didn't like about it:1) Brizendine's early implications that females are superior to males because we have hormones which make us more responsive to other humans, better listeners, more nurturing annoyed me. I felt like she included that and the little by-line on the back of the book (""Men, get ready to have brain envy"") to passify the feminists. The examples she gave of little toddler and preschooler boys and girls to prove her points of superiority were completely annoying to me. I could find just as many examples from my preschoolers of cases where the boys displayed better behavior and the girls were manipulative and exlclusive. Seemed very one-sided. 2) Brizendine tries writing in the Malcolm Gladwell style. No one can do it like Malcolm though, so the lack is obvious.3) Brizendine is a psychologist, not a researcher. This becomes more evident as she presents the research to prove her point. For instance she presents a piece of evidence about the monogomous DNA strand which may pre-determine whether you're more likely to stay with one mate, or try for many. But the original research doesn't really say that. She just takes a small portion of it to prove her point. Being married to a researcher makes me more aware of these ""research omissions."" "
22,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5844827-rajesh,2,"First off, I'm not in the target audience intended by the author, as I understand this book is written for women. However, my approach to this book was to understand any scientific advances in the field of biology that finds interesting difference between the sexes. In this regard, I think the book fails. Firstly, it constantly talks about proximate rather than distal causes as in ""estrogen triggers this circuit during this time that causes this"". This perhaps is interesting to a clinician, but to the average reader why such a behavior came about (as with evolutionary pressures) is perhaps more interesting. Secondly, I found that the references were scant and when studies were mentioned they seemed to be generalizations of rodent studies. Thirdly, I found a lot of passages to be a little preachy. There were also generalizations made from the the author's own experience with her patients. I would think that has little value insofar as anecdotal evidence versus statistical evidence is considered in science. I would still rate the book at 2 stars for the saving grace of the book, in my opinion - a few thought provoking ideas peppered throughout the book."
23,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,4,"This book was a delight to read. Having long decried supposed gender differences and endorsed a faith in the universality of reason, much of what Dr. Brizendine claims to be gender-characteristic of brains was definitely not what I wanted to read. However, her mix of challenging claims and anecdotal exemplifications of them worked very well towards making what could have been a very dull exercise into something fun and memorable.Although I mark myself as owning a copy of this book, I plan to give it away within the near future and look forward to reading her subsequent book on the male brain."
24,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16882379-raphael-lysander,2,"The good thing about this book is showing that sex differences are not inequality, but just the reality and nature. Nevertheless, the book isn't actually about the female brain but about the female hormones ! And since that wouldn't have been interesting and grist-to-the-mill, the author chose the previous one, without much care about truthfulness. The book makes hormones the propeller of women's lives, and though the author refers quickly and shyly that hormones don't make one person bad or good, she still completed this book as if they do! For example, she foucs on the 10% of teenage girls who have overreactions for teenage changes as if they were the rule. She also finds love a reaction for dopamine , depression a cause for lack of estrogen, and she gives hormones as a treatment for marriage problems ! Hormones, surly affect women however that doesn't mean hormones define women's lives.Those women who can overcome depression from work, for instance, could as well deal with their biological changes very efficiently, and maybe the author should have focused on that a little bit. If changes in mood due to temporary hormones changes could be understood, this book becomes irritating when talking about love. And the scientific method here becomes a joke. As she support her work by MIR scans of women in love, referring how that hormone went up and how that part of the brain sparkled. The obvious question here is how the author defines love so she recognised when she saw it on the MIR. What if those women who've done the scans broke up with theirs other ones immediately after the test ?! How the author was sure that what she saw was love not lust, or maybe over happiness because the woman succeeded in deceiving a rich man ?! All is possible in lack of clear definition of love. And she seems very found of the animals experiments and finds no problem applying them on humans as if they are only driven by their biological needs and have no brain. This leads in her book that people fall in love when they find the best helthy and shapely other one, and become monogamous or polygamous according to theirs genes tall !! As an example for the author's theory failure, and not so far, we read in this book about her friend Sylvia who came to her because of marriage problems, and she gave her a hormone treatment. this worked for a month but at the end of the chapter the author tells us that Sylvia got divorced anyway. So again, hormone might cause temporary problems and that should not prevent us from seeing the real, deep problems. Very many things to say indeed, but this book came completely disappointing to me, I expected to read about how women see the world, how they react with it, what they seek in love and relationships, and how they think in general. So, I want to refer here to something Pere Daco said in his amazing book The Female; ""Men try to change the world then they reflect that to their insides. Women starts from inside themselves to change the outside"". This short sentence explained to me many literature and art works by women and it's more important to me than entire Brizendine book wich was by the way pretty tiny compared to the female brain (without the blank pages, references, notes..etc. It was only 180 pages !)."
25,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11792174-asha,0,"Well. I did not finish this. I was looking for something based on science that could provide me with research studies and statistics, maybe some diagrams and charts. I wanted something that had actual content. What I got was a lot of opinion and stereotypes. I am very interested in learning about the differences in the female and male brain (like how the hippocampus is larger in the female brain and the amygdala is larger in the male brain) and how this affects us. But I also want the source material to be credible and, what's more, actually credited within the book. Brizendine would state things about the brain but there was no citation. She used examples of women and girls she knew. It all seemed a little too casual, almost made up. (Not that I want to be smacked in the face with a bunch of medical jargon.) There was only about one study mentioned in the one and a half chapters I read and, of course, the study wasn't cited (come on, footnotes aren't that hard). Her stereotypes of women are very...(I hate using this phrase) close-minded. There also didn't seem to be any sort of study that involved girls/women who weren't white. Then again, I didn't finish the book, so there might have been. But honestly, I doubt it.Time to look for a different book instead. One that actually has some semblance of fact to it. Also, she straight up name dropped all her universities of study and residency on the first page. Calm down, miss. We know you've got your doctorate. "
26,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5933766-melumebelle,2,"This book seems to be fairly polarizing. I was browsing through the reviews, and people either seemed to love it, or to hate it. I'm really not in either camp. I think I do agree that at times the author over-simplifies or makes generalizing statements. I also agree that she is at times patronizing. I think one thing I see a lot in reviews is people being offended by her stating something that doesn't portray women in the best light. I saw one review which cited the author as slut-shaming, based on a passage where she described the ""neanderthal"" brain of a man and how sleeping with a man quickly might in the long run make him less attracted to you.Is this 100% false? Probably not. Nature is not always flattering. I think the takeaway is that, at times, due to our conditioning, humans are wont to behave in a way which is not idealistic or flattering. It is then our job, as thinking, mindful beings, to realize this, to rationalize our thoughts, and to confront these things and not give in to them. It certainly wasn't the best book I've ever read, but I don't think it deserves the immense praise or outrage that I seem to see in all the reviews I've read."

After reading the first volume of Louann Brizendine as well, now I finally understand why many other readers have complained about her being too ""feminist"" or rude. Well, let's empathize with her, it's her first volume. :-)I strongly suggest you to do as I did: read first The Male Brain, the later and more clear, transparent and evolved book to get used to her great style. Then of course you should read The Female Brain, which is... well... a bit raw. She teaches extremely handful and remarkable thoughts about how women work, e.g. the flood of feelings and their reasons. Very good and useful book too!"
28,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/282676-heather,3,"This book was pretty interesting though too chatty in style for me - a common fault of 'mass market' science books. It talks about the hormone and other neurochemical differences between women and men, nothing in it was too earth shattering and I did still have a nagging voice in the back of my head complaining that this was essentialist/reductive/oversimplified...but the actual mechanics of neural processes being different were interesting, and the chapter discussing the ""mommy brain"" was both interesting and sort of upbeat. "
29,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107666-nicole,3,"I thought this book was an interesting exploration of the specific structures of the female brain. While I do think that it was a worthwhile read, I wish the author had delved a bit deeper than she did. That said, it is for a trade audience so it is understandable that some of the more technical elements might have been left out. Overall it's a good book to challenge the way we think about sex differences and the whole nature vs. nurture argument."
30,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6714902-amanda-root,5,So awesome. I learned so much. Very well done. 
31,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12162514-graeme-newell,4,"The author takes us through a lifetime of changes in a woman‚Äôs brain from prenatal to post-menopausal. Brizendine does a nice job of showing how brain chemistry motivates so many of the major life events throughout a woman‚Äôs life. I was surprised to learn about the profound differences in the brain chemistry of men and women. The author shows that what can be mistaken for behavioral or personality proclivities are often strongly motivated by brain chemistry.Biochemical brain differences are often the foundations for misunderstandings that plague both sexes. Anger, love, achieving, you name it, evolution has hardwired women‚Äôs brains with carefully honed survival strategies. Those behaviors manifest themselves in fascinating ways within the modern world where we live.Most interesting to me was the author's discussion of how testosterone influences babies in utero. Boys and girls are sent down divergent paths because of the profound influences of this chemical. There‚Äôs a reason little boys play so rough. There‚Äôs sound brain chemistry behind little girls‚Äô accelerated language skills. The author does a nice job explaining how these differences in brain chemistry manifest in behavioral differences between boys and girls. And those changes continue into adolescents when little girls once again have their brains scrambled by hormonal changes.I also enjoyed her explanation of the brain reactions of conflict. She showed how men and women have a predisposition to process anger differently. I picked up some good pointers here for the next time my wife gets annoyed with me. :)Brizendine also reveals the brain chemistry behind the fact that so many post-menopausal women divorce their husbands. I had no idea women‚Äôs preferences in career, family and love are so profoundly influenced by hormonal changes within the brain.I really enjoyed this book. The things I learned will help me to better understand and support the women in my life."

My mom knocked it out of the park with this book. I seriously have never read a book that has taught me so much about being female. I‚Äôm not kidding when I say that everybody of every gender and sex needs to read this book. I will shout from the rooftops of the importance of this book.As the title suggest, this book is all about the female brain. Starting from in the womb to menopause and everything in between, Louann Brizendine explains exactly what happens to females while going through the different stages of life. She even mentions what boys experience during those times and includes examples from her clients to supplement everything. That made this book a little bit easier to read and it broke up a lot of the science that was involved.This book has changed me. Had I had this book in highschool it would have changed a lot of things for me. I honestly thought what I went through when my body changed was something I alone was dealing with. Not the case at all. Let me tell you, friends, the relief that flowed through me when I read that part was life changing.This book has changed my life. I know I‚Äôm repeating myself but I can‚Äôt help it. I feel so‚Ä¶explained and understanding of myself. I feel like my entire being has been explained. I feel so much better knowing that the changes that happen to me are okay. And I am better prepared for the future changes that will happen.

Highly recommend this book for both females and males to understand themselves and the women in their lives esp. if it‚Äôs a wife/daughter.

35,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24059057-filothea,5,A must ready by every single woman and heterosexual male. Will definitely re-read.

The depth of research the author has undertaken is astounding. I have learned many things about women and the female brain that I, as a male would surely not have understood and simply brushed off as ""women are complicated"". Now my new found perspective is broader and though I still see women as being complicated, they are beautifully so. Women can be understood, of course to some extent...there is always some mystery that remains."
37,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12116829-miranda,4,"Books of this type often lose its ground. In an attempt to fill itself out, it goes off topic and outlives its point. However, Louann Brizendine's The Female Brain is dense with information. I compulsively highlighted every page. It was all fascinating.I have tried to insert Brizendine's finds in everyday conversation, but I was surprised to find friends weren't as enthralled as I was. What at first seemed like common sense (girl talk, PMS, motherhood) turned into something I re-discovered through brain scans and hormones. Brizendine spends lots of time on relationships (monogamy, choosing mates, common arguments), which makes the book seem like something else, but what is in fact a major function in a woman's body.As a woman in my early 20s, I thought I'd lose interest midway since I would no longer be reading about myself. However, I was just as fascinated. I related to my mother and grandmother in ways I didn't expect. I saw myself in my 30s, 40s, and 50s like I never had before.This is a great read for both men and women.For men: it'll inform your relationship and help you discover that women are not crazy (well, maybe they are sometimes).And for women: it'll inform your past, present, and future, helping you understand your body and make decisions throughout your life.This book will give food-for-thought for years to come. I'm glad I picked it up.UPDATE:After reading some of the negative reviews, I wanted to cover my thoughts on some points that others pointed out:* This book is intended for a general female audience; much of the science is light and not firmly explained. I saw it as her way of moving briskly along, throwing things out there for us to nibble on or look up ourselves if we're so speculative. I thought of other popular science writers such as Malcolm Gladwell, who is easily arguable in his quest to prove his thesis.* She does talk about the general (stereotypical) female and doesn't embark on variations (homosexuality is in the appendix) or solutions. She sometimes blurs the line between cultural and biological. And knowing her conventional background shows that she tends to back up more traditional cultural behavior, which I'm sure would rub many people the wrong way. I didn't always believe what she said, but it didn't impact my experience negatively.* I think her aim with this book was somewhat loose: ""It is my hope that this book will benefit many more women an girls than I can personally reach in the clinic."" And she draws her information from her years working in that clinic -- a precursor to her use of anecdotal evidence. In a way, she's stating that she is only hoping to reach the people who are open to hear what she thinks, who would seek her out as a neuropsychiatrist. She wasn't a Bestseller at the time of writing the book, so the breadth of her outreach is not a fault.So as always, go in with an open mind and you'll have fun."
38,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3663921-linnea-arneson,1,"Reading this made me totally take back my critique of the feminist book. Maybe it's because it totally goes against my principles, but I found this book really sexist (and I had already read a book called Delusions of Gender that refuted many of its claims). It made some huge sweeping generalizations about women. Although it's based on ""science"", brains are so complex that mri's, which can only be used in very small studies, can't be used to claim that women's brains are different enough to warrant a separate book. And it's not just the book but the sentiment behind it that's dangerous. Pseudoscience on gender differences in brains has been used to subjugate women for generations. And it advocates a false equality: ""Men may be better at math and stuff, but women are better at reading emotions, so it evens out."" That's BS. Used to console women about their inferiority. Who would rather be more sensitive than smarter? Plus it's insulting to men: the author uses anecdotal evidence (which counts for nothing in science, but sadly sticks with people longer, so is handy for authors) about this guy who was just totally clueless about this woman's emotions. I mean, that is the stereotype, and people say that stereotypes are based in truth, but no one writes books about how the evidence shows that Asian people are actually worse at driving. It felt like she just took the stereotypes she encountered, and then worked backwards to try to explain it with chemical reasons.I know that this book might help some women. Like, if I were dating a guy, and he seemed emotionally unresponsive, I would feel better, because I would say, ""oh, that's not my fault."" But me, I read it and I thought, ""wow, I thought my ability to avoid conflict was something to be proud of. Nope, it's just girliness.""The bottom line is that, while there are irrefutable differences between the average man and average women, there's much more variation within the groups than between them. The book doesn't even discuss transgender people, which is weird for, you know, a book about gender. Probably because they don't fit into her nice little archetypes for men and women. Homosexuality barely made it in there, in Appendix C at the very end, and wasn't dealt with very well, let's just say that."
39,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3533371-emily,3,"The book does take a very general view on the topic, and there were a lot of things she mentioned in the book that I already knew, and there wasn't much that changed my outlook already of what I've already gathered and heard about the female brain. However, that is because I realized this book is more about offering biological, and strictly, chemical/hormone explanation for women's behavior. It is not as psychological as I expected it to be. Its more of a verification of general ideas we already know, kind of like, match each hormone up with each behavior kind of thing. Even though I was a bit unenthusiastic about realizing that this is not a deep book, its still nice to know some that its informatory. Which is exactly what this book is, informatory. It doesn't really go deep at all, and that can be fine for some people. The whole 200-something page book is like a little general guide. It is not groundbreaking and it isn't breathtaking after you read it, but its helps you back your information up on what you know about women. I'd also like to say that even though it is unfortunately very easy to feel that the author is stereotyping women, something I was a little ansy about every few chapters, keep in mind, she is JUST explaining the pure general, cover aspect of women. LITERALLY. You can tell this was never a book that was supposed to go in depth. And even though she bases many actions on the ""stone age"" brain, you have to realize if she's talking pure biology and chemicals, we're inevitably talking about the GENERAL structure of male and female brains that have evolved over centuries. As in, women tend to care less about sex, men tend to care less about talking, women like art, dresses, dolls and communication, men like cars, fighting, math and science. Its literally the basics. But its not bad. "
40,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2226141-rachel,4,"I found this book to be fascinating! Brizendine looks at biological bases for male and female cognitive & emotional differences and how hormones influence the way woman's brain functions throughout her life cycle. Some of her assessments felt subjectively true to me. Others were shocking and I had to read passages aloud to Andrew to see if he thought they accurately reflected a general male experience. This was especially true during the section comparing the female and male teenage brains. Some of the sections on the ""childbearing age"" woman's brain were frankly a little frightening. The section on postmenopausal women was really interesting to me and seemed very true to life in ways that caught me completely by surprise. This book was written in a very conversational & accessible style. It was fun to read left me wanting to know more. Much of what she said ""felt right,"" but the cynic / scientist in me wants more proof / information on the research and data so that I feel more sure that there is really a biological basis for the behavior patterns she describes and that culture / nurture / & the authors stereotypes are not really the prime movers in the scenario she lays our in her book.Read it and let me know what you think! I'm so curious!"
41,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2980505-becca,5,"I think that this book is a MUST READ for everyone. For me, understanding some of the neurological differences between men and women, and some of the basic norms of women has really started to shift my thinking about people and their actions (including myself). realizing that some of the things that I though just some men do, are really things that all men are prone to do, and some of my own thoughts and actions dont' make me such a freak. I grew up very much a tom-boy, and having more male friends through college than female friends, I always compared myself to men, and felt like an alien next to them. Go figure! And later, trying to have the kinds of conversations with men I've tried to date that I have with my now girlfriends and failing miserably and not understanding why, well, this book helped put that misguided notion into perspective. Oh, slight warning, I'm a little paranoid about perimenopause now...It's not the best written book - it gets a little repetitive, and I wish she had gone into a little more depth in some area (the cycles in our lives are not all addressed equally), but it got 5 stars from me for it's overall educational value. On to The Male Brain next!"
42,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285612-aerin,4,"I found this a fast and interesting book about the basic changes in brain chemistry a woman faces in her life. This isn't a hard science book, but she does provide many references and notes in the back if you want to read more thoroughly on the subject. Research into how hormones and chemicals in the brain affect us throughout our lives is only just beginning. This book brings a first look at some of the important work out there and the need for more to be done. As a woman and a biologist, I disagree with others that this book reinforces chauvinistic ideas or that women are somehow inferior to men. I think it is a realistic view of the differences between the sexes and the biological challenges we face. Women and men are both equally capable, but we are not biologically the same. When society starts to accept and embrace the different strengths women and men bring in their own unique ways, we will be much happier and stronger for it. I am a feminist, but I am not a man and I should not be expected to behave like one to be successful. Greater understanding of all people is what we should be striving for, not conformity.Anyway, great book and I'm looking forward to reading ""The Male Brain."" I'd recommend this book to everyone, woman and man alike."

I just can‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt. Additional minuses: All examples in the book are really stereotypical ones. I really missed parts and explanations about education, brain training via activities and continuous improvement - how these things impact on how your brain acts? Who takes care of our hormones and how we can work on it WITHOUT medical hormonal therapy‚Äôs? Non of it is answered or even touched in this book.And for the end of my review, few positive things: i) great topic to talk about and, ii) nice way of telling story - using human‚Äôs lifecycle."

The author reads sooooo slooooowly, and even my male brain was rubbed wrong by the subtle tone variations she employed throughout (even at x2 speed). She reads like shes explaining to 4 year old that hitting is not okay. The 'stories from the couch' were boring and in some cases just flat out concerning. I haven't done extensive research, but there seems to be some bad science in this book (male vs female #words per day, mirror neurons, etc). The way she extrapolated from certain research and made such generalized statements made me uncomfortable.That said; there is still some fascinating science here, and some insights that I felt were helpful, some of which i ran by that the women in my life, who said they found it helpful and validating. IDK if its ultimately worth reading the book though- you could likely get better info (better presented too) elsewhere. "
45,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/843529-kathy,1,"What did I ""learn"" from this book? Women are controlled at all different stages of their life by their hormones. Women are better at communicating, feeling, empathizing, evaluating and checking anger and aggression, etc. Women want better mates and better chances of survival for their offspring. Women are more affected by violent / action movies. Women get crabby and snappy during PMS. I learned all of this through annoying scenes such as (not exact quotes), ""Erica turned flirtatiously on her high heels towards the door. 'Wait! I don't have your phone number. How will I find you again?' said Evan. 'Google me, and you'll find me,' Erica purred as she hopped into a cab."" Some amusing tidbits and warnings aside (e.g., don't let a man hug you for more than 20 seconds unless you trust him, since you will trust a man after he's given you a 20-second hug, whether he's trustworthy or not), this book is worth skipping."

Gender is such a controversial scientific field that I mostly want to read hard science on the subject as gender studies are notoriously known for a lot of extremely bad and biased science. But Brizendine still archives to make her point without seeming to anecdotal. And the science is sound and good. I still wish that this book were a few hundred pages longer. As the female mind is such an important and complicated subject."

However, I couldn't seem to make it past the first chapter. Her ill-placed frivolity spoke more to a condescension of the reader than an effort to engage. The whole tone of the book was insulting and off-putting. I would definitely not recommend this book to an educated woman who wants to engage in intellectual and moderate discussions of feminism in 21st century America. "

I would not pick it up if I thought that is what it contained but the author is a women with an MD and other degrees from reapectable universities. Full disclaimer I do not feel uncomfortable with gender binary but extent of her analysis was little girls play with dolls while little boys play with trucks. One hardly needs an MD to see that, and she offers nothing original or intelligent about this observation which is what I was most dissapointed about. "
49,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962381-katie,1,"I felt this book relied too much on stereotypes between the genders rather than explaining from a more medical point of view. Also, I had the feeling that the author was talking down to the readers throughout the book. I am looking forward to discussing it with Rosalie and hearing her point of view."
50,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1944898-sarah,1,"This book is offensively bad. It's written pretty well, but the references are a joke - within the first few pages, studies are already being cited as supporting data that they don't actually support, or in some cases don't actually have anything to do with what Brizendine is talking about."

56,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Somewhere between biological determinism and imposed conformity will be a reality Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Attention to understandable and comprehensible explanations, which are based on coherent life experiences, makes the work interesting for non-specialists as well as readers already more deeply involved in the matter. The hormonal and brain-physiological backgrounds described by Brizendine for typical patterns of behavior are evidence of the fact that gender differences are not always politically correct. They are based on research findings and experiences of the author based on her practice. Which in no case legitimacy for the relapse into a dark age of sexism or children to be pushed into rigid role models. On the contrary, the facts of the case, which are free from ideology and explanations based on simple hypotheses or antiquated ideas, are presented in combination with two of the most profound illustrations. Examples from different stages of life together with the hormones, which in the background are each a gray eminence, guarantee a lifelike as well as the scientific picture of the gender dilemma. Hardly a reader should not find himself in one or more of the situations. Apart from genuine self-reflection, the possibility of introspection and a better understanding of the fundamentally different motives of the opposite sex is offered. These are said to have led to significant discrepancies in one or the other proven case. To defuse or, at best, to prevent such predictable conflict potentials, which are unavoidable by the different perspectives, offers nothing better than the study of the psyche of the ene.... partner. Like dandruff, one sees in reading the ever-increasing escalation and conflict patterns that are based on no evil intention but entirely contrary points of view.In this way, senseless and ridiculous patterns of behavior become comprehensible to one's gender, and one understands why so much effort and energy is put into subjectively time-wasting activities.In dealing with parents, partners, and children, nothing can be more helpful than gaining a deeper understanding of their needs and ways of thinking and thus laying the seeds for serenity and mindfulness in social interaction.The access to matter is described exclusively from the author's hormonal and neurobiological point of view. For a more comprehensive awareness-raising additional sociological and anthropological reading would, therefore, be recommended to avoid a one-sidedness of analytical approaches and opinion formation.Unfortunately, selective perception, along with the tendency to block out all disdainful cognitive dissonance, brings marked problems with it. Blindness and misinterpretation are commonplace in contemporaries throbbing with biological determinism and the accompanying lack of meaning in gender-neutral education, as well as among emancipating advocates.Indeed, neoconservatives, marketing and advertising professionals of toy manufacturers and eternal sexists are fond of the idea that genes and hormones predestine everything. They use this momentary majority standpoint for their interests.However, it is counterproductive for the women's movement and gendering concerns to compulsively seek consensus and uniformity in areas where they just can not exist. Because biology causes different gender preferences. Neither party can claim the right to either impose on the children a tight corset of stereotypical gender clich√©s. Alternatively, to subject them to the compulsion not to behave according to their gender, but always to remain as neutral as possible.Where the motives of the feminists are nobler of improving nature for the society, desirable and more worth promoting than the arguments of the other party and thus can not enjoy a strong lobby in the background. On the other hand, an unscrupulous industrial machine benefits from both a population conditioned to consumption and ever new trends, and the potential doubling of turnover, depending on the sex of the child. Since a clear demarcation line between feminine and masculine is promoted and exalted in both genders for clothing and toys, sports articles, hobbies, and consorts, there is plenty of scope for a potential increase in demand. It makes sense to anchor relevant images in the minds of people throughout their lives, from the babysitting room to the retirement home. To be able to influence purchasing behavior efficiently in every phase of life. The middle ground between the extreme poles would, as so often, be the optimum, but thanks to dogmas and lobby interests it is a utopia whose implementation could only be accompanied by a change in the current social and, above all, economic system.Irgendwo zwischen biologischem Determinismus und aufgesetzter Konformit√§t wird die Realit√§t liegenDas Augenmerk auf verst√§ndliche und nachvollziehbare Erkl√§rungen, die sich an nachvollziehbaren Lebenserfahrungen orientieren, macht das Werk sowohl f√ºr Laien als auch bereits tiefer in die Materie involvierte Leser interessant. Die von Brinzendine geschilderten hormonellen und hirnphysiologischen Hintergr√ºnde f√ºr typische Verhaltensmuster sind Belege f√ºr die politisch nicht immer ganz korrekt vermittelbare Tatsache, dass Geschlechtsunterschiede schlichtweg bestehen. Sie fu√üen auf Forschungsergebnissen und Erfahrungen der Autorin aus ihrer Praxis fu√üendeWomit auf keinem Fall eine Legitimation f√ºr den R√ºckfall in dunkle Zeitalter des Sexismus gegeben werden oder Kinder in rigide Rollenbilder gedr√§ngt werden sollen. Vielmehr wird, frei von Ideologie und auf reinen Hypothesen oder antiquierten Vorstellungen fu√üenden Erkl√§rungsmustern, anhand der Kombination zwei der profundesten Veranschaulichungen der Sachverhalt dargestellt. Beispiele aus verschiedenen Lebensabschnitten samt den jeweils im Hintergrund als graue Eminenz werkenden Hormonen gew√§hrleisten ein sowohl lebensnahes als auch wissenschaftliches Bild des Geschlechterdilemmas. Kaum ein Leser d√ºrfte sich nicht in einer oder eher mehreren der Situationen wiederfinden. Abseits von reiner Selbstbetrachtung offeriert sich die M√∂glichkeit zur Introspektion und des besseren Verst√§ndnisses der grundverschiedenen Motive des anderen Geschlechts. Diese sollen schon in dem einen oder anderen belegten Fall zu betr√§chtlichen Diskrepanzen gef√ºhrt haben. Zur Entsch√§rfung oder im besten Fall Pr√§vention solch vorhersehbarer und durch die unterschiedlichen Betrachtungsweisen unvermeidlichen und immer gleichen Konfliktpotentiale bietet sich nichts besser an als die Studie der Psyche des Fein‚Ä¶, Partners. Wie Schuppen fallen einem beim Lesen die immer gleichen Aufschaukelungs- Eskalations- und Streitmuster auf, die auf keiner b√∂sen Absicht, sondern g√§nzlich kontr√§ren Gesichtspunkten fu√üen. So werden f√ºr das eigene Geschlecht sinnlos und l√§cherlich erscheinende Verhaltensmuster nachvollziehbar und man versteht, warum so viel M√ºhe und Energie in subjektiv zeitverschwenderische Aktivit√§ten gesteckt wird. Im Umgang mit Eltern, Partnern und Kindern kann wohl nichts hilfreicher sein, als ein tieferes Verst√§ndnis ihrer Bed√ºrfnisse und Denkweisen zu erlangen und damit den Keim f√ºr Gelassenheit und Achtsamkeit in der sozialen Interaktion zu legen.Der Zugang zur Materie wird ausschlie√ülich vom hormonellen und neurobiologischen Standpunkt der Autorin her geschildert. Zu einer umfassenderen Bewusstseinsbildung w√§re daher zus√§tzliche soziologische und anthropologische Lekt√ºre zu empfehlen, um keine Einseitigkeit der Erkl√§rungsans√§tze und Meinungsbildung aufkommen zu lassen. Leider bringt die selektive Wahrnehmung samt der Tendenz, s√§mtliche missliebigen kognitiven Dissonanzen auszublenden, vorgezeichnete Probleme mit sich. Sowohl bei den auf den biologischen Determinismus und damit einhergehender Sinnbefreitheit geschlechtsneutraler Erziehung pochenden Zeitgenossen als auch bei den Emanzipationsbef√ºrwortern sind blinde Flecken und Fehlinterpretationen h√§ufig. Sicher weiden sich Neokonservative, Marketing- und Werbefachleute von Spielzeugherstellern und ewige Sexisten an der Vorstellung, alles w√§re durch Gene und Hormone vorherbestimmt. Sie nutzen diesen momentanen Mehrheitsstandpunkt f√ºr ihre Interessen aus. Genau so ist es aber f√ºr die Frauenbewegung und Gendering-Anliegen kontraproduktiv, zwanghaft nach √úbereinstimmungen und Gleichf√∂rmigkeit in Bereichen zu suchen, in denen sie schlichtweg nicht vorhanden sein k√∂nnen. Weil die Biologie unterschiedliche Pr√§ferenzen der Geschlechter bewirkt. Keine der beiden Parteien kann das Recht f√ºr sich vereinnahmen, den Kindern entweder ein enges Korsett stereotyper Geschlechterklischees √ºber zu st√ºlpen. Oder sie dem Zwang auszusetzen, sich nicht ihrem Geschlecht entsprechend verhalten zu d√ºrften, sondern immer m√∂glichst neutral zu bleiben.Wobei die Motive der Feministinnen hehrer, die Gesellschaft verbessernder Natur und w√ºnschens- und f√∂rderungswerter sind als die Argumente der Gegenpartei und sich somit keiner starken Lobby im Hintergrund erfreuen k√∂nnen. Auf der anderen Seite profitiert eine skrupellose Wirtschaftsmaschinerie sowohl von auf Konsum und immer neue Trends konditionierter Bev√∂lkerung und der potentiellen Verdopplung des Umsatzes, je nach Geschlecht des Kindes. Da sowohl bei Kleidung als auch Spielzeug, Sportartikeln, Hobbies und Konsorten eine deutliche Demarkationslinie zwischen feminin und maskulin gef√∂rdert und verherrlicht wird, ist f√ºr einen potentiellen Mehrbedarf T√ºr und Tor ge√∂ffnet. Es bietet sich an, entsprechende Bilder das ganze Leben lang von der Krabbelstube bis zur Seniorenresidenz in den K√∂pfen der Menschen zu verankern. Um das Kaufverhalten effektiv in jeder Lebensphase beeinflussen zu k√∂nnen.Der Mittelweg zwischen den extremen Polen w√§re wie so oft das Optimum, ist jedoch dank Dogmen und Lobbyinteressen eine Utopie, deren Umsetzung nur mit einer √Ñnderung des momentanen Gesellschafts- und vor allem Wirtschaftssystems einhergehen k√∂nnte."
57,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6687675-nicole,3,"I was really interested to read this when Lisa Bilyeu mentioned it in the Relationship Theory podcast, could this book explain why females react and think so differently from males? That was the question that piqued my interest. I read the ebook during my trip and to be honest, this is probably one of the first books that made me sleepy. It was very dry and has alot of medical and scientific jargon. I do say that the author tries to make everything concise and simple for the layman or woman to understand. Great that the author interspersed examples of her patients, friends and family to help the reader relate more to what she was explaining such as why do women feel like nurturers and avoid conflict or why do women react very emotionally at certain times of the month. I did agree with some areas (women overthinking to protect their relationships, teenage girls acting out, the mommy brain, females being able to empathize more through emotions, females being able to feel the pain of others) but I disagree with others. Some of the content in this book would definitely have feminists up in arms and protesting.Some of the parts I agreed with or found interesting are:""There are important reasons to explore, for example, the effects of medications on each sex. Not only are women 50 percent more likely to experience adverse drug reactions than men, but many medicines also have different impacts on men and women. In 2013, for example, researchers found that zolpidem (Ambien), one of the best selling prescription sleep aids, had a stronger effect on women-leading the FDA, for the first time, to reduce the standard dose for women to half that recommended for men. On the other hand, women need twice as much morphine to achieve the same degree of pain relief as men.""Foreword to the Tenth Anniversary Edition, Pg 6 of 9""I loved that this baby girl wanted to look at me, and I wished my sun had been so interested in my face. He was just the opposite. He wanted to look at everything else- mobiles, lights, and doorknobs- but not me. Making eye contact was at the bottom of his lists of interesting things to do. I was taught in medical school that all babies are born with the need for mutual gazing because it is the key to developing the mother-infant bond, and for months I thought something was terribly wrong with my son. But it turns out theories of the earliest stages of child developement were female-biased. Girls do not experience a testosterone surge in the utero that shrinks the centers for communication and processing of emotions.""Chapter 1, Pg 9-10 of 46""Baby girls are born interested in emotional expression. They take meaning about themselves from a look, touch, every reaction from the people they coe into contact with. From those cues, they discover whether they are worthy, lovable or annoying.""Chapter 1, Pg 10 of 46""Many people, like Melissa, think the loss of a romantic high of early love is a sign that a couple's relationship is going south. In reality however, the pair may be just moving into an, important, longer-term phase of the relationship, driven by additional neurological circuits.""Chapter 3, Pg 31 of 46""In both males and females, oxytocin causes relaxation, fearlessness, bonding, and contentment with each other. And to maintain it's effects long-term, the brain's attachment system needs repeated, almost daily activation through oxytocin stimulated by closeness and touch. Males need to be touched two to three times more frequently than females to maintain the same level of oxytocin, according to a study by Swedish researcher Kerstin Uvnasmoberg.""Chapter 3, Pg 36 of 46This sounds great but does not take into account love languages.""One night, Rob didn't call Melissa after he said he would. It was unlike him, and she started to freak out and worry. Was he hurt?Was he with another woman? Melissa could feel her fear physically. Strangely enough. the state of romantic love can be reignited by the threat or fear of losing one's partner-of being dumped. Being dumped actually heightens the phenomenon of passionate love in the brain circuits of both men and women. The brain region desperately, hungrily seeks the loved one.""Chapter 3, Pg 42 of 46""A woman needs to be pit in the mood. Before sex, there has to be a soothing and smoothing of the relationship, and she has to be able to stop being annoyed with him. Anger at one's partner is one of the most common reasons for sexual problems. Many sex therapists say that, for women, foreplay is everything that happens twenty-four hours preceding penile insertion. For men, it's everything that happens three minutes before. Since many parts of a woman's brain are active at once, she must get into the mood by first relaxing and reconnecting positively with her partner. And women, tell your men that if they plan on critisizing you or starting a fight on the day they are hoping to get lucky, they should think again. They will have to wait for the twenty-four hour clock to reset before you'll be ready.""Chapter 4, Pg 14 of 38""The muscular contractions and uterine suction associated with a women's orgasm have been long known to pull the sperm through the cervical mucus barrier.""Chapter 4, Pg 16 of 38""Many mammals have this capacity to bond with, nurture, and care for the offspring of others. An intriging study of hunting hunting among women of the Agta Negrito of Luzon (The Philippines) underscores the function of networks of female kin. Women's huntinghas largely been regarded as biologically impractical because hunting is assumed to be incompatible with the obligations of infant care. Specifically, hunting forays were thought to impair women's ability to nurse, care for, and carry children. However, studies of cultures in which females do hunt suggest exceptions that prove the rule. Agta women participate actively in hunting precisely because others are available to assume childcare responsibilities. When women were observed to hunt, they either brought nursing children with them or gave the children to their mothers or older female siblings for care.""Chapter 5, Pg 43 of 49""Men don't seem to have the same innate ability to read faces and tone of voice for emotional nuance. This difference was in abundant display during the first few weeks after Jane and Evan met. She told me he was going way too fast for her, but he was unaware of her discomfort. A female friend of Evan's took one look at Jane, spotted her uneasiness, and warned Evan to back off. He didn't listen, and the result was nearly disastrous.""Chapter 6, Pg 11 of 40""Sometimes, other people's feelings can overwhelm a woman. My patient, Roxy, for example, gasped every time she saw a loved one hurt him or herself-even when they did something as minor as stub a toe-as if she was feeling their pain. Her mirror neurons were overreacting, but she was demostrating an extreme form of what the female brain does naturally from childhood and even more in adulthood-experience the pain of another person. At the Institute of Neurology at University College, London, researchers placed women in MRI machine while they delivered brief electric shocks, some weak and some strong to their hands. Next, the hands of the women's romantic partners were hooked up for the same treatment. The women were signalled as to whether the electric shock to their beloved' hands were weak or strong. The female subjects couldn't see their lovers faces or bodies, but even so, the same pain areas of their brains that had activated when they themselves were shocked lit up when they learnt their partners were being strongly shocked. The women were feeling their partners' pain. Like walking in another's brain, not just his shoes. Researchers have been unable to elicit similar brain responses from men.Chapter 6, Pg 13-14 of 40""To get a male's brain's emotional attention, a woman needs to do the equivalent of yelling, 'periscope up! Emotion coming. All hands on deck!'.""Chapter 6, Pg 16 of 40""Bursting into tears often grabs the male brain's attention, but the tears nearly always come as a complete surprise-and extreme discomfort-to a man. A woman, because of her expert ability to read faces, will recognize the pursed lips, the squeezing around the eyes, and the quivering corners of the mouth as preludes to crying. A man will not have seen this buildup, so his response is usually 'Why are you crying? Please don't make such a big deal out of nothing. Being upset is a waste of time.' Researchers conclude that this typical scenario means the male brain must go through a longer process to interpret emotional meaning.""Chapter 6, Pg 17 of 40Well I don't think this applied to all men...Overall, the book is informative but not for everyone. While some of the contents would resonate with people, I think that the behaviors mentioned do not guarantee all women will feel or react like this. Another thing that surprised me was that the actual content of the book only takes up half of it, the rest are appendix and references."
58,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1752924-zach,1,"I wish other reviewers would address the numerous scientific errors and misrepresentations in the book. As a review in the science journal Nature points out:""Yet, despite the author's extensive academic credentials, The Female Brain disappointingly fails to meet even the most basic standards of scientific accuracy and balance. The book is riddled with scientific errors and is misleading about the processes of brain development, the neuroendocrine system, and the nature of sex differences in general.""One example: the author uses erroneous data to claim on average, women use more words in a day than men do. This aligns so neatly with gender stereotypes - taciturn men, chatty women! Unfortunately it is not true, as studies looking at this show no significant difference or that men speak slightly more on average than women. There are many other examples of giants leaps to conclusions or distortions of science, just search for responses to this book from the neuroscience community. The author has relevant experience as a clinician, but this book does a great disservice by misrepresenting scientific literature to explain biological differences between gender when there is no biological basis for the claims. Of course, there is an eager market and news outlets excited to promote this book, given its sensational claims that reinforce gender stereotypes under the banner of science. And unfortunately, that hype overwhelms the less exciting fact-checking and contextualization from the scientific community. If you want an excellent science-based rebuttal to this book (even if you love this book and are just curious what the other side would say) - please read Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender. It's a great read in addition to being grounded in science."
59,0767920090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30265783-akshat-solanki,4,"FemininityThe Female Brain, as the name suggests is the book about women's brains, their behavior, behavioral changes, the neuron circuits formed in their brains, and how they determine things.The author has talked about hormone changes in women according to their age, according to their mother, grandma and how they react to them under some circumstances. It's divided into a few chapters like how a baby girl thinks, how a somewhat older girl thinks, how a teenager thinks, how an adult woman thinks, how a woman thinks after delivering a child or two, how do they think when they're old, how do they react to sex, aggression, and men's behavior.The women can easily understand what a man is going to do after 5-6 days if they see a little change or a slight clue that men don't understand even themselves.So, the readers get to read and understand a lot of things about women and how they see men around them.It's a must-read book.Do read this book.Akshat Solanki"
