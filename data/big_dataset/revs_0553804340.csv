0,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110812-kinga,4,"I fear of dying from hunger. It’s a very unreasonable fear because what are my chances of dying from hunger? Yet, this is what I must fear because each time my dinner arrives I eyeball it cautiously wondering whether it is enough. All sorts of food sharing events are a particular torture because I'm a slow eater, so the food is usually gone when I'm barely starting to eat. So I stuff my face, I barely chew; because I worry that everybody will walk away full and satisfied and I will be left hungry. There is no plausible explanation for this. Yes, I did grow up in communism, but it was Poland, not North Korea, I never had to go to bed without dinner. I didn't have to fight a litter of brothers and sisters at the table; in fact, I only have a younger sister whose favourite food was cauliflower. Oh, I do truly live in the here and now. I think every meal I eat is at the same time my first and my last one. I pay for it with those extra pounds I so desperately try to run off, jogging at 6am by the canals. I don't turn heads quite the way I used and it saddens me. But it doesn't sadden me anywhere near as much as the thought that I have to eat everything today because there will be no food tomorrow.Brian Wansink in ‘Mindless Eating’ talks about people like me but also people like you, the normal kind. The kind who thinks they are in control of what and how much they eat it. But you lot, you’re no better than me. If someone gives you free five day old stale popcorn with a movie ticket you will eat that. You will eat that and the box size will be the only criteria of how much food you need. Give you a small plate – that’s your portion. Give you a bigger one – that’s your portion too. Give you your food in a bucket, well, that’s how much you’ll eat. We need to clean our plate. Let's not throw away food! It's a sin. And what about those starving children in Africa? Let's eat more because they can't.Wansink maintains we make about 200 food-related decisions a day. He is a scientist with good methodology, so let’s believe him. This is a lot of decisions. Who has the time to make 200 right decisions a day? And he proves beyond doubt that even the people who think they know, or even know they know, still don’t know or fully control how much they eat. You think you’re so smart, but some Sade from the speakers in a restaurant will make you order a dessert.Gosh, are you hungry? You weren't even hungry before but I started talking about food and now you want to eat. You want a brownie and spaghetti, and sushi, pumpkin soup and a burger. I will show you my food and then I will close the door and let the thought of that food slowly burn in your brain. When you finally break and come begging me for that food you will eat almost twice as much as you would have if I weren't such a tease and just gave it to when I first showed you. If it says low fat it means you can eat all you want. If it says something vaguely healthy on the packaging, again you can eat as much as you want of it and also believe it will cure cancer. That’s your brain on food.There are so many fantastic facts and experiments in this book, some you can even try at home. Read it so you can learn what a fool you are. Me, I'm fine. As long as I can somehow convince myself there will still be food tomorrow."

2,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266234-7jane,4,"This author is familiar to me through being quoted in other food-eating books I've read, including the stale popcorn study, and the plate size study, at least. This book is about raising awareness of how much, what, and why we're eating certain ways (there's both healthy and harmful types - and we can never completely get rid of the mindlessness), sometimes without realising it, or being able to admit it (to say: ""I wasn't influenced - others might've""). This book is meant to help us make better food choices when buying and eating, and buying and making for others, plus the outside eating (work-related and the eating out).There's plenty of illustrations, and at the end some popular diets studied, on eliminating diet danger zones and some frequently asked questions answered (that came up after a couple of first printings of this book). The studies are listed (and author creates and uses his own). Each chapter of the main part ends with 1-3 reengineering strategies that may help us eat better.Stuff that comes up: the mindless margin (eating 100 more or less calories than needed can change one's weight over time); the oftentimes lack of awareness of amount eaten; tablescape - the equipment and the food (sizes and amounts matter); big packages - bigger eats; where the food is placed matters - the distance to it, the visibility, etc.; how to handle wholesale food buying; our eating scripts (""when it's time for tv, I grab this snack""); influence of friends, family, and the one who controls food at home through making and buying; the ""manly man"" overeating; restaurant look-strategies; the influence of what the food's title is; comfort foods (where gender preferences show, plus reasons why-this-food); saving the best for first or last?; the trap within 'low-fat' etc.-titled light foods.I learned a lot, and did mark up some eating strategies for later use. This is a easily flowing book with a great message while it entertains. It makes you ponder deeply on food, while giving you more motivation to eat better, and make helpful strategies for making others' eating experience better, healthier. Very interesting a read."
3,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"My friend Richard recommended this to me with this review.http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/....It seems there are an endless supply of books coming out at the moment about how our judgement can be lead astray and what we can do about it. This one is particularly good. Simple advice on how to lose weight by explaining why we might put it on in the first place.When I was a child my mother told me not to cheat at patience (Solitaire) because you are only cheating yourself. I had always thought this a good maxim. Now I think that the only person you should cheat is yourself. If you want to learn how to cheat yourself out of being basketball shaped - this book is for you.The thing I liked most about this book was the amount of time he spent convincing the reader that the reader was not quite as logical as the reader might just imagine. We are all too ready to believe that everyone else is stupid and we have somehow avoided the common affliction. This book should do much to dispell this dangerous assumption.I'm going to try to put some of the advice in this book into practice. But before I do, I really will need to find out more about the caloric content of foods. Throughout this bookhe asked people to guess how many calories certain foods contained and, honestly, I would be guessing wildly. The advice, though, that we don't eat calories, but volume is very interesting."
4,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"See an important related article in the New York Times: ""In Obesity Epidemic, What’s One Cookie?"" (10 March 2010) by Tara Parker-Pope.Wansink's book combines diet instructions with lessons on the cognitive flaws in the human psyche that make dieting necessary for so many of us.He runs a ""food psychology lab"" at Cornell University, where he and his colleagues study how we make out eating decisions and how they can be manipulated. That gives this book a twist, since it is as much a book on human cognition as Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational or Leonard Mlodinow's The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives.Wansink has a good style for this kind of book, too. Breezy and humorous enough to keep you reading, but with enough depth and substance to provide credible guidance. It doesn't take too much time to finish the book; a moderately quick reader will probably take most of a weekend. The chapters and sections within them also make it easy to read this in sporadic chunks.­"
5,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96664-samantha,3,"I bought this book at a conference after reading just the title. Fully aware that I myself am a mindless eater (most of us are, so don't think you're immune!), I was curious to see what the book had to say about our eating habits.This book was very interesting and laugh-out-loud funny in parts, too. (Believe me, I got a few odd looks as I was reading this during the conference's keynote address.) The experiements that the author has conducted in his lab and elsewhere to reveal the hidden cues that cause us to eat more than we need to are intriguing.The bottom line: Americans eat using visual cues - how big is the package or plate? how much are the people around us eating? what does the label say? Believe it or not, if the label makes some sort of health claim (""helps lower your risk of heart disease,"" ""low fat,"" etc.), we eat more of it because we are lured into a false sense of security.The motives behind our eating habits were very eye-opening. While not realizing that I fall into those traps while they're happening, I find myself going, ""I do that!"" while I'm reading about them after the fact.The one downfall to the book, in my opinion, is the easy-as-pie way Wansink makes changing those habits sound. At the end of each chapter he offers what he calls ""Reengineering Strategies"" for turning ""mindless"" eating into ""mindful"" eating. They are good suggestions, but putting them into practice in a world where we are constantly bombarded with a ""more is better"" attitude is more difficult than it sounds. However, at the end of the day, we are all accountable for what we choose to put into our bodies, McAdvertising be damned.Interesting (and very quick!) read."
6,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2863328-elissa-washuta,2,"I found Wansink's accounts of his research to be totally fascinating. He writes about his experiments carried out at Cornell University's Food and Brand Lab that gave his team insight into how packaging, surroundings, and other cues influence how and how much people eat. While I loved reading about the experiments, I found it unfortunate that this book seemed to pose as a diet book. Wansink gives recommendations for changing eating behaviors based on his research, which I find unnecessary--the findings speak for themselves. Additionally, he is not a nutritionist. The text has a calorie obsession, endlessly tallying. Certainly, I am biased, being against the idea of basing dietary wellness on calorie tabulation to begin with, but Wansink's tireless focus on slashing calories made me question his entire approach to eating. Really, is the amount of food we're eating always the problem? Is eating less always the answer?"
7,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/736024-nic,4,"I breezed through this book in just a few hours. Much of its advice is common sense, but the fact it is backed up by actual research studies gives it more weight. The studies conducted are fascinating - especially those conducted on behalf of the Army on how to get stressed out troops in combat environments to eat MORE - and Wansink's voice is fun. Nothing is belabored and he advocates making a few changes to ones habits and looking for longterm results since the body responds to ""diets"" by storing more fat. Very practical and a pretty fun read. I particularly liked ""what's your personality"" based on soup preference. For me, it was dead on."
8,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6685020-tiffany,5,"I read this book for work. It was one of my goals this year. I am an oncology dietitan by day since my husband seems to think that we need actual food to eat and books just won’t cut it (pah!).  I was amazing! I absolutely loved it. I have presented his information 3 different times to other dietitians and doctors. It is so interesting that I even got my doctors to engage in dialogue with me about it. It is easy enough that anyone can read it and understand it, but it is interesting enough to keep anyone engaged. It provides practical tips to change our eating in small ways that we won’t feel like we are depriving ourselves. I have already requested that three of my patients read it for themselves and my boss can’t wait until I finish it to read it for herself. We will be ordering half a dozen copies to keep in our office for people to borrow. In short, this book looks at why people eat and why they eat so much. It is just theories, it is backed up by studies that the author himself (and his team) have run countless times to get insight into our eating in almost every situation. This book will change how I eat and how I practice as a dietitian. READ IT!"
9,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"Brian Wansink is a food psychologist, an American professor, and a former Executive Director of the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. His book Mindless Eating summarizes some of his research, much of which is focused on how external cues like packaging, portion sizes, and presentation can influence how much we eat.Published back in 2006, some of the information feels dated. For example, his work showed that eating a designated portion from a smaller plate would lead to more satisfaction than if eating the same portion from a larger plate. Probably groundbreaking once upon a time, but not so much now.That said, most of the book details ways in which our environment can lead to mindless overeating. From smaller plates, to smaller portion sizes, to out-of-sight-out-of-mind, he suggests that we can use what he's learned about mindless overconsumption to actually promote mindless (ie painless) calorie control. Most of us don't eat because we are hungry, and more importantly we don't stop eating when we are full. We look to other cues to determine how much and for how long we continue to eat. The book certainly raises awareness, though I find Wansink's assertion that cutting 100-200 calories through ""mindless calorie control"" might actually solve our weight problems to be somewhat naïve. Bottom line, as a means of increasing awareness, it's a great read. We live in a day and age where the strategies we've adopted to survive, no longer serve us. Our cravings for salty, sweet, and fat, which originally kept us from starvation, are now causing us to overeat, often to the point of illness and disease. And perhaps more importantly, and less obvious, is the context in which we eat significantly impacts calorie consumption."
10,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/468995-tina,2,"I picked up this book because one of its studies was cited in another book I read, and I was interested in reading about things that influence our eating habits--but I was disappointed. I wish it would have focused more on presenting the research and less on giving weight loss advice. The research itself was interesting and I'd enjoy reading more about the findings, but the advice was mostly not new. I'd heard it all before from many sources. The research could have made those points or suggestions in a much more compelling way."
11,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,3,"Bullet Review:This was okay. I wouldn't say I learned anything particularly ground-breaking, but what I think the book does best is try to make small changes instead of overhauling your entire meal plan and eating only raw vegetables or switching to a paleo diet. I did find the various studies interesting, but again, I've read a couple of psychology books, so I get that we think we're way smarter than we are. (But we aren't.) Hell, I can just tell you from my own personal experiences that I have no clue how many calories I eat, give myself way too big of portions if asked to eyeball, and am a member of the ""clean your plate"" club. Just to name a few.By far the best line of the book is the one it ends on: ""The best diet is the one you don't know you're on"". It's not a bad take-away at all.The narrator was meh. Okay, but nothing to write home about.I also wonder if this book would be better read in dead tree version just because of the tables and charts that appear.But in case this sounds like a big fat no to this book, I just want to clarify: It was ""OK"". Neither bad nor amazing."
12,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18844431-david-h,1,"A absolutely fascinating book to read that was just marred retroactively for me by reading about all of Wansink's papers that have been retracted due to a variety of scientific errors, to the point that Wansink was removed from research and teaching by Cornell University last fall, and he just resigned a week ago. Sooo that's something. Skimming the list of 17 (!) papers that have been retracted, not every paper's results was included in the book, but several were. (Here's a Vox.com article about the situation.)I now wish I hadn't read this book, because I don't know what I can still trust from it—anything?! Well, at least I enjoyed it when I was reading it? And at least I'm thinking about what I'm eating these days . . . But what a waste."
13,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27422233-j,4,I think this supposedly weight-loss book gives more useful and interesting marketing strategies or tactics than other counterparts. :-) I am going to adopt the labeling method for my project right now!
14,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13556622-leonidas,5,"So here's the subjective rundown. We eat mindlessly most of the time. Why? Because we are on autopilot.  But also because it is cultural in the west. People in the east (Japan, for example), eat to 'not feel hungry'. Westerners (Canada, U.S., for example), eat until we 'feel full'. As a result, getting fat, or eating too much is much easier for us than we care to think.  A big plate will trick you into eating more. More variety, such as different coloured M&M's will make you eat more (think buffet, you just 'need' to try everything). Even a bowl that fills itself, without you knowing, will make you eat more.  But to really show how dumb we are, do this. Take 2 bottles of the exact same wine, same age, same everything. But switch out the labels. One from California, and one from Detroit. Suddenly, the California wine 'tastes' better, in all tests with real people. As well, the drinkers believe their food tastes better, and they even stay longer to enjoy their meal. Rinse repeat with name brands from shoes, ketchup, and everything else on the market.  Now for fast-food, such as a bowl of chips, place it next to you, and you will pig out. Place it just a meter away, and you will eat a less. Place it 2 meters away, and suddenly it's too much effort to eat. We don't want to consume energy to get energy. This goes as deep as Risk vs reward, when a field mouse needs to run across a field to get a berry, while the watchful hawk preys on the mouse.  Oh, and manliness vs. being a woman. Men believe it's manly to eat a lot, especially on a first date, while women believe they should eat only a little, to be perceived as feminine. Not to mention, eating meats is more manly as well (despite the huge negative health issues with eating beef).  Then we have scientifically manufactured colours, tastes, and smells, which culminates into McDonalds and any other fast-food on the market. Each food is engineered to have the scientifically 'optimal' amount of the trifecta: salts, fats, and sugars. The trifecta feeds back into our primitive monkey selves, when food was scarce and dangerous to consume. Salts help us store water, fats help us store energy, and sugars told us that a food was safe for consumption... as opposed to a sour poisonous berry.  Food inheritance was interesting as well. Why do you hate that food? Why do you love it? Can you trace it back? Dig deep. Dig into your childhood when you first fell in love with that taste, or the process of getting to that food. Does it remind you of your parents, your friends, relatives, that special occasion? We associate our emotions to certain foods, plain and simple.  Finally, Subway sandwiches has been lying to you. Sure it might seem healthy, but is it really? How many calories are you actually consuming? Not too many less than a McDonalds big mac. Add all that sauce, meat, veggies, bread, a drink, chips, and a cookie, and you are eating maybe 1000 calories? Om nom nom, no thank you weight-loss Jared.  Common sense? Not when you eat with your stomach, and not with your head. Also, those low-fat variety foods are only fractionally low fat. But you also end up eating more of the low fat variety... you just tricked yourself.  Nonetheless, be MINDFUL of what you eat, but before you are, read this book. And if you are a fat shit, hit the gym ;) True story."
15,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85848-mike-kowalczyk,4,"What an interesting book! In short, it examined our (humans') tendencies with respect to eating: what makes us eat, what makes us enjoy food, what causes our eating habits. Through psychological studies, the author demonstrates that almost all of our decisions about food and eating are psychological and even if we believe we control them, we don't. He presents many cases and analyzes many different scenarios, all of which are very interesting.Aside from this, the overall premise of the book is to present a common-sense approach to dieting, which he calls the Mindless Diet. Unlike fad diets, which are either difficult or futile, in each chapter he presents several tips based on his psychological research that ought to help people slowly but steadily lose weight with only a small change of lifestyle. I recommend this book to anyone who knows he or she will want to lose a little weight before the summer (even though it is still winter)."
16,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,3,"Interesting market research about the various things that affect how much we eat, such as the size of a dinner plate and how quickly items are cleared away from a restaurant table. It's not a diet book, but at the end of each chapter Wansink does give tips on ways to easily cut out the 100-200 calories of mindless eating each day that make us gain weight over time. I would recommend the book to those who liked ""Fast Food Nation"" and other pop sociology, such as Malcolm Gladwell or the Freakonomics books. "
17,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22641312-mohammad-ali-abedi,4,"An important aspect of this book is to be more self-aware of all the hidden aspects of our daily nutrition. Some of it is tricks from food companies that we need to be careful about, so that we don’t fall into their traps, but a lot of them is just that our evolutionary mind, regarding calories in and out, isn’t really built for contemporary living.Here is quick lessons from the book.Be aware of the small daily calories, that can add up. 100 calories a day can add up to 10 pounds a year (4.5 kgs). The energy drink on my desk while I’m writing this has 96 calorie. Usually, I get zero sugar versions (wasn’t available) knowing that those little calories can add up. There was a time where I would mock people with their Zero Coca Cola while eating two burgers and a side of fries. Now that I think, so what? 1500 calorie is still less than 1600 calorie.Understand that your eyes sees the food, not your stomach. I always try to finish whatever there is on my plate. Maybe a part of it is due to upbringing and parents telling us to wipe the plate clean. So, solution today is to have less food on my plate. I have been doing this for a while now. If I have rice, I use smaller plates, and less servings. If I want to, I can refill plate, but usually, it’s easier to resist a second serving than leave rice on my plate.Related to above, always use smaller plates, bowls, glasses, etc. Why use a tall glass to fill my soda, when I can use a smaller one? Even prepackaged items. If I have to have chips, I should use a smaller bag, rather than a better value larger one, even though I might initially assume I’d just eat half of it. Gratefully, we don’t (yet) have a super-size culture in Iranian fast foods yet, so I don’t have to battle temptation of larger servings of fries and soda.Hide unhealthy food, and keep healthy food in view. It would be great if I have to pass through the veggies and yogurts and nuts to reach my bar of Snickers.Understand that we have certain Eating Scripts. We eat more in larger gatherings, men feel that it is manly to have big appetites, the effects of restaurants on how long we stay eating, and so on. To battle against these scripts, we need to practice more self-awareness and understand they exist. Personally, I know I get a certain satisfaction of having a big appetite in gatherings. Given that I am not fat, I always have a certain perverse satisfaction when I eat more than my friends in gatherings. There is a competition aspect of it for me. I need to be more aware of the effect of such scripts in my diet.Names can affect how we feel about food. By being aware of this, I should restructure my own healthy home-cooked foods to sound better for myself and guests. Companies & restaurants practice this a lot, and instead of them controlling the narrative on my diet, I should do it myself.Comfort food are generally unhealthy, but that’s not due to their specific characteristics, it’s because they have positive associations from our childhood. So, find out my comfort foods, and replace them with healthier alternatives, by creating positive associations. What if I serve them repeatedly in friendly gatherings, so I can associate positive feelings with them? I realize now that I enjoy fast food at night. To me, it is like a ritual after a hard day. Wait until the kid is asleep, finish all my responsibilities for the day, put on a movie, and enjoy some takeout. Recently, with the coronavirus outbreak, it is almost ten days when I haven’t had any takeouts, and writing this has made me realize that a large part of my love for them is due to the positive associations I have built for them over the years. These comfort food has been a “reward” that I give myself for the end of the day. Could I not instead slowly create a new reward?The main takeaway (heh) lesson from this book comes from the title “Mindless Eating”. As long as I can change my habit to “Mindful Eating”, than I would have already solved a big part of my diet."
18,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8926937-michelle,3,"I'm at 42% and find this book to be rather interesting, although no shocking. The one thing that did surprise me is the possibility of scent-infused (or impregnated) bowls etc. to encourage people to eat more. Wow. So many cues out there that encourage over-eating or eating things that are not healthy. And even though most of the stuff is not so shocking and makes sense, it's still a good reminder to think about before and while you are eating, and when you are shopping.Still getting through this book... today I read that you burn about one calorie for every ice-cold ounce you drink. So if you drink eight 8-oz (64 oz) glasses of water with ice, you will burn an extra 70 cals! Too bad I don't have better access to ice while at work since that is where I drink a lot of water! Although I do start my day with an ice water and end it with ice water...Finally finished this book. It was interesting and I think I got some takeaways from it. Mostly to be more mindful about my eating habits and if some of them are not healthy, I can do some things to change them and make healthier habits. Most of it is common sense and it's not super shocking how marketing and restaurants manipulate us. I've always found that serving sizes are way too large. I could be perfectly happy with HALF of a serving most of the time and most of the time, they don't allow you to order a half order... and leftovers are never as good... so yeah, I tend to overeat those meals so I can enjoy them while they are fresh... but I'm getting better at stopping before I feel full and just taking it go and if it's a loss (I don't eat it later) at least my waistline isn't suffering. "
19,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2263972-tamara,4,"First off, this is not a diet book.Okay, now that we have that clarified, let’s talk about what it is!Each of us makes approximately 200 food-related decisions daily, on everything from whether to have a sandwich or salad for lunch, whether or not to eat a candy (or 10) from the dish on the desk, and what to say to the carton of double fudge oreo chocolate ice cream that has been screaming at us from inside the freezer all afternoon. The problem is, we make 90% of those decisions without even being aware we’re making them.Sound unbelievable? Most of us think we’re pretty aware of what we eat, but research says otherwise. The studies in the book are both fascinating and hilarious—everything from rigging restaurant soup bowls so they never empty, to feeding movie-goers popcorn that is five days old (but free), to slapping a “North Dakota Vineyard” label on a bottle of wine and seeing how much worse the diners rate the entire dinner because of it.The food industry pays millions of dollars to figure out how to get us to buy and eat more. The scary thing is that these mindless choices easily add up to gaining 10-20 pounds A YEAR without us having any idea where the weight came from. The good thing is that we can turn this mindless eating on its head—to actually lose 10-20 pounds in a year without noticing we’ve made a change.The author maintains (as we’ve often heard), that diets don’t work because when we cut back 800 calories a day, both our bodies and our minds feel deprived. However, there is a “mindless margin” of 100-200 calories that we can cut out without noticing or feeling deprived. This doesn’t sound like much, but it adds up to 10-20 pounds LOST in a year, without us even noticing we’re eating less. The book takes the millions of dollars worth of research the food industry has paid for and gives many suggestions of how we can trick our minds and stomachs into mindlessly eating less, while avoiding the tricks restaurants, grocery stores, and food packages use to try to get us to mindlessly eat more.Wansink has a Ph.D. from Stanford University, is director of the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab, and has been featured on National Public Radio and in the New York Times. The book is part psychology, part marketing, and part nutrition, and written in an easy-to-read format with lots of humor but zero guilt or pressure. It teaches not only how to avoid mindless eating (and weight gain) but how to use mindless eating for your benefit to eat healthier, lose weight, make your dinner guests think dinner is better than it is, and get your kids to enjoy eating “dinosaur trees.”Recommended for: Anyone interested in psychology, healthy eating, marketing, or getting dinner guests to love your dinners and kids to eat their broccoli. Especially for anyone who hates restrictive, pressure-filled diets but wants to eat better."
20,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20735143-yaaresse,2,"Aug 2016 book club pick. (library e-book) Brian Wansink is a food psychologist who runs a lab focused primarily on determining why people make the food choices they do and what influences those decisions. As it turns out, we often don't consciously make food decisions; we eat primarily in response to to learned behaviors, peer influences, and our immediate environments (lighting, plate/package size, wrappers, company, music, etc.). In other words, most of us--at least those of us fortunate enough to have access to plentiful food--eat not because we are physically in need of calories for fuel, but as an unconscious reaction to other things. I seriously doubt that is news to anyone, at least not anyone in North America. My two-star rating for the book is not because the information isn't useful or that the overall premise isn't interesting. It's a quick read, and there's some fascinating results to the studies the food lab has done. I'm giving it two stars because I just really didn't much care for the writing and because I didn't find anything new in the material. First, the writing. The book tries to straddle the line between being a book about research and a self-help/diet book, and it doesn't really do either very well. It tries too hard to be chummy and funny and chatty, to hit that pop psychology sweet spot that will get it mentioned on Oprah or Dr. Oz. I just wanted to read some science. Second, the ""knew that"" reaction: I worked many years in food service. I worked a few years around marketing types. I read too much (if such a thing is possible.) This book was published in 2006. In the world of research and behavioral science, ten year old data might as well be 100 year old data. Any juicy or particularly fascinating parts have been stripped out and splattered all over other media. You've probably seen most of the ""fascinating facts"" and ""helpful tips"" everywhere from Newsweek to Buzzfeed. As a result, I really didn't learn much that I haven't come across elsewhere. Even if the author's food lab (which he will remind you about a thousand times he is head of) did originate the information, it still feels third-hand at this point. The ""vintage"" drawings didn't help. If anything, they made it feel more dated. This book was the selection for our book club next month. I suspect I will find the discussion more stimulating than the book itself. ETA: After reading this book, I saw Michael Moss' Salt, Sugar, Fat at our library and decided to read it as a follow-up to this book. In my opinion, Salt, Sugar, Fat is a much more informative and interesting book on the subject. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1..."
21,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1988214-jennifer-perry,5,"I know it sounds trite, but truly this book changed my life. Or rather it helped me immensely at a point when I was already changing my life. I had weight loss surgery two years ago and read this book during my recovery from surgery. In the first year after my surgery, not only did the surgery itself help me loose weight, but becoming aware of all the things which caused me to eat when I wasn't necessarily hungry also helped me loose weight. Learning to NOT eat mindlessly is helping to keep the weight off. WLS is not brain surgery, and if you don't change your thinking about food, then you'll gain the weight back. Mindfulness in eating and learning new ways to deal with emotional and stress triggers are the key.I just reread this book to remind me again to eat mindfully and to recommit myself to my new healthy way of life."
22,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"A fascinating book about the psychology of food and eating. It is primarily written by an American for Americans and it highlights so many differences between the US food culture and our own in the UK. It is filled with records of sociological and psychological studies done in food labs and in resteraunts and with amusing anecdotes from the backgrounds of some of the studies too. Of all the other books I've read, the one it most reminded me of is Watching The English. It is not just about one nationality this time though.It is written with the express purpose of helping overweight people to watch what they eat painlessly. However, I think everyone can gain so much from it just in the understanding of themselves and their fellow man. I would recommend it to everyone. I will also be putting some of his suggestions into action too."
23,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4939087-tom,5,"Very straightforward, entertaining, and informative. I've read a lot of statistics that came from studies, and it's nice to see the studies fleshed out a bit more here. This book made me hungry! Actually, this book made me hungry while I was reading it, but as soon as I put it down to get a snack, the hunger vanished. I think that the main messages of controlling portion sizes (e.g. don't eat until you're full, instead eat until you're no longer hungry) and of creating a food environment at home that helps counteract ""mindless"" overeating would work well in conjunction with a lot of other diets or food plans. The appendices are also good to have as a nutritional reference and summary of the book."
24,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3481704-julia,5,"This was a really valuable book. I have already recommended it to many people I know. It is NOT a diet book. Instead, it talks about that ""mindless"" margin that we all have - about 100+/- calories that we can add/eliminate from our diets and mindlessly gain/lose weight.The author runs a food lab in Cornell, and it is all research based. Small things like: plate size, serving size, music, taking away bones/glasses, even saying that a wine is from California vs. North Dakota all influence how we eat.This is a great book, and I will continue to recommend it to all folks I know who are concerned about eating."
25,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,3,"The basic premise is that by setting yourself up for success in various areas where you eat mindlessly, you can shave off calorie consumption, improving your health long-term. I dunno. If I intentionally do things to trick myself, does that defeat the purpose? Some of the ideas were interesting, and heck, they can't hurt, but I'm not sure it is exactly revolutionary."
26,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47421419-ann-l,3,"This book talks about how certain environments, social engagements, personal habits and marketing ploys effect how much we eat. I thought the author researched this subject quite thoroughly, as that is how he makes his living, and he has a lab to do his experiments with on a day to day basis. He says we can lose up to 20 lbs just by shaving off 100-200 calories a day (by watching and being mindful of how much food we eat). His belief is that half our plate should be veggies, a quarter of our plate should be meat or protein, and the other quarter of our plate a starch (potato, rice, pasta). Then on the side of our plate a small cup of pudding or ice cream OR one cup of milk or yogurt, and then a small piece of fruit to top it off. This is based on the U.S. Food Pyramid, in which he had a say so on the making of the new pyramid.I rate this book a 3.5. It had some ideas I liked in it, like getting rid of your ""platters"" at home and eating off a smaller plate so you don't overeat, and things of that nature, but I'm concerned about the fact that it doesn't discuss some of the most horrible ingredients in packaged/processed foods which are detrimental to our health and that can also cause weight gain. I think the author doesn't want to piss off our food industries by saying anything negative. The author is very much part of the food industry in his belief it's ok to eat jelly beans (or anything for that matter), just not so many in one sitting. This isn't a ""diet"" book (I don't like that word anyways). This is a book discussing how we overeat on a consistent basis (at least in the United States), due to many factors and he goes into those factors so we can be aware of them. This isn't a book for people with allergies to foods, what ingredients are horrible in processed foods, or how to be more healthy. This is strictly an awareness book on how marketing, eating with friends and family, what personal habits you may have that contribute to your overeating ""Americanized"" food. Other countries don't seem to have that problem (unless they also become westernized with their diets)."
27,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/998266-kate-schwarz,4,"Easy reading health book--written by an informative and kinda funny guy, which made his delivery of information you might not want to hear go a little more smoothly. I eat pretty well already and our family's only fast food stop is Chic-Fil-A, and I can't remember when we went. We eat at home a lot. Still, there was a lot to tweak about my own diet to lose those stubborn pounds or to just eat more healthfully. Here are the lessons I learned from this book:- The French are taught to stop eating when they are no longer hungry. (That's it?! I had to listen to Wansink say that a few times, because the thought of simply putting my fork down when I wasn't hungry any more was profound and...kinda crazy. I should try it for a week...maybe?!)- Your body isn't going to miss 200 calories each day, so try and trick yourself out of 200 calories by making small decisions (no more than 3, he suggests).- When introducing food to children, add a descriptive word or two like smart restaurants do. Instead of saying, we've got lasagna for dinner, say we've got ""Garfield's favorite Lasagna"" for dinner or ""dinosaur trees"" instead of broccoli. My kids are a little too old for this, but...I think it still might work on my stubborn youngest child.- People notoriously underestimate what they've eaten. This is a fact. So, it's likely that, at any given time, I have eaten more than I really realize (especially when a glass of wine is involved or I'm at a special gathering with family or friends). "
28,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61140026-sarah-bodaly,5,"This was pretty interesting. I can't say that for me, having studied nutrition and such, there were a lot of new, enlightening facts, but it was really interesting to have ""all"" the information put together in one book. It delves into the psychological aspect of eating (how we've customized ourselves to eat until X, or when doing X, etc.), and then gives a good bit of helpful advice on how to rewire your brain, per se, to stop mindlessly eating. He mentioned the ""mindless margin,""of 100-200 calories per day, plus or minus, that for most people, are the difference between gaining or losing ten pounds in a year. This guy did a TON of case studies (college students love offers of free food), so all of his theories were backed up with a lot of evidence.I liked one point he had about plate size. I already eat off of ""salad"" plates, since they're smaller than dinner plates and your brain sees a full plate and is satisfied with that information (and ice cream goes in a custard cup because then it's a full bowl), but he said that he talked to an antique dealer who said that people would buy old dinner plates, thinking they were salad plates, and then ask if there were matching dinner plates. Our American abundance lifestyle has changed the size of our dinnerware. Also, American kitchen space versus European, which I will fully testify to, buying massive quantities at Costco... all of these trick our brain into thinking we need to eat more."

The author summarizes in the 10 chapters the main pain points when it comes to the gain in weight over the long period of time. The most important one is called ""the mindless margin"". This is basically the difference between 2000 calories a day and 2200 calories a day. We are not aware of those calories. It can be an extra bar of Snickers, or a few extra chips, or even upgrading a medium menu to large in a fast food restaurant.Therefore, the author's approach to lose weight in the long term is to reverse the process and instead of eating 200 extra calories a day, just eat 200 less a day by implementing small changes in our daily diet.Most of the ideas in the book are psychological changes, like placing the food further away from us, or creating smaller portions, or eating from a smaller plate and things of this nature. Personally, I think this book given some sound advice when it comes to taking care of your weight and it shows that most kilograms gained in the long run are mostly invisible in the immediate term, but can definitely be seen when we compare the photos we take now to the ones we took when we were younger.All in all, I recommend this to anyone who struggles with weight loss and to anyone who might want to discover more about compulsive eating or habits created due to environmental changes."

I am interested in psychology and this book discusses food psychology along with marketing strategies. It was thought provoking and I found myself reasonating with much of the information. While overall I liked the book, I did find it to be a slow read as I highlighted much of it. Many health books can be strongly against the food and restaurant industry. I did not find this book to be that way. It was a light read that offered support to all sides. I appreciate how the author was able to remain neutral. I like how the author explains how we eat more without being aware of it. He then followed up with ideas on how we can avoid these pitfalls. The tips the author provides are realistic and doable. His motto is: ""The best diet is the one you dont know you're on"". "

There are also many actions he suggests that we can take to make little changes that will help us manage our weight over time.This is not a quick fix, but a book of information and tips that you can implement over time to make positive changes to our eating habits.The audiobook was read by the author, Brian Wansink, which I like, and the production quality is very good."

You can’t just eat French fries all day long and expect to be healthy. You might lose weight if you’re taking in less calories than you need, but I promise your body still hates you. "

He does lots of crazy food studies, like demonstrating how people consume more soup if you give them a bowl that's secretly refilling itself from the bottom, or how if you put folks in a dark room and ask them to evaluate your new strawberry yogurt but give them chocolate yogurt instead they'll think it has a good strawberry flavor. The book's kinda all over the place: overlong, poorly written, chock full of irrelevant anecdotes and ""jokes"" and name dropping of the fancy places he's talked or worked [""Ooh! The Max Planck Institute!""], it can't decide whether it's telling you gee-whiz stories, giving you advice, or just explaining why you're going to fail. [It doesn't take a consistent view on whether knowing your own biases leads to any paths to reduce those biases.]I can't really recommend it because it wasn't well written and it wasn't helpful, although if you've never read anything else in this space maybe it would be OK?A few notes from the book:- Expectations matter; people don't believe it. Give people a glass of California wine, they expect it'll be good, they'll think it's good. Give them a glass of North Dakota wine, they expect it'll be bad, they'll think it's bad. Of course it's the same wine with different labels. And of course the people insist that the wine's origin didn't influence their judgement.- One of the book's central concept is ""the mindless margin."" The argument is that (1) it is easy to mindlessly reduce [or increase] your calories by 100 or so / day, and that (2) this will have large effects on your eventual weight because 3500 calories is a pound. (1) is undoubtedly true, but (2) is deeply suspect, because it's very possible your metabolism or changes in NEAT [non-exercise activity thermogenesis] will absorb small calorie surpluses or deficits. The book treats human psychology as complex, but human metabolism as trivial, which is basically just embarrassing and non-scientific.- Plate size makes a huge difference. Seriously consider getting and using smaller plates and serving spoons [the experiment used ice cream scoops]. You anchor off the size of your plate. Plate size has been increasing over time. [Edit: This is assuming you want to consume fewer calories. If you want to consume more calories, get bigger plates. I find consuming more calories trivial and consuming fewer difficult.]- Many of the suggestions in the book are weak because you operate in an unfriendly environment: the restaurant doesn't care how fat you are; if you're willing to not to eat in restaurants, you have a lot of tools at your disposal but that's drastic for most of us. Worse, one of the suggestions is to prime yourself to eat good foods: they did an experiment where they asked one group to do a detailed recollection of the last time they eat soup [a healthy food], and reported that this group ""anticipated they would eat more than twice as much soup in the next month as the non-primed group"". BUT THEY DID NOT MEASURE HOW MUCH SOUP THEY ACTUALLY ATE! - At one point the book puts ""pizza"" in a list of relatively healthy foods. Good to know.- I guess I don't want to read any book that tells me about a hot new idea called ""evolutionary psychology."" Way to show off your middlebrow.-Naming on menus is important. Which of these menus do you want to order from? ""Red beans with rice / seafood filet / grilled chicken / chicken parmesan / chocolate pudding / zucchini cookies"" or ""Traditional cajun red beans with rice / succulent italian seafood filet / tender grilled chicken / home-style chicken parmesan / satin chocolate pudding / grandma's zucchini cookies."" The food's the same. This totally works. I cannot want the first menu.I guess this book made me grumpy. I do want to be more mindful in my food consumption, but this book did not help much."

His book is a friendly, rather chatty account of his findings, which include:* Your stomach can't count. It doesn't know how many spoonfuls of soup (or whatever) you had, so it will encourage you to keep eating until the plate is clean, the bag or box is empty, or the TV show is over. That's evolution, baby.* It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach let your brain know that you are full. (OK, I knew that one already.)* Here's where it gets interesting: If you cut calorie intake drastically, your body will reduce your metabolism, and you will feel hungry most of the time. If you cut calorie intake by 100-300 calories per day, your body will not notice the difference . . . but you may be able to lose 30 pounds in a year. Even if you don't, you'll at least stop gaining. It is possible to do this calorie cutting through exercise, but through diet is easier for most people.Some ways to cut those 100-300 daily calories:- Eat slowly. People eat faster/more if others around them eat faster/more. Try to find the slowest eater at the table and pace yourself with him/her.- Put down your fork after every bite.- When you are eating, just eat. No reading, no TV watching, no computer using. It's OK to talk or listen to music if you are with others, but try to make it slow-tempo music or you'll all eat faster.- Be aware that you will eat more when dining with others, mostly because you will be at the table for a longer time. If you are dining with several others, you will likely eat a lot more.- Don't serve food family style (in serving dishes on the table) unless it's vegetables.- Use smaller plates and tall, skinny glasses. Your brain doesn't know the difference. - Eat fruit for dessert.- If you're going to have a high-calorie dessert, try to split it with others. The best part of dessert is the first two bites.- If you must eat in front of the TV, decide in advance how much you want and put that in a plate or bowl. No eating out of a multiple-serving bag or box.- If you bulk-buy snacks, repackage them into smaller containers or bags.- Nutritious foods go where you can see them: on the counter or on a front shelf in a clear container. Non-nutritious foods, if you must buy them, go on the backs of the shelves in opaque containers.Here are the tips that I thought were too extreme for me:• Eat in only one room of your house--the kitchen or dining room.• Don't set foot in the kitchen unless it's mealtime. If you have to, enter the house a different way so you don't snack immediately after work.• Before you eat something that is bad for you, say out loud, ""I'm not actually hungry, but I'm going to eat this anyway."""

And how can we use the ""mindless margin"" to lose–instead of gain–ten to twenty pounds in the coming year?Mindless Eating will change the way you look at food, and it will give you the facts you need to easily make smarter, healthier, more mindful and enjoyable choices at the dinner table, in the supermarket, in restaurants, at the office–even at a vending machine–wherever you decide to satisfy your appetite."
50,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10864046-kara,4,"The book is chock-full of observations, counter-intuitive at first but turn out to be more of common sense than originally thought. Instead of dictating what may constitute as the healthiest eating habits and willing the readers to follow the tall order, Brian Wansink attempts to explain the psychological aspects behind why we eat what we eat the way we eat. I am yet to go nuts about poring over the ingredient labels but I am intrigued by the idea of re-engineering my gourmet lifestyle and seeing how it pans out. Not that I'm going to cover all bases but I'll consider it a feat if I can just stick with some of these mindless/mindful tricks that I find most relevant to myself:1. Re-write the scripts and re-wire the comfort food - My top 2 activities that always seems more appealing when pairing with eating - watching TV shows and reading. Meanwhile, winter is coming.2. Take a good look at what I eat and make sure I see them ALL before and while eating - I'll appreciate the food more and be conscious of my intake at the same time. Pretty boys, my apology in advance if I can't give you my undivided attention.3. Evaluate if I can eventually realise all the savings on bulk purchase - Apart from a tendency to gorge things down faster than normal pace, I may end up throwing them away upon expiry. 4. Hara hachi bun me - Eat until I am eight parts (out of ten) full. I've always been such a big nagger if I eat too much.5. Don't be fooled by labels - I am a sucker for packaging and beautiful wordings. Ergo, my palates can already be biased before even tasting the dish. 6. Be transparent or opaque depending on the food situation - Out of sight is out of mind.7. Inconvenience is bliss - I don't need to make fire hoops as long as I can embrace the lazy self (though I still very much fancy at the idea of bracing myself against the wind while it is 4 degree outside for a good walk to Sobeys)8. Do not go for grocery shopping if I'm hungry - This will save me from all the impulse buying and food fantasizing."
51,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13316740-alex-timberman,4,"The author, Brian Wansink, is an expert in his field. He is a professor at Cornell University in the Marketing and Nutritional Science department, or something of that sort. His expertise is on the interdisciplinary relationship of marketing, nutritional science, and economics. If you read some books on behavioral economics like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman or Nudge by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, you will quickly get the psychology behind this book. The question he tries to answer is why we eat so much and what we can do about it. Obviously, this is a big problem in America with our super-sized portions and processed meals. Because he runs a food laboratory with a large research budget, his team has been able to conduct numerous experiments on why we can’t control our eating. The gist is that we all have a lot of biases and holes in our thinking that prevent us from knowing how much we are eating, when to stop eating, and on why we are eating. Because our behavior runs on autopilot, a good way to correct our bad eating habits is to set up a system so that we control our eating on autopilot. He suggests we can do that by cutting our calorie intake by a slight percentage, a percentage so small that our brains and bodies won’t be able to know the difference from our current eating habits, but a difference important enough in that over time it will lead to a significant change in our consumption. So I learned some things: follow the eating speed of the slowest eater at the dinner table to let my brain catch up with my consumption, use smaller dishes and plates because it will help me to consume less food, and etc. Even though I know all that, I just can’t resist eating what I feel like eating, when I see or think about it. As I swing into my thirties, hopefully, I can get more serious with my diet and apply some of the principles herein. "
52,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850999-beth-peninger,5,"Whoa. Each one of us is required to make 200 or more choices about food (and beverage) each day. At least that is what Wansink has discovered in his years of research. He says that number may seem high because we aren't aware of 90% of them! We are mindless when it comes to eating, to food choices, to knowing what we are actually digesting. Wansink spends the length of the book proving that and giving solutions to combat that mindless eating and become more mindful. This isn't a diet or restrictive solution. All it involves is thinking a bit more than normal when it comes to mealtimes. This book is far from dry, Wansink uses interesting research and conducts really fun and interesting studies. His facts and research are fascinating because they prove how powerful thought, or lack thereof, can be. He proposes that if we change three habits and nothing else we would lose up to 30 lbs a year (if we needed to lose weight)! And the science behind mindful and not mindless eating is so incredibly simple that I felt a little dumb listening and realizing how painless it would be to make some changes. Right away I decided to quit getting adult meals at the only fast food place I go to, I'm getting a kid meal and it's plenty. (Plus I get a fun toy!) Next time I'm at a restaurant I'll look over the kids menu and see if there is an adult kind of meal or I will be mindful. It's about being mindful. We can all say we know that but Wansink proves that we know it but we don't know it. This is a great book, such a great resource. For a preview of Wansink's suggestions and resources check out Mindless Eating's website. I highly recommend this book regardless of your size, weight, and ideas about food. "
53,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6227186-elaine,4,"Written in 2006 (and perhaps a bit dated), ""Mindless Eating"" is, first, a book about food psychology and, second, a diet book. The bottom line offers some helpful Heloise-ish tips for food control. But, the fascinating part is the first 2/3 of the book, in which Brian Wansink, a food researcher, tells stories from his life work. Of course, he maligns “foods to die for:” fat, sugar, and salt. He doesn’t blame food manufacturers and restaurants: they are in business to make money, not a conspiracy against the health of Americans. (McDonald’s doesn’t care if you throw ½ your fries away between the pick-up counter and your seat, an idea he recommends.) Most of his truisms are well-known or obvious: we eat more out of bigger bags (he calls it the “warehouse store curse”), we grossly underestimate the calories we eat, we eat more when prolonging a meal with friends (especially if they eat a lot), we will continue to eat mindlessly if we’re eating from a refilling soup bowl (he created such a device, and the subjects did continue to eat and didn’t notice the refilling part). I found the chapter in which he delineates his “soup personalities” to be most intriguing. Which soup do you prefer? Chicken noodle, chili beef, vegetable, New England clam chowder, or tomato? Here is your personality in order: a homebody, the life of the party, the trend-setter, a witty sophisticate, or a sociable affectionate reader. I’m not sure I’m a trend-setter, but of course, I’d choose vegetable. Sometimes humorous, sometimes illuminating, always fascinating, ""Mindless Eating"" was a delightful quick read for me."
54,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,4,"This researcher has a lot of experience in running experiments to see see what influences us in relation to food. Some were run in a specially designed restaurant area. In one, for example, everyone was given a free glass of wine. The bottles were almost identical. The only difference is that half the labels carried the name of a highly reputable wine growing area and the other half mention an an area not known for good wine. At no point was this pointed out to the diners. The wine was the same in each case, as were the meals served to all the diners. The survey afterwards asked diners to rate their experience of both the wine and the meal. The diners who had the supposedly cheap wine gave the wine lower ratings, but I was surprised that they also rated the food and the dining experience lower too. Lesson: people's expectations affect their experience of food.In another experiment, students were offered free food such as ribs whilst watching a football game. They could eat as much as they liked by helping themselves from a buffet. For half the students, the bowls of bones and detritus were removed regularly from the table. For the other half, the bowls were left in place. The second set ate significantly less overall. Lesson: we don't pay attention to how much we are eating and don't stop eating just because we have had enough to eat.We probably all know that we sometimes eat mindlessly, but the author helps explain why that is, and also what to do about it. It's easy to read, with lots of practical examples. I enjoyed listening to this book and will undoubtedly listen to it again from time to time."
55,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,4,"How do we determine how much we eat? Surely it depends on how hungry we are and how tasty the food is, but  Brian Wansink argues that it depends just as much on external cues, like how much is on our plate, the shape of our drinking glasses, how fast other people at the table are eating, and so forth.The best parts of this book are when he describes his experiments: the famous bottomless soup bowl, for example, or the chicken wing Super Bowl party experiment. (In the former he finds that if your bowl surreptitiously refills itself, you will eat far, far more than if it doesn't, because you are relying on the visual cue of how much soup is left in the bowl to tell you to stop eating, and in the latter he finds that if the bones aren't cleared away, they provide a reminder of how much you've eaten, and you'll eat fewer wings than if the bones are continuously removed from your sight.)The weaker parts are when he tries to extend his findings to produce dieting advice. If our mindless eating causes us to eat a few extra calories a day and cause us to gain a few pounds a year without noticing, then theoretically we could change our habits to give ourselves slightly smaller portions, so slight in difference that we don't even notice, and so we can lose a few pounds a year without even noticing the difference. Fair enough, but I could pick that up from reading the experiments, and I thought the diet advice was a bit heavy-handed and repetitive."
56,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,3,"This was a fun read: basically a tour of anecdotes and studies with unexpected insights into how people perceive food portions and what that means for healthy eating. If you like books like Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything then you will dig this; it feels similar to me though the topics and scope are very different. The overall premise here is that simple changes can help you eat healthier over time without really thinking about it. Wansink has come under fire a little in the news recently over research methods, but that doesn't seem particularly relevant to this book. The material is intuitively sensible. The thing that most resonated with me was simply to consider how much you want to eat before you start a meal, otherwise a host of social, marketing, and evolutionary factors will encourage you to eat more than you meant to. I can sum that up in one sentence, but the studies in the book make it stick in your head more than someone just saying it.The introduction was off-putting to me personally. The author spends a while establishing his bonafides, but I would rather make that decision myself based on the content instead of having someone convince me up front. It was fine after the introduction though. "
57,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32021539-holly-b,5,"I ran clinical trials for a couple of drugs being developed for obesity and used this book as a teaching tool. When you do randomized placebo controlled trials there has to be something in it for everyone. In the case of our studies it was the counseling part. What is most interesting about the author’s approach to mindless eating is the political angle. He presents study after study demonstrating how manipulated we are in the current food environment. Much of the research is conducted by the military (efficiency and economy of food) and the restaurant industry (eat more cheap stuff so you don’t notice that the expensive ingredients are scanty or missing). By the time you’ve completed the book you should be enraged at how the food marketing business has shaped your choices, portions, and the quality of what is available to buy. I personally have never eaten the same since reading this book and it was really helpful for study participants. Example: I consider myself to be pretty educated about healthy eating but, before reading this book, was not at all aware of subtle manipulations such as: By having only big boxes available to use at a salad bar you tend to put in more food than you were planning to eat just so items don’t slide around and fall apart. Subtle but effective, right Whole Foods? Super annoying once you start noticing all the strategies."

This isn't really a diet book, but more of an culmination of behavioral research when it comes to eating. Not only do we drastically underestimate the amount of food decisions we make daily, we underestimate our caloric intake. This little book is chock full of fun food and eating experiments. I thought this book was going to be similar to The End of Overeating but I was wrong. That book is more about the sweet spot of foods that have the perfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that get us hooked. This book is more about food cues and how humans aren't very good at paying attention to them. We can mindlessly overeat, but with some simple strategies, we can also mindlessly cut 200-300 calories without our bodies switching gears into starvation and fat storage mode. This book works better not as a diet book, but as a look into human behavior and the psychology of eating in various environments. Just thinking about these experiments would lead one to eat more mindfully. "

The author summarizes in the 10 chapters the main pain points when it comes to the gain in weight over the long period of time. The most important one is called ""the mindless margin"". This is basically the difference between 2000 calories a day and 2200 calories a day. We are not aware of those calories. It can be an extra bar of Snickers, or a few extra chips, or even upgrading a medium menu to large in a fast food restaurant.Therefore, the author's approach to lose weight in the long term is to reverse the process and instead of eating 200 extra calories a day, just eat 200 less a day by implementing small changes in our daily diet.Most of the ideas in the book are psychological changes, like placing the food further away from us, or creating smaller portions, or eating from a smaller plate and things of this nature. Personally, I think this book given some sound advice when it comes to taking care of your weight and it shows that most kilograms gained in the long run are mostly invisible in the immediate term, but can definitely be seen when we compare the photos we take now to the ones we took when we were younger.All in all, I recommend this to anyone who struggles with weight loss and to anyone who might want to discover more about compulsive eating or habits created due to environmental changes."
61,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4143583-bojana-duke,4,"Top takeaways:- most diets fail spectacularly because they rely on deprivation for quick results- alternately, small changes add up over time- take advantage of psychological quirks to adjust your patterns so you don't even notice a reduction in food- pick a single goal and three things you will work on per month towards the goal. track how you do each day for accountability. move on when it becomes mindless habit- some tips:* reduce default portion sizes by 20%* see all the food you plan on eating before you start (i.e. no eating straight from larger containers, multiple servings, etc.)* use smaller dishes to make portions look larger* decrease convenience of snacking* reduce distractions while eating (no TV, reading, etc.)* improve associations with healthier foods (describe them enticingly, eat them during happy times)* be a gatekeeper in the household to establish healthy habits for everyone (control what is getting bought, cooked, etc.)"

I am interested in psychology and this book discusses food psychology along with marketing strategies. It was thought provoking and I found myself reasonating with much of the information. While overall I liked the book, I did find it to be a slow read as I highlighted much of it. Many health books can be strongly against the food and restaurant industry. I did not find this book to be that way. It was a light read that offered support to all sides. I appreciate how the author was able to remain neutral. I like how the author explains how we eat more without being aware of it. He then followed up with ideas on how we can avoid these pitfalls. The tips the author provides are realistic and doable. His motto is: ""The best diet is the one you dont know you're on"". "

There are also many actions he suggests that we can take to make little changes that will help us manage our weight over time.This is not a quick fix, but a book of information and tips that you can implement over time to make positive changes to our eating habits.The audiobook was read by the author, Brian Wansink, which I like, and the production quality is very good."

I found myself saying, ""I would never do that,"" only to find myself doing exactly THAT the next day.

However, this book does make it seem like you can eat whatever sounds good as long as you keep up with your calories, and that seems a bit novice to me in the health space. You can’t just eat French fries all day long and expect to be healthy. You might lose weight if you’re taking in less calories than you need, but I promise your body still hates you. "

He does lots of crazy food studies, like demonstrating how people consume more soup if you give them a bowl that's secretly refilling itself from the bottom, or how if you put folks in a dark room and ask them to evaluate your new strawberry yogurt but give them chocolate yogurt instead they'll think it has a good strawberry flavor. The book's kinda all over the place: overlong, poorly written, chock full of irrelevant anecdotes and ""jokes"" and name dropping of the fancy places he's talked or worked [""Ooh! The Max Planck Institute!""], it can't decide whether it's telling you gee-whiz stories, giving you advice, or just explaining why you're going to fail. [It doesn't take a consistent view on whether knowing your own biases leads to any paths to reduce those biases.]I can't really recommend it because it wasn't well written and it wasn't helpful, although if you've never read anything else in this space maybe it would be OK?A few notes from the book:- Expectations matter; people don't believe it. Give people a glass of California wine, they expect it'll be good, they'll think it's good. Give them a glass of North Dakota wine, they expect it'll be bad, they'll think it's bad. Of course it's the same wine with different labels. And of course the people insist that the wine's origin didn't influence their judgement.- One of the book's central concept is ""the mindless margin."" The argument is that (1) it is easy to mindlessly reduce [or increase] your calories by 100 or so / day, and that (2) this will have large effects on your eventual weight because 3500 calories is a pound. (1) is undoubtedly true, but (2) is deeply suspect, because it's very possible your metabolism or changes in NEAT [non-exercise activity thermogenesis] will absorb small calorie surpluses or deficits. The book treats human psychology as complex, but human metabolism as trivial, which is basically just embarrassing and non-scientific.- Plate size makes a huge difference. Seriously consider getting and using smaller plates and serving spoons [the experiment used ice cream scoops]. You anchor off the size of your plate. Plate size has been increasing over time. [Edit: This is assuming you want to consume fewer calories. If you want to consume more calories, get bigger plates. I find consuming more calories trivial and consuming fewer difficult.]- Many of the suggestions in the book are weak because you operate in an unfriendly environment: the restaurant doesn't care how fat you are; if you're willing to not to eat in restaurants, you have a lot of tools at your disposal but that's drastic for most of us. Worse, one of the suggestions is to prime yourself to eat good foods: they did an experiment where they asked one group to do a detailed recollection of the last time they eat soup [a healthy food], and reported that this group ""anticipated they would eat more than twice as much soup in the next month as the non-primed group"". BUT THEY DID NOT MEASURE HOW MUCH SOUP THEY ACTUALLY ATE! - At one point the book puts ""pizza"" in a list of relatively healthy foods. Good to know.- I guess I don't want to read any book that tells me about a hot new idea called ""evolutionary psychology."" Way to show off your middlebrow.-Naming on menus is important. Which of these menus do you want to order from? ""Red beans with rice / seafood filet / grilled chicken / chicken parmesan / chocolate pudding / zucchini cookies"" or ""Traditional cajun red beans with rice / succulent italian seafood filet / tender grilled chicken / home-style chicken parmesan / satin chocolate pudding / grandma's zucchini cookies."" The food's the same. This totally works. I cannot want the first menu.I guess this book made me grumpy. I do want to be more mindful in my food consumption, but this book did not help much."

77,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,4,"""The best diet is the one you don't know you're on.""Wansink is a Ph.D. who has run food labs at different universities and independently. His book is a friendly, rather chatty account of his findings, which include:* Your stomach can't count. It doesn't know how many spoonfuls of soup (or whatever) you had, so it will encourage you to keep eating until the plate is clean, the bag or box is empty, or the TV show is over. That's evolution, baby.* It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach let your brain know that you are full. (OK, I knew that one already.)* Here's where it gets interesting: If you cut calorie intake drastically, your body will reduce your metabolism, and you will feel hungry most of the time. If you cut calorie intake by 100-300 calories per day, your body will not notice the difference . . . but you may be able to lose 30 pounds in a year. Even if you don't, you'll at least stop gaining. It is possible to do this calorie cutting through exercise, but through diet is easier for most people.Some ways to cut those 100-300 daily calories:- Eat slowly. People eat faster/more if others around them eat faster/more. Try to find the slowest eater at the table and pace yourself with him/her.- Put down your fork after every bite.- When you are eating, just eat. No reading, no TV watching, no computer using. It's OK to talk or listen to music if you are with others, but try to make it slow-tempo music or you'll all eat faster.- Be aware that you will eat more when dining with others, mostly because you will be at the table for a longer time. If you are dining with several others, you will likely eat a lot more.- Don't serve food family style (in serving dishes on the table) unless it's vegetables.- Use smaller plates and tall, skinny glasses. Your brain doesn't know the difference. - Eat fruit for dessert.- If you're going to have a high-calorie dessert, try to split it with others. The best part of dessert is the first two bites.- If you must eat in front of the TV, decide in advance how much you want and put that in a plate or bowl. No eating out of a multiple-serving bag or box.- If you bulk-buy snacks, repackage them into smaller containers or bags.- Nutritious foods go where you can see them: on the counter or on a front shelf in a clear container. Non-nutritious foods, if you must buy them, go on the backs of the shelves in opaque containers.Here are the tips that I thought were too extreme for me:• Eat in only one room of your house--the kitchen or dining room.• Don't set foot in the kitchen unless it's mealtime. If you have to, enter the house a different way so you don't snack immediately after work.• Before you eat something that is bad for you, say out loud, ""I'm not actually hungry, but I'm going to eat this anyway."""

Isn't so much a diet book as a how-to on better facilitating the interaction between the feed-me messages of our stomachs and the controls in our heads.""—Publishers WeeklyProduct Description:In this illuminating and groundbreaking new book, food psychologist Brian Wansink shows why you may not realize how much you're eating, what you're eating–or why you're even eating at all.• Does food with a brand name really taste better?• Do you hate brussels sprouts because your mother did?• Does the size of your plate determine how hungry you feel?• How much would you eat if your soup bowl secretly refilled itself?• What does your favorite comfort food really say about you?• Why do you overeat so much at healthy restaurants?Brian Wansink is a Stanford Ph.D. and the director of the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab. He's spent a lifetime studying what we don't notice: the hidden cues that determine how much and why people eat. Using ingenious, fun, and sometimes downright fiendishly clever experiments like the ""bottomless soup bowl,"" Wansink takes us on a fascinating tour of the secret dynamics behind our dietary habits. How does packaging influence how much we eat? Which movies make us eat faster? How does music or the color of the room influence how much we eat? How can we recognize the ""hidden persuaders"" used by restaurants and supermarkets to get us to mindlessly eat? What are the real reasons most diets are doomed to fail? And how can we use the ""mindless margin"" to lose–instead of gain–ten to twenty pounds in the coming year?Mindless Eating will change the way you look at food, and it will give you the facts you need to easily make smarter, healthier, more mindful and enjoyable choices at the dinner table, in the supermarket, in restaurants, at the office–even at a vending machine–wherever you decide to satisfy your appetite."

Instead of dictating what may constitute as the healthiest eating habits and willing the readers to follow the tall order, Brian Wansink attempts to explain the psychological aspects behind why we eat what we eat the way we eat. I am yet to go nuts about poring over the ingredient labels but I am intrigued by the idea of re-engineering my gourmet lifestyle and seeing how it pans out. Not that I'm going to cover all bases but I'll consider it a feat if I can just stick with some of these mindless/mindful tricks that I find most relevant to myself:1. Re-write the scripts and re-wire the comfort food - My top 2 activities that always seems more appealing when pairing with eating - watching TV shows and reading. Meanwhile, winter is coming.2. Take a good look at what I eat and make sure I see them ALL before and while eating - I'll appreciate the food more and be conscious of my intake at the same time. Pretty boys, my apology in advance if I can't give you my undivided attention.3. Evaluate if I can eventually realise all the savings on bulk purchase - Apart from a tendency to gorge things down faster than normal pace, I may end up throwing them away upon expiry. 4. Hara hachi bun me - Eat until I am eight parts (out of ten) full. I've always been such a big nagger if I eat too much.5. Don't be fooled by labels - I am a sucker for packaging and beautiful wordings. Ergo, my palates can already be biased before even tasting the dish. 6. Be transparent or opaque depending on the food situation - Out of sight is out of mind.7. Inconvenience is bliss - I don't need to make fire hoops as long as I can embrace the lazy self (though I still very much fancy at the idea of bracing myself against the wind while it is 4 degree outside for a good walk to Sobeys)8. Do not go for grocery shopping if I'm hungry - This will save me from all the impulse buying and food fantasizing."
81,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13316740-alex-timberman,4,"The author, Brian Wansink, is an expert in his field. He is a professor at Cornell University in the Marketing and Nutritional Science department, or something of that sort. His expertise is on the interdisciplinary relationship of marketing, nutritional science, and economics. If you read some books on behavioral economics like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman or Nudge by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, you will quickly get the psychology behind this book. The question he tries to answer is why we eat so much and what we can do about it. Obviously, this is a big problem in America with our super-sized portions and processed meals. Because he runs a food laboratory with a large research budget, his team has been able to conduct numerous experiments on why we can’t control our eating. The gist is that we all have a lot of biases and holes in our thinking that prevent us from knowing how much we are eating, when to stop eating, and on why we are eating. Because our behavior runs on autopilot, a good way to correct our bad eating habits is to set up a system so that we control our eating on autopilot. He suggests we can do that by cutting our calorie intake by a slight percentage, a percentage so small that our brains and bodies won’t be able to know the difference from our current eating habits, but a difference important enough in that over time it will lead to a significant change in our consumption. So I learned some things: follow the eating speed of the slowest eater at the dinner table to let my brain catch up with my consumption, use smaller dishes and plates because it will help me to consume less food, and etc. Even though I know all that, I just can’t resist eating what I feel like eating, when I see or think about it. As I swing into my thirties, hopefully, I can get more serious with my diet and apply some of the principles herein. "
82,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850999-beth-peninger,5,"Whoa. Each one of us is required to make 200 or more choices about food (and beverage) each day. At least that is what Wansink has discovered in his years of research. He says that number may seem high because we aren't aware of 90% of them! We are mindless when it comes to eating, to food choices, to knowing what we are actually digesting. Wansink spends the length of the book proving that and giving solutions to combat that mindless eating and become more mindful. This isn't a diet or restrictive solution. All it involves is thinking a bit more than normal when it comes to mealtimes. This book is far from dry, Wansink uses interesting research and conducts really fun and interesting studies. His facts and research are fascinating because they prove how powerful thought, or lack thereof, can be. He proposes that if we change three habits and nothing else we would lose up to 30 lbs a year (if we needed to lose weight)! And the science behind mindful and not mindless eating is so incredibly simple that I felt a little dumb listening and realizing how painless it would be to make some changes. Right away I decided to quit getting adult meals at the only fast food place I go to, I'm getting a kid meal and it's plenty. (Plus I get a fun toy!) Next time I'm at a restaurant I'll look over the kids menu and see if there is an adult kind of meal or I will be mindful. It's about being mindful. We can all say we know that but Wansink proves that we know it but we don't know it. This is a great book, such a great resource. For a preview of Wansink's suggestions and resources check out Mindless Eating's website. I highly recommend this book regardless of your size, weight, and ideas about food. "
83,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6227186-elaine,4,"Written in 2006 (and perhaps a bit dated), ""Mindless Eating"" is, first, a book about food psychology and, second, a diet book. The bottom line offers some helpful Heloise-ish tips for food control. But, the fascinating part is the first 2/3 of the book, in which Brian Wansink, a food researcher, tells stories from his life work. Of course, he maligns “foods to die for:” fat, sugar, and salt. He doesn’t blame food manufacturers and restaurants: they are in business to make money, not a conspiracy against the health of Americans. (McDonald’s doesn’t care if you throw ½ your fries away between the pick-up counter and your seat, an idea he recommends.) Most of his truisms are well-known or obvious: we eat more out of bigger bags (he calls it the “warehouse store curse”), we grossly underestimate the calories we eat, we eat more when prolonging a meal with friends (especially if they eat a lot), we will continue to eat mindlessly if we’re eating from a refilling soup bowl (he created such a device, and the subjects did continue to eat and didn’t notice the refilling part). I found the chapter in which he delineates his “soup personalities” to be most intriguing. Which soup do you prefer? Chicken noodle, chili beef, vegetable, New England clam chowder, or tomato? Here is your personality in order: a homebody, the life of the party, the trend-setter, a witty sophisticate, or a sociable affectionate reader. I’m not sure I’m a trend-setter, but of course, I’d choose vegetable. Sometimes humorous, sometimes illuminating, always fascinating, ""Mindless Eating"" was a delightful quick read for me."
84,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,4,"This researcher has a lot of experience in running experiments to see see what influences us in relation to food. Some were run in a specially designed restaurant area. In one, for example, everyone was given a free glass of wine. The bottles were almost identical. The only difference is that half the labels carried the name of a highly reputable wine growing area and the other half mention an an area not known for good wine. At no point was this pointed out to the diners. The wine was the same in each case, as were the meals served to all the diners. The survey afterwards asked diners to rate their experience of both the wine and the meal. The diners who had the supposedly cheap wine gave the wine lower ratings, but I was surprised that they also rated the food and the dining experience lower too. Lesson: people's expectations affect their experience of food.In another experiment, students were offered free food such as ribs whilst watching a football game. They could eat as much as they liked by helping themselves from a buffet. For half the students, the bowls of bones and detritus were removed regularly from the table. For the other half, the bowls were left in place. The second set ate significantly less overall. Lesson: we don't pay attention to how much we are eating and don't stop eating just because we have had enough to eat.We probably all know that we sometimes eat mindlessly, but the author helps explain why that is, and also what to do about it. It's easy to read, with lots of practical examples. I enjoyed listening to this book and will undoubtedly listen to it again from time to time."
85,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,4,"How do we determine how much we eat? Surely it depends on how hungry we are and how tasty the food is, but  Brian Wansink argues that it depends just as much on external cues, like how much is on our plate, the shape of our drinking glasses, how fast other people at the table are eating, and so forth.The best parts of this book are when he describes his experiments: the famous bottomless soup bowl, for example, or the chicken wing Super Bowl party experiment. (In the former he finds that if your bowl surreptitiously refills itself, you will eat far, far more than if it doesn't, because you are relying on the visual cue of how much soup is left in the bowl to tell you to stop eating, and in the latter he finds that if the bones aren't cleared away, they provide a reminder of how much you've eaten, and you'll eat fewer wings than if the bones are continuously removed from your sight.)The weaker parts are when he tries to extend his findings to produce dieting advice. If our mindless eating causes us to eat a few extra calories a day and cause us to gain a few pounds a year without noticing, then theoretically we could change our habits to give ourselves slightly smaller portions, so slight in difference that we don't even notice, and so we can lose a few pounds a year without even noticing the difference. Fair enough, but I could pick that up from reading the experiments, and I thought the diet advice was a bit heavy-handed and repetitive."
86,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,3,"This was a fun read: basically a tour of anecdotes and studies with unexpected insights into how people perceive food portions and what that means for healthy eating. If you like books like Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything then you will dig this; it feels similar to me though the topics and scope are very different. The overall premise here is that simple changes can help you eat healthier over time without really thinking about it. Wansink has come under fire a little in the news recently over research methods, but that doesn't seem particularly relevant to this book. The material is intuitively sensible. The thing that most resonated with me was simply to consider how much you want to eat before you start a meal, otherwise a host of social, marketing, and evolutionary factors will encourage you to eat more than you meant to. I can sum that up in one sentence, but the studies in the book make it stick in your head more than someone just saying it.The introduction was off-putting to me personally. The author spends a while establishing his bonafides, but I would rather make that decision myself based on the content instead of having someone convince me up front. It was fine after the introduction though. "
87,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32021539-holly-b,5,"I ran clinical trials for a couple of drugs being developed for obesity and used this book as a teaching tool. When you do randomized placebo controlled trials there has to be something in it for everyone. In the case of our studies it was the counseling part. What is most interesting about the author’s approach to mindless eating is the political angle. He presents study after study demonstrating how manipulated we are in the current food environment. Much of the research is conducted by the military (efficiency and economy of food) and the restaurant industry (eat more cheap stuff so you don’t notice that the expensive ingredients are scanty or missing). By the time you’ve completed the book you should be enraged at how the food marketing business has shaped your choices, portions, and the quality of what is available to buy. I personally have never eaten the same since reading this book and it was really helpful for study participants. Example: I consider myself to be pretty educated about healthy eating but, before reading this book, was not at all aware of subtle manipulations such as: By having only big boxes available to use at a salad bar you tend to put in more food than you were planning to eat just so items don’t slide around and fall apart. Subtle but effective, right Whole Foods? Super annoying once you start noticing all the strategies."

If you deprive yourself of everything, you'll give up at some point.- You can't trust your stomach, it can't count and it only feels full because of external cues.- See it BEFORE and WHILE you eat it: if you're doing other things, and you've not carefully chosen a portion, you'll end op eating everything- Optical illusion: buy smaller plates- Variety makes us eat more, don't offer a wide variety: at a buffet, only take two different things each time- Convenience wins every time: keep things that tempt you far away and you're so much less likely to eat things that are bad for you: make overeating a hassle- Be the last one to get your food and the last one to finish your meal, try to follow the pace of whoever is at your table- Serve yourself BEFORE you start- Brand-name psychosis- Think small or share- Choose one step, DON'T IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME"

This isn't really a diet book, but more of an culmination of behavioral research when it comes to eating. Not only do we drastically underestimate the amount of food decisions we make daily, we underestimate our caloric intake. This little book is chock full of fun food and eating experiments. I thought this book was going to be similar to The End of Overeating but I was wrong. That book is more about the sweet spot of foods that have the perfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that get us hooked. This book is more about food cues and how humans aren't very good at paying attention to them. We can mindlessly overeat, but with some simple strategies, we can also mindlessly cut 200-300 calories without our bodies switching gears into starvation and fat storage mode. This book works better not as a diet book, but as a look into human behavior and the psychology of eating in various environments. Just thinking about these experiments would lead one to eat more mindfully. "

The author summarizes in the 10 chapters the main pain points when it comes to the gain in weight over the long period of time. The most important one is called ""the mindless margin"". This is basically the difference between 2000 calories a day and 2200 calories a day. We are not aware of those calories. It can be an extra bar of Snickers, or a few extra chips, or even upgrading a medium menu to large in a fast food restaurant.Therefore, the author's approach to lose weight in the long term is to reverse the process and instead of eating 200 extra calories a day, just eat 200 less a day by implementing small changes in our daily diet.Most of the ideas in the book are psychological changes, like placing the food further away from us, or creating smaller portions, or eating from a smaller plate and things of this nature. Personally, I think this book given some sound advice when it comes to taking care of your weight and it shows that most kilograms gained in the long run are mostly invisible in the immediate term, but can definitely be seen when we compare the photos we take now to the ones we took when we were younger.All in all, I recommend this to anyone who struggles with weight loss and to anyone who might want to discover more about compulsive eating or habits created due to environmental changes."
91,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4143583-bojana-duke,4,"Top takeaways:- most diets fail spectacularly because they rely on deprivation for quick results- alternately, small changes add up over time- take advantage of psychological quirks to adjust your patterns so you don't even notice a reduction in food- pick a single goal and three things you will work on per month towards the goal. track how you do each day for accountability. move on when it becomes mindless habit- some tips:* reduce default portion sizes by 20%* see all the food you plan on eating before you start (i.e. no eating straight from larger containers, multiple servings, etc.)* use smaller dishes to make portions look larger* decrease convenience of snacking* reduce distractions while eating (no TV, reading, etc.)* improve associations with healthier foods (describe them enticingly, eat them during happy times)* be a gatekeeper in the household to establish healthy habits for everyone (control what is getting bought, cooked, etc.)"

I am interested in psychology and this book discusses food psychology along with marketing strategies. It was thought provoking and I found myself reasonating with much of the information. While overall I liked the book, I did find it to be a slow read as I highlighted much of it. Many health books can be strongly against the food and restaurant industry. I did not find this book to be that way. It was a light read that offered support to all sides. I appreciate how the author was able to remain neutral. I like how the author explains how we eat more without being aware of it. He then followed up with ideas on how we can avoid these pitfalls. The tips the author provides are realistic and doable. His motto is: ""The best diet is the one you dont know you're on"". "

The author points out and illuminates things that influence our eating that may seem obvious in retrospect, but that we don't tend to realize in the moment. There are also many actions he suggests that we can take to make little changes that will help us manage our weight over time.This is not a quick fix, but a book of information and tips that you can implement over time to make positive changes to our eating habits.The audiobook was read by the author, Brian Wansink, which I like, and the production quality is very good."

I found myself saying, ""I would never do that,"" only to find myself doing exactly THAT the next day. I am more aware of my psychological eating and am now highly motivated to put some of these ideas to the test. I highly recommend this book."

However, this book does make it seem like you can eat whatever sounds good as long as you keep up with your calories, and that seems a bit novice to me in the health space. You can’t just eat French fries all day long and expect to be healthy. You might lose weight if you’re taking in less calories than you need, but I promise your body still hates you. "

He does lots of crazy food studies, like demonstrating how people consume more soup if you give them a bowl that's secretly refilling itself from the bottom, or how if you put folks in a dark room and ask them to evaluate your new strawberry yogurt but give them chocolate yogurt instead they'll think it has a good strawberry flavor. The book's kinda all over the place: overlong, poorly written, chock full of irrelevant anecdotes and ""jokes"" and name dropping of the fancy places he's talked or worked [""Ooh! The Max Planck Institute!""], it can't decide whether it's telling you gee-whiz stories, giving you advice, or just explaining why you're going to fail. [It doesn't take a consistent view on whether knowing your own biases leads to any paths to reduce those biases.]I can't really recommend it because it wasn't well written and it wasn't helpful, although if you've never read anything else in this space maybe it would be OK?A few notes from the book:- Expectations matter; people don't believe it. Give people a glass of California wine, they expect it'll be good, they'll think it's good. Give them a glass of North Dakota wine, they expect it'll be bad, they'll think it's bad. Of course it's the same wine with different labels. And of course the people insist that the wine's origin didn't influence their judgement.- One of the book's central concept is ""the mindless margin."" The argument is that (1) it is easy to mindlessly reduce [or increase] your calories by 100 or so / day, and that (2) this will have large effects on your eventual weight because 3500 calories is a pound. (1) is undoubtedly true, but (2) is deeply suspect, because it's very possible your metabolism or changes in NEAT [non-exercise activity thermogenesis] will absorb small calorie surpluses or deficits. The book treats human psychology as complex, but human metabolism as trivial, which is basically just embarrassing and non-scientific.- Plate size makes a huge difference. Seriously consider getting and using smaller plates and serving spoons [the experiment used ice cream scoops]. You anchor off the size of your plate. Plate size has been increasing over time. [Edit: This is assuming you want to consume fewer calories. If you want to consume more calories, get bigger plates. I find consuming more calories trivial and consuming fewer difficult.]- Many of the suggestions in the book are weak because you operate in an unfriendly environment: the restaurant doesn't care how fat you are; if you're willing to not to eat in restaurants, you have a lot of tools at your disposal but that's drastic for most of us. Worse, one of the suggestions is to prime yourself to eat good foods: they did an experiment where they asked one group to do a detailed recollection of the last time they eat soup [a healthy food], and reported that this group ""anticipated they would eat more than twice as much soup in the next month as the non-primed group"". BUT THEY DID NOT MEASURE HOW MUCH SOUP THEY ACTUALLY ATE! - At one point the book puts ""pizza"" in a list of relatively healthy foods. Good to know.- I guess I don't want to read any book that tells me about a hot new idea called ""evolutionary psychology."" Way to show off your middlebrow.-Naming on menus is important. Which of these menus do you want to order from? ""Red beans with rice / seafood filet / grilled chicken / chicken parmesan / chocolate pudding / zucchini cookies"" or ""Traditional cajun red beans with rice / succulent italian seafood filet / tender grilled chicken / home-style chicken parmesan / satin chocolate pudding / grandma's zucchini cookies."" The food's the same. This totally works. I cannot want the first menu.I guess this book made me grumpy. I do want to be more mindful in my food consumption, but this book did not help much."

107,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,4,"""The best diet is the one you don't know you're on.""Wansink is a Ph.D. who has run food labs at different universities and independently. His book is a friendly, rather chatty account of his findings, which include:* Your stomach can't count. It doesn't know how many spoonfuls of soup (or whatever) you had, so it will encourage you to keep eating until the plate is clean, the bag or box is empty, or the TV show is over. That's evolution, baby.* It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach let your brain know that you are full. (OK, I knew that one already.)* Here's where it gets interesting: If you cut calorie intake drastically, your body will reduce your metabolism, and you will feel hungry most of the time. If you cut calorie intake by 100-300 calories per day, your body will not notice the difference . . . but you may be able to lose 30 pounds in a year. Even if you don't, you'll at least stop gaining. It is possible to do this calorie cutting through exercise, but through diet is easier for most people.Some ways to cut those 100-300 daily calories:- Eat slowly. People eat faster/more if others around them eat faster/more. Try to find the slowest eater at the table and pace yourself with him/her.- Put down your fork after every bite.- When you are eating, just eat. No reading, no TV watching, no computer using. It's OK to talk or listen to music if you are with others, but try to make it slow-tempo music or you'll all eat faster.- Be aware that you will eat more when dining with others, mostly because you will be at the table for a longer time. If you are dining with several others, you will likely eat a lot more.- Don't serve food family style (in serving dishes on the table) unless it's vegetables.- Use smaller plates and tall, skinny glasses. Your brain doesn't know the difference. - Eat fruit for dessert.- If you're going to have a high-calorie dessert, try to split it with others. The best part of dessert is the first two bites.- If you must eat in front of the TV, decide in advance how much you want and put that in a plate or bowl. No eating out of a multiple-serving bag or box.- If you bulk-buy snacks, repackage them into smaller containers or bags.- Nutritious foods go where you can see them: on the counter or on a front shelf in a clear container. Non-nutritious foods, if you must buy them, go on the backs of the shelves in opaque containers.Here are the tips that I thought were too extreme for me:• Eat in only one room of your house--the kitchen or dining room.• Don't set foot in the kitchen unless it's mealtime. If you have to, enter the house a different way so you don't snack immediately after work.• Before you eat something that is bad for you, say out loud, ""I'm not actually hungry, but I'm going to eat this anyway."""

110,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10864046-kara,4,"The book is chock-full of observations, counter-intuitive at first but turn out to be more of common sense than originally thought. Instead of dictating what may constitute as the healthiest eating habits and willing the readers to follow the tall order, Brian Wansink attempts to explain the psychological aspects behind why we eat what we eat the way we eat. I am yet to go nuts about poring over the ingredient labels but I am intrigued by the idea of re-engineering my gourmet lifestyle and seeing how it pans out. Not that I'm going to cover all bases but I'll consider it a feat if I can just stick with some of these mindless/mindful tricks that I find most relevant to myself:1. Re-write the scripts and re-wire the comfort food - My top 2 activities that always seems more appealing when pairing with eating - watching TV shows and reading. Meanwhile, winter is coming.2. Take a good look at what I eat and make sure I see them ALL before and while eating - I'll appreciate the food more and be conscious of my intake at the same time. Pretty boys, my apology in advance if I can't give you my undivided attention.3. Evaluate if I can eventually realise all the savings on bulk purchase - Apart from a tendency to gorge things down faster than normal pace, I may end up throwing them away upon expiry. 4. Hara hachi bun me - Eat until I am eight parts (out of ten) full. I've always been such a big nagger if I eat too much.5. Don't be fooled by labels - I am a sucker for packaging and beautiful wordings. Ergo, my palates can already be biased before even tasting the dish. 6. Be transparent or opaque depending on the food situation - Out of sight is out of mind.7. Inconvenience is bliss - I don't need to make fire hoops as long as I can embrace the lazy self (though I still very much fancy at the idea of bracing myself against the wind while it is 4 degree outside for a good walk to Sobeys)8. Do not go for grocery shopping if I'm hungry - This will save me from all the impulse buying and food fantasizing."
111,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13316740-alex-timberman,4,"The author, Brian Wansink, is an expert in his field. He is a professor at Cornell University in the Marketing and Nutritional Science department, or something of that sort. His expertise is on the interdisciplinary relationship of marketing, nutritional science, and economics. If you read some books on behavioral economics like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman or Nudge by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, you will quickly get the psychology behind this book. The question he tries to answer is why we eat so much and what we can do about it. Obviously, this is a big problem in America with our super-sized portions and processed meals. Because he runs a food laboratory with a large research budget, his team has been able to conduct numerous experiments on why we can’t control our eating. The gist is that we all have a lot of biases and holes in our thinking that prevent us from knowing how much we are eating, when to stop eating, and on why we are eating. Because our behavior runs on autopilot, a good way to correct our bad eating habits is to set up a system so that we control our eating on autopilot. He suggests we can do that by cutting our calorie intake by a slight percentage, a percentage so small that our brains and bodies won’t be able to know the difference from our current eating habits, but a difference important enough in that over time it will lead to a significant change in our consumption. So I learned some things: follow the eating speed of the slowest eater at the dinner table to let my brain catch up with my consumption, use smaller dishes and plates because it will help me to consume less food, and etc. Even though I know all that, I just can’t resist eating what I feel like eating, when I see or think about it. As I swing into my thirties, hopefully, I can get more serious with my diet and apply some of the principles herein. "
112,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850999-beth-peninger,5,"Whoa. Each one of us is required to make 200 or more choices about food (and beverage) each day. At least that is what Wansink has discovered in his years of research. He says that number may seem high because we aren't aware of 90% of them! We are mindless when it comes to eating, to food choices, to knowing what we are actually digesting. Wansink spends the length of the book proving that and giving solutions to combat that mindless eating and become more mindful. This isn't a diet or restrictive solution. All it involves is thinking a bit more than normal when it comes to mealtimes. This book is far from dry, Wansink uses interesting research and conducts really fun and interesting studies. His facts and research are fascinating because they prove how powerful thought, or lack thereof, can be. He proposes that if we change three habits and nothing else we would lose up to 30 lbs a year (if we needed to lose weight)! And the science behind mindful and not mindless eating is so incredibly simple that I felt a little dumb listening and realizing how painless it would be to make some changes. Right away I decided to quit getting adult meals at the only fast food place I go to, I'm getting a kid meal and it's plenty. (Plus I get a fun toy!) Next time I'm at a restaurant I'll look over the kids menu and see if there is an adult kind of meal or I will be mindful. It's about being mindful. We can all say we know that but Wansink proves that we know it but we don't know it. This is a great book, such a great resource. For a preview of Wansink's suggestions and resources check out Mindless Eating's website. I highly recommend this book regardless of your size, weight, and ideas about food. "
113,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6227186-elaine,4,"Written in 2006 (and perhaps a bit dated), ""Mindless Eating"" is, first, a book about food psychology and, second, a diet book. The bottom line offers some helpful Heloise-ish tips for food control. But, the fascinating part is the first 2/3 of the book, in which Brian Wansink, a food researcher, tells stories from his life work. Of course, he maligns “foods to die for:” fat, sugar, and salt. He doesn’t blame food manufacturers and restaurants: they are in business to make money, not a conspiracy against the health of Americans. (McDonald’s doesn’t care if you throw ½ your fries away between the pick-up counter and your seat, an idea he recommends.) Most of his truisms are well-known or obvious: we eat more out of bigger bags (he calls it the “warehouse store curse”), we grossly underestimate the calories we eat, we eat more when prolonging a meal with friends (especially if they eat a lot), we will continue to eat mindlessly if we’re eating from a refilling soup bowl (he created such a device, and the subjects did continue to eat and didn’t notice the refilling part). I found the chapter in which he delineates his “soup personalities” to be most intriguing. Which soup do you prefer? Chicken noodle, chili beef, vegetable, New England clam chowder, or tomato? Here is your personality in order: a homebody, the life of the party, the trend-setter, a witty sophisticate, or a sociable affectionate reader. I’m not sure I’m a trend-setter, but of course, I’d choose vegetable. Sometimes humorous, sometimes illuminating, always fascinating, ""Mindless Eating"" was a delightful quick read for me."
114,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,4,"This researcher has a lot of experience in running experiments to see see what influences us in relation to food. Some were run in a specially designed restaurant area. In one, for example, everyone was given a free glass of wine. The bottles were almost identical. The only difference is that half the labels carried the name of a highly reputable wine growing area and the other half mention an an area not known for good wine. At no point was this pointed out to the diners. The wine was the same in each case, as were the meals served to all the diners. The survey afterwards asked diners to rate their experience of both the wine and the meal. The diners who had the supposedly cheap wine gave the wine lower ratings, but I was surprised that they also rated the food and the dining experience lower too. Lesson: people's expectations affect their experience of food.In another experiment, students were offered free food such as ribs whilst watching a football game. They could eat as much as they liked by helping themselves from a buffet. For half the students, the bowls of bones and detritus were removed regularly from the table. For the other half, the bowls were left in place. The second set ate significantly less overall. Lesson: we don't pay attention to how much we are eating and don't stop eating just because we have had enough to eat.We probably all know that we sometimes eat mindlessly, but the author helps explain why that is, and also what to do about it. It's easy to read, with lots of practical examples. I enjoyed listening to this book and will undoubtedly listen to it again from time to time."
115,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,4,"How do we determine how much we eat? Surely it depends on how hungry we are and how tasty the food is, but  Brian Wansink argues that it depends just as much on external cues, like how much is on our plate, the shape of our drinking glasses, how fast other people at the table are eating, and so forth.The best parts of this book are when he describes his experiments: the famous bottomless soup bowl, for example, or the chicken wing Super Bowl party experiment. (In the former he finds that if your bowl surreptitiously refills itself, you will eat far, far more than if it doesn't, because you are relying on the visual cue of how much soup is left in the bowl to tell you to stop eating, and in the latter he finds that if the bones aren't cleared away, they provide a reminder of how much you've eaten, and you'll eat fewer wings than if the bones are continuously removed from your sight.)The weaker parts are when he tries to extend his findings to produce dieting advice. If our mindless eating causes us to eat a few extra calories a day and cause us to gain a few pounds a year without noticing, then theoretically we could change our habits to give ourselves slightly smaller portions, so slight in difference that we don't even notice, and so we can lose a few pounds a year without even noticing the difference. Fair enough, but I could pick that up from reading the experiments, and I thought the diet advice was a bit heavy-handed and repetitive."
116,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,3,"This was a fun read: basically a tour of anecdotes and studies with unexpected insights into how people perceive food portions and what that means for healthy eating. If you like books like Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything then you will dig this; it feels similar to me though the topics and scope are very different. The overall premise here is that simple changes can help you eat healthier over time without really thinking about it. Wansink has come under fire a little in the news recently over research methods, but that doesn't seem particularly relevant to this book. The material is intuitively sensible. The thing that most resonated with me was simply to consider how much you want to eat before you start a meal, otherwise a host of social, marketing, and evolutionary factors will encourage you to eat more than you meant to. I can sum that up in one sentence, but the studies in the book make it stick in your head more than someone just saying it.The introduction was off-putting to me personally. The author spends a while establishing his bonafides, but I would rather make that decision myself based on the content instead of having someone convince me up front. It was fine after the introduction though. "

When you do randomized placebo controlled trials there has to be something in it for everyone. In the case of our studies it was the counseling part. What is most interesting about the author’s approach to mindless eating is the political angle. He presents study after study demonstrating how manipulated we are in the current food environment. Much of the research is conducted by the military (efficiency and economy of food) and the restaurant industry (eat more cheap stuff so you don’t notice that the expensive ingredients are scanty or missing). By the time you’ve completed the book you should be enraged at how the food marketing business has shaped your choices, portions, and the quality of what is available to buy. I personally have never eaten the same since reading this book and it was really helpful for study participants. Example: I consider myself to be pretty educated about healthy eating but, before reading this book, was not at all aware of subtle manipulations such as: By having only big boxes available to use at a salad bar you tend to put in more food than you were planning to eat just so items don’t slide around and fall apart. Subtle but effective, right Whole Foods? Super annoying once you start noticing all the strategies."

This isn't really a diet book, but more of an culmination of behavioral research when it comes to eating. Not only do we drastically underestimate the amount of food decisions we make daily, we underestimate our caloric intake. This little book is chock full of fun food and eating experiments. I thought this book was going to be similar to The End of Overeating but I was wrong. That book is more about the sweet spot of foods that have the perfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that get us hooked. This book is more about food cues and how humans aren't very good at paying attention to them. We can mindlessly overeat, but with some simple strategies, we can also mindlessly cut 200-300 calories without our bodies switching gears into starvation and fat storage mode. This book works better not as a diet book, but as a look into human behavior and the psychology of eating in various environments. Just thinking about these experiments would lead one to eat more mindfully. "

The author summarizes in the 10 chapters the main pain points when it comes to the gain in weight over the long period of time. The most important one is called ""the mindless margin"". This is basically the difference between 2000 calories a day and 2200 calories a day. We are not aware of those calories. It can be an extra bar of Snickers, or a few extra chips, or even upgrading a medium menu to large in a fast food restaurant.Therefore, the author's approach to lose weight in the long term is to reverse the process and instead of eating 200 extra calories a day, just eat 200 less a day by implementing small changes in our daily diet.Most of the ideas in the book are psychological changes, like placing the food further away from us, or creating smaller portions, or eating from a smaller plate and things of this nature. Personally, I think this book given some sound advice when it comes to taking care of your weight and it shows that most kilograms gained in the long run are mostly invisible in the immediate term, but can definitely be seen when we compare the photos we take now to the ones we took when we were younger.All in all, I recommend this to anyone who struggles with weight loss and to anyone who might want to discover more about compulsive eating or habits created due to environmental changes."

I am interested in psychology and this book discusses food psychology along with marketing strategies. It was thought provoking and I found myself reasonating with much of the information. While overall I liked the book, I did find it to be a slow read as I highlighted much of it. Many health books can be strongly against the food and restaurant industry. I did not find this book to be that way. It was a light read that offered support to all sides. I appreciate how the author was able to remain neutral. I like how the author explains how we eat more without being aware of it. He then followed up with ideas on how we can avoid these pitfalls. The tips the author provides are realistic and doable.

You can’t just eat French fries all day long and expect to be healthy. You might lose weight if you’re taking in less calories than you need, but I promise your body still hates you. "

He does lots of crazy food studies, like demonstrating how people consume more soup if you give them a bowl that's secretly refilling itself from the bottom, or how if you put folks in a dark room and ask them to evaluate your new strawberry yogurt but give them chocolate yogurt instead they'll think it has a good strawberry flavor. The book's kinda all over the place: overlong, poorly written, chock full of irrelevant anecdotes and ""jokes"" and name dropping of the fancy places he's talked or worked [""Ooh! The Max Planck Institute!""], it can't decide whether it's telling you gee-whiz stories, giving you advice, or just explaining why you're going to fail. [It doesn't take a consistent view on whether knowing your own biases leads to any paths to reduce those biases.]I can't really recommend it because it wasn't well written and it wasn't helpful, although if you've never read anything else in this space maybe it would be OK?A few notes from the book:- Expectations matter; people don't believe it. Give people a glass of California wine, they expect it'll be good, they'll think it's good. Give them a glass of North Dakota wine, they expect it'll be bad, they'll think it's bad. Of course it's the same wine with different labels. And of course the people insist that the wine's origin didn't influence their judgement.- One of the book's central concept is ""the mindless margin."" The argument is that (1) it is easy to mindlessly reduce [or increase] your calories by 100 or so / day, and that (2) this will have large effects on your eventual weight because 3500 calories is a pound. (1) is undoubtedly true, but (2) is deeply suspect, because it's very possible your metabolism or changes in NEAT [non-exercise activity thermogenesis] will absorb small calorie surpluses or deficits. The book treats human psychology as complex, but human metabolism as trivial, which is basically just embarrassing and non-scientific.- Plate size makes a huge difference. Seriously consider getting and using smaller plates and serving spoons [the experiment used ice cream scoops]. You anchor off the size of your plate. Plate size has been increasing over time. [Edit: This is assuming you want to consume fewer calories. If you want to consume more calories, get bigger plates. I find consuming more calories trivial and consuming fewer difficult.]- Many of the suggestions in the book are weak because you operate in an unfriendly environment: the restaurant doesn't care how fat you are; if you're willing to not to eat in restaurants, you have a lot of tools at your disposal but that's drastic for most of us. Worse, one of the suggestions is to prime yourself to eat good foods: they did an experiment where they asked one group to do a detailed recollection of the last time they eat soup [a healthy food], and reported that this group ""anticipated they would eat more than twice as much soup in the next month as the non-primed group"". BUT THEY DID NOT MEASURE HOW MUCH SOUP THEY ACTUALLY ATE! - At one point the book puts ""pizza"" in a list of relatively healthy foods. Good to know.- I guess I don't want to read any book that tells me about a hot new idea called ""evolutionary psychology."" Way to show off your middlebrow.-Naming on menus is important. Which of these menus do you want to order from? ""Red beans with rice / seafood filet / grilled chicken / chicken parmesan / chocolate pudding / zucchini cookies"" or ""Traditional cajun red beans with rice / succulent italian seafood filet / tender grilled chicken / home-style chicken parmesan / satin chocolate pudding / grandma's zucchini cookies."" The food's the same. This totally works. I cannot want the first menu.I guess this book made me grumpy. I do want to be more mindful in my food consumption, but this book did not help much."

His book is a friendly, rather chatty account of his findings, which include:* Your stomach can't count. It doesn't know how many spoonfuls of soup (or whatever) you had, so it will encourage you to keep eating until the plate is clean, the bag or box is empty, or the TV show is over. That's evolution, baby.* It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach let your brain know that you are full. (OK, I knew that one already.)* Here's where it gets interesting: If you cut calorie intake drastically, your body will reduce your metabolism, and you will feel hungry most of the time. If you cut calorie intake by 100-300 calories per day, your body will not notice the difference . . . but you may be able to lose 30 pounds in a year. Even if you don't, you'll at least stop gaining. It is possible to do this calorie cutting through exercise, but through diet is easier for most people.Some ways to cut those 100-300 daily calories:- Eat slowly. People eat faster/more if others around them eat faster/more. Try to find the slowest eater at the table and pace yourself with him/her.- Put down your fork after every bite.- When you are eating, just eat. No reading, no TV watching, no computer using. It's OK to talk or listen to music if you are with others, but try to make it slow-tempo music or you'll all eat faster.- Be aware that you will eat more when dining with others, mostly because you will be at the table for a longer time. If you are dining with several others, you will likely eat a lot more.- Don't serve food family style (in serving dishes on the table) unless it's vegetables.- Use smaller plates and tall, skinny glasses. Your brain doesn't know the difference. - Eat fruit for dessert.- If you're going to have a high-calorie dessert, try to split it with others. The best part of dessert is the first two bites.- If you must eat in front of the TV, decide in advance how much you want and put that in a plate or bowl. No eating out of a multiple-serving bag or box.- If you bulk-buy snacks, repackage them into smaller containers or bags.- Nutritious foods go where you can see them: on the counter or on a front shelf in a clear container. Non-nutritious foods, if you must buy them, go on the backs of the shelves in opaque containers.Here are the tips that I thought were too extreme for me:• Eat in only one room of your house--the kitchen or dining room.• Don't set foot in the kitchen unless it's mealtime. If you have to, enter the house a different way so you don't snack immediately after work.• Before you eat something that is bad for you, say out loud, ""I'm not actually hungry, but I'm going to eat this anyway."""

140,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10864046-kara,4,"The book is chock-full of observations, counter-intuitive at first but turn out to be more of common sense than originally thought. Instead of dictating what may constitute as the healthiest eating habits and willing the readers to follow the tall order, Brian Wansink attempts to explain the psychological aspects behind why we eat what we eat the way we eat. I am yet to go nuts about poring over the ingredient labels but I am intrigued by the idea of re-engineering my gourmet lifestyle and seeing how it pans out. Not that I'm going to cover all bases but I'll consider it a feat if I can just stick with some of these mindless/mindful tricks that I find most relevant to myself:1. Re-write the scripts and re-wire the comfort food - My top 2 activities that always seems more appealing when pairing with eating - watching TV shows and reading. Meanwhile, winter is coming.2. Take a good look at what I eat and make sure I see them ALL before and while eating - I'll appreciate the food more and be conscious of my intake at the same time. Pretty boys, my apology in advance if I can't give you my undivided attention.3. Evaluate if I can eventually realise all the savings on bulk purchase - Apart from a tendency to gorge things down faster than normal pace, I may end up throwing them away upon expiry. 4. Hara hachi bun me - Eat until I am eight parts (out of ten) full. I've always been such a big nagger if I eat too much.5. Don't be fooled by labels - I am a sucker for packaging and beautiful wordings. Ergo, my palates can already be biased before even tasting the dish. 6. Be transparent or opaque depending on the food situation - Out of sight is out of mind.7. Inconvenience is bliss - I don't need to make fire hoops as long as I can embrace the lazy self (though I still very much fancy at the idea of bracing myself against the wind while it is 4 degree outside for a good walk to Sobeys)8. Do not go for grocery shopping if I'm hungry - This will save me from all the impulse buying and food fantasizing."
141,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13316740-alex-timberman,4,"The author, Brian Wansink, is an expert in his field. He is a professor at Cornell University in the Marketing and Nutritional Science department, or something of that sort. His expertise is on the interdisciplinary relationship of marketing, nutritional science, and economics. If you read some books on behavioral economics like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman or Nudge by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, you will quickly get the psychology behind this book. The question he tries to answer is why we eat so much and what we can do about it. Obviously, this is a big problem in America with our super-sized portions and processed meals. Because he runs a food laboratory with a large research budget, his team has been able to conduct numerous experiments on why we can’t control our eating. The gist is that we all have a lot of biases and holes in our thinking that prevent us from knowing how much we are eating, when to stop eating, and on why we are eating. Because our behavior runs on autopilot, a good way to correct our bad eating habits is to set up a system so that we control our eating on autopilot. He suggests we can do that by cutting our calorie intake by a slight percentage, a percentage so small that our brains and bodies won’t be able to know the difference from our current eating habits, but a difference important enough in that over time it will lead to a significant change in our consumption. So I learned some things: follow the eating speed of the slowest eater at the dinner table to let my brain catch up with my consumption, use smaller dishes and plates because it will help me to consume less food, and etc. Even though I know all that, I just can’t resist eating what I feel like eating, when I see or think about it. As I swing into my thirties, hopefully, I can get more serious with my diet and apply some of the principles herein. "
142,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850999-beth-peninger,5,"Whoa. Each one of us is required to make 200 or more choices about food (and beverage) each day. At least that is what Wansink has discovered in his years of research. He says that number may seem high because we aren't aware of 90% of them! We are mindless when it comes to eating, to food choices, to knowing what we are actually digesting. Wansink spends the length of the book proving that and giving solutions to combat that mindless eating and become more mindful. This isn't a diet or restrictive solution. All it involves is thinking a bit more than normal when it comes to mealtimes. This book is far from dry, Wansink uses interesting research and conducts really fun and interesting studies. His facts and research are fascinating because they prove how powerful thought, or lack thereof, can be. He proposes that if we change three habits and nothing else we would lose up to 30 lbs a year (if we needed to lose weight)! And the science behind mindful and not mindless eating is so incredibly simple that I felt a little dumb listening and realizing how painless it would be to make some changes. Right away I decided to quit getting adult meals at the only fast food place I go to, I'm getting a kid meal and it's plenty. (Plus I get a fun toy!) Next time I'm at a restaurant I'll look over the kids menu and see if there is an adult kind of meal or I will be mindful. It's about being mindful. We can all say we know that but Wansink proves that we know it but we don't know it. This is a great book, such a great resource. For a preview of Wansink's suggestions and resources check out Mindless Eating's website. I highly recommend this book regardless of your size, weight, and ideas about food. "
143,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6227186-elaine,4,"Written in 2006 (and perhaps a bit dated), ""Mindless Eating"" is, first, a book about food psychology and, second, a diet book. The bottom line offers some helpful Heloise-ish tips for food control. But, the fascinating part is the first 2/3 of the book, in which Brian Wansink, a food researcher, tells stories from his life work. Of course, he maligns “foods to die for:” fat, sugar, and salt. He doesn’t blame food manufacturers and restaurants: they are in business to make money, not a conspiracy against the health of Americans. (McDonald’s doesn’t care if you throw ½ your fries away between the pick-up counter and your seat, an idea he recommends.) Most of his truisms are well-known or obvious: we eat more out of bigger bags (he calls it the “warehouse store curse”), we grossly underestimate the calories we eat, we eat more when prolonging a meal with friends (especially if they eat a lot), we will continue to eat mindlessly if we’re eating from a refilling soup bowl (he created such a device, and the subjects did continue to eat and didn’t notice the refilling part). I found the chapter in which he delineates his “soup personalities” to be most intriguing. Which soup do you prefer? Chicken noodle, chili beef, vegetable, New England clam chowder, or tomato? Here is your personality in order: a homebody, the life of the party, the trend-setter, a witty sophisticate, or a sociable affectionate reader. I’m not sure I’m a trend-setter, but of course, I’d choose vegetable. Sometimes humorous, sometimes illuminating, always fascinating, ""Mindless Eating"" was a delightful quick read for me."
144,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,4,"This researcher has a lot of experience in running experiments to see see what influences us in relation to food. Some were run in a specially designed restaurant area. In one, for example, everyone was given a free glass of wine. The bottles were almost identical. The only difference is that half the labels carried the name of a highly reputable wine growing area and the other half mention an an area not known for good wine. At no point was this pointed out to the diners. The wine was the same in each case, as were the meals served to all the diners. The survey afterwards asked diners to rate their experience of both the wine and the meal. The diners who had the supposedly cheap wine gave the wine lower ratings, but I was surprised that they also rated the food and the dining experience lower too. Lesson: people's expectations affect their experience of food.In another experiment, students were offered free food such as ribs whilst watching a football game. They could eat as much as they liked by helping themselves from a buffet. For half the students, the bowls of bones and detritus were removed regularly from the table. For the other half, the bowls were left in place. The second set ate significantly less overall. Lesson: we don't pay attention to how much we are eating and don't stop eating just because we have had enough to eat.We probably all know that we sometimes eat mindlessly, but the author helps explain why that is, and also what to do about it. It's easy to read, with lots of practical examples. I enjoyed listening to this book and will undoubtedly listen to it again from time to time."
145,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,4,"How do we determine how much we eat? Surely it depends on how hungry we are and how tasty the food is, but  Brian Wansink argues that it depends just as much on external cues, like how much is on our plate, the shape of our drinking glasses, how fast other people at the table are eating, and so forth.The best parts of this book are when he describes his experiments: the famous bottomless soup bowl, for example, or the chicken wing Super Bowl party experiment. (In the former he finds that if your bowl surreptitiously refills itself, you will eat far, far more than if it doesn't, because you are relying on the visual cue of how much soup is left in the bowl to tell you to stop eating, and in the latter he finds that if the bones aren't cleared away, they provide a reminder of how much you've eaten, and you'll eat fewer wings than if the bones are continuously removed from your sight.)The weaker parts are when he tries to extend his findings to produce dieting advice. If our mindless eating causes us to eat a few extra calories a day and cause us to gain a few pounds a year without noticing, then theoretically we could change our habits to give ourselves slightly smaller portions, so slight in difference that we don't even notice, and so we can lose a few pounds a year without even noticing the difference. Fair enough, but I could pick that up from reading the experiments, and I thought the diet advice was a bit heavy-handed and repetitive."
146,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,3,"This was a fun read: basically a tour of anecdotes and studies with unexpected insights into how people perceive food portions and what that means for healthy eating. If you like books like Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything then you will dig this; it feels similar to me though the topics and scope are very different. The overall premise here is that simple changes can help you eat healthier over time without really thinking about it. Wansink has come under fire a little in the news recently over research methods, but that doesn't seem particularly relevant to this book. The material is intuitively sensible. The thing that most resonated with me was simply to consider how much you want to eat before you start a meal, otherwise a host of social, marketing, and evolutionary factors will encourage you to eat more than you meant to. I can sum that up in one sentence, but the studies in the book make it stick in your head more than someone just saying it.The introduction was off-putting to me personally. The author spends a while establishing his bonafides, but I would rather make that decision myself based on the content instead of having someone convince me up front. It was fine after the introduction though. "

When you do randomized placebo controlled trials there has to be something in it for everyone. In the case of our studies it was the counseling part. What is most interesting about the author’s approach to mindless eating is the political angle. He presents study after study demonstrating how manipulated we are in the current food environment. Much of the research is conducted by the military (efficiency and economy of food) and the restaurant industry (eat more cheap stuff so you don’t notice that the expensive ingredients are scanty or missing). By the time you’ve completed the book you should be enraged at how the food marketing business has shaped your choices, portions, and the quality of what is available to buy. I personally have never eaten the same since reading this book and it was really helpful for study participants. Example: I consider myself to be pretty educated about healthy eating but, before reading this book, was not at all aware of subtle manipulations such as: By having only big boxes available to use at a salad bar you tend to put in more food than you were planning to eat just so items don’t slide around and fall apart. Subtle but effective, right Whole Foods? Super annoying once you start noticing all the strategies."

This isn't really a diet book, but more of an culmination of behavioral research when it comes to eating. Not only do we drastically underestimate the amount of food decisions we make daily, we underestimate our caloric intake. This little book is chock full of fun food and eating experiments. I thought this book was going to be similar to The End of Overeating but I was wrong. That book is more about the sweet spot of foods that have the perfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that get us hooked. This book is more about food cues and how humans aren't very good at paying attention to them. We can mindlessly overeat, but with some simple strategies, we can also mindlessly cut 200-300 calories without our bodies switching gears into starvation and fat storage mode. This book works better not as a diet book, but as a look into human behavior and the psychology of eating in various environments. Just thinking about these experiments would lead one to eat more mindfully. "

The author summarizes in the 10 chapters the main pain points when it comes to the gain in weight over the long period of time. The most important one is called ""the mindless margin"". This is basically the difference between 2000 calories a day and 2200 calories a day. We are not aware of those calories. It can be an extra bar of Snickers, or a few extra chips, or even upgrading a medium menu to large in a fast food restaurant.Therefore, the author's approach to lose weight in the long term is to reverse the process and instead of eating 200 extra calories a day, just eat 200 less a day by implementing small changes in our daily diet.Most of the ideas in the book are psychological changes, like placing the food further away from us, or creating smaller portions, or eating from a smaller plate and things of this nature. Personally, I think this book given some sound advice when it comes to taking care of your weight and it shows that most kilograms gained in the long run are mostly invisible in the immediate term, but can definitely be seen when we compare the photos we take now to the ones we took when we were younger.All in all, I recommend this to anyone who struggles with weight loss and to anyone who might want to discover more about compulsive eating or habits created due to environmental changes."

I am interested in psychology and this book discusses food psychology along with marketing strategies. It was thought provoking and I found myself reasonating with much of the information. While overall I liked the book, I did find it to be a slow read as I highlighted much of it. Many health books can be strongly against the food and restaurant industry. I did not find this book to be that way. It was a light read that offered support to all sides. I appreciate how the author was able to remain neutral. I like how the author explains how we eat more without being aware of it. He then followed up with ideas on how we can avoid these pitfalls. The tips the author provides are realistic and doable.

165,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14685347-rif-a-saurous,2,"If you don't live under a rock, you're probably familiar with Brian Wansink's work. He does lots of crazy food studies, like demonstrating how people consume more soup if you give them a bowl that's secretly refilling itself from the bottom, or how if you put folks in a dark room and ask them to evaluate your new strawberry yogurt but give them chocolate yogurt instead they'll think it has a good strawberry flavor. The book's kinda all over the place: overlong, poorly written, chock full of irrelevant anecdotes and ""jokes"" and name dropping of the fancy places he's talked or worked [""Ooh! The Max Planck Institute!""], it can't decide whether it's telling you gee-whiz stories, giving you advice, or just explaining why you're going to fail. [It doesn't take a consistent view on whether knowing your own biases leads to any paths to reduce those biases.]I can't really recommend it because it wasn't well written and it wasn't helpful, although if you've never read anything else in this space maybe it would be OK?A few notes from the book:- Expectations matter; people don't believe it. Give people a glass of California wine, they expect it'll be good, they'll think it's good. Give them a glass of North Dakota wine, they expect it'll be bad, they'll think it's bad. Of course it's the same wine with different labels. And of course the people insist that the wine's origin didn't influence their judgement.- One of the book's central concept is ""the mindless margin."" The argument is that (1) it is easy to mindlessly reduce [or increase] your calories by 100 or so / day, and that (2) this will have large effects on your eventual weight because 3500 calories is a pound. (1) is undoubtedly true, but (2) is deeply suspect, because it's very possible your metabolism or changes in NEAT [non-exercise activity thermogenesis] will absorb small calorie surpluses or deficits. The book treats human psychology as complex, but human metabolism as trivial, which is basically just embarrassing and non-scientific.- Plate size makes a huge difference. Seriously consider getting and using smaller plates and serving spoons [the experiment used ice cream scoops]. You anchor off the size of your plate. Plate size has been increasing over time. [Edit: This is assuming you want to consume fewer calories. If you want to consume more calories, get bigger plates. I find consuming more calories trivial and consuming fewer difficult.]- Many of the suggestions in the book are weak because you operate in an unfriendly environment: the restaurant doesn't care how fat you are; if you're willing to not to eat in restaurants, you have a lot of tools at your disposal but that's drastic for most of us. Worse, one of the suggestions is to prime yourself to eat good foods: they did an experiment where they asked one group to do a detailed recollection of the last time they eat soup [a healthy food], and reported that this group ""anticipated they would eat more than twice as much soup in the next month as the non-primed group"". BUT THEY DID NOT MEASURE HOW MUCH SOUP THEY ACTUALLY ATE! - At one point the book puts ""pizza"" in a list of relatively healthy foods. Good to know.- I guess I don't want to read any book that tells me about a hot new idea called ""evolutionary psychology."" Way to show off your middlebrow.-Naming on menus is important. Which of these menus do you want to order from?

167,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,4,"""The best diet is the one you don't know you're on.""Wansink is a Ph.D. who has run food labs at different universities and independently. His book is a friendly, rather chatty account of his findings, which include:* Your stomach can't count. It doesn't know how many spoonfuls of soup (or whatever) you had, so it will encourage you to keep eating until the plate is clean, the bag or box is empty, or the TV show is over. That's evolution, baby.* It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach let your brain know that you are full. (OK, I knew that one already.)* Here's where it gets interesting: If you cut calorie intake drastically, your body will reduce your metabolism, and you will feel hungry most of the time. If you cut calorie intake by 100-300 calories per day, your body will not notice the difference . . . but you may be able to lose 30 pounds in a year. Even if you don't, you'll at least stop gaining. It is possible to do this calorie cutting through exercise, but through diet is easier for most people.Some ways to cut those 100-300 daily calories:- Eat slowly. People eat faster/more if others around them eat faster/more. Try to find the slowest eater at the table and pace yourself with him/her.- Put down your fork after every bite.- When you are eating, just eat. No reading, no TV watching, no computer using. It's OK to talk or listen to music if you are with others, but try to make it slow-tempo music or you'll all eat faster.- Be aware that you will eat more when dining with others, mostly because you will be at the table for a longer time. If you are dining with several others, you will likely eat a lot more.- Don't serve food family style (in serving dishes on the table) unless it's vegetables.- Use smaller plates and tall, skinny glasses. Your brain doesn't know the difference. - Eat fruit for dessert.- If you're going to have a high-calorie dessert, try to split it with others. The best part of dessert is the first two bites.- If you must eat in front of the TV, decide in advance how much you want and put that in a plate or bowl. No eating out of a multiple-serving bag or box.- If you bulk-buy snacks, repackage them into smaller containers or bags.- Nutritious foods go where you can see them: on the counter or on a front shelf in a clear container. Non-nutritious foods, if you must buy them, go on the backs of the shelves in opaque containers.Here are the tips that I thought were too extreme for me:• Eat in only one room of your house--the kitchen or dining room.• Don't set foot in the kitchen unless it's mealtime. If you have to, enter the house a different way so you don't snack immediately after work.• Before you eat something that is bad for you, say out loud, ""I'm not actually hungry, but I'm going to eat this anyway."""
168,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26295-gina,4,"I liked this book. The studies & results published here help to change the way we think about the next meal. We are susceptible to so many hidden persuaders: large plates, shorter-wider glasses, things that say ""low fat"" ""low calorie"", lighting, music, childhood habits, stress, mood! After reading this I will ""see"" and make more aware, enjoyably and healthy eating choices. "

170,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10864046-kara,4,"The book is chock-full of observations, counter-intuitive at first but turn out to be more of common sense than originally thought. Instead of dictating what may constitute as the healthiest eating habits and willing the readers to follow the tall order, Brian Wansink attempts to explain the psychological aspects behind why we eat what we eat the way we eat. I am yet to go nuts about poring over the ingredient labels but I am intrigued by the idea of re-engineering my gourmet lifestyle and seeing how it pans out. Not that I'm going to cover all bases but I'll consider it a feat if I can just stick with some of these mindless/mindful tricks that I find most relevant to myself:1. Re-write the scripts and re-wire the comfort food - My top 2 activities that always seems more appealing when pairing with eating - watching TV shows and reading. Meanwhile, winter is coming.2. Take a good look at what I eat and make sure I see them ALL before and while eating - I'll appreciate the food more and be conscious of my intake at the same time. Pretty boys, my apology in advance if I can't give you my undivided attention.3. Evaluate if I can eventually realise all the savings on bulk purchase - Apart from a tendency to gorge things down faster than normal pace, I may end up throwing them away upon expiry. 4. Hara hachi bun me - Eat until I am eight parts (out of ten) full. I've always been such a big nagger if I eat too much.5. Don't be fooled by labels - I am a sucker for packaging and beautiful wordings. Ergo, my palates can already be biased before even tasting the dish. 6. Be transparent or opaque depending on the food situation - Out of sight is out of mind.7. Inconvenience is bliss - I don't need to make fire hoops as long as I can embrace the lazy self (though I still very much fancy at the idea of bracing myself against the wind while it is 4 degree outside for a good walk to Sobeys)8. Do not go for grocery shopping if I'm hungry - This will save me from all the impulse buying and food fantasizing."
171,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13316740-alex-timberman,4,"The author, Brian Wansink, is an expert in his field. He is a professor at Cornell University in the Marketing and Nutritional Science department, or something of that sort. His expertise is on the interdisciplinary relationship of marketing, nutritional science, and economics. If you read some books on behavioral economics like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman or Nudge by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, you will quickly get the psychology behind this book. The question he tries to answer is why we eat so much and what we can do about it. Obviously, this is a big problem in America with our super-sized portions and processed meals. Because he runs a food laboratory with a large research budget, his team has been able to conduct numerous experiments on why we can’t control our eating. The gist is that we all have a lot of biases and holes in our thinking that prevent us from knowing how much we are eating, when to stop eating, and on why we are eating. Because our behavior runs on autopilot, a good way to correct our bad eating habits is to set up a system so that we control our eating on autopilot. He suggests we can do that by cutting our calorie intake by a slight percentage, a percentage so small that our brains and bodies won’t be able to know the difference from our current eating habits, but a difference important enough in that over time it will lead to a significant change in our consumption. So I learned some things: follow the eating speed of the slowest eater at the dinner table to let my brain catch up with my consumption, use smaller dishes and plates because it will help me to consume less food, and etc. Even though I know all that, I just can’t resist eating what I feel like eating, when I see or think about it. As I swing into my thirties, hopefully, I can get more serious with my diet and apply some of the principles herein. "
172,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850999-beth-peninger,5,"Whoa. Each one of us is required to make 200 or more choices about food (and beverage) each day. At least that is what Wansink has discovered in his years of research. He says that number may seem high because we aren't aware of 90% of them! We are mindless when it comes to eating, to food choices, to knowing what we are actually digesting. Wansink spends the length of the book proving that and giving solutions to combat that mindless eating and become more mindful. This isn't a diet or restrictive solution. All it involves is thinking a bit more than normal when it comes to mealtimes. This book is far from dry, Wansink uses interesting research and conducts really fun and interesting studies. His facts and research are fascinating because they prove how powerful thought, or lack thereof, can be. He proposes that if we change three habits and nothing else we would lose up to 30 lbs a year (if we needed to lose weight)! And the science behind mindful and not mindless eating is so incredibly simple that I felt a little dumb listening and realizing how painless it would be to make some changes. Right away I decided to quit getting adult meals at the only fast food place I go to, I'm getting a kid meal and it's plenty. (Plus I get a fun toy!) Next time I'm at a restaurant I'll look over the kids menu and see if there is an adult kind of meal or I will be mindful. It's about being mindful. We can all say we know that but Wansink proves that we know it but we don't know it. This is a great book, such a great resource. For a preview of Wansink's suggestions and resources check out Mindless Eating's website. I highly recommend this book regardless of your size, weight, and ideas about food. "
173,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6227186-elaine,4,"Written in 2006 (and perhaps a bit dated), ""Mindless Eating"" is, first, a book about food psychology and, second, a diet book. The bottom line offers some helpful Heloise-ish tips for food control. But, the fascinating part is the first 2/3 of the book, in which Brian Wansink, a food researcher, tells stories from his life work. Of course, he maligns “foods to die for:” fat, sugar, and salt. He doesn’t blame food manufacturers and restaurants: they are in business to make money, not a conspiracy against the health of Americans. (McDonald’s doesn’t care if you throw ½ your fries away between the pick-up counter and your seat, an idea he recommends.) Most of his truisms are well-known or obvious: we eat more out of bigger bags (he calls it the “warehouse store curse”), we grossly underestimate the calories we eat, we eat more when prolonging a meal with friends (especially if they eat a lot), we will continue to eat mindlessly if we’re eating from a refilling soup bowl (he created such a device, and the subjects did continue to eat and didn’t notice the refilling part). I found the chapter in which he delineates his “soup personalities” to be most intriguing. Which soup do you prefer? Chicken noodle, chili beef, vegetable, New England clam chowder, or tomato? Here is your personality in order: a homebody, the life of the party, the trend-setter, a witty sophisticate, or a sociable affectionate reader. I’m not sure I’m a trend-setter, but of course, I’d choose vegetable. Sometimes humorous, sometimes illuminating, always fascinating, ""Mindless Eating"" was a delightful quick read for me."
174,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,4,"This researcher has a lot of experience in running experiments to see see what influences us in relation to food. Some were run in a specially designed restaurant area. In one, for example, everyone was given a free glass of wine. The bottles were almost identical. The only difference is that half the labels carried the name of a highly reputable wine growing area and the other half mention an an area not known for good wine. At no point was this pointed out to the diners. The wine was the same in each case, as were the meals served to all the diners. The survey afterwards asked diners to rate their experience of both the wine and the meal. The diners who had the supposedly cheap wine gave the wine lower ratings, but I was surprised that they also rated the food and the dining experience lower too. Lesson: people's expectations affect their experience of food.In another experiment, students were offered free food such as ribs whilst watching a football game. They could eat as much as they liked by helping themselves from a buffet. For half the students, the bowls of bones and detritus were removed regularly from the table. For the other half, the bowls were left in place. The second set ate significantly less overall. Lesson: we don't pay attention to how much we are eating and don't stop eating just because we have had enough to eat.We probably all know that we sometimes eat mindlessly, but the author helps explain why that is, and also what to do about it. It's easy to read, with lots of practical examples. I enjoyed listening to this book and will undoubtedly listen to it again from time to time."
175,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,4,"How do we determine how much we eat? Surely it depends on how hungry we are and how tasty the food is, but  Brian Wansink argues that it depends just as much on external cues, like how much is on our plate, the shape of our drinking glasses, how fast other people at the table are eating, and so forth.The best parts of this book are when he describes his experiments: the famous bottomless soup bowl, for example, or the chicken wing Super Bowl party experiment. (In the former he finds that if your bowl surreptitiously refills itself, you will eat far, far more than if it doesn't, because you are relying on the visual cue of how much soup is left in the bowl to tell you to stop eating, and in the latter he finds that if the bones aren't cleared away, they provide a reminder of how much you've eaten, and you'll eat fewer wings than if the bones are continuously removed from your sight.)The weaker parts are when he tries to extend his findings to produce dieting advice. If our mindless eating causes us to eat a few extra calories a day and cause us to gain a few pounds a year without noticing, then theoretically we could change our habits to give ourselves slightly smaller portions, so slight in difference that we don't even notice, and so we can lose a few pounds a year without even noticing the difference. Fair enough, but I could pick that up from reading the experiments, and I thought the diet advice was a bit heavy-handed and repetitive."
176,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,3,"This was a fun read: basically a tour of anecdotes and studies with unexpected insights into how people perceive food portions and what that means for healthy eating. If you like books like Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything then you will dig this; it feels similar to me though the topics and scope are very different. The overall premise here is that simple changes can help you eat healthier over time without really thinking about it. Wansink has come under fire a little in the news recently over research methods, but that doesn't seem particularly relevant to this book. The material is intuitively sensible. The thing that most resonated with me was simply to consider how much you want to eat before you start a meal, otherwise a host of social, marketing, and evolutionary factors will encourage you to eat more than you meant to. I can sum that up in one sentence, but the studies in the book make it stick in your head more than someone just saying it.The introduction was off-putting to me personally. The author spends a while establishing his bonafides, but I would rather make that decision myself based on the content instead of having someone convince me up front. It was fine after the introduction though. "
177,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32021539-holly-b,5,"I ran clinical trials for a couple of drugs being developed for obesity and used this book as a teaching tool. When you do randomized placebo controlled trials there has to be something in it for everyone. In the case of our studies it was the counseling part. What is most interesting about the author’s approach to mindless eating is the political angle. He presents study after study demonstrating how manipulated we are in the current food environment. Much of the research is conducted by the military (efficiency and economy of food) and the restaurant industry (eat more cheap stuff so you don’t notice that the expensive ingredients are scanty or missing). By the time you’ve completed the book you should be enraged at how the food marketing business has shaped your choices, portions, and the quality of what is available to buy. I personally have never eaten the same since reading this book and it was really helpful for study participants. Example: I consider myself to be pretty educated about healthy eating but, before reading this book, was not at all aware of subtle manipulations such as: By having only big boxes available to use at a salad bar you tend to put in more food than you were planning to eat just so items don’t slide around and fall apart. Subtle but effective, right Whole Foods? Super annoying once you start noticing all the strategies."

If you deprive yourself of everything, you'll give up at some point.- You can't trust your stomach, it can't count and it only feels full because of external cues.- See it BEFORE and WHILE you eat it: if you're doing other things, and you've not carefully chosen a portion, you'll end op eating everything- Optical illusion: buy smaller plates- Variety makes us eat more, don't offer a wide variety: at a buffet, only take two different things each time- Convenience wins every time: keep things that tempt you far away and you're so much less likely to eat things that are bad for you: make overeating a hassle- Be the last one to get your food and the last one to finish your meal, try to follow the pace of whoever is at your table- Serve yourself BEFORE you start- Brand-name psychosis- Think small or share- Choose one step, DON'T IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME"

This isn't really a diet book, but more of an culmination of behavioral research when it comes to eating. Not only do we drastically underestimate the amount of food decisions we make daily, we underestimate our caloric intake. This little book is chock full of fun food and eating experiments. I thought this book was going to be similar to The End of Overeating but I was wrong. That book is more about the sweet spot of foods that have the perfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that get us hooked. This book is more about food cues and how humans aren't very good at paying attention to them. We can mindlessly overeat, but with some simple strategies, we can also mindlessly cut 200-300 calories without our bodies switching gears into starvation and fat storage mode. This book works better not as a diet book, but as a look into human behavior and the psychology of eating in various environments. Just thinking about these experiments would lead one to eat more mindfully. "

The author summarizes in the 10 chapters the main pain points when it comes to the gain in weight over the long period of time. The most important one is called ""the mindless margin"". This is basically the difference between 2000 calories a day and 2200 calories a day. We are not aware of those calories. It can be an extra bar of Snickers, or a few extra chips, or even upgrading a medium menu to large in a fast food restaurant.Therefore, the author's approach to lose weight in the long term is to reverse the process and instead of eating 200 extra calories a day, just eat 200 less a day by implementing small changes in our daily diet.Most of the ideas in the book are psychological changes, like placing the food further away from us, or creating smaller portions, or eating from a smaller plate and things of this nature. Personally, I think this book given some sound advice when it comes to taking care of your weight and it shows that most kilograms gained in the long run are mostly invisible in the immediate term, but can definitely be seen when we compare the photos we take now to the ones we took when we were younger.All in all, I recommend this to anyone who struggles with weight loss and to anyone who might want to discover more about compulsive eating or habits created due to environmental changes."
181,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4143583-bojana-duke,4,"Top takeaways:- most diets fail spectacularly because they rely on deprivation for quick results- alternately, small changes add up over time- take advantage of psychological quirks to adjust your patterns so you don't even notice a reduction in food- pick a single goal and three things you will work on per month towards the goal. track how you do each day for accountability. move on when it becomes mindless habit- some tips:* reduce default portion sizes by 20%* see all the food you plan on eating before you start (i.e. no eating straight from larger containers, multiple servings, etc.)* use smaller dishes to make portions look larger* decrease convenience of snacking* reduce distractions while eating (no TV, reading, etc.)* improve associations with healthier foods (describe them enticingly, eat them during happy times)* be a gatekeeper in the household to establish healthy habits for everyone (control what is getting bought, cooked, etc.)"

I am interested in psychology and this book discusses food psychology along with marketing strategies. It was thought provoking and I found myself reasonating with much of the information. While overall I liked the book, I did find it to be a slow read as I highlighted much of it. Many health books can be strongly against the food and restaurant industry. I did not find this book to be that way. It was a light read that offered support to all sides. I appreciate how the author was able to remain neutral. I like how the author explains how we eat more without being aware of it. He then followed up with ideas on how we can avoid these pitfalls. The tips the author provides are realistic and doable.

195,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14685347-rif-a-saurous,2,"If you don't live under a rock, you're probably familiar with Brian Wansink's work. He does lots of crazy food studies, like demonstrating how people consume more soup if you give them a bowl that's secretly refilling itself from the bottom, or how if you put folks in a dark room and ask them to evaluate your new strawberry yogurt but give them chocolate yogurt instead they'll think it has a good strawberry flavor. The book's kinda all over the place: overlong, poorly written, chock full of irrelevant anecdotes and ""jokes"" and name dropping of the fancy places he's talked or worked [""Ooh! The Max Planck Institute!""], it can't decide whether it's telling you gee-whiz stories, giving you advice, or just explaining why you're going to fail. [It doesn't take a consistent view on whether knowing your own biases leads to any paths to reduce those biases.]I can't really recommend it because it wasn't well written and it wasn't helpful, although if you've never read anything else in this space maybe it would be OK?A few notes from the book:- Expectations matter; people don't believe it. Give people a glass of California wine, they expect it'll be good, they'll think it's good. Give them a glass of North Dakota wine, they expect it'll be bad, they'll think it's bad. Of course it's the same wine with different labels. And of course the people insist that the wine's origin didn't influence their judgement.- One of the book's central concept is ""the mindless margin."" The argument is that (1) it is easy to mindlessly reduce [or increase] your calories by 100 or so / day, and that (2) this will have large effects on your eventual weight because 3500 calories is a pound. (1) is undoubtedly true, but (2) is deeply suspect, because it's very possible your metabolism or changes in NEAT [non-exercise activity thermogenesis] will absorb small calorie surpluses or deficits. The book treats human psychology as complex, but human metabolism as trivial, which is basically just embarrassing and non-scientific.- Plate size makes a huge difference. Seriously consider getting and using smaller plates and serving spoons [the experiment used ice cream scoops]. You anchor off the size of your plate. Plate size has been increasing over time. [Edit: This is assuming you want to consume fewer calories. If you want to consume more calories, get bigger plates. I find consuming more calories trivial and consuming fewer difficult.]- Many of the suggestions in the book are weak because you operate in an unfriendly environment: the restaurant doesn't care how fat you are; if you're willing to not to eat in restaurants, you have a lot of tools at your disposal but that's drastic for most of us. Worse, one of the suggestions is to prime yourself to eat good foods: they did an experiment where they asked one group to do a detailed recollection of the last time they eat soup [a healthy food], and reported that this group ""anticipated they would eat more than twice as much soup in the next month as the non-primed group"". BUT THEY DID NOT MEASURE HOW MUCH SOUP THEY ACTUALLY ATE! - At one point the book puts ""pizza"" in a list of relatively healthy foods. Good to know.- I guess I don't want to read any book that tells me about a hot new idea called ""evolutionary psychology."" Way to show off your middlebrow.-Naming on menus is important. Which of these menus do you want to order from? ""Red beans with rice / seafood filet / grilled chicken / chicken parmesan / chocolate pudding / zucchini cookies"" or ""Traditional cajun red beans with rice / succulent italian seafood filet / tender grilled chicken / home-style chicken parmesan / satin chocolate pudding / grandma's zucchini cookies."" The food's the same. This totally works. I cannot want the first menu.I guess this book made me grumpy. I do want to be more mindful in my food consumption, but this book did not help much."

His book is a friendly, rather chatty account of his findings, which include:* Your stomach can't count. It doesn't know how many spoonfuls of soup (or whatever) you had, so it will encourage you to keep eating until the plate is clean, the bag or box is empty, or the TV show is over. That's evolution, baby.* It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach let your brain know that you are full. (OK, I knew that one already.)* Here's where it gets interesting: If you cut calorie intake drastically, your body will reduce your metabolism, and you will feel hungry most of the time. If you cut calorie intake by 100-300 calories per day, your body will not notice the difference . . . but you may be able to lose 30 pounds in a year. Even if you don't, you'll at least stop gaining. It is possible to do this calorie cutting through exercise, but through diet is easier for most people.Some ways to cut those 100-300 daily calories:- Eat slowly. People eat faster/more if others around them eat faster/more. Try to find the slowest eater at the table and pace yourself with him/her.- Put down your fork after every bite.- When you are eating, just eat. No reading, no TV watching, no computer using. It's OK to talk or listen to music if you are with others, but try to make it slow-tempo music or you'll all eat faster.- Be aware that you will eat more when dining with others, mostly because you will be at the table for a longer time. If you are dining with several others, you will likely eat a lot more.- Don't serve food family style (in serving dishes on the table) unless it's vegetables.- Use smaller plates and tall, skinny glasses. Your brain doesn't know the difference. - Eat fruit for dessert.- If you're going to have a high-calorie dessert, try to split it with others. The best part of dessert is the first two bites.- If you must eat in front of the TV, decide in advance how much you want and put that in a plate or bowl. No eating out of a multiple-serving bag or box.- If you bulk-buy snacks, repackage them into smaller containers or bags.- Nutritious foods go where you can see them: on the counter or on a front shelf in a clear container. Non-nutritious foods, if you must buy them, go on the backs of the shelves in opaque containers.Here are the tips that I thought were too extreme for me:• Eat in only one room of your house--the kitchen or dining room.• Don't set foot in the kitchen unless it's mealtime. If you have to, enter the house a different way so you don't snack immediately after work.• Before you eat something that is bad for you, say out loud, ""I'm not actually hungry, but I'm going to eat this anyway."""

200,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10864046-kara,4,"The book is chock-full of observations, counter-intuitive at first but turn out to be more of common sense than originally thought. Instead of dictating what may constitute as the healthiest eating habits and willing the readers to follow the tall order, Brian Wansink attempts to explain the psychological aspects behind why we eat what we eat the way we eat. I am yet to go nuts about poring over the ingredient labels but I am intrigued by the idea of re-engineering my gourmet lifestyle and seeing how it pans out. Not that I'm going to cover all bases but I'll consider it a feat if I can just stick with some of these mindless/mindful tricks that I find most relevant to myself:1. Re-write the scripts and re-wire the comfort food - My top 2 activities that always seems more appealing when pairing with eating - watching TV shows and reading. Meanwhile, winter is coming.2. Take a good look at what I eat and make sure I see them ALL before and while eating - I'll appreciate the food more and be conscious of my intake at the same time. Pretty boys, my apology in advance if I can't give you my undivided attention.3. Evaluate if I can eventually realise all the savings on bulk purchase - Apart from a tendency to gorge things down faster than normal pace, I may end up throwing them away upon expiry. 4. Hara hachi bun me - Eat until I am eight parts (out of ten) full. I've always been such a big nagger if I eat too much.5. Don't be fooled by labels - I am a sucker for packaging and beautiful wordings. Ergo, my palates can already be biased before even tasting the dish. 6. Be transparent or opaque depending on the food situation - Out of sight is out of mind.7. Inconvenience is bliss - I don't need to make fire hoops as long as I can embrace the lazy self (though I still very much fancy at the idea of bracing myself against the wind while it is 4 degree outside for a good walk to Sobeys)8. Do not go for grocery shopping if I'm hungry - This will save me from all the impulse buying and food fantasizing."
201,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13316740-alex-timberman,4,"The author, Brian Wansink, is an expert in his field. He is a professor at Cornell University in the Marketing and Nutritional Science department, or something of that sort. His expertise is on the interdisciplinary relationship of marketing, nutritional science, and economics. If you read some books on behavioral economics like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman or Nudge by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, you will quickly get the psychology behind this book. The question he tries to answer is why we eat so much and what we can do about it. Obviously, this is a big problem in America with our super-sized portions and processed meals. Because he runs a food laboratory with a large research budget, his team has been able to conduct numerous experiments on why we can’t control our eating. The gist is that we all have a lot of biases and holes in our thinking that prevent us from knowing how much we are eating, when to stop eating, and on why we are eating. Because our behavior runs on autopilot, a good way to correct our bad eating habits is to set up a system so that we control our eating on autopilot. He suggests we can do that by cutting our calorie intake by a slight percentage, a percentage so small that our brains and bodies won’t be able to know the difference from our current eating habits, but a difference important enough in that over time it will lead to a significant change in our consumption. So I learned some things: follow the eating speed of the slowest eater at the dinner table to let my brain catch up with my consumption, use smaller dishes and plates because it will help me to consume less food, and etc. Even though I know all that, I just can’t resist eating what I feel like eating, when I see or think about it. As I swing into my thirties, hopefully, I can get more serious with my diet and apply some of the principles herein. "
202,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850999-beth-peninger,5,"Whoa. Each one of us is required to make 200 or more choices about food (and beverage) each day. At least that is what Wansink has discovered in his years of research. He says that number may seem high because we aren't aware of 90% of them! We are mindless when it comes to eating, to food choices, to knowing what we are actually digesting. Wansink spends the length of the book proving that and giving solutions to combat that mindless eating and become more mindful. This isn't a diet or restrictive solution. All it involves is thinking a bit more than normal when it comes to mealtimes. This book is far from dry, Wansink uses interesting research and conducts really fun and interesting studies. His facts and research are fascinating because they prove how powerful thought, or lack thereof, can be. He proposes that if we change three habits and nothing else we would lose up to 30 lbs a year (if we needed to lose weight)! And the science behind mindful and not mindless eating is so incredibly simple that I felt a little dumb listening and realizing how painless it would be to make some changes. Right away I decided to quit getting adult meals at the only fast food place I go to, I'm getting a kid meal and it's plenty. (Plus I get a fun toy!) Next time I'm at a restaurant I'll look over the kids menu and see if there is an adult kind of meal or I will be mindful. It's about being mindful. We can all say we know that but Wansink proves that we know it but we don't know it. This is a great book, such a great resource. For a preview of Wansink's suggestions and resources check out Mindless Eating's website. I highly recommend this book regardless of your size, weight, and ideas about food. "
203,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6227186-elaine,4,"Written in 2006 (and perhaps a bit dated), ""Mindless Eating"" is, first, a book about food psychology and, second, a diet book. The bottom line offers some helpful Heloise-ish tips for food control. But, the fascinating part is the first 2/3 of the book, in which Brian Wansink, a food researcher, tells stories from his life work. Of course, he maligns “foods to die for:” fat, sugar, and salt. He doesn’t blame food manufacturers and restaurants: they are in business to make money, not a conspiracy against the health of Americans. (McDonald’s doesn’t care if you throw ½ your fries away between the pick-up counter and your seat, an idea he recommends.) Most of his truisms are well-known or obvious: we eat more out of bigger bags (he calls it the “warehouse store curse”), we grossly underestimate the calories we eat, we eat more when prolonging a meal with friends (especially if they eat a lot), we will continue to eat mindlessly if we’re eating from a refilling soup bowl (he created such a device, and the subjects did continue to eat and didn’t notice the refilling part). I found the chapter in which he delineates his “soup personalities” to be most intriguing. Which soup do you prefer? Chicken noodle, chili beef, vegetable, New England clam chowder, or tomato? Here is your personality in order: a homebody, the life of the party, the trend-setter, a witty sophisticate, or a sociable affectionate reader. I’m not sure I’m a trend-setter, but of course, I’d choose vegetable. Sometimes humorous, sometimes illuminating, always fascinating, ""Mindless Eating"" was a delightful quick read for me."
204,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,4,"This researcher has a lot of experience in running experiments to see see what influences us in relation to food. Some were run in a specially designed restaurant area. In one, for example, everyone was given a free glass of wine. The bottles were almost identical. The only difference is that half the labels carried the name of a highly reputable wine growing area and the other half mention an an area not known for good wine. At no point was this pointed out to the diners. The wine was the same in each case, as were the meals served to all the diners. The survey afterwards asked diners to rate their experience of both the wine and the meal. The diners who had the supposedly cheap wine gave the wine lower ratings, but I was surprised that they also rated the food and the dining experience lower too. Lesson: people's expectations affect their experience of food.In another experiment, students were offered free food such as ribs whilst watching a football game. They could eat as much as they liked by helping themselves from a buffet. For half the students, the bowls of bones and detritus were removed regularly from the table. For the other half, the bowls were left in place. The second set ate significantly less overall. Lesson: we don't pay attention to how much we are eating and don't stop eating just because we have had enough to eat.We probably all know that we sometimes eat mindlessly, but the author helps explain why that is, and also what to do about it. It's easy to read, with lots of practical examples. I enjoyed listening to this book and will undoubtedly listen to it again from time to time."
205,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,4,"How do we determine how much we eat? Surely it depends on how hungry we are and how tasty the food is, but  Brian Wansink argues that it depends just as much on external cues, like how much is on our plate, the shape of our drinking glasses, how fast other people at the table are eating, and so forth.The best parts of this book are when he describes his experiments: the famous bottomless soup bowl, for example, or the chicken wing Super Bowl party experiment. (In the former he finds that if your bowl surreptitiously refills itself, you will eat far, far more than if it doesn't, because you are relying on the visual cue of how much soup is left in the bowl to tell you to stop eating, and in the latter he finds that if the bones aren't cleared away, they provide a reminder of how much you've eaten, and you'll eat fewer wings than if the bones are continuously removed from your sight.)The weaker parts are when he tries to extend his findings to produce dieting advice. If our mindless eating causes us to eat a few extra calories a day and cause us to gain a few pounds a year without noticing, then theoretically we could change our habits to give ourselves slightly smaller portions, so slight in difference that we don't even notice, and so we can lose a few pounds a year without even noticing the difference. Fair enough, but I could pick that up from reading the experiments, and I thought the diet advice was a bit heavy-handed and repetitive."
206,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,3,"This was a fun read: basically a tour of anecdotes and studies with unexpected insights into how people perceive food portions and what that means for healthy eating. If you like books like Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything then you will dig this; it feels similar to me though the topics and scope are very different. The overall premise here is that simple changes can help you eat healthier over time without really thinking about it. Wansink has come under fire a little in the news recently over research methods, but that doesn't seem particularly relevant to this book. The material is intuitively sensible. The thing that most resonated with me was simply to consider how much you want to eat before you start a meal, otherwise a host of social, marketing, and evolutionary factors will encourage you to eat more than you meant to. I can sum that up in one sentence, but the studies in the book make it stick in your head more than someone just saying it.The introduction was off-putting to me personally. The author spends a while establishing his bonafides, but I would rather make that decision myself based on the content instead of having someone convince me up front. It was fine after the introduction though. "
207,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32021539-holly-b,5,"I ran clinical trials for a couple of drugs being developed for obesity and used this book as a teaching tool. When you do randomized placebo controlled trials there has to be something in it for everyone. In the case of our studies it was the counseling part. What is most interesting about the author’s approach to mindless eating is the political angle. He presents study after study demonstrating how manipulated we are in the current food environment. Much of the research is conducted by the military (efficiency and economy of food) and the restaurant industry (eat more cheap stuff so you don’t notice that the expensive ingredients are scanty or missing). By the time you’ve completed the book you should be enraged at how the food marketing business has shaped your choices, portions, and the quality of what is available to buy. I personally have never eaten the same since reading this book and it was really helpful for study participants. Example: I consider myself to be pretty educated about healthy eating but, before reading this book, was not at all aware of subtle manipulations such as: By having only big boxes available to use at a salad bar you tend to put in more food than you were planning to eat just so items don’t slide around and fall apart. Subtle but effective, right Whole Foods? Super annoying once you start noticing all the strategies."

If you deprive yourself of everything, you'll give up at some point.- You can't trust your stomach, it can't count and it only feels full because of external cues.- See it BEFORE and WHILE you eat it: if you're doing other things, and you've not carefully chosen a portion, you'll end op eating everything- Optical illusion: buy smaller plates- Variety makes us eat more, don't offer a wide variety: at a buffet, only take two different things each time- Convenience wins every time: keep things that tempt you far away and you're so much less likely to eat things that are bad for you: make overeating a hassle- Be the last one to get your food and the last one to finish your meal, try to follow the pace of whoever is at your table- Serve yourself BEFORE you start- Brand-name psychosis- Think small or share- Choose one step, DON'T IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME"

This isn't really a diet book, but more of an culmination of behavioral research when it comes to eating. Not only do we drastically underestimate the amount of food decisions we make daily, we underestimate our caloric intake. This little book is chock full of fun food and eating experiments. I thought this book was going to be similar to The End of Overeating but I was wrong. That book is more about the sweet spot of foods that have the perfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that get us hooked. This book is more about food cues and how humans aren't very good at paying attention to them. We can mindlessly overeat, but with some simple strategies, we can also mindlessly cut 200-300 calories without our bodies switching gears into starvation and fat storage mode. This book works better not as a diet book, but as a look into human behavior and the psychology of eating in various environments. Just thinking about these experiments would lead one to eat more mindfully. "

The author summarizes in the 10 chapters the main pain points when it comes to the gain in weight over the long period of time. The most important one is called ""the mindless margin"". This is basically the difference between 2000 calories a day and 2200 calories a day. We are not aware of those calories. It can be an extra bar of Snickers, or a few extra chips, or even upgrading a medium menu to large in a fast food restaurant.Therefore, the author's approach to lose weight in the long term is to reverse the process and instead of eating 200 extra calories a day, just eat 200 less a day by implementing small changes in our daily diet.Most of the ideas in the book are psychological changes, like placing the food further away from us, or creating smaller portions, or eating from a smaller plate and things of this nature. Personally, I think this book given some sound advice when it comes to taking care of your weight and it shows that most kilograms gained in the long run are mostly invisible in the immediate term, but can definitely be seen when we compare the photos we take now to the ones we took when we were younger.All in all, I recommend this to anyone who struggles with weight loss and to anyone who might want to discover more about compulsive eating or habits created due to environmental changes."
211,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4143583-bojana-duke,4,"Top takeaways:- most diets fail spectacularly because they rely on deprivation for quick results- alternately, small changes add up over time- take advantage of psychological quirks to adjust your patterns so you don't even notice a reduction in food- pick a single goal and three things you will work on per month towards the goal. track how you do each day for accountability. move on when it becomes mindless habit- some tips:* reduce default portion sizes by 20%* see all the food you plan on eating before you start (i.e. no eating straight from larger containers, multiple servings, etc.)* use smaller dishes to make portions look larger* decrease convenience of snacking* reduce distractions while eating (no TV, reading, etc.)* improve associations with healthier foods (describe them enticingly, eat them during happy times)* be a gatekeeper in the household to establish healthy habits for everyone (control what is getting bought, cooked, etc.)"

I am interested in psychology and this book discusses food psychology along with marketing strategies. It was thought provoking and I found myself reasonating with much of the information. While overall I liked the book, I did find it to be a slow read as I highlighted much of it. Many health books can be strongly against the food and restaurant industry. I did not find this book to be that way. It was a light read that offered support to all sides. I appreciate how the author was able to remain neutral. I like how the author explains how we eat more without being aware of it. He then followed up with ideas on how we can avoid these pitfalls. The tips the author provides are realistic and doable.

There are also many actions he suggests that we can take to make little changes that will help us manage our weight over time.This is not a quick fix, but a book of information and tips that you can implement over time to make positive changes to our eating habits.The audiobook was read by the author, Brian Wansink, which I like, and the production quality is very good."

You can’t just eat French fries all day long and expect to be healthy. You might lose weight if you’re taking in less calories than you need, but I promise your body still hates you. "

He does lots of crazy food studies, like demonstrating how people consume more soup if you give them a bowl that's secretly refilling itself from the bottom, or how if you put folks in a dark room and ask them to evaluate your new strawberry yogurt but give them chocolate yogurt instead they'll think it has a good strawberry flavor. The book's kinda all over the place: overlong, poorly written, chock full of irrelevant anecdotes and ""jokes"" and name dropping of the fancy places he's talked or worked [""Ooh! The Max Planck Institute!""], it can't decide whether it's telling you gee-whiz stories, giving you advice, or just explaining why you're going to fail. [It doesn't take a consistent view on whether knowing your own biases leads to any paths to reduce those biases.]I can't really recommend it because it wasn't well written and it wasn't helpful, although if you've never read anything else in this space maybe it would be OK?A few notes from the book:- Expectations matter; people don't believe it. Give people a glass of California wine, they expect it'll be good, they'll think it's good. Give them a glass of North Dakota wine, they expect it'll be bad, they'll think it's bad. Of course it's the same wine with different labels. And of course the people insist that the wine's origin didn't influence their judgement.- One of the book's central concept is ""the mindless margin."" The argument is that (1) it is easy to mindlessly reduce [or increase] your calories by 100 or so / day, and that (2) this will have large effects on your eventual weight because 3500 calories is a pound. (1) is undoubtedly true, but (2) is deeply suspect, because it's very possible your metabolism or changes in NEAT [non-exercise activity thermogenesis] will absorb small calorie surpluses or deficits. The book treats human psychology as complex, but human metabolism as trivial, which is basically just embarrassing and non-scientific.- Plate size makes a huge difference. Seriously consider getting and using smaller plates and serving spoons [the experiment used ice cream scoops]. You anchor off the size of your plate. Plate size has been increasing over time. [Edit: This is assuming you want to consume fewer calories. If you want to consume more calories, get bigger plates. I find consuming more calories trivial and consuming fewer difficult.]- Many of the suggestions in the book are weak because you operate in an unfriendly environment: the restaurant doesn't care how fat you are; if you're willing to not to eat in restaurants, you have a lot of tools at your disposal but that's drastic for most of us. Worse, one of the suggestions is to prime yourself to eat good foods: they did an experiment where they asked one group to do a detailed recollection of the last time they eat soup [a healthy food], and reported that this group ""anticipated they would eat more than twice as much soup in the next month as the non-primed group"". BUT THEY DID NOT MEASURE HOW MUCH SOUP THEY ACTUALLY ATE! - At one point the book puts ""pizza"" in a list of relatively healthy foods. Good to know.- I guess I don't want to read any book that tells me about a hot new idea called ""evolutionary psychology."" Way to show off your middlebrow.-Naming on menus is important. Which of these menus do you want to order from? ""Red beans with rice / seafood filet / grilled chicken / chicken parmesan / chocolate pudding / zucchini cookies"" or ""Traditional cajun red beans with rice / succulent italian seafood filet / tender grilled chicken / home-style chicken parmesan / satin chocolate pudding / grandma's zucchini cookies."" The food's the same. This totally works. I cannot want the first menu.I guess this book made me grumpy. I do want to be more mindful in my food consumption, but this book did not help much."

His book is a friendly, rather chatty account of his findings, which include:* Your stomach can't count. It doesn't know how many spoonfuls of soup (or whatever) you had, so it will encourage you to keep eating until the plate is clean, the bag or box is empty, or the TV show is over. That's evolution, baby.* It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach let your brain know that you are full. (OK, I knew that one already.)* Here's where it gets interesting: If you cut calorie intake drastically, your body will reduce your metabolism, and you will feel hungry most of the time. If you cut calorie intake by 100-300 calories per day, your body will not notice the difference . . . but you may be able to lose 30 pounds in a year. Even if you don't, you'll at least stop gaining. It is possible to do this calorie cutting through exercise, but through diet is easier for most people.Some ways to cut those 100-300 daily calories:- Eat slowly. People eat faster/more if others around them eat faster/more. Try to find the slowest eater at the table and pace yourself with him/her.- Put down your fork after every bite.- When you are eating, just eat. No reading, no TV watching, no computer using. It's OK to talk or listen to music if you are with others, but try to make it slow-tempo music or you'll all eat faster.- Be aware that you will eat more when dining with others, mostly because you will be at the table for a longer time. If you are dining with several others, you will likely eat a lot more.- Don't serve food family style (in serving dishes on the table) unless it's vegetables.- Use smaller plates and tall, skinny glasses. Your brain doesn't know the difference. - Eat fruit for dessert.- If you're going to have a high-calorie dessert, try to split it with others. The best part of dessert is the first two bites.- If you must eat in front of the TV, decide in advance how much you want and put that in a plate or bowl. No eating out of a multiple-serving bag or box.- If you bulk-buy snacks, repackage them into smaller containers or bags.- Nutritious foods go where you can see them: on the counter or on a front shelf in a clear container. Non-nutritious foods, if you must buy them, go on the backs of the shelves in opaque containers.Here are the tips that I thought were too extreme for me:• Eat in only one room of your house--the kitchen or dining room.• Don't set foot in the kitchen unless it's mealtime. If you have to, enter the house a different way so you don't snack immediately after work.• Before you eat something that is bad for you, say out loud, ""I'm not actually hungry, but I'm going to eat this anyway."""

230,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10864046-kara,4,"The book is chock-full of observations, counter-intuitive at first but turn out to be more of common sense than originally thought. Instead of dictating what may constitute as the healthiest eating habits and willing the readers to follow the tall order, Brian Wansink attempts to explain the psychological aspects behind why we eat what we eat the way we eat. I am yet to go nuts about poring over the ingredient labels but I am intrigued by the idea of re-engineering my gourmet lifestyle and seeing how it pans out. Not that I'm going to cover all bases but I'll consider it a feat if I can just stick with some of these mindless/mindful tricks that I find most relevant to myself:1. Re-write the scripts and re-wire the comfort food - My top 2 activities that always seems more appealing when pairing with eating - watching TV shows and reading. Meanwhile, winter is coming.2. Take a good look at what I eat and make sure I see them ALL before and while eating - I'll appreciate the food more and be conscious of my intake at the same time. Pretty boys, my apology in advance if I can't give you my undivided attention.3. Evaluate if I can eventually realise all the savings on bulk purchase - Apart from a tendency to gorge things down faster than normal pace, I may end up throwing them away upon expiry. 4. Hara hachi bun me - Eat until I am eight parts (out of ten) full. I've always been such a big nagger if I eat too much.5. Don't be fooled by labels - I am a sucker for packaging and beautiful wordings. Ergo, my palates can already be biased before even tasting the dish. 6. Be transparent or opaque depending on the food situation - Out of sight is out of mind.7. Inconvenience is bliss - I don't need to make fire hoops as long as I can embrace the lazy self (though I still very much fancy at the idea of bracing myself against the wind while it is 4 degree outside for a good walk to Sobeys)8. Do not go for grocery shopping if I'm hungry - This will save me from all the impulse buying and food fantasizing."
231,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13316740-alex-timberman,4,"The author, Brian Wansink, is an expert in his field. He is a professor at Cornell University in the Marketing and Nutritional Science department, or something of that sort. His expertise is on the interdisciplinary relationship of marketing, nutritional science, and economics. If you read some books on behavioral economics like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman or Nudge by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, you will quickly get the psychology behind this book. The question he tries to answer is why we eat so much and what we can do about it. Obviously, this is a big problem in America with our super-sized portions and processed meals. Because he runs a food laboratory with a large research budget, his team has been able to conduct numerous experiments on why we can’t control our eating. The gist is that we all have a lot of biases and holes in our thinking that prevent us from knowing how much we are eating, when to stop eating, and on why we are eating. Because our behavior runs on autopilot, a good way to correct our bad eating habits is to set up a system so that we control our eating on autopilot. He suggests we can do that by cutting our calorie intake by a slight percentage, a percentage so small that our brains and bodies won’t be able to know the difference from our current eating habits, but a difference important enough in that over time it will lead to a significant change in our consumption. So I learned some things: follow the eating speed of the slowest eater at the dinner table to let my brain catch up with my consumption, use smaller dishes and plates because it will help me to consume less food, and etc. Even though I know all that, I just can’t resist eating what I feel like eating, when I see or think about it. As I swing into my thirties, hopefully, I can get more serious with my diet and apply some of the principles herein. "
232,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850999-beth-peninger,5,"Whoa. Each one of us is required to make 200 or more choices about food (and beverage) each day. At least that is what Wansink has discovered in his years of research. He says that number may seem high because we aren't aware of 90% of them! We are mindless when it comes to eating, to food choices, to knowing what we are actually digesting. Wansink spends the length of the book proving that and giving solutions to combat that mindless eating and become more mindful. This isn't a diet or restrictive solution. All it involves is thinking a bit more than normal when it comes to mealtimes. This book is far from dry, Wansink uses interesting research and conducts really fun and interesting studies. His facts and research are fascinating because they prove how powerful thought, or lack thereof, can be. He proposes that if we change three habits and nothing else we would lose up to 30 lbs a year (if we needed to lose weight)! And the science behind mindful and not mindless eating is so incredibly simple that I felt a little dumb listening and realizing how painless it would be to make some changes. Right away I decided to quit getting adult meals at the only fast food place I go to, I'm getting a kid meal and it's plenty. (Plus I get a fun toy!) Next time I'm at a restaurant I'll look over the kids menu and see if there is an adult kind of meal or I will be mindful. It's about being mindful. We can all say we know that but Wansink proves that we know it but we don't know it. This is a great book, such a great resource. For a preview of Wansink's suggestions and resources check out Mindless Eating's website. I highly recommend this book regardless of your size, weight, and ideas about food. "
233,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6227186-elaine,4,"Written in 2006 (and perhaps a bit dated), ""Mindless Eating"" is, first, a book about food psychology and, second, a diet book. The bottom line offers some helpful Heloise-ish tips for food control. But, the fascinating part is the first 2/3 of the book, in which Brian Wansink, a food researcher, tells stories from his life work. Of course, he maligns “foods to die for:” fat, sugar, and salt. He doesn’t blame food manufacturers and restaurants: they are in business to make money, not a conspiracy against the health of Americans. (McDonald’s doesn’t care if you throw ½ your fries away between the pick-up counter and your seat, an idea he recommends.) Most of his truisms are well-known or obvious: we eat more out of bigger bags (he calls it the “warehouse store curse”), we grossly underestimate the calories we eat, we eat more when prolonging a meal with friends (especially if they eat a lot), we will continue to eat mindlessly if we’re eating from a refilling soup bowl (he created such a device, and the subjects did continue to eat and didn’t notice the refilling part). I found the chapter in which he delineates his “soup personalities” to be most intriguing. Which soup do you prefer? Chicken noodle, chili beef, vegetable, New England clam chowder, or tomato? Here is your personality in order: a homebody, the life of the party, the trend-setter, a witty sophisticate, or a sociable affectionate reader. I’m not sure I’m a trend-setter, but of course, I’d choose vegetable. Sometimes humorous, sometimes illuminating, always fascinating, ""Mindless Eating"" was a delightful quick read for me."
234,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,4,"This researcher has a lot of experience in running experiments to see see what influences us in relation to food. Some were run in a specially designed restaurant area. In one, for example, everyone was given a free glass of wine. The bottles were almost identical. The only difference is that half the labels carried the name of a highly reputable wine growing area and the other half mention an an area not known for good wine. At no point was this pointed out to the diners. The wine was the same in each case, as were the meals served to all the diners. The survey afterwards asked diners to rate their experience of both the wine and the meal. The diners who had the supposedly cheap wine gave the wine lower ratings, but I was surprised that they also rated the food and the dining experience lower too. Lesson: people's expectations affect their experience of food.In another experiment, students were offered free food such as ribs whilst watching a football game. They could eat as much as they liked by helping themselves from a buffet. For half the students, the bowls of bones and detritus were removed regularly from the table. For the other half, the bowls were left in place. The second set ate significantly less overall. Lesson: we don't pay attention to how much we are eating and don't stop eating just because we have had enough to eat.We probably all know that we sometimes eat mindlessly, but the author helps explain why that is, and also what to do about it. It's easy to read, with lots of practical examples. I enjoyed listening to this book and will undoubtedly listen to it again from time to time."
235,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,4,"How do we determine how much we eat? Surely it depends on how hungry we are and how tasty the food is, but  Brian Wansink argues that it depends just as much on external cues, like how much is on our plate, the shape of our drinking glasses, how fast other people at the table are eating, and so forth.The best parts of this book are when he describes his experiments: the famous bottomless soup bowl, for example, or the chicken wing Super Bowl party experiment. (In the former he finds that if your bowl surreptitiously refills itself, you will eat far, far more than if it doesn't, because you are relying on the visual cue of how much soup is left in the bowl to tell you to stop eating, and in the latter he finds that if the bones aren't cleared away, they provide a reminder of how much you've eaten, and you'll eat fewer wings than if the bones are continuously removed from your sight.)The weaker parts are when he tries to extend his findings to produce dieting advice. If our mindless eating causes us to eat a few extra calories a day and cause us to gain a few pounds a year without noticing, then theoretically we could change our habits to give ourselves slightly smaller portions, so slight in difference that we don't even notice, and so we can lose a few pounds a year without even noticing the difference. Fair enough, but I could pick that up from reading the experiments, and I thought the diet advice was a bit heavy-handed and repetitive."
236,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,3,"This was a fun read: basically a tour of anecdotes and studies with unexpected insights into how people perceive food portions and what that means for healthy eating. If you like books like Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything then you will dig this; it feels similar to me though the topics and scope are very different. The overall premise here is that simple changes can help you eat healthier over time without really thinking about it. Wansink has come under fire a little in the news recently over research methods, but that doesn't seem particularly relevant to this book. The material is intuitively sensible. The thing that most resonated with me was simply to consider how much you want to eat before you start a meal, otherwise a host of social, marketing, and evolutionary factors will encourage you to eat more than you meant to. I can sum that up in one sentence, but the studies in the book make it stick in your head more than someone just saying it.The introduction was off-putting to me personally. The author spends a while establishing his bonafides, but I would rather make that decision myself based on the content instead of having someone convince me up front. It was fine after the introduction though. "

When you do randomized placebo controlled trials there has to be something in it for everyone. In the case of our studies it was the counseling part. What is most interesting about the author’s approach to mindless eating is the political angle. He presents study after study demonstrating how manipulated we are in the current food environment. Much of the research is conducted by the military (efficiency and economy of food) and the restaurant industry (eat more cheap stuff so you don’t notice that the expensive ingredients are scanty or missing). By the time you’ve completed the book you should be enraged at how the food marketing business has shaped your choices, portions, and the quality of what is available to buy. I personally have never eaten the same since reading this book and it was really helpful for study participants. Example: I consider myself to be pretty educated about healthy eating but, before reading this book, was not at all aware of subtle manipulations such as: By having only big boxes available to use at a salad bar you tend to put in more food than you were planning to eat just so items don’t slide around and fall apart. Subtle but effective, right Whole Foods? Super annoying once you start noticing all the strategies."

This isn't really a diet book, but more of an culmination of behavioral research when it comes to eating. Not only do we drastically underestimate the amount of food decisions we make daily, we underestimate our caloric intake. This little book is chock full of fun food and eating experiments. I thought this book was going to be similar to The End of Overeating but I was wrong. That book is more about the sweet spot of foods that have the perfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that get us hooked. This book is more about food cues and how humans aren't very good at paying attention to them. We can mindlessly overeat, but with some simple strategies, we can also mindlessly cut 200-300 calories without our bodies switching gears into starvation and fat storage mode. This book works better not as a diet book, but as a look into human behavior and the psychology of eating in various environments. Just thinking about these experiments would lead one to eat more mindfully. "

The author summarizes in the 10 chapters the main pain points when it comes to the gain in weight over the long period of time. The most important one is called ""the mindless margin"". This is basically the difference between 2000 calories a day and 2200 calories a day. We are not aware of those calories. It can be an extra bar of Snickers, or a few extra chips, or even upgrading a medium menu to large in a fast food restaurant.Therefore, the author's approach to lose weight in the long term is to reverse the process and instead of eating 200 extra calories a day, just eat 200 less a day by implementing small changes in our daily diet.Most of the ideas in the book are psychological changes, like placing the food further away from us, or creating smaller portions, or eating from a smaller plate and things of this nature. Personally, I think this book given some sound advice when it comes to taking care of your weight and it shows that most kilograms gained in the long run are mostly invisible in the immediate term, but can definitely be seen when we compare the photos we take now to the ones we took when we were younger.All in all, I recommend this to anyone who struggles with weight loss and to anyone who might want to discover more about compulsive eating or habits created due to environmental changes."
241,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4143583-bojana-duke,4,"Top takeaways:- most diets fail spectacularly because they rely on deprivation for quick results- alternately, small changes add up over time- take advantage of psychological quirks to adjust your patterns so you don't even notice a reduction in food- pick a single goal and three things you will work on per month towards the goal. track how you do each day for accountability. move on when it becomes mindless habit- some tips:* reduce default portion sizes by 20%* see all the food you plan on eating before you start (i.e. no eating straight from larger containers, multiple servings, etc.)* use smaller dishes to make portions look larger* decrease convenience of snacking* reduce distractions while eating (no TV, reading, etc.)* improve associations with healthier foods (describe them enticingly, eat them during happy times)* be a gatekeeper in the household to establish healthy habits for everyone (control what is getting bought, cooked, etc.)"

I am interested in psychology and this book discusses food psychology along with marketing strategies. It was thought provoking and I found myself reasonating with much of the information. While overall I liked the book, I did find it to be a slow read as I highlighted much of it. Many health books can be strongly against the food and restaurant industry. I did not find this book to be that way. It was a light read that offered support to all sides. I appreciate how the author was able to remain neutral. I like how the author explains how we eat more without being aware of it. He then followed up with ideas on how we can avoid these pitfalls. The tips the author provides are realistic and doable.

255,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14685347-rif-a-saurous,2,"If you don't live under a rock, you're probably familiar with Brian Wansink's work. He does lots of crazy food studies, like demonstrating how people consume more soup if you give them a bowl that's secretly refilling itself from the bottom, or how if you put folks in a dark room and ask them to evaluate your new strawberry yogurt but give them chocolate yogurt instead they'll think it has a good strawberry flavor. The book's kinda all over the place: overlong, poorly written, chock full of irrelevant anecdotes and ""jokes"" and name dropping of the fancy places he's talked or worked [""Ooh! The Max Planck Institute!""], it can't decide whether it's telling you gee-whiz stories, giving you advice, or just explaining why you're going to fail. [It doesn't take a consistent view on whether knowing your own biases leads to any paths to reduce those biases.]I can't really recommend it because it wasn't well written and it wasn't helpful, although if you've never read anything else in this space maybe it would be OK?A few notes from the book:- Expectations matter; people don't believe it. Give people a glass of California wine, they expect it'll be good, they'll think it's good. Give them a glass of North Dakota wine, they expect it'll be bad, they'll think it's bad. Of course it's the same wine with different labels. And of course the people insist that the wine's origin didn't influence their judgement.- One of the book's central concept is ""the mindless margin."" The argument is that (1) it is easy to mindlessly reduce [or increase] your calories by 100 or so / day, and that (2) this will have large effects on your eventual weight because 3500 calories is a pound. (1) is undoubtedly true, but (2) is deeply suspect, because it's very possible your metabolism or changes in NEAT [non-exercise activity thermogenesis] will absorb small calorie surpluses or deficits. The book treats human psychology as complex, but human metabolism as trivial, which is basically just embarrassing and non-scientific.- Plate size makes a huge difference. Seriously consider getting and using smaller plates and serving spoons [the experiment used ice cream scoops]. You anchor off the size of your plate. Plate size has been increasing over time. [Edit: This is assuming you want to consume fewer calories. If you want to consume more calories, get bigger plates. I find consuming more calories trivial and consuming fewer difficult.]- Many of the suggestions in the book are weak because you operate in an unfriendly environment: the restaurant doesn't care how fat you are; if you're willing to not to eat in restaurants, you have a lot of tools at your disposal but that's drastic for most of us. Worse, one of the suggestions is to prime yourself to eat good foods: they did an experiment where they asked one group to do a detailed recollection of the last time they eat soup [a healthy food], and reported that this group ""anticipated they would eat more than twice as much soup in the next month as the non-primed group"". BUT THEY DID NOT MEASURE HOW MUCH SOUP THEY ACTUALLY ATE! - At one point the book puts ""pizza"" in a list of relatively healthy foods. Good to know.- I guess I don't want to read any book that tells me about a hot new idea called ""evolutionary psychology."" Way to show off your middlebrow.-Naming on menus is important. Which of these menus do you want to order from? ""Red beans with rice / seafood filet / grilled chicken / chicken parmesan / chocolate pudding / zucchini cookies"" or ""Traditional cajun red beans with rice / succulent italian seafood filet / tender grilled chicken / home-style chicken parmesan / satin chocolate pudding / grandma's zucchini cookies."" The food's the same. This totally works. I cannot want the first menu.I guess this book made me grumpy. I do want to be more mindful in my food consumption, but this book did not help much."

257,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,4,"""The best diet is the one you don't know you're on.""Wansink is a Ph.D. who has run food labs at different universities and independently. His book is a friendly, rather chatty account of his findings, which include:* Your stomach can't count. It doesn't know how many spoonfuls of soup (or whatever) you had, so it will encourage you to keep eating until the plate is clean, the bag or box is empty, or the TV show is over. That's evolution, baby.* It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach let your brain know that you are full. (OK, I knew that one already.)* Here's where it gets interesting: If you cut calorie intake drastically, your body will reduce your metabolism, and you will feel hungry most of the time. If you cut calorie intake by 100-300 calories per day, your body will not notice the difference . . . but you may be able to lose 30 pounds in a year. Even if you don't, you'll at least stop gaining. It is possible to do this calorie cutting through exercise, but through diet is easier for most people.Some ways to cut those 100-300 daily calories:- Eat slowly. People eat faster/more if others around them eat faster/more. Try to find the slowest eater at the table and pace yourself with him/her.- Put down your fork after every bite.- When you are eating, just eat. No reading, no TV watching, no computer using. It's OK to talk or listen to music if you are with others, but try to make it slow-tempo music or you'll all eat faster.- Be aware that you will eat more when dining with others, mostly because you will be at the table for a longer time. If you are dining with several others, you will likely eat a lot more.- Don't serve food family style (in serving dishes on the table) unless it's vegetables.- Use smaller plates and tall, skinny glasses. Your brain doesn't know the difference. - Eat fruit for dessert.- If you're going to have a high-calorie dessert, try to split it with others. The best part of dessert is the first two bites.- If you must eat in front of the TV, decide in advance how much you want and put that in a plate or bowl. No eating out of a multiple-serving bag or box.- If you bulk-buy snacks, repackage them into smaller containers or bags.- Nutritious foods go where you can see them: on the counter or on a front shelf in a clear container. Non-nutritious foods, if you must buy them, go on the backs of the shelves in opaque containers.Here are the tips that I thought were too extreme for me:• Eat in only one room of your house--the kitchen or dining room.• Don't set foot in the kitchen unless it's mealtime. If you have to, enter the house a different way so you don't snack immediately after work.• Before you eat something that is bad for you, say out loud, ""I'm not actually hungry, but I'm going to eat this anyway."""
258,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26295-gina,4,"I liked this book. The studies & results published here help to change the way we think about the next meal. We are susceptible to so many hidden persuaders: large plates, shorter-wider glasses, things that say ""low fat"" ""low calorie"", lighting, music, childhood habits, stress, mood! After reading this I will ""see"" and make more aware, enjoyably and healthy eating choices. "

260,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10864046-kara,4,"The book is chock-full of observations, counter-intuitive at first but turn out to be more of common sense than originally thought. Instead of dictating what may constitute as the healthiest eating habits and willing the readers to follow the tall order, Brian Wansink attempts to explain the psychological aspects behind why we eat what we eat the way we eat. I am yet to go nuts about poring over the ingredient labels but I am intrigued by the idea of re-engineering my gourmet lifestyle and seeing how it pans out. Not that I'm going to cover all bases but I'll consider it a feat if I can just stick with some of these mindless/mindful tricks that I find most relevant to myself:1. Re-write the scripts and re-wire the comfort food - My top 2 activities that always seems more appealing when pairing with eating - watching TV shows and reading. Meanwhile, winter is coming.2. Take a good look at what I eat and make sure I see them ALL before and while eating - I'll appreciate the food more and be conscious of my intake at the same time. Pretty boys, my apology in advance if I can't give you my undivided attention.3. Evaluate if I can eventually realise all the savings on bulk purchase - Apart from a tendency to gorge things down faster than normal pace, I may end up throwing them away upon expiry. 4. Hara hachi bun me - Eat until I am eight parts (out of ten) full. I've always been such a big nagger if I eat too much.5. Don't be fooled by labels - I am a sucker for packaging and beautiful wordings. Ergo, my palates can already be biased before even tasting the dish. 6. Be transparent or opaque depending on the food situation - Out of sight is out of mind.7. Inconvenience is bliss - I don't need to make fire hoops as long as I can embrace the lazy self (though I still very much fancy at the idea of bracing myself against the wind while it is 4 degree outside for a good walk to Sobeys)8. Do not go for grocery shopping if I'm hungry - This will save me from all the impulse buying and food fantasizing."
261,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13316740-alex-timberman,4,"The author, Brian Wansink, is an expert in his field. He is a professor at Cornell University in the Marketing and Nutritional Science department, or something of that sort. His expertise is on the interdisciplinary relationship of marketing, nutritional science, and economics. If you read some books on behavioral economics like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman or Nudge by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, you will quickly get the psychology behind this book. The question he tries to answer is why we eat so much and what we can do about it. Obviously, this is a big problem in America with our super-sized portions and processed meals. Because he runs a food laboratory with a large research budget, his team has been able to conduct numerous experiments on why we can’t control our eating. The gist is that we all have a lot of biases and holes in our thinking that prevent us from knowing how much we are eating, when to stop eating, and on why we are eating. Because our behavior runs on autopilot, a good way to correct our bad eating habits is to set up a system so that we control our eating on autopilot. He suggests we can do that by cutting our calorie intake by a slight percentage, a percentage so small that our brains and bodies won’t be able to know the difference from our current eating habits, but a difference important enough in that over time it will lead to a significant change in our consumption. So I learned some things: follow the eating speed of the slowest eater at the dinner table to let my brain catch up with my consumption, use smaller dishes and plates because it will help me to consume less food, and etc. Even though I know all that, I just can’t resist eating what I feel like eating, when I see or think about it. As I swing into my thirties, hopefully, I can get more serious with my diet and apply some of the principles herein. "
262,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850999-beth-peninger,5,"Whoa. Each one of us is required to make 200 or more choices about food (and beverage) each day. At least that is what Wansink has discovered in his years of research. He says that number may seem high because we aren't aware of 90% of them! We are mindless when it comes to eating, to food choices, to knowing what we are actually digesting. Wansink spends the length of the book proving that and giving solutions to combat that mindless eating and become more mindful. This isn't a diet or restrictive solution. All it involves is thinking a bit more than normal when it comes to mealtimes. This book is far from dry, Wansink uses interesting research and conducts really fun and interesting studies. His facts and research are fascinating because they prove how powerful thought, or lack thereof, can be. He proposes that if we change three habits and nothing else we would lose up to 30 lbs a year (if we needed to lose weight)! And the science behind mindful and not mindless eating is so incredibly simple that I felt a little dumb listening and realizing how painless it would be to make some changes. Right away I decided to quit getting adult meals at the only fast food place I go to, I'm getting a kid meal and it's plenty. (Plus I get a fun toy!) Next time I'm at a restaurant I'll look over the kids menu and see if there is an adult kind of meal or I will be mindful. It's about being mindful. We can all say we know that but Wansink proves that we know it but we don't know it. This is a great book, such a great resource. For a preview of Wansink's suggestions and resources check out Mindless Eating's website. I highly recommend this book regardless of your size, weight, and ideas about food. "
263,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6227186-elaine,4,"Written in 2006 (and perhaps a bit dated), ""Mindless Eating"" is, first, a book about food psychology and, second, a diet book. The bottom line offers some helpful Heloise-ish tips for food control. But, the fascinating part is the first 2/3 of the book, in which Brian Wansink, a food researcher, tells stories from his life work. Of course, he maligns “foods to die for:” fat, sugar, and salt. He doesn’t blame food manufacturers and restaurants: they are in business to make money, not a conspiracy against the health of Americans. (McDonald’s doesn’t care if you throw ½ your fries away between the pick-up counter and your seat, an idea he recommends.) Most of his truisms are well-known or obvious: we eat more out of bigger bags (he calls it the “warehouse store curse”), we grossly underestimate the calories we eat, we eat more when prolonging a meal with friends (especially if they eat a lot), we will continue to eat mindlessly if we’re eating from a refilling soup bowl (he created such a device, and the subjects did continue to eat and didn’t notice the refilling part). I found the chapter in which he delineates his “soup personalities” to be most intriguing. Which soup do you prefer? Chicken noodle, chili beef, vegetable, New England clam chowder, or tomato? Here is your personality in order: a homebody, the life of the party, the trend-setter, a witty sophisticate, or a sociable affectionate reader. I’m not sure I’m a trend-setter, but of course, I’d choose vegetable. Sometimes humorous, sometimes illuminating, always fascinating, ""Mindless Eating"" was a delightful quick read for me."
264,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,4,"This researcher has a lot of experience in running experiments to see see what influences us in relation to food. Some were run in a specially designed restaurant area. In one, for example, everyone was given a free glass of wine. The bottles were almost identical. The only difference is that half the labels carried the name of a highly reputable wine growing area and the other half mention an an area not known for good wine. At no point was this pointed out to the diners. The wine was the same in each case, as were the meals served to all the diners. The survey afterwards asked diners to rate their experience of both the wine and the meal. The diners who had the supposedly cheap wine gave the wine lower ratings, but I was surprised that they also rated the food and the dining experience lower too. Lesson: people's expectations affect their experience of food.In another experiment, students were offered free food such as ribs whilst watching a football game. They could eat as much as they liked by helping themselves from a buffet. For half the students, the bowls of bones and detritus were removed regularly from the table. For the other half, the bowls were left in place. The second set ate significantly less overall. Lesson: we don't pay attention to how much we are eating and don't stop eating just because we have had enough to eat.We probably all know that we sometimes eat mindlessly, but the author helps explain why that is, and also what to do about it. It's easy to read, with lots of practical examples. I enjoyed listening to this book and will undoubtedly listen to it again from time to time."
265,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,4,"How do we determine how much we eat? Surely it depends on how hungry we are and how tasty the food is, but  Brian Wansink argues that it depends just as much on external cues, like how much is on our plate, the shape of our drinking glasses, how fast other people at the table are eating, and so forth.The best parts of this book are when he describes his experiments: the famous bottomless soup bowl, for example, or the chicken wing Super Bowl party experiment. (In the former he finds that if your bowl surreptitiously refills itself, you will eat far, far more than if it doesn't, because you are relying on the visual cue of how much soup is left in the bowl to tell you to stop eating, and in the latter he finds that if the bones aren't cleared away, they provide a reminder of how much you've eaten, and you'll eat fewer wings than if the bones are continuously removed from your sight.)The weaker parts are when he tries to extend his findings to produce dieting advice. If our mindless eating causes us to eat a few extra calories a day and cause us to gain a few pounds a year without noticing, then theoretically we could change our habits to give ourselves slightly smaller portions, so slight in difference that we don't even notice, and so we can lose a few pounds a year without even noticing the difference. Fair enough, but I could pick that up from reading the experiments, and I thought the diet advice was a bit heavy-handed and repetitive."
266,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,3,"This was a fun read: basically a tour of anecdotes and studies with unexpected insights into how people perceive food portions and what that means for healthy eating. If you like books like Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything then you will dig this; it feels similar to me though the topics and scope are very different. The overall premise here is that simple changes can help you eat healthier over time without really thinking about it. Wansink has come under fire a little in the news recently over research methods, but that doesn't seem particularly relevant to this book. The material is intuitively sensible. The thing that most resonated with me was simply to consider how much you want to eat before you start a meal, otherwise a host of social, marketing, and evolutionary factors will encourage you to eat more than you meant to. I can sum that up in one sentence, but the studies in the book make it stick in your head more than someone just saying it.The introduction was off-putting to me personally. The author spends a while establishing his bonafides, but I would rather make that decision myself based on the content instead of having someone convince me up front. It was fine after the introduction though. "
267,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32021539-holly-b,5,"I ran clinical trials for a couple of drugs being developed for obesity and used this book as a teaching tool. When you do randomized placebo controlled trials there has to be something in it for everyone. In the case of our studies it was the counseling part. What is most interesting about the author’s approach to mindless eating is the political angle. He presents study after study demonstrating how manipulated we are in the current food environment. Much of the research is conducted by the military (efficiency and economy of food) and the restaurant industry (eat more cheap stuff so you don’t notice that the expensive ingredients are scanty or missing). By the time you’ve completed the book you should be enraged at how the food marketing business has shaped your choices, portions, and the quality of what is available to buy. I personally have never eaten the same since reading this book and it was really helpful for study participants. Example: I consider myself to be pretty educated about healthy eating but, before reading this book, was not at all aware of subtle manipulations such as: By having only big boxes available to use at a salad bar you tend to put in more food than you were planning to eat just so items don’t slide around and fall apart. Subtle but effective, right Whole Foods? Super annoying once you start noticing all the strategies."

If you deprive yourself of everything, you'll give up at some point.- You can't trust your stomach, it can't count and it only feels full because of external cues.- See it BEFORE and WHILE you eat it: if you're doing other things, and you've not carefully chosen a portion, you'll end op eating everything- Optical illusion: buy smaller plates- Variety makes us eat more, don't offer a wide variety: at a buffet, only take two different things each time- Convenience wins every time: keep things that tempt you far away and you're so much less likely to eat things that are bad for you: make overeating a hassle- Be the last one to get your food and the last one to finish your meal, try to follow the pace of whoever is at your table- Serve yourself BEFORE you start- Brand-name psychosis- Think small or share- Choose one step, DON'T IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME"

This isn't really a diet book, but more of an culmination of behavioral research when it comes to eating. Not only do we drastically underestimate the amount of food decisions we make daily, we underestimate our caloric intake. This little book is chock full of fun food and eating experiments. I thought this book was going to be similar to The End of Overeating but I was wrong. That book is more about the sweet spot of foods that have the perfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that get us hooked. This book is more about food cues and how humans aren't very good at paying attention to them. We can mindlessly overeat, but with some simple strategies, we can also mindlessly cut 200-300 calories without our bodies switching gears into starvation and fat storage mode. This book works better not as a diet book, but as a look into human behavior and the psychology of eating in various environments. Just thinking about these experiments would lead one to eat more mindfully. "

The author summarizes in the 10 chapters the main pain points when it comes to the gain in weight over the long period of time. The most important one is called ""the mindless margin"". This is basically the difference between 2000 calories a day and 2200 calories a day. We are not aware of those calories. It can be an extra bar of Snickers, or a few extra chips, or even upgrading a medium menu to large in a fast food restaurant.Therefore, the author's approach to lose weight in the long term is to reverse the process and instead of eating 200 extra calories a day, just eat 200 less a day by implementing small changes in our daily diet.Most of the ideas in the book are psychological changes, like placing the food further away from us, or creating smaller portions, or eating from a smaller plate and things of this nature. Personally, I think this book given some sound advice when it comes to taking care of your weight and it shows that most kilograms gained in the long run are mostly invisible in the immediate term, but can definitely be seen when we compare the photos we take now to the ones we took when we were younger.All in all, I recommend this to anyone who struggles with weight loss and to anyone who might want to discover more about compulsive eating or habits created due to environmental changes."
271,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4143583-bojana-duke,4,"Top takeaways:- most diets fail spectacularly because they rely on deprivation for quick results- alternately, small changes add up over time- take advantage of psychological quirks to adjust your patterns so you don't even notice a reduction in food- pick a single goal and three things you will work on per month towards the goal. track how you do each day for accountability. move on when it becomes mindless habit- some tips:* reduce default portion sizes by 20%* see all the food you plan on eating before you start (i.e. no eating straight from larger containers, multiple servings, etc.)* use smaller dishes to make portions look larger* decrease convenience of snacking* reduce distractions while eating (no TV, reading, etc.)* improve associations with healthier foods (describe them enticingly, eat them during happy times)* be a gatekeeper in the household to establish healthy habits for everyone (control what is getting bought, cooked, etc.)"

I am interested in psychology and this book discusses food psychology along with marketing strategies. It was thought provoking and I found myself reasonating with much of the information. While overall I liked the book, I did find it to be a slow read as I highlighted much of it. Many health books can be strongly against the food and restaurant industry. I did not find this book to be that way. It was a light read that offered support to all sides. I appreciate how the author was able to remain neutral. I like how the author explains how we eat more without being aware of it. He then followed up with ideas on how we can avoid these pitfalls. The tips the author provides are realistic and doable.

There are also many actions he suggests that we can take to make little changes that will help us manage our weight over time.This is not a quick fix, but a book of information and tips that you can implement over time to make positive changes to our eating habits.The audiobook was read by the author, Brian Wansink, which I like, and the production quality is very good."

I found myself saying, ""I would never do that,"" only to find myself doing exactly THAT the next day.

(I’ll actually probably give a copy to a relative). However, this book does make it seem like you can eat whatever sounds good as long as you keep up with your calories, and that seems a bit novice to me in the health space. You can’t just eat French fries all day long and expect to be healthy. You might lose weight if you’re taking in less calories than you need, but I promise your body still hates you. "

He does lots of crazy food studies, like demonstrating how people consume more soup if you give them a bowl that's secretly refilling itself from the bottom, or how if you put folks in a dark room and ask them to evaluate your new strawberry yogurt but give them chocolate yogurt instead they'll think it has a good strawberry flavor. The book's kinda all over the place: overlong, poorly written, chock full of irrelevant anecdotes and ""jokes"" and name dropping of the fancy places he's talked or worked [""Ooh! The Max Planck Institute!""], it can't decide whether it's telling you gee-whiz stories, giving you advice, or just explaining why you're going to fail. [It doesn't take a consistent view on whether knowing your own biases leads to any paths to reduce those biases.]I can't really recommend it because it wasn't well written and it wasn't helpful, although if you've never read anything else in this space maybe it would be OK?A few notes from the book:- Expectations matter; people don't believe it. Give people a glass of California wine, they expect it'll be good, they'll think it's good. Give them a glass of North Dakota wine, they expect it'll be bad, they'll think it's bad. Of course it's the same wine with different labels. And of course the people insist that the wine's origin didn't influence their judgement.- One of the book's central concept is ""the mindless margin."" The argument is that (1) it is easy to mindlessly reduce [or increase] your calories by 100 or so / day, and that (2) this will have large effects on your eventual weight because 3500 calories is a pound. (1) is undoubtedly true, but (2) is deeply suspect, because it's very possible your metabolism or changes in NEAT [non-exercise activity thermogenesis] will absorb small calorie surpluses or deficits. The book treats human psychology as complex, but human metabolism as trivial, which is basically just embarrassing and non-scientific.- Plate size makes a huge difference. Seriously consider getting and using smaller plates and serving spoons [the experiment used ice cream scoops]. You anchor off the size of your plate. Plate size has been increasing over time. [Edit: This is assuming you want to consume fewer calories. If you want to consume more calories, get bigger plates. I find consuming more calories trivial and consuming fewer difficult.]- Many of the suggestions in the book are weak because you operate in an unfriendly environment: the restaurant doesn't care how fat you are; if you're willing to not to eat in restaurants, you have a lot of tools at your disposal but that's drastic for most of us. Worse, one of the suggestions is to prime yourself to eat good foods: they did an experiment where they asked one group to do a detailed recollection of the last time they eat soup [a healthy food], and reported that this group ""anticipated they would eat more than twice as much soup in the next month as the non-primed group"". BUT THEY DID NOT MEASURE HOW MUCH SOUP THEY ACTUALLY ATE! - At one point the book puts ""pizza"" in a list of relatively healthy foods. Good to know.- I guess I don't want to read any book that tells me about a hot new idea called ""evolutionary psychology."" Way to show off your middlebrow.-Naming on menus is important. Which of these menus do you want to order from? ""Red beans with rice / seafood filet / grilled chicken / chicken parmesan / chocolate pudding / zucchini cookies"" or ""Traditional cajun red beans with rice / succulent italian seafood filet / tender grilled chicken / home-style chicken parmesan / satin chocolate pudding / grandma's zucchini cookies."" The food's the same. This totally works. I cannot want the first menu.I guess this book made me grumpy. I do want to be more mindful in my food consumption, but this book did not help much."

287,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,4,"""The best diet is the one you don't know you're on.""Wansink is a Ph.D. who has run food labs at different universities and independently. His book is a friendly, rather chatty account of his findings, which include:* Your stomach can't count. It doesn't know how many spoonfuls of soup (or whatever) you had, so it will encourage you to keep eating until the plate is clean, the bag or box is empty, or the TV show is over. That's evolution, baby.* It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach let your brain know that you are full. (OK, I knew that one already.)* Here's where it gets interesting: If you cut calorie intake drastically, your body will reduce your metabolism, and you will feel hungry most of the time. If you cut calorie intake by 100-300 calories per day, your body will not notice the difference . . . but you may be able to lose 30 pounds in a year. Even if you don't, you'll at least stop gaining. It is possible to do this calorie cutting through exercise, but through diet is easier for most people.Some ways to cut those 100-300 daily calories:- Eat slowly. People eat faster/more if others around them eat faster/more. Try to find the slowest eater at the table and pace yourself with him/her.- Put down your fork after every bite.- When you are eating, just eat. No reading, no TV watching, no computer using. It's OK to talk or listen to music if you are with others, but try to make it slow-tempo music or you'll all eat faster.- Be aware that you will eat more when dining with others, mostly because you will be at the table for a longer time. If you are dining with several others, you will likely eat a lot more.- Don't serve food family style (in serving dishes on the table) unless it's vegetables.- Use smaller plates and tall, skinny glasses. Your brain doesn't know the difference. - Eat fruit for dessert.- If you're going to have a high-calorie dessert, try to split it with others. The best part of dessert is the first two bites.- If you must eat in front of the TV, decide in advance how much you want and put that in a plate or bowl. No eating out of a multiple-serving bag or box.- If you bulk-buy snacks, repackage them into smaller containers or bags.- Nutritious foods go where you can see them: on the counter or on a front shelf in a clear container. Non-nutritious foods, if you must buy them, go on the backs of the shelves in opaque containers.Here are the tips that I thought were too extreme for me:• Eat in only one room of your house--the kitchen or dining room.• Don't set foot in the kitchen unless it's mealtime. If you have to, enter the house a different way so you don't snack immediately after work.• Before you eat something that is bad for you, say out loud, ""I'm not actually hungry, but I'm going to eat this anyway."""

290,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10864046-kara,4,"The book is chock-full of observations, counter-intuitive at first but turn out to be more of common sense than originally thought. Instead of dictating what may constitute as the healthiest eating habits and willing the readers to follow the tall order, Brian Wansink attempts to explain the psychological aspects behind why we eat what we eat the way we eat. I am yet to go nuts about poring over the ingredient labels but I am intrigued by the idea of re-engineering my gourmet lifestyle and seeing how it pans out. Not that I'm going to cover all bases but I'll consider it a feat if I can just stick with some of these mindless/mindful tricks that I find most relevant to myself:1. Re-write the scripts and re-wire the comfort food - My top 2 activities that always seems more appealing when pairing with eating - watching TV shows and reading. Meanwhile, winter is coming.2. Take a good look at what I eat and make sure I see them ALL before and while eating - I'll appreciate the food more and be conscious of my intake at the same time. Pretty boys, my apology in advance if I can't give you my undivided attention.3. Evaluate if I can eventually realise all the savings on bulk purchase - Apart from a tendency to gorge things down faster than normal pace, I may end up throwing them away upon expiry. 4. Hara hachi bun me - Eat until I am eight parts (out of ten) full. I've always been such a big nagger if I eat too much.5. Don't be fooled by labels - I am a sucker for packaging and beautiful wordings. Ergo, my palates can already be biased before even tasting the dish. 6. Be transparent or opaque depending on the food situation - Out of sight is out of mind.7. Inconvenience is bliss - I don't need to make fire hoops as long as I can embrace the lazy self (though I still very much fancy at the idea of bracing myself against the wind while it is 4 degree outside for a good walk to Sobeys)8. Do not go for grocery shopping if I'm hungry - This will save me from all the impulse buying and food fantasizing."
291,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13316740-alex-timberman,4,"The author, Brian Wansink, is an expert in his field. He is a professor at Cornell University in the Marketing and Nutritional Science department, or something of that sort. His expertise is on the interdisciplinary relationship of marketing, nutritional science, and economics. If you read some books on behavioral economics like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman or Nudge by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, you will quickly get the psychology behind this book. The question he tries to answer is why we eat so much and what we can do about it. Obviously, this is a big problem in America with our super-sized portions and processed meals. Because he runs a food laboratory with a large research budget, his team has been able to conduct numerous experiments on why we can’t control our eating. The gist is that we all have a lot of biases and holes in our thinking that prevent us from knowing how much we are eating, when to stop eating, and on why we are eating. Because our behavior runs on autopilot, a good way to correct our bad eating habits is to set up a system so that we control our eating on autopilot. He suggests we can do that by cutting our calorie intake by a slight percentage, a percentage so small that our brains and bodies won’t be able to know the difference from our current eating habits, but a difference important enough in that over time it will lead to a significant change in our consumption. So I learned some things: follow the eating speed of the slowest eater at the dinner table to let my brain catch up with my consumption, use smaller dishes and plates because it will help me to consume less food, and etc. Even though I know all that, I just can’t resist eating what I feel like eating, when I see or think about it. As I swing into my thirties, hopefully, I can get more serious with my diet and apply some of the principles herein. "
292,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4850999-beth-peninger,5,"Whoa. Each one of us is required to make 200 or more choices about food (and beverage) each day. At least that is what Wansink has discovered in his years of research. He says that number may seem high because we aren't aware of 90% of them! We are mindless when it comes to eating, to food choices, to knowing what we are actually digesting. Wansink spends the length of the book proving that and giving solutions to combat that mindless eating and become more mindful. This isn't a diet or restrictive solution. All it involves is thinking a bit more than normal when it comes to mealtimes. This book is far from dry, Wansink uses interesting research and conducts really fun and interesting studies. His facts and research are fascinating because they prove how powerful thought, or lack thereof, can be. He proposes that if we change three habits and nothing else we would lose up to 30 lbs a year (if we needed to lose weight)! And the science behind mindful and not mindless eating is so incredibly simple that I felt a little dumb listening and realizing how painless it would be to make some changes. Right away I decided to quit getting adult meals at the only fast food place I go to, I'm getting a kid meal and it's plenty. (Plus I get a fun toy!) Next time I'm at a restaurant I'll look over the kids menu and see if there is an adult kind of meal or I will be mindful. It's about being mindful. We can all say we know that but Wansink proves that we know it but we don't know it. This is a great book, such a great resource. For a preview of Wansink's suggestions and resources check out Mindless Eating's website. I highly recommend this book regardless of your size, weight, and ideas about food. "
293,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6227186-elaine,4,"Written in 2006 (and perhaps a bit dated), ""Mindless Eating"" is, first, a book about food psychology and, second, a diet book. The bottom line offers some helpful Heloise-ish tips for food control. But, the fascinating part is the first 2/3 of the book, in which Brian Wansink, a food researcher, tells stories from his life work. Of course, he maligns “foods to die for:” fat, sugar, and salt. He doesn’t blame food manufacturers and restaurants: they are in business to make money, not a conspiracy against the health of Americans. (McDonald’s doesn’t care if you throw ½ your fries away between the pick-up counter and your seat, an idea he recommends.) Most of his truisms are well-known or obvious: we eat more out of bigger bags (he calls it the “warehouse store curse”), we grossly underestimate the calories we eat, we eat more when prolonging a meal with friends (especially if they eat a lot), we will continue to eat mindlessly if we’re eating from a refilling soup bowl (he created such a device, and the subjects did continue to eat and didn’t notice the refilling part). I found the chapter in which he delineates his “soup personalities” to be most intriguing. Which soup do you prefer? Chicken noodle, chili beef, vegetable, New England clam chowder, or tomato? Here is your personality in order: a homebody, the life of the party, the trend-setter, a witty sophisticate, or a sociable affectionate reader. I’m not sure I’m a trend-setter, but of course, I’d choose vegetable. Sometimes humorous, sometimes illuminating, always fascinating, ""Mindless Eating"" was a delightful quick read for me."
294,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019544-sue,4,"This researcher has a lot of experience in running experiments to see see what influences us in relation to food. Some were run in a specially designed restaurant area. In one, for example, everyone was given a free glass of wine. The bottles were almost identical. The only difference is that half the labels carried the name of a highly reputable wine growing area and the other half mention an an area not known for good wine. At no point was this pointed out to the diners. The wine was the same in each case, as were the meals served to all the diners. The survey afterwards asked diners to rate their experience of both the wine and the meal. The diners who had the supposedly cheap wine gave the wine lower ratings, but I was surprised that they also rated the food and the dining experience lower too. Lesson: people's expectations affect their experience of food.In another experiment, students were offered free food such as ribs whilst watching a football game. They could eat as much as they liked by helping themselves from a buffet. For half the students, the bowls of bones and detritus were removed regularly from the table. For the other half, the bowls were left in place. The second set ate significantly less overall. Lesson: we don't pay attention to how much we are eating and don't stop eating just because we have had enough to eat.We probably all know that we sometimes eat mindlessly, but the author helps explain why that is, and also what to do about it. It's easy to read, with lots of practical examples. I enjoyed listening to this book and will undoubtedly listen to it again from time to time."
295,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,4,"How do we determine how much we eat? Surely it depends on how hungry we are and how tasty the food is, but  Brian Wansink argues that it depends just as much on external cues, like how much is on our plate, the shape of our drinking glasses, how fast other people at the table are eating, and so forth.The best parts of this book are when he describes his experiments: the famous bottomless soup bowl, for example, or the chicken wing Super Bowl party experiment. (In the former he finds that if your bowl surreptitiously refills itself, you will eat far, far more than if it doesn't, because you are relying on the visual cue of how much soup is left in the bowl to tell you to stop eating, and in the latter he finds that if the bones aren't cleared away, they provide a reminder of how much you've eaten, and you'll eat fewer wings than if the bones are continuously removed from your sight.)The weaker parts are when he tries to extend his findings to produce dieting advice. If our mindless eating causes us to eat a few extra calories a day and cause us to gain a few pounds a year without noticing, then theoretically we could change our habits to give ourselves slightly smaller portions, so slight in difference that we don't even notice, and so we can lose a few pounds a year without even noticing the difference. Fair enough, but I could pick that up from reading the experiments, and I thought the diet advice was a bit heavy-handed and repetitive."
296,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,3,"This was a fun read: basically a tour of anecdotes and studies with unexpected insights into how people perceive food portions and what that means for healthy eating. If you like books like Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything then you will dig this; it feels similar to me though the topics and scope are very different. The overall premise here is that simple changes can help you eat healthier over time without really thinking about it. Wansink has come under fire a little in the news recently over research methods, but that doesn't seem particularly relevant to this book. The material is intuitively sensible. The thing that most resonated with me was simply to consider how much you want to eat before you start a meal, otherwise a host of social, marketing, and evolutionary factors will encourage you to eat more than you meant to. I can sum that up in one sentence, but the studies in the book make it stick in your head more than someone just saying it.The introduction was off-putting to me personally. The author spends a while establishing his bonafides, but I would rather make that decision myself based on the content instead of having someone convince me up front. It was fine after the introduction though. "
297,0553804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32021539-holly-b,5,"I ran clinical trials for a couple of drugs being developed for obesity and used this book as a teaching tool. When you do randomized placebo controlled trials there has to be something in it for everyone. In the case of our studies it was the counseling part. What is most interesting about the author’s approach to mindless eating is the political angle. He presents study after study demonstrating how manipulated we are in the current food environment. Much of the research is conducted by the military (efficiency and economy of food) and the restaurant industry (eat more cheap stuff so you don’t notice that the expensive ingredients are scanty or missing). By the time you’ve completed the book you should be enraged at how the food marketing business has shaped your choices, portions, and the quality of what is available to buy. I personally have never eaten the same since reading this book and it was really helpful for study participants. Example: I consider myself to be pretty educated about healthy eating but, before reading this book, was not at all aware of subtle manipulations such as: By having only big boxes available to use at a salad bar you tend to put in more food than you were planning to eat just so items don’t slide around and fall apart. Subtle but effective, right Whole Foods? Super annoying once you start noticing all the strategies."

If you deprive yourself of everything, you'll give up at some point.- You can't trust your stomach, it can't count and it only feels full because of external cues.- See it BEFORE and WHILE you eat it: if you're doing other things, and you've not carefully chosen a portion, you'll end op eating everything- Optical illusion: buy smaller plates- Variety makes us eat more, don't offer a wide variety: at a buffet, only take two different things each time- Convenience wins every time: keep things that tempt you far away and you're so much less likely to eat things that are bad for you: make overeating a hassle- Be the last one to get your food and the last one to finish your meal, try to follow the pace of whoever is at your table- Serve yourself BEFORE you start- Brand-name psychosis- Think small or share- Choose one step, DON'T IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME"

This isn't really a diet book, but more of an culmination of behavioral research when it comes to eating. Not only do we drastically underestimate the amount of food decisions we make daily, we underestimate our caloric intake. This little book is chock full of fun food and eating experiments. I thought this book was going to be similar to The End of Overeating but I was wrong. That book is more about the sweet spot of foods that have the perfect combination of sugar, salt, and fat that get us hooked. This book is more about food cues and how humans aren't very good at paying attention to them. We can mindlessly overeat, but with some simple strategies, we can also mindlessly cut 200-300 calories without our bodies switching gears into starvation and fat storage mode. This book works better not as a diet book, but as a look into human behavior and the psychology of eating in various environments. Just thinking about these experiments would lead one to eat more mindfully. "
