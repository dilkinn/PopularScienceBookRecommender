0,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"Much of this book is autobiographical. Richard Dawkins collects anecdotes from his professional life. He has led a fascinating life, and has become friends with a number of wonderfully intelligent and interesting people. I guess I am a bit jealous of his experiences! Some people think that Dawkins comes off as being arrogant, but I totally disagree. To me, he comes across as a good person, often humble, who admits mistakes yet recognizes his value to science and to society. I find his writing to be inspiring.Dawkins has written a number of books about evolution, and some have become classics. If you are unfamiliar with his books, you may not appreciate many of the references in this book. And, in some of the later chapters he dives into evolution science, which can become rather technical. "
1,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,5,"The fabulous and far more gripping follow up to 'An Appetite for Wonder,' this book chronicles the great biologist's life from the publication of 'The Selfish Gene' on, and it's a very variegated and intriguing life indeed. Sectioned out into themes, it gets better and better as it goes on, and is certainly of interest to anyone who is familiar with the man's work."
2,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,4,"This is a rather better-constructed book than An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist, his autobiography of the first half of his life. In this, he drops the chronological approach and it’s more thematic. It starts as it ends, with a 70th birthday party in his honour, and in between covers his research, public speaking, media presentations, encounters with a diverse range of humanity, and of course his writing.It’s great to read vicariously about a life so rich in experience that he is able to rub shoulders with other world-class scientists, philosophers, Nobel prize-winners and royalty. There is nothing in the way of self-promotion or name-dropping about all this, in fact Dawkins writes about himself and his interactions with others in an amusing and self-deprecating way. Quite the opposite of how he has been maligned as an extremist by so many religious groups. Yes, in his books he can be iconoclastic and a little tiresome when preaching to the converted, but it’s clear from what he says here that he’s more disappointed than angry when the reaction to his arguments is emotional rather than rational.As I said, he’s written this thematically rather than chronologically. Thus there are entertaining chapters on his interactions with the media, his publishing ventures (which of course he is most famous for) and his scientific research – again as in the first book, there are several rather endearing vignettes of some quite mundane work with insect life.  If I had one criticism it would be that rather than describe his life around his writing – how he managed it, what he was thinking, etc - he tends to summarize the main themes of each of his books as though he were reviewing them himself. While it is rather nice to have summaries of the books that I haven’t (yet) read, I read this one to know more about Dawkins, and I didn’t really get that. On the other hand, outside their work, does it really matter that much whether a scientist’s private life is a mess or not? "
3,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43365829-sharon-a,4,"I feel this book helped me understand Dawkins considerably more than I did previously. It also deepened my appreciation for him and his life's work - in zoology, evolutionary biology, religion, philosophy, and science in society. There is no sign of him being mean-spirited, and I have not seen that from him in his daily life either. I may not always agree with him but he presses me with his arguments to examine why I do not. In that way, he is a great teacher. His emotions are simple, direct, and natural, while his intellect is deep and thought is complex. I do not think he will be remembered by history as a bully or strident or insulting (none of which do I think he is); he will be memorialized and regarded for pushing us to think and for challenging society on some topics (and certain people and bad ideas) that REALLY needed to be challenged. Other than some long quotes from other sources, and poems that I could do without, this was a good read for those who know Richard Dawkins' work. "
4,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1249392-mysteryfan,3,"I received an ARC for this book. The worst part is the illustrations weren't there. I'll have to get the final version just for those. Richard Dawkins is a renowned biologist, atheist, and lecturer. This book is funny, informative, digressive, and both educational and entertaining. It's hard to summarize it otherwise. Some of it is biographical - I didn't know he was married to a former Doctor's Companion and it was fun learning about Oxford pedagogical techniques. I loved his descriptions of scientists he knew and worked with, especially the other Simonyi lecturers. It's a good read."

10,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13384265-moshe-mikanovsky,4,"More a memoir than a biography, Dawkins has a way to make me feel right about changes I have made in my life. Even when I don't fully understand the intricate logic or scientific deductions, Dawkins is a pleasure to listen to. Reading his own book, as much posh or old-world-Oxford/British-intellectually as Dawkins might sound, he does his best to explain himself in a plain way. This book has a lot of many different small stories from his experience in the academia, lecturing, public media etc. Splendid!"
11,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,3,"Dear Dr Dawkins FRS, etc. Remember how I said, ""Fewer biology lessons"" in the first volume of your autobiography? If only you had listened. You retain the superb command of language and wit that marked An Appetite For Wonder, and the eccentric stories of scientists - especially of the Oxbridge species - remain appreciated.But the long, long final chapter that sums up your chief theories and publications is a little dense for the space allotted and, dare I say in all humility, for the purposes of this book. Which is the endearing, intimate, entertaining, and almost inspiring story of your life.But I'd certainly recommend Volume I and the first two-thirds of Volume II to fellow readers.Yours, etc."
12,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3246379-j-d,3,"It’s always fascinating to read a memoir by a great scientific mind. This book, although plagued by some digressions (recognized at the outset by the author) is no exception, and it gives a tour (a deluxe, limo tour) of the thinking behind a life devoted to Biology and to argue philosophical positions in world which complains a bit too loudly about those who have no faith.Whether you agree or not with Dawkins’ strong stand against organized religion, he has produced some of the best science books for the layman on the late 20th Century. More opinionated and less romantic than Carl Sagan, his work nevertheless dug deep into the area where science and philosophy intermix (I still remember the day I bought The Selfish Gene, a book like no other on his time). Here, we get to learn about Dawkins’ personal life, the enviable lot of some of the smartest people in the world he’s met in his professional journey. We also glance behind the curtains to see what made his writings so influential. This memoir component is the best of this book—plus an odd fascination with poetry I didn’t expect from him.The part that’s less easy to go through and gives the reader some “reading pains” is the excessive detail—and the frustrating lack of it, when trying to understand the bulk—one finds about each and every one of his books. For those works I haven’t read, the experience is confusing; for those I did, I wanted to go through them again, to see what I’ve missed. I also cared very little about the books’ many editions and their differences.Other than containing some technical material that might’ve been best if left out, this is a worth-reading and unusual memoir, an inner look to and by an influential scientist that calls attention to some of the great debates in science and culture."
13,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2892211-jason-mills,3,"This second volume of Dawkins' memoirs tells of his work in science, his life as an Oxford scholar and his wider career as a writer, broadcaster and public figure. The Prof seems a bit more affably revealing in this volume, telling us a little about his marriages and his daughter, as well his unconcealed irritation with the sometimes obtuse claims of his American counterpart Stephen Jay Gould.There are lots of pleasing academic anecdotes and appealing picture sections; but the long closing section reviewing the themes of his books mostly feels like a retread of old ground.Discussion of some of the non-scientific controversies in which he's also been embroiled could have been interesting: the twitter storms; the little media furore over the closure of his web forum; or his later legal spat with that site's manager, to whom Dawkins had once dedicated a book.It's a breezy, lively, interesting, though safe, autobiography."
14,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4826004-kirsten,4,"Such an interesting life he's led, dedicated to science and reason. Covers the second half of his life, mid-thirties on. So positive about all the people he's met along the way, with some very specific exceptions, which seems to reflect his general outlook on life. He comes across as very secure and confident about his role in advancing science and the ""new atheism"" movement, but not overblown or egotistical. Very readable, although I did scan a little of the more intense descriptions of his research towards the end."
15,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4687167-chris,4,So much of this book took the form of what I'd imagine having Dawkins as my tutor at Oxford would be like: educational and full of amazing stories about the coolest places and people in the scientific world. But he also spends an exhausting amount of time later in the book talking about his computer programs and I just can't get excited about that part of his life at all. It's ultimately what kept me from giving this book 5 stars. 
16,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5506324-caroline-smith,1,"Putting aside my distaste for Richard Dawkins, the book was engaging, well written, and more personal than his previous memoir. His writing ages well, and there's a reason that he's called one of the best nonfiction writers of our time. "
17,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32301233-mybookishrants,5,It was encouraging to hear him humility and how he worked with so many great minds to produce the science and literature I've come to know.
18,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,3,"There is a clarity of thought that Richard Dawkins possesses that is unmissable in his writings. Whether he is talking about animal behaviour or the pitfalls of organized religion, things are crystal clear from how he articulates it all. The same extends to his books when he explores his own life and what he has been through. This is the second in his series of biographies where the focus is mostly on Dawkins life through his work. A lot of it is about what really goes on in his mind when he is writing, speaking, talking or appearing in the public. As Steven Pinker puts it on the book jacket blurb, it can closely be approximated to eavesdropping on the mind of Dawkins.There isn’t much of new ground that is covered in this book in terms of scientific ideas for it is almost fully about the behind the scenes happenings. Dawkins gives a glimpse of what it means to be a don at Oxford and a time spent living between academic years. The book then proceeds to various arenas of Dawkins’s work – islands where he is doing research, television appearances, Christmas Lectures to kids and so on. Dawkins possesses a dry wit that he sprinkles all along the way as he moves on, it is the kind to give you a little smile at times.Not really a fantastic book but provided you like Dawkins, this would be a good addition. Nothing more or less."
19,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7500502-michael-cabus,3,"It shines when discussing biology and academia. It becomes boorish and boring when it discusses atheism. It’s not the topic or any offence personally to the idea of atheism, it’s really just that discussing atheism as a philosophy seems superfluous, like a dinner host talking endlessly about the desert they never got round to making. One wants something in its place at least if it will be such a topic. I did however find myself inspired by his relish for scientific inquiry and the brave pursuit of intellectual curiosity. And I added several books to my to read list I would have never heard about before. It is Neil Tyson’s appearance in the book that is most inspiring as a way of understanding education and truth. Tyson’s advocation that educators put the truth out there and communicate that truth with a sensitivity of context is lost on Dawkins at least in this book. And until it’s taken to heart I don’t believe Dawkins will ever be meaningful in the way he wants: to be a force for rational thought. "
20,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7973110-lin,4,"I really enjoyed learning about Richard Dawkins's career in science and his anecdotes were quite entertaining. What an interesting journey he's had! Since I've read some of his books already, the last section that reviews their themes was my least favorite, and the reason I knocked it down a star. If I ignored that last section (which is almost 1/3 of the book), then I would have given it 5 stars."

23,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Brief Candle in the Dark is the red-hot, scandal-filled memoir from the UK’s hottest atheist. From the sex behaviors of wasps to a raunchy prowl through scientific conferences, Dawkins leaves nothing to the imagination in this revealing tell-all filled with juicy gossip and sizzling behind-the-scenes biological action. The book has it all: sex, wasps, Darwin, conferences, education, sex, secrets, neckties, atheism, sex, scientific colleagues, phenotypes, speciation, academic debates and, of course, sex. Sorry, got a little carried away there. But seriously, you can’t have evolution without S.E.X.!!Actually the book is Richard Dawkins’ memoir of covering the period from 1976 and the publishing of The Selfish Gene until the present (his life leading up to 1976 is covered in his 2013 memoir An Appetite for Wonder). Dawkins roughly organizes the book chronologically and roughly again by topic, although he frequently digresses onto subjects tangential to that on hand and of course interjects information relating to Darwin and evolution because he is presumably unable to help himself. The controversy that has surrounded him at times never seems to penetrate his dry, English reserve and one is left with the impression of a man with a passion for science, intelligence and discovery of the truths of the world, wherever they may lie. Dawkins also recaps what he believes to be his most significant contributions to the field of biology. These mainly involve thought experiments such as: Mt. Improbable, the selfish gene, memes and the extended phenotype which encourage individuals to approach the field with an entirely new mindset. Overall the book is good, though not riveting. If you’re wondering what the life of an extremely successful science communicator is like, this book is a good place to start. It makes me wistful for the academic life I never had and rather made me wish I had stuck it out through a PhD."
24,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24616271-stephen-flanagan,4,"This is the second half of Dawkins's autobiography, and it does read quite differently to the first. I always find it interesting to understand what was happening in an authors personal life when they penned their greatest works. This book does go some of the way to uncovering Richard Dawkins, the real, living, breathing, feeling grown up child, with all the wonder in the world buzzing around his mind in his eloquent if sometimes strident rhetoric. I'm always torn with Dawkins, I of course enjoy his purely scientific work and I feel he has brought understanding to millions in the field of genetics and natural selection; but I suspect I would enjoy it more if it came with the sort of humbleness and modesty you witness with the likes of Attenborough. Having said that, I do understand his impatience with the indoctrinated, lacking in critical thinking elements of modern life that he so wants to educate the world out of. An interesting read."
25,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41127452-steven-wetter,5,"Had me captivated from cover to cover....The second installment of Richard Dawkins autobiography, this captivating reminiscence of his life from around the time of his publication of The Selfish Gene keeps you wanting to read more from beginning to end. Mostly a recollection of past projects, from scientific experiments, television documentaries, debates, parties, etc. Also some fond memories of past and present associations in the scientific, literary, film and academic communities. This book truly gives you an idea of who and what inspired and or influenced Dr. Dawkins throughout the latter half of his life. Certain passages really made me feel as if I had actually experienced some of those spectacular moments in his life that he was describing. He has lead an exciting and productive life. The world is a better place because of his contributions and we as a society should be inspired and truly grateful for those contributions and his eagerness to share them. "
26,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,3,"This book gave me insight into what it means to be in the top 1% of academia.The work is more along the lines of a personal diary of thoughts and rememberances of the author's presentations, invitations to watch squid hunting or travel to the Galapagos, dinners and award ceremonies. It stirs up images of secret Oxford alumnis meeting in wood paneled rooms drinking from port snifters and singing the college anthem. Mr. Dawkins is part of a generation of scientists that had the fortune to be in the business when technology exploded and advancements were happening in leaps in bounds. There's a bit of little Jack Horner here (he stuck his thumb in a pie and pulled out a meme.) There's no mistaking it though, he enjoyed it.I've liked what I've read from him, but I was expecting something of more substance."

I often get lost with his biology lessons since I'm not the best science student but I admire his honesty, bravery, authenticity and work ethic. if you want a book about Richard Dawkins, this is the one!"

Even with all this repetitiveness, Dawkins makes science and his life pretty interestindg, if not funny.I specially liked everytime his good friend Douglas Adams is mentioned, and how I wish he would have had the time to live more to write his autobiography, among plenty of other books of course."

This is a book about his life and about all the people that have had an effect on him. If you know only about his work as an atheist and judge him because of his tweets, this book might be just for you. He has lived astonishing life and thank ... him .. he's still working and carrying on his career. I've read all his books, most of them several times, and finally I got this ""backstage"" view of the processes behind them.

41,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63384722-alex,4,"Brief Candle in the Dark is part two of Richard Dawkins’ autobiography. Picking up where part one ended, it covers Dawkins’ life after the publication his first book The Selfish Gene, but unlike the first volume this isn’t in chronological order. Opening and closing with his 70th birthday dinner celebration, the first two-thirds is comprised of anecdotes that are grouped into chapters by themes. We learn of his time at Oxford, visits to various countries and recollections of interviews, debates and television shows. One of the defining points of Dawkins’ life was the establishment of, and his role as the Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science. He recalls a combination of staleness following two decades of tutoring, and a belief that he could have a larger positive influence by devoting his attention to a wider audience outside of Oxford. This drive to enlighten the public can be seen in the changing audience of his books, from technical (e.g. The Extended Phenotype), to youth (The Magic of Reality) and general (The Greatest Show on Earth, The God Delusion). The other attribute that epitomises Dawkins is his love of the arts and desire for the merger of scientific and literary cultures (into what C.P. Snow called the ‘third’ culture). This is reflected by his fondness of poetry – including some of Dawkins’ own featuring in the autobiography – and his books themselves as part of a wider trend of professional scientists writing to both the professional and layman (such as Stephen Hawking, Steven Pinker, Carl Sagan and Daniel Kahneman among others). He expresses pride in the fact that all his previous books are still in print and regards them as the culmination of his life’s work and achievement. The last third of the book then turns to a series of short essays tying in the key ideas and concepts from across all his work. Although the overall thematic structure tends to wander a tad, it is still an enjoyable read and I never tire from Dawkins’ superb explanatory ability, command of the English language and entertaining narrative voice."
42,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83080614-medmax,4,"Dawkins autobiography 2nd part. Stories of his life. Enjoyable stories with a lot of highly intelligent people and interesting ideas.Dawkins is a very good story teller and orator. Met a lot of interesting people, was married 3 times, a social person. Wrote 12 books, all non-fiction for a lay audience and recorded all of them plus some others. Dawkins is mainly a talker, a communicator of science, not a scientist. He coined phrases like ""meme"", ""god's utility function"" and ""survival machine"". But what were his original contributions? Not so clear. Having the idea? Maybe. Formulating it in a publication for the first time? Probably. Pupularising it? Yes. Formulating a theory? No. Doing some field work? Yes. Yes, all biologists have to do field work. That means looking at birds or other animals (better birds, because Darwin did that), preferably somewhere in the jungle. For the math and the programming he had to rely on other people's help. ""All science is either physics or stamp collecting.""In 1995, he was appointed Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford. Fitting for Dawkins. Simony is a rich Microsoft guy and Dawkins talked him into giving a large sum to Oxford. And then his atheism... Also worth mentioning: Stephen Jay Gould is a clown and a fraud. Dawkins deserves some credit for noticing that."
43,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28904428-petch-manopawitr,4,"Interesting memoir by one of the most well known living scientists. This book is a collection of anecdotes from Dawkins' professional life after the famous book 'selfish gene'. He had a breakthrough fairly early in his career and it seems he has been on a lofty side of science ever since, especially with an institution like Oxford and worldwide publicity. The book gives you an inside tour of his remarkable life that get him to interact with many other world renown scientists and authors. He has also been very active about science communication, publishing a dozen of books - some are very impactful and become a classic like selfish gene, god delusion. He also did several documentary, a famous public talk like Christmas dinner talk programme with the BBC etc. The closed door stories of all those are interesting. Because of his work on evolutionary biology, he has been a prominent athiest and that seems to have a big impact on his interaction with the public. As a memoir, it is a bit dry and could have been much more entertaining and engaging. You could feel the sense of dark humuor, his wit and his complex thought. If you are familiar with this works, this book must have been even more interesting. It makes me want to have a go with his works and also the first memoir 'appetite for wonder'. He is still active with his foundation promoting science and reason. "
44,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73252364-mario-di-maggio,3,"It was great to be reminded why Richard Dawkins is one of my three all-time heroes. I SO agree with his approach to criticising religion and superstitious thinking. My life experience has taught me that gentle persuasion and being sensitive to other people's (wrongly held) beliefs can only accomplish so much. Sometimes people need to be slapped around the face (figuratively speaking) to help them sober up. It was wonderful discovering so many behind-the-scenes details eg. how the Simonyi Professorship Chair for the Public Understanding of Science was established; how Richard Leakey carried his amputated legs in hand luggage through the airport; details of the rivalry between Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould; how Bill Gates and Microsoft programmers surprised Dawkins by grilling him intellectually, etc. It was also brilliantly entertaining coming across many of the highlights of his other 12 books. What an amazing life this man has led. What a carefully crafted academic career he has enjoyed and how he's exploited it to the full. Unselfish and uncompromising giants like Richard Dawkins make me feel proud to be human (and that's something, considering how jaded I'm becoming in old age)."

Petered our just before the end, though. It’s definitely a book I’d return to even with my ever growing lists of must read books. What I liked the most were the anecdotes such as the Concorde Fallacy and his explanation of the tragedy of the commons that was much better explained than some social policy literature I’ve read. I also enjoyed the parts about the ‘empty chair tactic’ and the double blind trials and kinesiology. He really does understand science, philosophy and truth and the parts that delved into why the Oxford University interview questions have evolved in such a way is precisely because they are testing the teachability of students and their line of reasoning (and whether they have one). Only flaws (although not really flaws - only bits I didn’t appreciate) were the way poems sometimes punctuated the prose (why?), all the name dropping although this way sometimes necessary and interesting and the very real sore spot that he has that he is not and is not considered a funny man. You can’t have everything, Richard. "

Some of that time is spent with them, in conversation (or not) and at least half of the time is spent by myself. During the alone time, I’ve listened to podcasts or music mostly, which is always very enjoyable. I really love that time, it makes driving so much more bearable. Though, for as long as I can remember I have been compiling a list of books that I also want to devour, but haven’t allowed myself, because of time and cost. Recently, I discovered the ability to loan and listen to digital audiobooks from the library and i am so excited to get back to my never-ending list of books. To start, I just finished Richard Dawkin’s, ‘A Brief Candle in the Dark’ and now I’m on to James Surowiecki’s, ‘The Wisdom of Crowds.’ I plan to post the books I’m reading, because, like music and movies, I love the ability they have to open our mind to the world and inspire powerful, beautiful thoughts and ideas. Like always, I would additionally love to hear about the books you are enjoying too."
47,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33761275-katherine-tirado-ryen,5,"Richard Dawkins’ “A Brief Candle in the Dark: My Life in Science” is a reflection of Dawkins’ acclaim as a respected biologist from Oxford as well as his fame/notoriety in raising the consciousness of atheism throughout the world. I’ve always appreciated Dawkins’ no-nonsense and unapologetic approach to science in education. He makes the argument that if public schools teach creationism via Christianity, they should also teach with equal reverence all other monotheistic and polytheistic creation myths...a path which would fall apart quickly as religions don’t view each other equally but are inherently atheistic to all religions but their own. In any case, that is not science, and it is imperative for students to freely seek answers to hard questions, and not rely on the truth-ending aphorism, “If science can’t explain it, the answer must be God.” Progress cannot be made with such a chokehold on intellectual curiosity. This book also makes me want to YouTube Dawkins’ Christmas lectures. Wish we had that in the United States!"
48,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25341472-gianfranco-nerdi,3,"This is the second volume of R. Dawkins' autobiography. This time, the author dispenses with the chronological approach adopted in the previous book, and chooses to approach his life by themes or topics. Again, there really isn't much to say - some chapters are interesting, some are pretty dull and boring. Especially the last chapter, over 100 pages long. Now, I have nothing about authors summarizing their work, but Jesus, have some fucking mercy, the chapter is pretty dense with facts and theories already, and you're making it over 120 pages long and putting it at the end of the volume! It was a torture to read. I have nothing bad to say about Dawkins' style; it is almost impeccable, as was logical to expect. Overall, I feel like there was no real need for this book and that, all things considered, it hasn't given me much."
49,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29348081-jill,2,"I was a fan of ""The God Delusion"" so I thought I would be a fan of this too. I was mistaken.Normally I will read a book to the bitter end regardless of how bad it is, but this just wasn't enjoyable to read. It wasn't necessarily badly written- in fact it would probably get high marks from some college English professor, but for that same reason it was pretty tedious and boring for a fairly average reader for me. (I'm no dolt- I have a professional doctorate degree in the medical field but just the first few chapters of this book made me feel like I was in over my head) The not-so-subtle undertone of ""I'm much smarter than you and here is why"" was just too overpowering for me. Maybe it got better if I would have just fought through a little longer, but I've decided life is too short to read books that aren't doing anything for me."
50,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69651448-abay-bektursun,5,"As Dan Dennett described RD's Extended Phenotype: ""... Is The Extended Phenotype science or philosophy? It is both; it is science, certainly, but it is also what philosophy should be, and only intermittently is: a scrupulously reasoned argument that opens our eyes to a new perspective, clarifying what had been murky and ill-understood, and giving us a new way of thinking about topics we thought we already understood..."", I would describe this book the same way, but instead of giving a perspective just on genes and phenotypes, it also gives outlook on everyday human life through the eyes of a genius. "
51,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,4,"Like Daniel Dennett, Dawkins is just remarkably likable. In the literal sense, as you can see. His musings are entertaining and interesting, and his inability to stop talking about the ideas behind The Selfish Gene is kinda endearing in the way it contextualizes and humanizes him. My one regret is that I am constitutionally opposed to the remnants of the British Gentry/Imperials he represents by default and I kinda squirm inside and hate myself for liking him. It's not fair, and I keep telling my brain to shut up, but there it is. "
52,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214409-jeff-wikstrom,4,"Definitely a set of memoirs and not a biography. It rambles quite a bit, but Richard Dawkins has had a magnificent life full of experiences, achievements, and amazing people. I've added a few names and titles to my reading list. I've loved his work due to his ability to communicate science, specifically evolution to a wide audience. This books shows how human he is. I really have a new affection for him that I would not expect."
53,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,1,"I needed an audiobook in a hurry for my workout and I downloaded this one from the library with a search on science and now available. I selected this because I have enjoyed many books on science from the author Richard Dawkins, but I had no time to read the review.The book is not about science, but rather about Dawkins. I have no interest in Dawkins himself, so I was even more bored than usual for the one hour I listened to the book for my workout"
54,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18868797-mike-histand,4,"A biography/memoir of the author's grandfather, artist and true hero of WWI. Graphic in many parts for the macbre war scenes as well as the grandfather's passion for art and painting his whole and very long life. Anti-war manifesto by inference, but also telling a very poignant story of a stalwart, sensitive man who succumbs to life changing choices made for him, but who remains faithful to their consequences in an inwardly agonizing life."
55,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860910-linda,4,"While this book entertained me, it also informed me. Some of the lengthy scientific explanations, however did not hold my interest, and I skimmed those parts. Dawkins has certainly led an interesting life, never shying away from expressing his opinions. Personally, I share his views on religion, and am pleased to hear them stated with such back up support. I would love to be in an audience at one of his talks, expecting that he is as entertaining/informing a speaker as he is a writer."
56,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10601562-shawn,4,"Dawkins on his life from about 35 on... he tells of travels, relationships, his philosophies, and his books. The memoir is told by theme rather than chronologically which allows Dawkins to follow ideas from beginning to end without having to leave threads and return to them. My favorite portions (besides thinking that I have been quite the underachiever) were when he talked about his daughter, and his books. Both areas obviously sources of pride and listening to him talking about them the warmth he feels came strongly through. I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about a life in science that has been well lived and fascinating."
57,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9295930-debby,4,"I am glad I started reading Richard Dawkins with this book ,that gave me appetite to read more and watch lectures online .Loved the anecdotes ,the wit ,about the books ,the way of thinking . See this book as a starting point for more reading and introduction to our day science writers and philosophy . "
58,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17172389-norman-felchle,4,"I'm surprised how many people just think ""Oh...the anti-god guy""Sure, he's a ""militant"" atheist, (not that there's anything wrong with that) but he's much more than that....and not an ogre.I think it would be a mistake for a person to write him off just because they don't share his views on religion."
59,0062288431,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9368697-shishir,3,"The book was more a journal of his experiences – I enjoyed learning of the human interactions in his life. The book is largely well written, but overly long for my liking. His view on Evolution and Religion came through clearly – God - The blind watch maker"
