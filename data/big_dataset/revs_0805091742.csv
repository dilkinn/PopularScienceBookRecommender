0,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"The Checklist Manifesto is not as helpful as Gawande's previous books - especially Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance which improved my business quite a bit with the injunction to 'count something' (so we did, everything, and saw the patterns. You should see my spreadsheets now! (Just as an aside, as an artist I am good at statistics I can see the patterns. Can't do maths though, never even got to GCSE level on that).Where this book really made a difference is in operating theatres. They are now run like airplanes. First there is a very short briefing where any of the team can say anything without regard to status, and then there are the checklists to make sure that all eventualities, equipment and item retrieval - swabs put into your body are supposed to be counted and then accounted for at the end. Gawande is so easy to read because he mixes his advice with proof and anecdotes, some of them personal. These sort of books, regardless of the subject are almost a genre in themselves. Think: Oliver Sacks for neurology and Jon Ronson for somewhat scandalous pop culture, but there are many more. Very enjoyable, light, non-fiction.Recommended for people who are allergic to self-help books (me) but work in a complex industry and would like some advice that doesn't look like it because as Oscar Wilde said, ""The only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. It is never of any use to oneself.""Read March 3, 2011. Review rewritten Dec. 15th, 2015"

Maybe a year?*cough*Well, at some point you have to look at them and say, ""I may not be finishing that one.""Or, alternatively, you can look at it and say, ""Man, fuck this book.""It's not like there was anything terribly wrong with the book or anything. I just...I feel like I got the idea pretty early on.Premise:Humans are to the point where we've uncovered so much knowledge that human minds can't hold all of it. AND processes have become not only long, but very complex in some cases. Rather than count on simplification or drilling in knowledge, a checklist can be a really great solution.The best example related to flying bombers in the 30's. Basically, the new planes were complicated enough that they kept crashing until a pre-flight checklist was instituted, and then everything was rad.In my personal life, the closest thing I have to flying a bomber is passengering on a commercial flight. Going without a checklist, I've shown up at destinations missing everything from toothbrushes (replaceable), to any sort of reasonable footwear (more a problem), to swim trunks (which is actually on purpose because swimming is for suckers).The problem I have with checklists is that I'm really awesome at using them to replace ACTUALLY DOING THE THING for which the checklist was created. If I'm going to do some serious cleaning, I might get it in my head to do a checklist first so that I don't waste any time. Why clean the spiders out of the curtains before cleaning the beetles out of the kitchen? Might as well do beetles first, then spiders, right? And centipedes....well, we always get rid of centipedes immediately. I don't know which dimension they escaped from, but I do know that it's a dark place that I would like to avoid.Anyway, by the time I get the cleaning checklist and necessary bug taxonomy notes wrapped up and bound by a plastic spiral at Kinko's, I feel like I've already done a lot of work. Which makes it hard to rally and do the actual work.Gawande's other books, Complications and Better, also had really simple messages explained in a way even us dum-dums could understand. But the message of this one, though important, was easy even for me, Archduke of Dum-Dums, to understand, and it might not have required a whole book. Now, I didn't get to be Archduke by making great choices, so it's entirely possible that there is some great stuff later in the book that I didn't get to. So if someone tells you this is a really great book and you have nagging doubts, just remember that those doubts were planted by a guy who uses a spatula for a scepter to punctuate the royal addresses he makes aloud to absolutely no one in his insect-filled kitchen."
2,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/608861-laura,4,"Before starting, I read quite a few reviews that described it as an extended magazine entry. And I went in skeptical; I was curious how much one could say about checklists. I see lists as a great way to get things done. As long as they are simple and directed, they can focus my attention and keep me on task. So I went in a list enthusiast, but still skeptical. This book argues checklists help us be more effective with complex tasks, by focusing us on what needs to be done and is often overlooked in emergency situations. Gawande recognizes that lists should not create bureaucratic nightmares. They are there to increase accuracy and prevent errors. Efforts should be made to test and refine them. What are things people are likely to remember (don't add them to the list) and what are things people are not likely to remember (put them on the list). This process means experts in the field need to make the checklists. By creating a space for everyone to check in with the process, the checklist can empower all team members and allow them to speak up when things are not working. This empowerment is the true value of the book. While complex tasks (medicine and architecture) used to be handle by a single master, this book argues that our modern world is too complex for a single master. Instead, a checklist guides the decision making process of a team. If a step can not be accomplished, people need a space to speak up or be authorized to make the best decision. (Example of authorizing people to make decisions - Walmart's decision to let staff do whatever needed to be done during Hurricane Katrine) When possible, the team should discuss events that are not accomplished as planned. However such discussion is not always possible. He acknowledges some tasks lend themselves to check lists (surgery preparation, airplane takeoffs, building buildings) and some do not (raising children). He argues - quite rightly - that children are unique. You can't create a checklist to deal with all children. Basically Gawande believes what Einstein said about simplicity - everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. And I think there is a strong satisfaction to finding a simple solution. I liked the different examples. Because I felt it helped open the possibility of checklists, while also maintaining perspective on the challenges. The exploration of different checklists will either appeal to you as a reader or you will feel it is going over the same information. I liked it...**Follow Up Thoughts** When I read the book, I realized that you can't raise kids with a checklist. But you could help kids manage their time and responsibilities with checklists. I think some kids would be very drawn to the routine of a daily checklist. So a checklist could be a positive teaching tool. "
3,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1175951-matt,3,"My having read - and enjoyed - a 200-page book about using checklists suggests that I'm a cocktail party nightmare, but I found this to be very much a worthy read. At the heart of it, this is really a book about management and efficiency. It's got a lot more ""manifesto"" in it than ""how-to"" though, which makes it both easy to plow through and easier for mass consumption. I actually wish it were more scientific and systematic than it turned out to be, but even as it rambles, it's thoughtful and interesting, with many good anecdotes.I really do think this guy is onto something. A 200-page book about checklists will really get you to think about checklists. What makes it interesting is that it's not quite like you're reading ""The Hammer Manifesto"", where everything improves if it's pounded by a hammer. The devil is in the details, and improperly specified checklists are more a hindrance than a benefit. A checklist can't be too cumbersome, or you'll lose efficiency. It also mustn't be authoritarian. Gawande's idea of effective checklists are those that free decision-makers up to use their expertise and will make for a more ""democratic"" decision-making procedure.The basic puzzle Gawande wants to solve is that in his field of medicine, as medical knowledge has advanced, the field has become so complex that no single individual is likely to both possess all the cutting-edge knowledge and expertise required for every contingency as well as be mentally prepared to take the right action all the time. Errors in communication and inconsistencies in preparation are proportionally more responsible for more fatalities these days than in the past. He compares being a physician to two jobs that rely heavily on checklists and procedure, airline pilot and building engineer.For example: ""Determining whether a structure … is built to code and fit for occupancy involves more knowledge and complexity than any one inspector could possibly have. So although inspectors do what they can to oversee a building's construction, mostly they make certain the builders have the proper checks in place and then have them sign affidavits attesting that they themselves have ensured that the structure is up to code. Inspectors disperse the power and the responsibility.""This is not necessarily what I expected when I picked up the book. ""That routine requires a balancing a number of virtues: freedom and discipline, craft and protocol, specialized ability and group collaboration. And for checklists to help achieve that balance, they have to take almost opposing forms. They supply a set of checks to ensure the stupid but critical stuff is not overlooked and they supply another set of checks to ensure people talk and coordinate and accept responsibility while nonetheless being left the power to manage the nuances and unpredictabilities the best they know how.""Not being a doctor or pilot, this stuff was a bit beyond useful for me, but still fascinating. Speaking more generally about the details of checklist-writing, he advocates certain principles. ""Bad checklists are vague and imprecise. They are too long; they are hard to use; they are impractical. They are made by desk jockeys with no awareness of the situations in which they are to be deployed. They treat the people using the tools as dumb and try to spell out every single step. They turn people's brains off rather than turn them on. Good checklists, on the other hand, are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in the most difficult situations. They do not try to spell out everything -- a checklist cannot fly a plane. Instead, they provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps -- the ones that even the highly skilled professionals using them could miss.""If I have any specific complaint, it's that after reading 200 pages about checklists I still feel like I've only grasped the tip of the iceberg, although I'm not likely to run out and clamor for the footnoted version just yet. Still, I'd have loved to see an appendix with a few good checklists in there. Yep, I'm pretty much a cocktail party nightmare."
4,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Over the last couple of years I’ve been studying and some of the subjects I have done have presented me with an assessment rubric. This is a kind of checklist which sums up everything that is good and bad about checklists to me. The first is that a checklist only really makes sense for highly repeatable behaviours. There is a really good reason why they work so well when landing planes and performing surgery. Things can go catastrophically wrong in either of these, but mostly they go wrong in somewhat predictable ways. No, that’s not quite right. It is like when I represented people in the trade union – people are infinitely inventive in getting themselves into trouble, but getting them out of trouble again generally follows a very predictable path. Jet engines can stop in all manner of ways, but really, whether they have stopped because of ice or geese, in the end you are still going to want to land the damn plane.The big lesson here is that checklists can very easily become self-defeating. Checklists aren’t recipes, they are not meant to tell you all of the steps necessary to do any particular thing – if they did that they would be so long as to be completely useless. Instead, the point of an effective checklist is to ensure that you have done all of the things that really must be done – that, if they haven’t been done, then all hell will break loose. There is an interesting discussion here about fires in operating theatres, for example. They decided not to include a checklist for this in a group of checklists they were working on, not because fires don’t happen or that they are not terrifying, but because they occur too infrequently and a good checklist looks for low-hanging fruit. Checklists should also start from the assumption that the person using them is an expert. This is why they are not really recipes. The point is not to teach a surgeon how to take out your appendix, it is to make sure they go through the kinds of checks that have been shown surgeons tend to miss ‘some of the time’ and that cause problems when missed ‘most of the time’.In a sense, and this is a point that is made really well in the book, we all tend to think that checklists are important for other people to follow. We know that we don’t make mistakes – obviously, that goes without saying – but other people are infinitely stupid and so it is a really good idea that they are forced to make doubly sure. If the price we must pay to make sure stupid people don’t make mistakes is for us to have to follow a checklist too, well, so be it. The fact we are deluded about our own abilities should be our primary assumption, but never seems to be…Checklists need to be comprehensive in the sense that they should be evidence based – what normally goes wrong – and culturally implemented – how do you trip people to make them check before they do what needs to be done? You see, we humans are really terrible at following procedures. We get bored. A computer, on the other hand, is really good at following procedures. In fact, that is pretty much all a computer ever does. This is the reason why we tend to forget the milk we were supposed to pick up on the way home from work – even though we might have reminded ourselves just as we were leaving. We are victims of habit to the extent that something new tends to be forgotten. Unfortunately, we aren’t even all that good at habit and so even things we do over and over again, we tend to mess up now and again as our minds wonder.The advice here, then, is that checklists can make a huge difference, but that checklists, like poems, are very hard to write. And that is true for much the same reason. In a good checklist you have to leave out what isn’t necessary, but make sure you put in what is. There is an inverse relationship operating here – the easier it sounds to write a checklist that ‘just has important things’ the harder it actually is to do. I believe the best people to write checklists are those who admits to making mistakes – but then, I think people who admit to making mistakes are the best people anyway. They tend to be grossly mistreated (‘she admits to making mistakes, what a loser!’), are infinitely rare – but invariably worth their weight in gold.If writing a checklist is a remarkably difficult task, following one can be just as hard. As I said, I’ve had to hand in assignments that have required following assessment rubrics. In theory these should be easy – make sure you have answered all of the questions and you win! But what is really called for is a change in culture. You need to remember to go back and check through the checklist before handing in the essay, and really check it, not just glance over it. This is a very hard thing to do once you have convinced yourself you have done ‘everything’ that needs to be done already. On one assignment this year I did not address an entire assessment criteria – it turned out I was not the only one to leave this particular criteria out. It was not in the least surprising to me that this was the criteria that asked me to detail how I would change what had occurred. This was the question that was asking me to be creative – and being creative is the hardest thing and therefore the most likely thing to be left to the end (based on those most the dangerous words, ‘I’ll just come back to that later’). But without having some procedural ‘cultural’ trigger to actually go through the checklist one last time before handing in the assignment, many of us completely missed this question and lost what ought to have been fairly easy marks.The problem is that checklist are:Hard to writeHard to followEasy to convince ourselves we’ve followed when we haven’tOnly good for more or less predictable outcomes and processes.Given these limitations this book does make it clear that they do make substantial improvements to performance if they are well constructed, easy to use and effectively used.My main problem, though, is that checklists come at the problem from the wrong end of the telescope. Checklists should be used as a ‘when everything else fails’ solution. The first solution we should be looking for is not, how do we restrict the options available by writing more or less optional procedures, we should be redesigning out dangers. Procedures lead to cultures of blame, and as I’ve said, humans aren’t terribly good at following procedures. So a checklist is a kind of time bomb waiting to go off in the face of the overworked and overly stressed person who misses one of its line-items. If you really want to improve things, don’t start by writing lists, start by redesigning hazards out of situations. For example, if you are using a guillotine you can have a checklist that says, ‘make sure your hands are not under the blade before operating’ or you can construct the guillotine so that it is impossible for either hand to be under the blade when it cuts. It is infinitely better to make it impossible for the worker to lose their hands, than it is to smugly tell them they don’t have hands because they didn’t properly follow a checklist.But, with that said, I think this is a very interesting book and also know that if I was the sort of person who made more lists I would probably be happier and more successful. Just because this book is a clear victory for the anally retentive, doesn’t make it any less worthwhile."
5,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9385087-shane,2,"How is this book a bestseller? It's not what I'd been hoping for. I expected a grand revelation in this book about a new way to approach making and using checklists to accomplish more, faster. What I got was a bunch of anecdotes about people using checklists successfully, many of them having already done so prior to the author exposing them to the technique. The author, a surgeon, essentially had just discovered the power of checklists himself and was on a mission to get their usage established as a norm in operating rooms worldwide, in hopes of drastically reducing the number of (sometimes fatal) errors made by hospital staff in patient care.What we get in this book is the story of that quest, including the dozen or so stories about others using checklists that gradually brought our author to his realization. Again, like many of these “self-help” books, it really does tend to go on ad infinitum about the same thing: checklists are helpful tools to ensure success. Anybody with a mother or a wife could have told him that. I can’t tell you how many times my wife has told me, “Write it down!” when I need to remember something important. Heck, three years into our marriage we finally figured out the ideal, most efficient and fool-proof way to decorate our Christmas tree each year so that it looks beautiful, the lights are evenly and aesthetically spaced, and takedown is a breeze. Know what we did? We wrote it step-by-step on the inside flap of the box (beginning with “HEY, DUMB ASS!”) in order to get it right year after year from then on.I’ve had a tiny slip of paper from a Chinese takeout fortune cookie taped to the front of my monitor for more than a year. It says, A short pencil is usually better than a long memory any day. Know what that means? Write it down! Checklists are good!Here’s a summary of Dr. Gawande’s book:Intro – Bad stuff happens when people make mistakes, especially in operating rooms. Failures are of two types: Necessary fallibility, which means we simply aren’t equipped to do everything in this world; and ineptitude, which means we have the knowledge and skill but fail to apply it properly. As our knowledge increases in this information age, more and more failures are coming from examples of ineptitude and lack of organization.Chapter 1 – Organization and communication are important in a hospital. They can and do save lives.Chapter 2 – Checklists are important and effective in aviation and emergency medicine.Chapter 3 – There are three types of problems: simple (can be solved like following a recipe); complicated (solution requires multiple people, teams or specialists); and complex (each problem is unique and never the same twice). Oh, and checklists are important in construction too.Chapter 4 – Organization and communication is important. Walmart saved lives faster after Hurricane Katrina than any government agency did. Checklists are also important in rock & roll as well as in the restaurant business.Chapter 5 – Soap works better with step-by-step instruction. Checklists are still important in hospitals.Chapter 6 – Checklists are still important in aviation. They save lives in critical situations at 30,000 feet. Investigate your failures so that you can make future improvements.Chapter 7 – The assertion that checklists are important in hospitals is dramatically tested and further enforced. Yep, they’re important and definitely save lives, even through seemingly mundane steps.Chapter 8 – Checklists are important for financial investors. In the operating room, it’s about more than the checklist itself; it’s about the culture of teamwork and discipline that the checklist instills.Chapter 9 – Once again, checklists are important in an operating room. Our author finds out firsthand when a checklist helps his own OR save a life that he himself almost accidentally terminates through a mistake during a surgical procedure.All in all, CHECKLISTS ARE IMPORTANT. WRITE IT DOWN.Duh.My biggest takeaway? David Lee Roth is not an egomaniacal control freak after all. Well, at least not when it comes to the famous bowl of M&Ms that was in the Van Halen touring contract rider in the ‘80s. The “no brown M&Ms” clause was apparently buried deep in the rider checklist which was mainly full of safety concerns, etc. If DLR came into the dressing room and that bowl of M&Ms was not there, or it still had the browns in it, then they knew they had to walk that checklist item-by-item to see what else had been skipped over or had the corners cut off it.Recommended reading? Not sure. It was OK, and it had some points that will stay with me, but it seemed to be a lot of repetition. Once again, as many of these books seem to be, it was twice as long as necessary to get the point across."
6,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,5,"You have to feel sorry for Atul Gawande's siblings. No matter how brilliant their accomplishments, at any family gathering, we know who is going to be center stage. He's not just your average doctor, he's a surgeon. Specializing in endocrine cancer. This astonishingly good book isn't his first - he's written two others, ""Better"" and ""Complications"". Of course he's a Harvard professor. Oh yes, he does a little magazine writing. For the freaking ""New Yorker"", for crying out loud. His essay in the June 1st 2009 edition analyzing the cost of healthcare Annals of Medicine  is considered to have been most influential in the legislative debate  Sidney awards . He heads up the WHO's ""Safe Surgery Saves Lives"" program. Did I mention the MacArthur ""genius"" award? The kind of brother any sibling would be justified in resenting.I have no idea what kind of a surgeon Dr Gawande might be (though a reasonable guess would be that he is a very good one). I can say that, based on his New Yorker articles, and on this book, that he is an excellent writer. Like his colleague, Malcolm Gladwell, he has the ability to write about material that could easily be boring in the hands of a less gifted author in a way that is clear, engaging, and thought-provoking, without ever being condescending. This serves him well in this book, whose general topic is achieving success in areas of endeavor that are intrinsically complex, where success requires a high level of interdisciplinary cooperation, and where the consequences of failure are catastrophic. In 2006, Gawande was approached by the WHO to help develop a global program to reduce avoidable deaths and harm from surgery. His initial (quite sensible) reaction was to have nothing to do with it, but he eventually agreed to help. What followed from that request is one of the fascinating stories that make up this book, and the author does an excellent job of telling it. That story on its own makes the book worth reading. But Gawande takes things a step further, arguing that the kinds of challenges that make surgery a risky and complicated business are characteristic of many modern endeavors. Launching a manned space shuttle, building skyscrapers that don't collapse, discovering, testing and manufacturing a novel cancer drug, flying a commercial jet -- these are all examples of activities whose successful execution requires the coordinated efforts of experts spanning a huge range of expertise, and for which the consequences of failure are serious, possibly catastrophic. As the author points out, advances in technology have led to systems that are so technically complex that no one person is capable of understanding the entire system - we live in an age of hyper-specialization. Yet we have faith that such systems will work every time we enter high-rise office building, board a plane, or are admitted to hospital. How can we be sure that our trust is warranted?Gawande explores three cases in great depth - airline safety, building construction, and hospital safety (with separate discussion of critical care procedures and surgical interventions). By examining the ways complexity is addressed in the first two cases (both of which have excellent track records), he identifies general principles that should carry over generally. I won't give them away here, except to say that he makes his case in a way that is both articulate and convincing. Shorter vignettes are included to support his arguments, and they make for fascinating reading. His comparison of Walmart's and FEMA's relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina was particularly interesting, as was the explanation for David Lee Roth's notorious ""no brown M & Ms"" contract rider. This is a terrific book - well-written, interesting, and thought-provoking. I read it in just two sittings. "

Yes, that detail too has to do with checklists and troubleshooting in a complex world."

They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification, but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.""― Atul Gawande, The Checklist ManifestoAtul Gawande is a bit intimidating. Anytime you have a guy that does surgery, public health, and has written four bestselling books, it is only fair to acknowledge the guy has both brains and hustle. Unlike Malcolm Gladwell, Gawande has a tremendous talent for distilling scientific and academic ideas into a glossy, easily digestible 8.5"" x 6"" science-lite book. Gladwell does it with other people's ideas. His books involved several varied stories that come together into a lose federation of themes. Gawande usually starts with the idea: ""Hand washing"" in Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance) or ""Checklists"" (The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right) and creates a book around them.Like Dr. Gawande the person, I find his books to be interesting, compelling, admirable, and straightforward. I admire his work and his vision. His books are almost always solid, just never once yet great. Dr. Gawande is clever. He writes books that are essentially entry-level business/leadership books that are disguised as surveys of medicine. He uses his experiences as a doctor and public health researcher to tackle broader social and cultural issues that intersect with medicine and health. He isn't super subtle, but most of those who are reading Gawande aren't looking for poetry or subtly. They want an idea to click. They want to feel inspired. The want to get better and avoid mistakes. He seems focused on presenting simple processes (soap, checklists) that may help."

Knowing Allen trumps this arena, Gawande should have been craftier or hands-on... like give us sample checklists of the 1%. Who wouldn't want to glimpse how Richard Branson compiles his to-do list ??? But no such luck. Just drawn-out tales from hospitals and airports : important yes, but vague and impractical. Not even one sample checklist in the index... imagine a cookbook without a single recipe! Overall, a poorly-constructed read which by Chapter 3 seems like Gawande's way of publicly congratulating himself for becoming a surgeon. Bitch, please."
10,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63168028-peter,5," Checklist This is more than a book, it is a groundbreaking transformation. Having worked in the wider healthcare sector for over 30 years (not a clinician), you understand the levels of authority, the egos, and intransigence of senior healthcare professionals, especially in relation to their juniors and lesser deemed roles. The challenge has been, to inculcate something so obvious and relatively easy to implement, causes concerns that much of hard-earned experience and intellect can be reduced to checklists. Surely we need as many fail-safes as possible when people’s lives are at risk. Suck it up buttercup!Atul Gawande has presented compelling evidence that checklists can have a dramatic impact on quality of care and healthcare outcomes. He has shown that this is repeatable around the world and not just in regions because they're have a poorer healthcare system, a state healthcare system or a private system. If an aircraft pilot fails, he goes down with the plane. If the same consequence was applied to the failure of a medical consultant - we'd have checklists in every hospital tomorrow!"
11,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I really enjoyed Atul Gawande's earlier book Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, and also an anthology that he edited, The Best American Science Writing 2006. So, I eagerly started this very short book, about checklists. Dr. Gawande ran a program sponsored by the World Health Organization. He proposed that hospitals institute checklists in the operating room, that would do two things. First, the checklists would help catch mistakes that can easily happen, as surgeries can be simple, difficult, or complex. Second, the checklists help bring the people in the operating room into a real team. The checklist helps to bring the timid people out, to give them the confidence to say things that are wrong, when otherwise they might simply defer to the chief surgeon.Dr. Gawande was astounded by the success of his program. It was tested in four first-world hospitals, and also in four third-world hospitals. The checklists helped improve surgical outcomes in all of the hospitals, regardless of economic zone. Now, some of the surgeons reacted very well to the checklists, while others rebelled. But it didn't matter; in all cases, mistakes were noticed before harm was done, infections were thwarted, and the surgical teams were better prepared for the inevitable surprises and emergencies that occur.The book also mentions several other areas. Everybody knows about the checklists that airplane pilots use. But most people don't realize that there isn't a single checklist; rather there is an entire hierarchy of checklists for all sorts of situations and emergencies. And, surprisingly, the book describes the checklists used by a few of the best investment companies; the checklists help save time, prevent mistakes, and improve profitability.The title of the book seems so banal; I expected a rather trite description of the benefits of checklists. I was happily surprised; the book is not at all what I expected, and was even entertaining at times."
12,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"It never ceases to amaze me how systems can get lost in their own complexity as they grow. Something starts out simple, but as time goes by complexity creeps in incrementally. What used to work so well isn't really cutting it any more. Worse, the attitudes & aptitudes that were once mandatory must also be changed. Gawande does a great job of showing exactly this when it comes to medicine. The doctor that delivered me & cured my childhood colds also did my hernia operation, sewed up our wounds, & set our bones. He even made house calls occasionally, but that was the very end of that era - the early 1960s. Medicine had evolved beyond the black bag & home setting. He was very well respected, a solitary king of his domain, & had an ego to match. He needed that ego to control everything, too. In the past 50 years, technology has changed the profession immensely. In 1900, doctors needed a high school diploma & a year or two of medical school. Today most doctors can't get out on their own until they are in their mid thirties, an additional 15 years of study. There's that much more to learn & even so they have to specialize. Gawande jokes about left & right ear surgeons, but says it's not that big of a stretch.Doctors are no longer solitary kings, now they're part of a team, one more cog in the machine, but their egos & past mystique still cling to them. They are well practiced & immensely educated, so the idea that a simple check list can help them seems ludicrous, but it does. He provides numerous, real world examples & some are plain scary. Medical mistakes are, though. Gawande outlines a number of studies that show exactly that & he goes on to show why through examples both in & out of his industry from a simple medical procedure, flying a plane, building a skyscraper, finance, & all the way to the boondoogle that surrounded New Orleans when Katrina hit in 2005. He uses the aviation industry a lot since they originated/codified the process & prove it out continuously.The simple check list defines the goal, participants, & makes certain each step happens no matter what other distractions occur. It also defines the order, who is responsible & needs to make what decisions at what point. It fosters communication between the participants - even those not directly involved. His example of proper soap & dressings not being available due to lack of administrative involvement really brought the point home, something he does time & again. He addresses the ego problems very well & respectfully. Real world problems & solutions.He says there are basically 2 types: DO-CONFIRM & READ-DO. The first lets you do several tasks, then stop to confirm them. The second is more like a recipe - do one at a time & check it off. In both cases, there is a tendency to put in too many items, but they should be simple enough to always be used. Precision of meaning is also key. They're not how-to instructions or even outlines, they're only there to confirm the critical & overlooked items.This book really hit home. I'm the entire IT department for a small manufacturing company, a very complex field. (I often joke that I should get a degree in computer psychiatry when duplicate machines have different, intermittent issues.) I've been playing with computers for several decades now, the top tech for companies for more than half that time, can just about build a computer in my sleep. Still, I made a build check list years ago since I was forgetting things due to distractions or simply time between steps. After reading this, I went through my check lists, updated most. I made & deleted a couple more thanks to ideas that he sparked.I highly recommend this book to one & all. Not only does it make medicine more understandable, but it has a lot of practical value in our increasingly complex lives. "

I crassly assumed that ""How to Get Things Right"" denoted it was a how-to book, and that ""The Checklist Manifesto"" would have offered advice or instruction on the best ways and times to implement various types of checklists.Wrong, wrong, wrong. It's nine chapters of anecdotes. Nothing more. It's the literary equivalent of someone derailing your conversation in a bar and killing the next three hours of your life with tedious, tangentially related stories about himself. It is 200 pages of someone rocking back in his chair and consuming your evening with the retelling of a bunch of things that happened to him.

I have daily and weekly to-do lists and lists of projects I want to do, lists of projects for my husband to do and lists of ideas for summer activities for my boys, lists of books I want to read and places I want to visit. When I can see everything that needs to be done, even if it's an enormous amount, I feel like it's at least possible to get my arms around it and begin.When I was the credentialing coordinator for a multi-specialty medical clinic, I used checklists all the time to make sure I didn't miss any important details that would mean a disastrous delay in a physician getting licensed or covered by malpractice insurance. And checklists are a powerful tool for me as a business consultant, helping clients define, track, and evaluate their processes.All this to say that Dr. Gawande was preaching to the choir with this book; I'm already a believer. And even I was blown away by the data he shared demonstrating the incredible efficacy of this simple tool.Using examples across several professional fields, including construction, aviation, investment funds, restaurants, and of course, medicine, Dr. Gawande illustrates again and again the power of checklists to serve as a defense against complacency and arrogance. They help insure quality and consistency and yes, save lives.Dr. Gawande includes some specifics about using checklists optimally: keep them short, include items that are often skipped or missed rather than every single step, easy to read. But most interesting to me was his focus on using checklists to create the sense of teamwork and collegiality. The checklists are very useful, but they are a means to an end: aiding appropriate communication to ensure the best result.And it's always nice to have scientific backing of your natural inclinations. :)For more book reviews, come visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."

There are of course a select few bookworms, who would respectfully respond by asking about my taste in books. Most people's reaction however, tends to fall into one of the following extremes.
1) Utter bewilderment that anyone would STILL be spending time to read books... and for pleasure, no less.2) Great, let me recommend this absolutely amazing book called--
The first ones I can deal with easily enough: they feed my need for supercilious smirking wonderfully. The second ones however, are much harder to rebuff. Though it might seem easy to just give them a polite smile and make non-committal vaguely agreeing sounds, they like to follow up on my reading progress... and that's how this book ended up on my reading list.To be fair, I should admit that the book has a decent starting point. I certainly feel better being able to push the blame for my failure onto someone/something else. We're most probably all fairly good professionals, but being pushed into a context where interruptions are stalking us at every corner, succeeding is almost impossible.Even so, there are cases where the end result doesn't make things any more pleasant. Just imagine telling a grieving family, that their beloved son/father/brother/uncle did not necessarily have to die, but everyone just had so many things to look after, that they naturally missed a basic - but ultimately critical - step, when preparing for surgery. If only there were something to prevent this...Obviously the author doesn't try to convince anyone that coming up with checklists was his sole invention. Nor does he claim to have the ultimate checklist that will solve every one of our problems... ever. But he does present several examples, and a fairly comprehensive case study to make his point. Too bad it had to be surgery related. I'm squeamish enough as it is about blood in general, and you now make me read detailed descriptions of complex surgical procedures?! Sadist! So far so good, right? Well... not quite. See I love lists of any kind: to-do lists, checklists, reading lists, inventory lists... ugh list lists, you name it, I'm probably a fan. Heck, the first thing I do when I get to work is to jot down a quick list of tasks that I want to take care of... which will already be forgotten by noon. But still, I write stuff down!My biggest and most prominent problem however, is not addressed: how do you get back to the list, after an interruption? Because I totally forget all about the list once someone has an emergency that needs my attention asap.Score: 3/5 starsA decent effort, and an excellent anecdote to end things with. Still, the next person to recommend YET ANOTHER self-help book will be glaredpouted at mercilessly pitifully... *STARES*"

The first two books were lovely, reading about the experiences I had had and sometimes thoughts I had thought, but far more beautifully expressed than I ever could. It's just not fair.And then he goes and writes this book. It's really good.In particular, it is a shamelessly persuasive manifesto for a remarkably simple idea: smart people should focus their smart energy on doing things only smart people can do. And he uses several very nice examples to build the case that doctors, the smart people he is most interested in, are currently often idiots. In particular, these idiots insist on trying to remember everything all the time, rather than using simple back-ups (he calls them check-lists) to insure they haven't forgotten a silly detail. This, he suggests, means they frequently forget silly (but life-saving) details, AND they have to spend an enormous amount of time and energy trying to remember all those details, instead of doing real problem solving. He is right, and he explores this and explicates in such a powerful and subtle way that it's remarkable. It frankly changed my thinking."
17,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34550725-alfred-haplo,5,"UPDATE Jul 11, 2019: It's terribly funny to see another book about ""checklists"", that almost seems to complement Gawande's with an equally Non-Succinct Title Beyond the Checklist: What Else Health Care Can Learn from Aviation Teamwork and Safety. Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger appears in both books.******************Original Review:”These are…ridiculously primitive insights. ...But, really, does it take all that to figure out what house movers, wedding planners, and tax accountants figured out ages ago?” - Dr. Atul Gawande (Annals of Medicine, essay in New Yorker, 2007).In 2009’s Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Right, Gawande explains further. (Not a spoiler. Just... more.) (view spoiler)[ In every industry of complexity, voluminous knowledge abounds and overwhelms any individual’s capacity to perform with optimal outcome. No one person can do it all. Not even a team can do it all, all the time. Multiply any one surgical scenario hundreds of thousands of times across different settings, resources and personalities - boom, failure imminent. Certainly not always, but in any events where patient safety is at stake, the odds for success from training, specialization and advanced technology ought to be correlated exponentially higher than what it currently is. Gawande cites some numbers. According to the 9th edition of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) international classification of diseases, there are 13,000 different diseases, syndromes, and injury types. Clinicians have access to 6,000 drugs, 4,000 medical and surgical procedures with each a different requirement, risk and consideration. The average ICU patient required 178 individual actions per day, from administering a drug to suctioning the lungs, with every single action exposed to risk. How do 178 tasks get done consistently for every patient with a rotating medical staff without missing a beat? As Gawande puts it, “it is a lot to get right”. Here’s more. Based on 2004 WHO data, one person out of 25 undergoes surgery every year with 10 to 100 times more risk than childbirth. Globally, surgeons perform over 230 million major operations annually but over 7 million people are left disabled and 1 million dead - a staggering amount of harm rivaled by malaria, tuberculosis and other known public health concerns. 5 million Americans are admitted to the ICU annually, with an average stay of 4 days and survival rate of 86%. Research consistently showed that 50% of deaths and major complications from surgery is avoidable. “That means we need a different strategy for overcoming failure, one that builds on experience and takes advantage of the knowledge people have but somehow also makes up for our inevitable human inadequacies. And there is such a strategy - though it will seem almost ridiculous in its simplicity, maybe even crazy to those of us who have spent years carefully developing ever more advanced skills and technologies.”Enters the checklist. As a trivial exercise, check the following physiological data points at your next hospital appointment:__ Body temperature (reading: __)__ Pulse (reading: __)__ Blood pressure (reading: __)__ Respiratory rate (reading: __)(Hint: Zero would be… immediately very problematic). At every visit, these basic vital signs are recorded. One skipped is extremely sloppy, two skipped is well, don’t. Three normal readings and one highly abnormal one could cost someone their life. As first line of defense, all it takes to raise initial red flags for the safeguarding of our health, is this rudimentary routine check. And at every subsequent step of the treatment plan, whether we realize it or not, there are medical checklists upon medical checklists, and checklists of checklists… or whatever terminology variation we prefer to coat it as. The word “checklist” sometimes meets mental resistance across the medical field for being too “dumbed down”, too “reductionist”, too… too insulting that a specialist, sub-specialist, ultra-specialist! Should ever need to check little boxes for what they already know like the back of their gloved surgical hands. Yet, knowing is not always doing.At its most fundamental level, the checklist does two things: (a) Protects against faulty memory and distraction. Raise our hands, everyone who’s had an off day at work? Or, raise our hand, everyone who’s brought our A-game but everybody else is having an off day? On those days, the eveready checklist catches human fallibility. (b) Enforces mundane, but necessary minimum steps. In 2001, a critical care specialist at Johns Hopkins, Peter Provonost, implemented a doctor checklist of five no-brainer steps to target central line infections: (1) wash hands with soap(2) clean patient’s skin with chlorhexidine antiseptic(3) put sterile drapes over entire patient(4) wear mask, hat, sterile gown, gloves (5) place sterile dressing over insertion site The resulting observation? At least one step was missed for over a third of all patients needing a central venous catheter threaded directly into their vena cava, where an infection would be life-threatening. In the ensuring year, this “ridiculously simple” checklist produced a dramatic reduction of central line infections from 11% to ZERO%, and then only 2 cases over the next 15 months after. In more concrete numerical terms - 43 infections avoided, 8 people did not die, $2 million in costs saved (also nil emotional toll and $0 malpractice lawsuits). When Michigan state implemented Provonost’s checklist in ICUs statewide, an astounding 1500 lives and $170+ million were saved. THE CHECKLIST, its Status Elevated, is Certified Bonafide.More checklists were tested in the JH ICU. @Checking for pain/4 hours - check. Result: patients in untreated pain? 41% to 3%. @Checking mechanical ventilators - check. Result: patients not receiving recommended care? 70% to 4%. @Checking on pneumonia - check. Result: patients who lived? 21, or 25% of total. @Importance of baseline performance checklists and check, check, check-ing them off - check. Result: Gain in checklist devotees? MANY%. Are you checked out yet with checklist fatigue? Gawande has only just begun. Sexy, the checklist isn’t. But neither is being sick, or dead, or in public healthcare verbiage, a missed opportunity. In early 2007, WHO invited Gawande, along with numerous international medical personnel, to convene for the monumental task of addressing surgical safety in developed nations - with economic wealth, specialties and advanced technology - to third world countries - in many instances, entire hospitals are staffed by only a few very overworked medical staff with limited resources and expertise. Lots of ideas were brainstormed to address a vast variety of problems. Lots of ideas were tried but failed to gain traction. But a thought had begun to emerge - has anyone tried the humble checklist? One that could be deployed easily, cheaply, effectively, consistently and just as importantly, measured and duplicated easily, cheaply, effectively, consistently (Gawande repeatedly calls it ”transmissible” as if it’s a disease as only a doctor would!). He had noticed that all the problems have a common “leverage” attribute - a simple intervention leads to dramatically successful results. Skepticism abound but enthusiasm grew as participants after participants shared stories of their own successful use of checklists, which may include anything from medical action (e.g. crucial antibiotics within narrow 60 min window) to pow-wows for communicating pitfalls and contingencies right before commencing surgery (e.g. confirming left kidney, not right. Speech impaired, attention to non-articulated distress) to very simply, introduction of each surgical team member by name (e.g. to foster trust). After many revisions later, the WHO surgical checklist was born. Rolled out in 8 impoverished and affluent cities internationally, the checklist produced staggeringly positive results in its pilot year - major surgical complications fell 36%, deaths 47%. Fast forward to present time, implementation of it is now mandatory in 7 countries and over two dozen U.S. states, with an estimated 1,200 hospitals opting in as users. Gawande danced a mental jig on his desk, and thought, “this thing is real” (try to imagine a reserved Gawande in his standard attire of Brooks Brothers jacket and brown Oxford loafers letting loose his inner kid…). In absolute data, the surgical checklist is the real deal. But the real star of Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Right isn’t the checklist, but Gawande the writer. After all, a checklist is a checklist and a best-selling book changes nothing of its quotidian nature. Very few non-fiction authors I have read get giddy about banal topics the way Gawande does in his slightly astonished, intellectually nerdy way. As if he has discovered the wonder of sliced bread and after interrogating its shape, its thickness, its texture, pronounced it perfect for sandwiches. Then he layers on these small, interesting, colorful personal anecdotes and soon, have us chomping away at tidbits peripheral to the bread. This is my 3rd book of his, and counting *. If we say, great storytelling, Gawande, but show me the data. Worry not, he’s done the research neatly referenced by chapters at the back of book. It isn’t just surgery and public health that he writes earnestly, insightfully and meticulously about, it’s also the many non-medical industries - construction, supply chain management, investments, aviation - highlighted for utilizing their versions of the sacred yet ubiquitous checklist. Even if we are not frequent users of the checklist, any checklists, we can bet that many checklists have been applied to our lives directly or indirectly. If the idea of personally using a checklist seems hackneyed and restrictive to creative freedom, you’re probably right. Don’t use it. Gawande isn’t asking us to, he’s merely telling why he and other professional communities, use it to get their things right.  (hide spoiler)]""Checklist Manifesto for the Checklist Aficionado"" is my takeaway impression of Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Right. Using the checklist already has my buy-in since… oh, forever; an incurable habit from teenage days. Somewhat mis-titled, this book isn’t really a “How-To” but a ""How I”. There is no sample. There is no stories of failures. There is no setback without a comeback. There is no guide on crafting a checklist, but a few pointers. There is no promise that the checklist is the be-all and end-all, only that it is a very effective tool. One that house movers, wedding planners, tax accountants, many others and eventually even Gawande, have figured out. [* 4 stars: Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End , 4 stars:

18,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2202561-becky,5,"More lively and fast-moving than you'd think a book about checklists could be. Gawande speculates about why many people resist using checklists even though research has proven them effective. One reason interested me especially - that they distribute authority within a team. Thus nurses tend to like them more than surgeons, because a checklist provides a nurse with a more powerful voice, a surgeon with less. I see this book as part of a movement in human endeavor away from organizational structures based on top-down authority, and toward structures in which a team holds authority holistically, in which authority rests upon processes and policies descended from, and measured against, explicit goals. Many people find this type of authority hard to understand. I've even heard people claim it's not ""real"" authority at all, and must ultimately result in either chaos or stultification. But I think that people face an interesting challenge the 21st century of developing technologies and systems that enhance this type of distributed authority, to make it ever more effective and efficient. Gawande makes an eloquent case that members of more professions could reduce their error rates through the use of simple checklists. He includes a few pointers for developing good checklists; I would have preferred if he'd included even more. "

The checklist. While it is an obvious and rational solution to overcome the inherit ineptitudes of practicing medicine and mastering its complexities, it is a fairly underestimated tool and quite often forgotten. In his superb narrating skills, he takes you on a journey starting at why we need checklists through how they work, what makes good or bad checklists, the successful applications of good checklists in many things around us, the different types of checklists, how could they clear up your mind and allow for a greater degree of creativity and improvisation, and finally his successful attempt at revolutionizing the outcomes of surgery worldwide.The book gets a bit repetitive half way through.

He starts with an interesting anecdote of how aviation checklists got their start after test pilots crashed the ""bomber that was too much plane for one man to fly"". He bases the whole book on the premise that in the past man's problem was usually too little information, but now it is too much information and that we need a way to simplify in order not to miss the ""easy stuff"" that we think we know and always do, but studies have proven otherwise. He then goes on to give examples of people applying the use of checklists to all kinds of activities from surgery to investing. His own hospital's use of checklists during surgery resulted in impressive gains in lives saved and fewer complications.

24,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12798350-andrew,4,"The Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Right, by Atul Gawande, is an interesting book on the power of checklists in complex scenarios. Gawande is a doctor and famous author, and examines checklists mostly from a medical perspective. However, the application of checklists to various tasks transcends disciplines, and Gawande notes this. In various jobs throughout disciplines, oftentimes tasks can become muddled with interruptions and distractions. Even veteran doctors can forget simple things like washing ones hands, even though most people would expect them not too. In the medical world, one might be running through tasks for pre-surgery, when they are interrupted by a more pressing medical concern. What if someone is flat lining right in front of you? Will you remember every small detail and mundane but important task? Unlikely. We are not robots, and forgetfulness is a natural phenomena.So in comes the checklist. Gawande runs through the implementation of checklists in various fields (mostly medical). When doctors in Austria began implementing checklists in an avalanche prone area, to combat a surge in patients who had suffocated, they saw rates of fatalities fall dramatically. When hospitals in the US implemented checklists to combat IV lines infected with bacteria, staff infection rates fell to astronomically low levels. Gawande notes that when doctors and nurses were observed in their tasks, without running through any sort of physical checklist, mistakes were made a majority of the time! It is interesting how useful a simple checklist is, but it really should not be surprising. These simple tools help make complex tasks, like flying a B-52 flying fortress, or how to deal with an occurring risk that is a rarity, into step-by step processes where cognitive memory is not required. They are extremely useful tools because they take the human element out of tasks. Instead of a pilot having to remember to take a small pin out of a hole during take off every time, the process is relegated to a list with simple instructions. There are issues with checklists, however. As Gawande notes, veteran employees, or skilled doctors or whathaveyou, may be reluctant to change like this. Does it not feel insulting when someone hands you a checklist for a task you have been doing for a decade? However, the numbers are clear. Simple checklists can save lives, reduce pilot errors, smooth projects, and make tasks clear and concise. The checklist needs to be short, 100% accurate, and tested. It also needs to be accepted by employees, and given to the proper person to manage. I really enjoyed this book. The insights on the medical world were very interesting to start, with the intricacies of the operating room laid bare, and the simple mistakes that individuals can make noted with honest clarity. I personally love checklists, as they make simple processes easy, and take the onus off of my memory (as it is terrible). Gawande has written a readable and interesting book on checklists, and I can easily recommend this book to those looking for a kick in memory or productivity in their personal or professional life. "

I hate medical dramas, I can't keep my eyes on the screen if there is any sort of medical procedure happening on t.v. but I couldn't stop reading (to myself and whoever else happened to be around me at the moment) the details of how they accomplished what they did.I can't help but compare Gawande to Gladwell and Sacks, as they are all men that write popular sciencey type stuff. And I am a woman that generalizes stuff.In my mind the main difference between him and Gladwell is that whereas Gladwell seems more absolute and smug(?) in his conclusions, Gawande maintains a sense of awe, questioning, and curiosity throughout his story telling. The solutions he offers seems to come from outside himself and he acknowledges the problems as readily as the positives.As far as Sacks, well after his 9,000 page NewYorker article on his drug experiences in young adult hood, I can't help but see him as introspective to a self indulgent fault. Not fair, I know and I'll probably change my mind in a week but for now I've still got the seriously bad taste of that article in my mouth.bleh.Each time I've read something by Gawande I've walked away feeling equally amazed by and terrified of the medical world.*that was my Goodreaders engagement announcement by the way."

A manifesto on doing difficult, complex, absolutely vital things correctly as much of the time as possible. I talked about this when I read his Better, but he's hitting really close to home with me on this stuff. I'm not a doctor, but it doesn't help to know that there are literally tens of millions of dollars in insurance policies ready in the event I fuck something irreparably up when I know a mistake could wreck careers, fortunes, lives. So how do you complete complex, circumstance-dependent tasks on a time limit and do it right every time? The actual answer is that you don't. But this book is about how you get really close.Smart, revelatory, focused. One of those books I can really believe in because it spoke to my experiences by validating the usefulness of a lot of my mental habits, and catching me flat-footed in moments of cognitive blindness. No, self, there is no such thing as 'smart enough' not to need a checklist. You might be able to remember a 10-digit phone number told to you once three weeks ago, but you can't beat situational bias, subconscious corner-cutting, all the other brain failure modes by being smart. You just can't.Anyway. Navel gazing. Good book about how we do madly complex tasks – vascular surgery, building a skyscraper -- correctly. With teamwork and the heroism of tiny details. And checklists."

In the worlds of engineering/software/computing/project management/fill-in-the-blank, the checklist is as important & sometimes more important than half the personnel working on any given project.I didn't take away anything from it that I hadn't already known, actually felt I could probably point out a thing or two to the author, but checklists in all their varied manifestations were the skeleton of my professional life for decades. At least checklists have finally found their way into MD-land. Medicine can only be better for finally adopting 20th century project management tools, albeit at the end of the century & beginning of the next!"

Or at least it should be a classic, if it’s not already. Gawande takes something as seemingly simple as the checklist and reveals its complexities, its pitfalls, and its benefits. Turns out, they can not only help you remember your groceries but guarantee stable buildings, save lives in operating rooms, and land disabled planes without casualties. They can also be ineffective and unwieldy; it’s all about how you use them. He balances the practical with the personal so well; the case studies keep the book interesting, as well as provide usage tips that are invaluable. For anyone/everyone looking for solid productivity tools to use for work (or your personal life), this is a must-read. — Jenn NorthingtonFrom The Best Books We Read in February: http://bookriot.com/2015/03/02/riot-r..."

If I work closely with groups of people in the future I'll certainly keep these ideas in mind."
35,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,4,"""For nearly all of history, people's lives have been governed primarily by ignorance,"" writes Dr. Gawande.But sometime over the last several decades--and it is only over the last several decades--science has filled in enough knowledge to make ineptitude as much our struggle as ignorance.In particular, the practice of medicine and especially surgery has improved beyond all imagination, but the discovery and accumulation--and dissemination--of so much research has overwhelmed O.R. teams to the point that too many patients die from what Gawande calls ""the stupid stuff,"" like the giving of antibiotics prior to surgery. This should be automatic and most of the time it is, but ORs are not calm, quiet places and neither are the hospitals they are in. Emergencies are commonplace, doctors and nurses get distracted, and mistakes happen. So Gawande looks at how other professions prevent mistakes, including high rise construction, aviation, and even mutual fund managers. It turns out they all use...checklists.On an initial test flight in 1935, the B-17, aka the Flying Fortress, crashed and killed two of its five crew.The Boeing model was deemed, as a newspaper put it, ""too much airplane for one man to fly."" The army air corps declared Douglas's small design the winner. Boeing nearly went bankrupt.So a group of pilots get together and what do they do? They create a checklist. Anyone who's ever been on a plane has seen the pilots holding those plastic covered lists and if you're sitting far enough forward you can hear them running them down. The pilot's checklist has been instrumental in saving literally thousands of lives in airplane accidents, like United 811 when the cargo door blew off en route from Honolulu to New Zealand in 1989 and including US Airways 1549, aka The Miracle on the HudsonThe pilots' preparations had made them a team. Sullenberger would look for the nearest, safest possible landing site. Skiles would go to the engine failure checklists to see if he could relight the engines...In the end, Skiles managed to complete a restart attempt on both engines, something investigators later testified to be ""very remarkable"" in the time frame he had--and something they found difficult to replicate in simulation.In conjunction with WHO, Gawande decides to make a checklist for ORs. It is an abysmal failure, too long, too complicated, during the test drive in his own O.R. everyone including the patient hates it.By the end of the day, we had stopped using the checklist. Forget making this work around the world. It wasn't even working in one operating room.So he goes to Boeing, The Checklist Factory (the chapter title), and consults Dan Boorman, the guy in charge of developing checklists for Boeing aircraft. Boorman puts him in a flight simulator (I love this part, Gawande isn't a pilot and it doesn't sound like he has ever even flown in anything smaller than a 737) and throws an exploding cargo door at him on takeoff. By following the checklist, Gawande manages to abort the takeoff and land safely. (I'd bet anything he's in flight school right now.)Boorman instructs him on what makes a successful checklist. It has to be short. There have to be ""pause points."" It should use both uppercase and lowercase text for ease of reading. And most importantly, it has to be tested.So Gawande goes home and rewrites and rewrites and rewrites his OR checklist. And then he assembles an OR team in his conference room, puts a volunteer ""patient"" on the conference room table, and tests it and tests it and tests it and then tests it some more. When it's ready, he assembles eight hospitals from Tanzania to London to test it in their ORs. And then he goes home and waits.The final results showed that the rate of major complications for surgical patients in all eight hospitals fell by 36 percent after introduction of the checklist. Deaths fell 47 percent...Using the checklist had spared more than 150 people from harm--and 27 of them from death.""Some skepticism persisted,"" Gawande writes. After all, 20 percent did not find [the checklist] easy to use, thought it took too long, and felt it had not improved the safety of care.Then we asked the staff one more question. ""If you were having an operation,"" we asked, ""would you want the checklist to be used?""A full 93 percent said yes.His checklist is now being adopted in ORs around the nation and around the world, albeit slowly and in some cases because surgeons have long been the gods of their O.R.s and are reluctant to give up power. Ego is a lot of what's wrong with the world. Highly recommended."
36,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2132831-jason-cox,5,"A little over a year ago I heard about this book at a medical conference I attended where we were discussing the benefits of CPOE (Computerized Patient Order Entry) for hospital patients. Based on the recommendations of others at the conference I went ahead and bought the book and finally got to it a few weeks ago. I highly recommend you read this book.About the Author:Atul Gawande is a surgeon who both maintains a private practice and consults for the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding worldwide health issues. He has written several other books, and based on this one, I'll definitely be getting his others to read in the near future.Basic Premise: Gawande was presented with a statistical problem (epidemic) by the WHO - the rate of surgery and surgical complications is exploding in the world. That issue raises the question of what can be done to improve outcomes, not just in economically advanced countries but also in third world sites where surgery is still being performed at accelerating rates. While expensive solutions may be an option for developed nations, that isn't likely to be an option for those developing countries.Dr. Gawande opens with a look into several medical cases as examples of the complexity of the medical decision-making process. These are, by the way, fascinating cases. He shows some failures and incredible successes. What makes the difference in these outcomes? He then takes the reader on a journey in which he looks for answers in different industries that could apply to the medical problem he is confronting. He looks at the construction industry, where incredibly complicated buildings are constructed in clockwork fashion taking into account thousands of natural variables. Those guys end up being able to do that with an incredibly small failure rate. Of course, when a building fails, it is likely to lead to many deaths. The same is true for medical cases. He discovers the value of a checklist in the construction world, but decides the type of checklist they use isn't really practical in medicine because while construction occurs over months to years, medical decisions must be made in seconds.He then moves on to the airline industry, which is fascinating. This is a much more accurate fit with the medical problem and he finds again that checklists are in place in that industry leading to their very low rate of failure. Again he covers several interesting cases and how the implementation of checklists saved lives. Then he looks at the financial trading industry and how checklists have potential impact for that industry, but they fail to benefit from it due to the culture of the industry.Finally, he gives some personal anecdotes as he implements a checklist in his own O.R. With success the outcome, of course.Despite the setting of the book in the context of a medical issue, this book probably should be required reading for anyone who makes important decisions. The whole theme of the book, really, is that implementing checklists which ensure critical elements of any ""process"" aren't missed can and probably will result in improved outcomes. It's true in the construction and airline industry. There is evidence that it works even for institutional traders, if they'd use it, and the same is true for surgeons. How likely is it that your particular industry could do better with a checklist? I would suggest very likely. The Checklist Manifesto really raises a lot of questions about where can I benefit from developing checklists for my work as a hospitalist. There may even be room for a second book discussing how an organization should go about developing a checklist, although he does describe the process his team used. Consider the same for your own situation."
37,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,4,"This is a good book about the impact of checklists and importance of being humble to your discipline. The challenge in modern fields is that the volume of knowledge has outgrown our ability to execute it correctly. Even with super-specialization, the standard reaction to the volume problem, endemic to medicine and other complex fields—it's still too much for one person to keep in their head. Mistakes are easy to make. The book cycles through case and case again of people it's saved when applied to medicine and aviation. The book makes a valuable distinction between the simple, complicated and complex. The simple is what can be performed with a simple recipe, like baking a cake. The complicated is when many recipes come together, and identifying the recipes may not be easy, but they are present—like computers. Complex is when giving the same input doesn't always give the same output, meaning simple or complicated recipes don't work. Checklists work well for simple and complicated, but even in the complex cases can aid substantially. Checklists are a great means to enforce communication for complex projects. There are two types of checklists: read-do, and do-confirm. In the first, you read and do each task as you read them. In do-confirm, you do, and then confirm you didn't miss any. Both are valuable for different scenarios. Checklists scale new knowledge and discoveries. The aviation's antifragile nature of RCAs that propagate information to the rest of the world, is largely due to checklists. Every crash causes changes to checklists that are distributed to all similar airplanes in the world. This is how an industry as a whole gets better, rather than the individual actors within it. The latter being true in especially software.What I liked, was that the book took a pragmatic approach to checklists. It discusses in practise how you implement it into disciplines where people may feel offended by being presented with a simple piece of paper that should tell them what to do. The issues of the nurse dictating surgery by being in charge of the checklists. As well as the practical implications of having checklist overload. Some checks are too complicated for the probability of it going wrong in the first place.Humans are not build for discipline, but for novelty and excitement. Checklists are built for discipline and attention to detail. We need to get better at studying the tools, not just the new drugs and technology. We can get better at applying what we already have."
38,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5850905-rohit,1,"The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.DO NOT waste your time reading this book. You can just go through the summary lessons I have listed in the third paragraph and that should be it. You can thank me for saving few hours of your life.I had seen several influential people suggesting this book. So I thought I’d read it. I finished the book in one sitting of 4-6 hours while I was working in Basel and I left the book in the office next day so that anyone who wants to read it can do it for free. I had added a one pager lesson as the first page in the book with the summary so that no one has to waste their time and still get everything that this book has to offer. This book has following lessons:1.	Checklists are good. You must use them.2.	Checklists help us finish repeatable tasks by making minimum mistakes.3.	Create a checklist for any task that’s repeatable. Follow following rule: a.	Keep the checklist limited to one page only., b.	Checklist should be marked to be checked off: like a tick or a crossing off items.  c.	At max you can use YES/ NO. DO NOT over-complicate checklists.NEXT three lessons are from my personal experience and are NOT suggested by Mr. Gawande.1.	Non-repetitive tasks don’t need a checklist. Still run a mental check anyway so that you don’t miss anything. 2.	Use easy mental checklist by using total number of items/sub-tasks that you need to do when you don’t have a checklist at hand. IN case you don’t have the items adding up you can check which sub-task you missed. As a reader I’d like to save your time and my very strong suggestion would be to NOT READ this book. Because it’s a plain waste of time. The book has several anecdotes of doctors and aircraft pilots/ engineers being sloppy. Then they start following checklists and turn things around. Almost magically. I DO NOT doubt that these anecdotes are correct. Based on the references I take them as real. But beyond reinforcing the lessons that I have mentioned above they are useless. Furthermore, Atul Gawande’s writing style is impeccable. Good medium sized and easy to read sentences fill the texts. Beyond that the book doesn’t add any value (apart from the lessons I have listed above). May be this book would be found useful by folks who are into manufacturing or operations where they need to do repetitive tasks. One of the most overrated books. EVER."
39,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2399128-jason-miller,4,"I am a professional teacher of mathematics at a good, regional University in the Midwest. In many ways, my job is straightforward. Help students learn enough mathematics to be successful and productive citizens. Sometimes this means preparing them for the 'next' mathematics course they need to take. Sometimes this means giving them a good mathematical experience and increasing their ability to think about things in a mathematical way.In many ways, mine is a simple job. There's little that's complex or complicated about it. So it would seem that Atul Gawande's new book, the Checklist Manifesto, would have little too offer my professional self. And this is OK, because Dr. Gawande expresses his ideas through anecdote and imagery, making the reading of his essays such a pleasure. This along with my wife's penchant for list-making, drew me to chose this book as the 'listen' for our 1200 mile holiday drive to visit family.In the book, Dr. Gawande explores the way checklists can affect the handling of complicated and complex tasks by trained professionals. What he learns, through personal investigation and professional involvement with the World Health Organization, is that simple (and thoughtfully constructed) checklists can have a striking impact on the quality and volume of work of a group of professionals. Examples he explores include piloting modern commercial airplanes, managing the construction of a large building, providing rapid-response medical aid, rates of infection in hospital intensive care units, complication rates arising from surgery, and identifying prospect companies for investment by a large investment agency. In each of these cases, he shows how having and using thoughtfully designed (or evolved) checklists reduces errors and increases a group's ability to work as a team.This latter effect is somewhat surprising and counterintuitive, but it makes a whole lot of sense with Dr. Gawande explaining it. So I'll leave that to him. The book is definitely worth the four hours of listening-time. The hard-copy version is probably a quicker read. As you read the book, I'll be thinking about how these ideas can be used in higher education and in the service of teaching mathematics and the sciences. If you have any thoughts on that, give me a shout."
40,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6645592-mark-seemann,4,"As many American popular science books, The Checklist Manifesto starts with a sequence of stories designed to illustrate a point, or an aspect of an overall theme. After a few chapters with stories, but light on actionable content with a degree of detail that would enable me to extrapolate, I was slightly disappointed.As the text progressed, however, I found it more inspiring. The stories kept coming, but I also felt that there was enough information in the text that I could begin to see how to apply some of the ideas in my own field of work.Atul Gawande is a surgeon, so many of the illustrative anecdotes are about surgeries, or other parts of medicine. He does, however, also look at other industries, but not mine.The theme of the book is how simple checklists empower skilled professionals, like airplane pilots. When a task is complex, it's almost inevitable that you forget to consider a thing or two. A checklist helps you focus on the hard parts of your task by taking your mind off the trivial things. You don't have to make an effort to remember to do all the trivial things; you just have to remember to refer to the checklist at various pause points.It's important to understand that the type of checklist the book discusses is supposed to enable, support, and free practitioners. They're not there to monitor or audit. The power of these checklists is that you use them in the situation - not that they leave any trail of evidence. Perhaps the most powerful lists are those that specifically don't leave any audit trail. These could simply be lists on a wall poster, a clipboard, in a ring binder, or similar.My area of work is software development, and that's as complex as surgery or piloting an airplane. Software defects are legio, but I think that a lot could be avoided with a more methodological approach to the work.Checklists are not intended to constrain experts, but rather to improve results. As one of the author's informers put it:""When surgeons make sure to wash their hands or to talk to everyone on the team"" - he'd seen the surgery checklist - ""they improve their outcomes with no increase in skill. That's what we are doing when we use the checklist."" That's a wonderful way to put it, I find:Improve the outcome with no increase in skill."
41,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12065410-noor,4,"Gripping from the first page, Gawande main message of the book is simple: information has reached a new level whereby it has exceeded people's capabilities to maintain independently. The solution, according to the author, is the simple checklist.Gawande compares the medical profession to aviation, engineering, investment banking and the culinary profession, as his message is transferrable to most domains. Long gone are the days where polymaths or master engineers à la Michaelangelo exist, he argues. Why? Simply because, in this day and age, we are so inundated by knowledge and information that it is no longer possible for one person who retain all the knowledge available. Man is fallible and thus safety measures need to be put in place to ensure that complications are averted, whether in the operating theatre, constructing an elaborate building or flying a plane. Accordingly, traditional concepts of what constitutes scholarship or heroism have to be altered.Effective teamwork is the new hero, encompassing a shared responsibility, skill set and trustworthiness. If aviation has adapted to a disciplined (and proven) checklist, where accidents are as infrequent as 1 in 500,000, then surely the medical profession, where surgical problems are increasingly prevalent, should not shy away from adopting this simple addition to practice.The perfect checklist aims to be concise and include the more simple - but additionally critical - measures that can be overlooked. It should not be a step-by-step set of instructions on what to do in certain situations, but rather a guide to what professionals in their fields already know. The aviation industry has well adapted to checklists, and Gawande argues that the medical profession needs to similarly adapt its approach to practice. The pharmacy profession in the UK contains 'Standard Operating Procedures' that hold the same principle as these checklists, except that they are inclusive of all information relating to a particular event, and as a result many professionals that work in a pharmacy find them onerous to go through. Perhaps a more concise checklist version of these could be adapted to the future of pharmacy practice as well."

We set out with every intention to read them, but then days, weeks, and  *ahem*  , sometimes months go by and we have made little progress. Eventually, you realize life is too short, and despite your unnerving guilt, you have to put the book down and read something else. I feel bad for criticizing this book because I love Dr. Gawande. I have never been his colleague or patient, but based on his publications, I assume he is great at what he does. Also, he is total goals: a public health advocate, surgeon, and author of several best-selling books. And oh yeah, just to top it off, he is of course, a Professor at Harvard. I think part of why I read all of his books was to absorb 1/3 of his greatness, sadly I only got about 0.000000000009%.What distinguishes Gawande from other non-fiction writers is his delicious, clear prose; he has the ability to make complex topics accessible. I think it was Steven Pinker who said a good book makes the reader feel like a genius, while a bad book makes the reader feel like an idiot. However, despite my positive experiences with his other books, I was skeptical about this one. How can he talk about checklists for 190+ pages? And I was sort of right. I think most of the information in this book could be condensed into an online article. As the title suggests, this book is about checklists, and how they can be utilized to increase productivity in medicine. He does this by exploring other fields, like aviation and construction, where checklists have been used to boost efficiency. And while this was interesting to read, the information in this book was of little use to me. I thought it was going to revolutionize the way I looked at checklists, but it did not. Nonetheless, I think if you are in medicine, aviation, or construction, then you will like this book."
43,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1498938-deanna,5,"I was an ICU nurse for 10 years, and now am a family nurse practitioner. When I precept nursing students, I show them my daily list -- in the ICU, it is a 3"" wide, 12"" long piece of adhesive tape (easy to write on) stuck to the patient's bedside table where it can't get lost, with a simple list of numbers for the 12 hours of the shift down the side of the tape, and then abbreviations to fill in each hour what that patient needs so I don't forget anything important and can cross them off as I go. VS for vital signs, CT for an appointment in CT-scan, Vanco for the vancomycin infusion, SG for the Swan-Ganz intra-cardiac catheter pressure readings. Back and forth between my two patients' rooms, I run through my checklist each hour. It has saved me (and the patient, of course), more times than I can count from some stupid oversight, but getting new nurses to adopt the technique is intensely difficult, just as Dr. Gawande discusses. Perhaps I love my checklists because I was already in my late 30's with a not-so-good-anymore memory when I finished nursing school. Now I use my EMR (electronic medical record) to remind myself of each individual patient's needs. Messages pop up for the day I set: ""check for return labs,"" ""repeat mammogram done?"", ""oncologists report back?"" This book should be required reading for everyone. Schools should begin teaching the techniques in the elementary grades. Success in life, as Dr. Gawande states, is less about brilliant maverick-cowboy moves and more about the discipline of getting it (whatever ""it"" is for you) right every time. Thank you, Dr. Gawande."

I advocate the use of checklists and procedures in IT operations and in performing other repetitive processes as a means of ""not forgetting the important stuff.""It struck me that one of the benefits that Dr. Gawande attributes to checklists is actually only peripherally related to them. He recounts the empowerment that checklists give to nurses and other personnel when interacting with physicians, a profession known for their self-confidence and sense of entitlement. (Of course there are no people like that in IT or in business :-) I would argue that this benefit derives from adoption of an egoless, teamwork-oriented approach rather than directly from checklist adoption. It could be that the checklist acts to buffer the impact of a team member with less professional status confronting a higher-status colleague.The most moving part of Dr. Gawande's story is his description of the impact that the surgical checklist he developed for the World Health Organization has had on lives around the globe.I highly recommend this book to anyone who works in medicine, technology, or any other field where attention to detail is key to success."

However there is enough in this 200-page book to make it worth your while.Its thesis is as follows: while for long periods of time mankind's main problem was ignorance - the lack of knowledge, there is currently so much knowledge in any given field that the problem has morphed into ineptitude - the inability to properly apply what was learned. A solution to this problem is the checklist, not as a step by step guide to a process, but devised in a way to ensure the most important things, 'the killer items', are executed. This in turn enables one to concentrate on solving the complex problems that arise rather than be confronted with the consequences of not performing the easier but pivotal checks.You cannot help but feel that this book would be best enjoyed by someone with at least a modicum of knowledge in the field of medicine, as the author Atul Gawande is himself a surgeon and many of the examples are from this field. Despite that there are still a large number of examples of how checklists can have a significant effect in various domains and situations, ranging from construction to flying to Van Halen concerts, all presented in an entertaining manner."

The book considers the interdisciplinary history of the checklist, wherein the medical checklist drew inspiration and assistance from aviation. Key insights: 1.) Professionals cannot possibly remember everything that their job entails, hence, simple checklists can help immensely. 2.) Even the most competent individual is a victim of the fallibility of memory.3.) Don’t overlook simple solutions, these may have the most potent effects. "

Overall, I enjoyed this book."
53,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24259285-azat-sultanov,4,"I was so happy that a whole book was written on this topic since this always made complete sense to me. I use little checklists of my own every now and then. The idea is pretty simple though : you can't trust your brain at all times as it's not a place for storage, it's a place for generating ideas. Therefore it often fails you, especially in stressful and critical situations. For critical, complicated and reoccurring jobs with many variables (like construction of a skyscraper) you always need a checklist (a list of jobs to be done) if you want some consistency in the result. In some lines of work like surgery, piloting or construction it's absolutely essential. Failure to miss a step results in lives. You would be shocked to see statistics of how many die due to silly mistakes made by surgery teams even in highly developed countries.As it turns out airline companies fixed this problem long ago. They have all sorts of checklists for any imaginable emergency situation, which they use without failure. The author elaborated too much on the issue, providing redundant anecdotes to prove his point. One or two would have sufficed IMHO (-1 star for this). What was new for me is the fact that putting together a checklist is not a simple matter. Just listing all jobs to be done doesn't do the trick. In doing so a checklist becomes too long, hard to use and impractical in critical situations. It has to be as short as possible with only critical steps laid out (ideally 5-9 items). All in all the ideas is incredibly simple and extremely helpful. Say this is your first year as a class teacher. Wouldn't it be nice to have a checklist of essential things to be done with your class designed by a very experienced teacher? Unfortunately we are more often than not left to our own devices to rediscover a wheel. BTW based on my failures this year I started designing some checklists to use next year."

And as with previous work by Johns Hopkins' Peter Provonost on ICU catheter infections, Gawande has found that developing a simple checklist, modeled on those used successfully by airline pilots for decades, can dramatically reduce errors in the operating room, which is his specialty.Besides a good history of how airline checklists were created and refined, he also has a fascinating chapter on the use of checklists in the construction industry on major projects, which points out another important piece of the challenge. Part of the checklist is simply a detailed ""to do"" list, but another part is how people should communicate with each other if the unexpected arises. Both are important, and it explains why the surgery checklist includes a minute when members of the team introduces themselves and say what their jobs are. As simple as it sounds, these quick intros form a basis for better teamwork and communication later on.Finally, Gawande points to one other very American challenge: Getting people to embrace the idea of checklists in the first place. Checklists are an inherent acknowledgment that most complex work is done by groups and that group process is just as important or more important than individual skill, but in America, where individualism is valued so highly, it is often a tough sell.He left me convinced we should get over our egos and get on with the lists."
55,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178927-mason,5,"I found this book fascinating, and as a writer, I am thinking about ways of applying the checklist approach to my writing.Gawande is a prolific writer, somehow finding the time alongside his surgeries and research to write excellent articles for the New Yorker and three books over the past several years.Oddly, though, he never even mentions the idea of applying his checklist approach to writing. He does talk about how many professionals feel that their particular speciality isn't amenable to checklists because it requires too much intuition or quick thinking or creatively or inspiration or whatever other kind of quality you might think of that seems not amenable to taming with a checklist. Of all professions, writers might be the most prone to this kind of thinking.That's exactly right, Gawande argues—and exactly why checklists are so crucial. The checklist is to make sure you've ticked all the boxes for the numerous relatively easy-to-do things, freeing up your mind to deal with the really tough stuff. (In that way, it seems similar to Getting Things Done, with its emphasis on writing down items instead of carrying them around in your head.) And I think that writing a good news article, or feature story, or book also includes a bunch of relatively simple steps that you need to do to make it good. You also need some kind of indescribable magic to make the piece truly excellent. But the rest of the stuff should fit onto checklists. I'm going to try to figure out how best to do this, at least to compensate for my own biases and recurrent failures as a writer.Wish me luck. However it goes, I'll write about it."
56,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8787250-kevin,5,"My personal favorite of Gawande's 3 books. He is a surgeon who also got his start as a healthcare reporter; his pieces for The New Yorker have been used as examples for framework in gov't's healthcare reform, for example. His writing style is disarming and easy to follow. He removes all pretentiousness from his writing, and is eager to admit how much he doesn't know. By doing so here, he takes the very boring topic of checklists and provides real-life examples of effective checklist use to make a compelling case for their implementation in healthcare settings. He describes interesting, meaningful results of checklist experimentation in surgery to show how very brief, succinct, you've-got-to-be-kidding-me checklists - they are used fervently every day by airline pilots to provide the world's safest mode of travel, after all - can flat-out prevent deaths and offset or eliminate altogether mistakes, waste, and unnecessary care in hospitals. Central line infection, for example, fell to 0 percent at one hospital after a year(?) of simple checklist experimentation that ensured 100 percent sterile procedure with no steps skipped.Even if you don't work in healthcare, The Checklist Manifesto is a phenomenal, quick read. The David Lee Roth/Van Halen anecdote alone was a fascinating tibdit to read. My mother-in-law got me the book for Xmas, saw the cover and wasn't very interested. But she read the first page or so and before we knew it, she spent most of the day reading it and took it with her on her flight home to finish, then mailed it back to me so I could read. "
57,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6978592-sean,4,"I decided to read all three of Gawande's books, and this is the one I could get my hands on first. I wasn't as excited about it as I was about the other two, but so far I've enjoyed this one more than ""Better"", which I am reading now.I expected this book to be a bit of preaching-to-the-choir, and to some extent it was. I'd long ago come to the conclusion that the work I do (software engineering) contains some really complicated but predictable and boring stuff that is easy to screw up, and that a checklist is a good thing to have to avoid those screw-ups. And he does in fact discuss checklists of that kind.But he discusses another kind of checklist, which is used for stuff that's complicated but not predictable at all, where the main purpose of the checklist is to ensure that all the right people have talked about all the right issues - the checklist doesn't tell you what to do, it tells you what to do to figure out what to do. I had not thought of this approach before.Most popular books like this are heavy on anecdata, and this one is no exception - though he at least acknowledges the weakness of anecdata and provides statistics and studies to back up his assertions. His are unusually interesting, though, and unusually well-written."
58,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2737441-sarah,3,"This probably could have been a long article rather than an entire book. Main point: utilizing checklists, even though many of us feel that they are intrusive or beneath us, can increase our effectiveness regardless of our skills. Counterintuitively, routinizing behavior is seen to be especially useful in extremely complicated or specialized settings (such as in medicine, which many doctors argue is too individualized to benefit from checklists). I found it interesting that perhaps the most important item on the surgery checklist that the author developed (which has been found highly effective at improving patient survival rates, but has only been adopted by a small percentage of American hospitals) is requiring everyone on the surgical team to state their names and positions before beginning. Apparently it's not unusual for medical teams to not know each other, and the introduction made them work better as a team. This is an important finding mostly unrelated to the checklist philosophy which probably warrants its own implementation campaign.Now to make up some lists on how to best clean data, schedule meetings at my convenience, and have a conversation with my son...."
59,0805091742,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2110092-preeti,4,"I suck at reviews but here goes.This book was an easy and fascinating read. I can't remember how I came across the book but it looked interesting so I added it to my list. Then while on a library adventure I saw it on the New Books shelf so I picked it up.The book talks about the complexity of situations that arise in surgery and how to tackle those issues so that common problems can be avoided. The answer is a checklist.I loved learning about how checklists came to be used in the aviation field. The examples he used were really interesting (and of course, scary) but really cool to see how a simple thing as a checklist could make such a huge difference. In comparing checklists used in aviation to checklists potentially being used for surgeries, the argument makes a lot of sense. It frightened me to read about how some surgeons treat others on their teams as if they are below them and only the surgeon knows best. What Gawande writes makes a lot of sense and definitely convinced me.This was a quick read and easy to understand and follow. I will definitely be checking out his other books."
