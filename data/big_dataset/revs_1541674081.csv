It so horrified them that 100 true copies were printed for the scientists and a highly abridged version for everyone else. The research was not confirmed for another 60 years.What was so horrifying? Male Adelies mate with anything, baby penguins, dead frozen corpses, other males, they don't care, they just want to stick it in and fuck, and damn the consequences. The females, apart from chimpanzees and humans, are, it seems the only animals to go in for transactional sex. The males collect stones for nests and present them to the females and then they mate. But some females go and take the stones and then hop off, leaving the male frustrated! One female was seen to do this 62 times in an hour :-) Presumably these were the males desperate for a real live female rather than going in for abusing babies or necrophilia. Well they got their rocks off, didn't they? :-)Bats. Male bats have big, dangly penises. Scientists have said that the more promiscuous a female of the species is, the bigger the willie of the male. Really? Does this apply to just bats? (What about human cultures? Do men have tiny willies in cultures where women aren't allowed any sexual freedom?) Bats also like oral sex. Researchers are investigating if the male not only licks the female but also inserts his tongue into her vagina to scoop out rival male's sperm. Fair enough, but there is no investigation or evolutionary justification given as to why the females enjoy giving blow jobs.Vultures. The reason they can eat rotting flesh is that they have the strongest stomach acids imaginable. Their poo is so strong it can kill germs ('kills 99% of all known germs' like Dettol. Do you think it could be advertised as natural product?) and the author was told she could use it to 'wash' her hands. She declined, understandably. But if you see vultures standing around with shitty legs, they aren't dirty, it's their very effective way of cleaning them. Disgusting.Turkey vultures defend themselves by projectile vomiting, up to 10 feet, their stinking stomach contents which are so acid they can burn the object of its displeasure. Turkey vultures do not make good pets. Since they only eat rotting meat, not good for eating either.It was always hard to think of any of the vulture family with any kind of affection or even real interest in their lives. It's even less so now.Sloths. Their fur is specially designed to trap water to feed the fungi, algae, moths and insects that live in it so it can 'make like a tree' and not attract predators who can't see it.They have the slowest moving digestion in the mammal world. One shit a month. Just as well as it would take them all day to climb down the tree and then back up again. Since they eat plant material and do not shit, the gasses build up inside them. This has the effect of making them very buoyant and they are good swimmers, doggy paddle and even back stroke, at three times the speed that they can move in trees. ,One of the sloths, the so-called two-toed sloth which has three toes but only two fingers is very bad tempered. If annoyed it will hiss and bare its two big front teeth and then swipe at the enemy with its huge clawed hands. Since this is done in slow motion, escape is not a problem.________________The book was really about debunking myths and changing popularly-held feelings about the animals featured. It is easy to debunk myths. No one nowadays would believe that beavers are capable of organising and controlling a construction gang, But changing feelings, that's harder. It is difficult to see vultures as 'pure' and 'noble' as eagles although (old world) both are in the same family. It is just as difficult to think of hyenas with the admiration and fascination granted to the animals they most resemble, the big cats and wolves.I enjoyed the book. It has the cheery irreverence of Mary Roach, but is considerably deeper and with more scientific research than her books. A five-star read. I would say I would like to read other books by this author, but she seems to only write about Sloths and I'm not sure that there's that much more to say about them that I'd want to know."

Seriously, I believe my squat, hairy man was getting a wee bit sick of me! I adored this book. If it's an animal and its wild, then I'm gonna love it. From bats that are hung like a horse, to legends of beavers chewing off their 'nads to save themselves. Sloths, hippos, hyenas ""I've always loved hyenas."" Many, many more. I liked hearing about the old beliefs about animals daily doings. Just made me wonder how many misconceptions we still have today. This book also had me on my computer looking up everything I could of Glass Eels. I've never eaten eel, and now after discovering their life and death journey, I'm pretty sure I'll never eat one. Remarkable creatures. Yeah, this is definitely a book I'd recommend. I enjoyed everything about it. My thanks to the publishers, and Netgalley."

In this book she traces the beginning thoughts of thirteen different species, and some of these facts were dingers.To give just a little preview, I will share a few tidbits from the book. Eels, which I find creepy and slimy, were thought to arrive out of the mud. To this day no one has figured out how they procreate. Japan is now the biggest consumer of eels, though Italy had its share.Beavers, almost extinct in Europe, so they decided to import some American Beavers, hoping they might all get along and have beaver babies. Turns out the American beaver is much more aggressive than the European model. Go figure!!Bats, shver me timbers, blood suckers of lore. I love them because they eat tons of bugs. Also as far as sexual parts go, the male bat is very well endowed, in relation to size of course. Also, theirs is the sex life that is the closest to our own.Frogs, during the middle ages, they foolishly believed that if the woman held a frog in her mouth during sexual relations, she would not conceive. Birth control by frog, can you believe it?Stork, well we all know that storks bring babies, don't we? A young married couple in Germany believed this so strongly, and when the story was not forthcoming with said child, they were shocked to find out they had to have sex first.The hippo, if one had flase teeth many years ago they were likely made from hippo teeth. Also there are now Randy hippos in Co!umbia. How did they get there, ask Escobar.Penguins, their sex life was kept secret for many years. Think I'm going to keep it secret too. Read the book. The sex life of penguins is rather shocking."

Photo by Ontley, on Wikimedia Commons)I knew I was going to love this book when, on the very first page, I learned that sloths shit only once a week. How could you not love a book that teaches you such things?? And on the very first page?? OK, maybe the lackadaisical manner in which a sloth's intestines push things along is not the most important thing to know.... but it's still interesting. Sloths' metabolism is so slow that it takes 14 days to fully digest their food. Imagine having to wait 2 full weeks to get rid of that holiday meal you couldn't stop eating.Other interesting tidbits found within these pages include:•Some fruit bats have colour vision that's 3 times as good as a human's.•Hippos secrete a slime that looks like blood but is actually an insect repellant, sunscreen, and antibiotic all rolled into one bright red super-goo.•Secretions from beavers' anal glands are commonly used as ""natural vanilla flavouring"" in foods and cosmetics. Yeh, you know you've been thinking about becoming vegan for a reason!•The highest a bird has been recorded flying is 36,000 feet or 7 miles (11 kilometers)!•Some species of frogs can fly. •Vulture excrement is an excellent disinfectant. (I'll take the author's word for that and continue using Lysol.)Lucy Cooke takes us on a wild ride through the animal kingdom, sharing many such facts. She explores ways in which several animal species have been misunderstood, and shows us how each of them is actually very well adapted to their environment. Sloths are not lazy; they have evolved optimum ways in which to survive the rainforests of South and Central America. Bats are not greedy blood-sucking vampires but help keep insect populations under control and pollinate flowers. Vultures are not disgusting creatures to be obliterated -- they help prevent the spread of disease by bacteria like botulism and anthrax. We humans have long compared other animals to ourselves, seeking to judge them by human standards. This is a mistake, as each animal has evolved the physical traits, habits, and appetites that are best suited for its unique environment. This book is fascinating and fun to read. My only complaint is that the author includes examples of horrid animal experiments. We are all no doubt aware of how many horrific things have been done to animals in the past; indeed, we are STILL doing horrific things to them. I could have done without reading about it and actually had to skip over a couple of pages. Was it really necessary to include that in the book? I think not. I don't see any purpose served in that, unlike talking about things humans still do to animals. Those things should be talked about, people should be aware of the immense suffering we heap upon millions of animals every single day. That aside, and a somewhat boring chapter on eels, I highly recommend this book. It's important to learn about other animals so that we are more likely to appreciate their intelligence and inner lives. The more we learn about them, hopefully the less complacent we become over the unnecessary suffering we heap upon them. Also, books like this are fun! Evolution by natural selection is one of the most beautiful and fascinating things I've ever learned and books depicting the evolution of life are such a joy to read! There are so many other interesting and thrilling facts I learned in this book that I had to often pause my reading to share them with my partner. Thankfully she is very patient and indulges me, and also loves to learn new things. I'm not sure many people would want to be around me when I'm devouring a book like this one! Since I can't possibly share everything in this review, I will instead suggest you read the book for yourself. Prepare to be wowed!

I read a lot of nature books and I want a few things from a book. I want a book that shows that an author really loves animals, that I learn something new, and that I am not bored while learning. Well this did all three and then some! It is obvious that the author loves animals, it is nearly palpable! I giggled and laughed through out this book! The things I learned, well, I wouldn't find in any other book!When the author started talking about sloths, well, I was smiling already. They are so adorable but then the way it is written makes it even more hilarious. I really started giggling when the description came up of making them move fast. Then on to the female hyena penis delivery of babies or the sex act. Bat orgies or vampire bat blood spewing and so much more! I was hysterical with laughter! There are myths in there too, they had me laughing as well. I hadn't heard them before. Wait til you find out what they put beaver gonad ass juice in that we use today, so gross! This is certainly a book that covers my three MUSTS for a nature book. It is a must read for anyone!"
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"This is a book filled with very interesting information about a select set of animals including sloths, bats, penguins, hippos, frogs, eels, pandas, chimpanzees, hyenas and others. Lot of the information is lesser known, and makes for engrossing reading. For instance, hippos genetic makeup shows a closer match with whales rather than any land animal. How do vultures promptly appear when animals die? And so many other interesting bits of information.Lucy Cooke closes the book with some excellent passages about how in our thinking we have distanced ourselves so much from animals. We think of them as things which exist for our use, and have license to perform cruel experiments on. The passages in the book on the cruel experiments performed on bats to satisfy our curiosity on how they navigate and using frogs for pregnancy tests is sad to read. Pandas for their cute appearance have become a political industry where they are artificially birthed in captivity and don’t lead very satisfying lives.While the book for the large part makes for excellent and very engrossing reading, it would have benefited from some more material on what motivates the behavior of each of these animals. I received a free ecopy from NetGalley to provide an honest review."
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,4,"In The Truth About Animals, Cooke takes us on a tour of the animal kingdom and peels back the layers of mystery surrounding all of these animals. She explores the history of our understanding (or misunderstanding) of each animal, along with the latest science on how they really are. Thirteen animals are covered in here, and every one gets its own chapter, so each is fairly short and snappy. My favorite chapters are the ones on hyena, hippo, and panda, but I enjoyed almost every one.This reads a lot like the Planet Earth documentaries, but with more focus on the historical misconceptions of the animals and how those myths were propagated. It's a fun book filled with lots of interesting tidbits. If you ever wondered about why sloths are so slow, how pandas became sex-shy, and whether bats really drink blood (and so many other questions!), this would be a good book to check out."

Each chapter is focused on a different animal and there is lots of great information. The author discusses myths and legends and proceeds to debunk most of them through meticulous research and an engaging voice. There is also lots of history and information on different research projects that have been conducted over time 7/10The Good: This book is so interesting!! The author does a fabulous job at presenting lots of information in a fun and constantly interesting way. Below are some of my favorite facts presented throughout the book:Sloths only poop once a weekMale adelie penguins are one of the most horny creatures on earth and have been known to mate with frozen corpsesVultures have such extremely acidic stomachs that it enables them to ear carrion and this is actually a huge defensive benefit to us because it helps to prevent the spread of many horrible diseasesFemale hyena have the largest clitoris of all animals and are extremely dominant and intelligent animalsMoose have been known to gorge on “drunken fruit” and get quite happy themselvesTo this day, nobody has been able to figure out how eels reproduceWayyyy back people believed that if a woman held a frog in her mouth during sexual intercourse she would not become pregnantThe Bad: Some sections seemed to drag on a bit, especially the chapter on eels. There is quite a bit of discussion of different research projects that are quite grisly… I understand the benefit and need to know about them but I really didn’t want to read about all the horrible things people have done to animals. Wish there was more on aquatic creatures and just longer in general!"

""The Truth About Animals"" by Lucy Cooke takes us on a worldwide journey to meet everyone from a Colombian hippo castrator to a Chinese panda porn peddler, all to lay bare the secret--and often hilarious--habits of the animal kingdom. Charming and at times downright weird, this modern bestiary is perfect for anyone who has ever suspected that virtue might be unnatural (from synopsis).This is such a unique and fascinating read, full of interesting information that I haven't come across in any other books. Perfect for those who enjoy learning about animals, fact lovers and those seeking a lighthearted and super-funny read. Some of the facts could be considered crude, so it isn't something to purchase if you are prudish. Cooke maintains that we have many misconceptions about animals and makes a conscious effort to correct these within this title. I feel that once people know some of these stories that they will want to know more. I sincerely hope Cooke writes another similar book, she has certainly found a niche. There is noone else I know making such excellent books, full of the oddities that exist in the animal kingdom. Although this is non-fiction, I feel strongly that a vast swathe of fiction-only readers would appreciate it too. The reason people usually give for not wanting to venture back into non-fiction is that the genre is dull. ""The Truth About Animals"" will change your mind! It is far from boring! I adored it! Highly recommended.Many thanks to Perseus Books, Basic Books for an ARC. I was not required to post a review and all thoughts and opinions expressed are my own."

What we can laugh at are the drawings of these early explorers. Some of these looked like 5-year olds letting loose with crayons (I am specifically referring to the sloth picture here)Also, hats off to the author for trying out some fantastical things while writing this book.

Now while I was reading The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife, it also became rather painfully obvious that in particular natural philosophers and scientists have sadly and frustratingly over the millennia, over the centuries been some of the absolutely worst offenders and villains with regard to imposing human characteristics, human superstitions, fears and animosities on animal species other than ourselves (claiming, for example, that beavers were socially organised construction companies and that bats supposedly were sexually deviant, even though their sexual practices are actually very much like our own, for bats as a species are in fact more closely related to primates and thus also to us, to humans, than to ANY other mammal species), not to mention the already alluded to above vehement and silly opposition to and often active hatred of scavengers (even though they provide such an important and essential general global service). But even more problematic is the sad and true fact that for ""science"" for ""discovery"" both amateurs and professionals have repeatedly both then and also still sometimes even now often viciously and cruelly tortured the very same animals they have been studying. And yes, I was rather unpleasantly surprised and disgusted at and by this (although in retrospect, I probably should not have been) when I read about the multiple instances of ""scientists"" actively and very much deliberately maiming, blinding, deafening bats in order to study how they hear and how they fly at night, or that before we figured out that many birds migrate in the fall to warmer climates, there was for example the idea floated around that swallows submerged themselves in water to wait out the winter, and of course this was then tested by deliberately drowning the poor birds and then trying to (and of course unsuccessfully) revive them (and while I have indeed found all of this presented factual information most interesting and enlightening, it has also proved infuriating, and even though I do very highly recommend The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife I do leave a caveat that many of the human ""mistakes"" and misunderstandings regarding animals will make those of you who love animals and want to protect and help animals at best a trifle upset, although I still do absolutely and highly commend Lucy Cooke for both detailing these experiments of what I can only call terrorism towards animals and that she is also always both ready and willing to vociferously condemn and disparage even those scientists and natural philosophers whom many of us seem to somehow consider heroic and proverbial sacred cows and thus above and beyond criticism, such as Carl Linnaeus, Charles Darwin, Georges Cuvier, Aristotle just to name a few). Highly recommended, and yes, a fun, engaging, informative (and also never tedious, never dragging or monotonous reading experience) The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife has been (with the detailed footnotes/endnotes and bibliography at the back and that the latter is in fact divided into specific sections corresponding to Lucy Cooke's presented chapters being both appreciated and very much an added bonus). But truth be told, I did kind of already expect there to be an included bibliography in The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife (just because of the subject matter at hand and that Lucy Cooke is obviously not just presenting her personal observations but also her own secondary research), but from my own academic point of departure, especially this here particular bibliography really does totally shine, and mostly because of the way it is organised, as I have always found that bibliographies based on a book's chapters or sections considerably easier and much more user-friendly to consult for especially supplemental research purposes than those bibliographies that just appear as one large and all encompassing list."

You're not a USian, so this is an easier-to-explain mistake, but ""Fox News"" is not a news channel, it is an entertainment channel, which means you should be skeptical of anything ""reported"" by them on air. If it's an amusing anecdotes about how stupid someone is, a popular theme, then it's sure to be bogus, maybe entirely, but certainly in all important details. I mention this to you, because you probably care about the credibility of your book, which clearly is less of an issue for your US publisher, Basic Books.Less than five minutes with Google will get you to Snopes and a brief but thorough account of how the only truth in your two sentences is that a German couple attended a fertility clinic. Storks are a later embellishment to the story.Please fix this before the next addition, because your book really is a fun demonstration of science as a process, chock full of bizarre theories and stranger facts. The stories of credulous writers in the past repeating outrageous claims made by other writers is sure to inspire a feeling of smugness in your readers that you probably don't want them to feel towards you (although it is an accurate demonstration: you probably had a fact-checker who confirmed that Fox had repeated the story but didn't check out Fox's source nor sought out evidence that it was an urban legend).More later: I haven't even gotten to the pandas yet.***That is both an upper and a downer. Cooke has chosen to focus on species that challenge both the conventional wisdom and the science reporting on animals, and it is fascinating. The Comte de Buffon is a treasure trove of strong opinions which are hideously misguided, good solid eye-rolling fun. But it's not just 18th century natural philosophers who are wrong, oh no, bubble-boy. There's a parade of wrongness since the earliest writers to the folks in the field right this minute. Certainly there's lots I thought I knew that ain't necessarily so. There's errors in the field, assuming one population of a species is interchangeable with all, there are errors born of insufficient observation, and errors in reporting, and so very many errors in assumptions. As I mentioned before, the world needs more science writing that shows how theories evolve (or fail to).Tl,dnr: humans aren't special in any of the ways we've ever thought, except our (so far as we currently know) unique ability to eradicate other species.

When you see photos or videos of animals doing human type things we tend to put human personalities and our morals on animals and it really doesn't work. They have their own tales to tell us and in a lot of cases the truth is much much stranger than the fiction.Cooke is the founder of the Sloth Appreciation Society and they make an appearance in here as she dispels the myths about them being lazy and explains the crucial part they play in the ecosystems in the forests that they live in. We will learn why vultures crap on their own legs, which animals partake in prostitution and necrophilia. How pandas are not as sex adverse as we think that they are and what happens when they stop being cute. Lots of animals were considered to appear from out of the mud at the bottom of ponds, including frogs and eels and swallows were though to stay at the bottom of ponds over winter and appear each spring. Migration was only properly discovered when a stork turned up with a spear from an African warrior in its neck. If you want to know why an African Hippo is making itself at home in Columbia and what they are actually closely related to and also to find out if moose are actually drunken reprobates then this is a good place to start.I am not sure that science books are meant to make to laugh out loud and chuckle away to yourself, but this did. Cooke dispels lots of myths and uncovers secrets about her selected animals so of which have been suppressed for almost 100 years. It is an enjoyable popular science book that still has its foundations in serious research in seeking to understand just what makes animals do what they do. 3.5 Stars"

This is not a book for prudes! Cooke makes a conscious effort to correct sanitized, Disneyfied views on animals by bluntly discussing penguin orgies, bat penises, the allure of sloth poo, and the intriguing nature of hyena anatomy. This is also not a book for people who are triggered by animal abuse. Cooke elaborates on the mythology around animals and how scientists in recent centuries (and decades, sadly) conducted cruel, almost senseless experimentation in the name of science. It used to be a great mystery as to where European birds went in the winter. Some believed they transformed into other winter birds, or hibernated in deep ponds (cue many horrible bird drownings to test this theory), or even migrated to the moon.I requested this book largely because I have a deep love for sloths and wanted to read that chapter, but I ended up learning something new on about every page. Some of that information was a bit on the disturbing side--I never expected to learn of a chimpanzee's cocktail-swilling and self-pleasuring ways--but it was consistently fascinating."

Using her wicked sense of humour, Oxford educated zoologist, Lucy Cooke debunks myths about some of the animal kingdom's most misunderstood residents and shows the ludicrous and sometimes barbaric lengths humans have gone to in order to better understand animals. Think you know a lot about the sex lives of penguins, the antibacterial qualities of vulture poo or the just how well-endowed bats are? Well, think again, my friend! Cooke brings readers into the private lives of thirteen animals and shows just how misguided (and often downright wrong) we've been about animals over the centuries. While the research side got a little heavy in places, overall, she successfully balances the information (both ancient texts and more modern beliefs) with a healthy dose of humour and it is clear that she truly loves and respects the beasties she studies. This is an informative read but it's also peppered with truly hilarious anecdotes that will have readers giggling out loud. You can't NOT laugh about myths involving beavers pelting hunters with 'unique' missiles, chimpanzee farts, or be in awe of hippo suntan lotion or shocked by the special ingredient in some vanilla extract!

But I know my husband was thankful when I finally finished this book because after reading each chapter I'd regale him with funny tidbits about sloths, moose (my fav!!), pandas, eels etc. The man can only take so much of my giggle-filled updates of all things animal, apparently.Human arrogance, rampant anthropomorphism and ignorance has proven to be detrimental and downright lethal to many animal species. From hippos to pandas, to hyenas and the slooooowww moving sloth, Cooke's knowledge, respect and love for animals is evident and hopefully readers will become more informed about the unique and fascinating creatures in this bestiary so that we can better appreciate and understand them before it's too late."

To name a few: sloth is not the nature's misfit but a strong survivor and a perfect result of the natural selection; The cuteness of pandas in our eyes severely distorted our understanding of the animal (sex-shy? no); Live African clawed frogs were used in the first reliable pregnancy test, and this frog species, brought by humans to the rest of the world, may be responsible for the deadly amphibian chytrid fungus that is wiping out other amphibians species all over the world.Humans have been looking for meanings and drawing moral lessons from animals since ancient Greece. In this book, Lucy Cooke discusses that in medieval Christian literature, religious views heavily influenced the early western understanding of many animals, from the drunken moose to the penguins thought to resemble the conservative Christian family values. Anthropomorphism is the consequence of the human psych, as it reflects our false belief that we are the center of the natural world. The author criticizes China's panda conservation--the inadequacy of protecting the animals natural habitat, the focus on AI-based breeding program only, and the re-wilding of these animals has a long way to go."

Nevertheless, there were some really good facts in here - I won't say what because, spoilers! The animals covered included some of my favourites; freshwater eels, pandas and frogs. The writing seemed largely anecdotal and some parts read like they were setting the scene for a fictional story - something I wouldn't want in a non-fiction book. The main issue for me was the disparaging remarks about significant figures like Charles Darwin and Carl Linnaeus, implying that their work contained too many errors; if like Carl Linnaeus you devise an entire classification system for cataloguing the entire world's living creatures, there's bound to be the odd error here and there - hell, scientists continue to rearrange and reclassify species following major research but that doesn't make the work by Linnaeus wrong!There were some references to additional reading that I definitely intend to have a look into, because that is one of the things I love about non-fiction books on animals - the reference list! For those looking for a fun 'Did You Know' read about animals, with a fair amount of history thrown in, this is excellent. For me, this felt like an opportunity to showcase the animals the author has an affinity for in a very positive light but the chapters covering some other species were littered with derogatory remarks regarding the species' worth. This was the best quote in this book: ""science is not going to save biodiversity; a shift in human behaviour is the only thing that is going to save it"" - unfortunately, this hits the nail on the head."
21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4714060-ron-s,5,"Oxford educated zoologist and documentary filmmaker Lucy Cooke offers a wildly entertaining random miscellany of thirteen animals, debunking myths and offering unusual insights for each. The new millennium was ripe for a new David Attenborough, and it's hard to imagine a more perfect one than Ms Cooke, a zoological cross between Mary Roach, Bill Bryson, and Richard Dawkins. Funnier than any HBO comedy special I've ever seen, this is the sort of book that could easily inspire a teenager's career path. The animals profiled aren't the Disney versions. Equally fascinating and perverse are the accounts of those that studied them in the past. With any luck, this book will sell well enough to bring forth a sequel: there's a lot more of the wild kingdom to explore and I can't imagine a more entertaining guide. "

Each animal gets a capsule chapter. The creature selection criteria seems diverse: are you misunderstood (sloth, panda)? Unfairly vilified (hyena, bat, vulture)? Humans think you can do cool things that animals definitely can’t do (beaver)? Have centuries of hilarious pseudo-science chronicling your reproduction and gustatory preferences (eel)? The author's frolicsome addiction to assonance, alliteration, and language puns can wear on a person after a few consecutive chapters but there’s no denying that her zest for getting to know the real animal behind the myths is contagious. "
23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32420578-alina,4,"***Note: I received a copy curtesy of Netgalley and Perseus Books, Basic Books in exchange for an honest review.I got rather slow into the book, as I didn’t find the first chapter, about eels, very interesting, and the humor at first seemed rather dull, but it made up afterwards and I found out a lot of interesting facts and hilarious myths about different animals, and the humor grew on me.Unfortunately, I must mention the horrible formatting of the review copy, with no upper case lettering, page numbers mixed in the text, pictures with explaining text disrupting the lecture - all these affected my reading experience in a bad way.Eels: apparently, to this day we don’t know how they reproduce..Beavers were believed to chew off their testicles to escape capture, because “castoreum was a revered medicine in the ancient world on account of its unusually pungent nature. This was a time when smells were considered to be particularly potent as treatments—the more overpowering, the better chances of being healed. Feces, for this reason, were a firm favorite with doctors, if not their patients. A trip to the doctor might involve inhaling a heady cocktail of up to thirty different medicinal turds (such as mouse and even human), which could only have made the sick feel even sicker. Sniffing beaver “testicles” would have been a bed of roses in comparison.”Sloths: “it appears sex is the only thing sloths do quickly.”Hyenas: Not all hyenas are scavengers, some of them hunt >90% of their pray. “Unlike most mammals, hyena cubs emerge with eyes open, muscles coordinated and teeth already pierced through their gums and eager to bite. These belligerent newborns frequently fight to the death over dinner, and siblicide is commonplace.[…]The fact that it fails to get sick after gorging on a putrid carcass riddled with anthrax may explain why many cultures believe the hyena possesses magical powers.”Bats have huge (for their size) and dangling penises.Adelie penguins fuck anything: females, males, babies, corpses, even rocks.Vultures: “if we were to feast on rotting flesh, we’d likely get very sick very quickly. Vultures survive by obliterating disease-bearing bacteria, including some very unforgiving ones, like botulism or anthrax, with some of the strongest stomach acids in the animal kingdom, with a ph similar to that of battery acid.“Frogs: “The sixty-seven hundred or so known species of frog include those that secrete their own sunscreen, others that make their own antifreeze and some that can even fly.”“What makes this frog [Darwin’s frog] so extraordinary is that it has eschewed conventional pond-based metamorphosis for something more sci-fi: after mating the male guards the fertilized eggs until they are close to hatching, then gobbles them up. Six weeks later, like a scene out of Alien, he barfs up baby frogs. He is the only male animal other than the seahorse to give birth, albeit through his mouth.”Moose frequently wander off in people’s gardens and eat apples. Not sure though if the getting drunk/high on fermented apples is true or not really.Hippos myth: “When the animal has become too bulky by continued over-feeding, it goes down to the banks of the river, and examines the reeds which have been newly cut; as soon as it has found a stump that is very sharp, it presses its body against it, and so wounds one of the veins in the thigh; and, by the flow of blood thus produced, the body, which would otherwise have fallen into a morbid state, is relieved; after which, it covers up the wound with mud. What reads as a tragic tale of a self-harming hippo with weight issues was in fact a portrayal of the ancient art of bloodletting—a procedure used in the treatment of an array of ailments for almost three thousand years.” 😊“Escobar was shot by military police in the early 1990s. His empire fell and his entire menagerie was rehoused in zoos across south America—except for the hippos. Transporting an animal that weighs up to four and a half tons is an all too hefty challenge for even the most ardent wannabe hippo owner. So for the next two decades, the hippos wallowed in their pond as their master’s massive ranch was looted to the point of dereliction, and then transformed by the government into the unlikely combination of Pablo escobar theme park (open to escobar fans and complete with waterslides) and high-security prison (open to escobar wannabes and without waterslides).”Wild panda “is a secret stud, fond of threesomes and rough sex, with a taste for flesh and a fearsome bite. But it inhabits an impenetrable forest in a cryptic country, which has allowed an imposter to take center stage and ensured that one of the most recognizable animal brands is nothing but a fraud.”P.S. I loved and recommend Petra's review."

Cooke takes this one throughout the book, exploring how humans have conceived of animal behavior and framed it through human understand and beliefs, rather than the ones of the animals themselves. It's hilarious to read about the sex lives of penguins (no monogamy) and pandas (male pandas have peeing contests to win a mate) and sloths (no one really knows), but, we judge those things based on what we as humans see as normal. And Cooke isn't afraid to look at this both historically and through contemporary lenses.A really great read, with tons of funny stories, and a clear love for animals throughout. My favorite sections were on the sloth -- particularly the drawings and ways that they were rendered in the past -- as well as the section on frogs and hippos. I found the chimpanzee one to be the weakest, but then again, it might be what really hooks other readers. The chimp-human connection isn't a thing that fascinates me the way it does many others.Worth noting that for readers sensitive to depictions of animal abuse in the laboratory, this might be tough to read. Early science wasn't exactly kind to animals in the quest for ""knowledge."" "

There is a large focus on myths that stemmed from the embarrassing depths of early zoology, which was entertaining for the most part. I think that the author was more interested in clowning on certain historical figures than anything else, so it did get a tad repetitive at times. Overall though, when the text was gearing more towards animal facts, I found this to be a pretty decent read. "
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/657110-beth,5,"Animals are glorious - there is such variety among us all, and yet sometimes, that variety is not seen as a positive. As Lucy Cooke points out in her book - creatures like the sloth and the bat, and even the panda are not what we assume them to be. And in every case, they are better.This book is a wild ride. Cooke gets into the past studies of these animals, and includes drawings that are...hideous? Weird? Crazy? In most cases, all of the above. So little understanding, and so much myth has accompanied the hippo and the penguin. There are crazy sex tales (penguins are not generally monogamous), strange facts (the hippo's closest relative is...the whale), and bizarre stories of competitions between early scientists (who would be the first to create a humanzee). Yet Cooke also gives us plenty of actual facts about these amazing creatures, and shows how each is special and unique and deserves its place. She makes a valid point that we cannot afford to continue making mistakes with our wildlife - or we will no longer have them.Overall, this was simply a fascinating book. There were parts that had me laughing, and others where I'm pretty sure my eyes about popped out of my sockets. Parts where I wanted to slap some of those old scientists, and others where I was just in awe about the amazing creatures we have on this earth. Those same creatures that we take for granted or ridicule based on our own perspective - without realizing just how perfect they are for *what* they are. Cooke has shown them for what they are - amazing, bizarre, and special - and worthy of our time and our respect."

Cooke explore these animals from a zoological perspective and historical perspective, particularly how naturalists and biologists of the past misunderstood these animals or infused their attempts to understand them with anthromorphism or religious underpinnings. Cooke’s point is that these animals aren’t here for our entertainment or even for us to study and the only way we can truly understand nature is to try to view the animals that comprise the world from their perspective and not ours. But the book isn’t all deep thoughts but contain fascinating glimpses at amazing animals. Who knew that the genitalia of hyenas could be so enthralling."

Throughout, she dissects these past theories for signs of human superiority, a binary physical understanding, and a little too much of the woodsy musk from a beaver's “gonads.” What’s left: Hyenas are avid feminists, Eels keep their coitus quiet, and Sloths are pretty much the ultimate survivalists. You can devour this all at once or savor each chapter as an individual essay, but you will be amazed by the truth (and bestiary sketches) either way."

36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40159364-moses-hetfield,3,"This book was informative, enjoyable, and easy to get through. The book is basically a history of zoology and misconceptions about certain animals, some of which were pretty wild. Cooke cites a number of sources that sound absolutely fascinating, from medieval bestiaries to 
Lucy: Growing Up Human: A Chimpanzee Daughter in a Psychotherapist's Family
, the memoir of a psychotherapist who decided to raise a chimpanzee as his daughter, which apparently includes some raunchy scenes with a vacuum cleaner.However, Cooke's sense of humor doesn't match up perfectly with mine, and I often found myself cringing at her jokes, which were largely unnecessary as the subject matter was already interesting, bizarre, and funny enough without them. She tries too hard to be cute, and on occasion misses the mark in problematic ways in her efforts to make a cheap joke. Her description of female hyenas as ""the original chicks with dicks,"" which also uses the phrase ""trans trickery,"" play into the misconception that trans people are trying to deceive others through their gender presentation (73). The phrasing is entirely inappropriate, using transphobic tropes to convey a misleading message about female hyenas, who are also not attempting to trick anyone, all for the sake of a rhyme and an alliterative phrase that Cooke evidently thought would be a cute way to spice up her writing. It's not cute.Still, certainly an interesting book overall with plenty of positive features."

46,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author, who studied under Richard Dawkins, focuses her expertise on a handful of animals, among them the hyena, hippo, sloth (her favorite), panda, penguin, chimp, and bat. Her premise is that the wild misconceptions about animals from ancient and medieval times, however erroneous they may be, are no more fantastical than the truth. For example, one early solution to the question of where birds go in certain seasons was the suggestion that they fly to the moon. But that's no crazier an idea (in terms of distance) than the actual routes some birds fly in their migratory commute. Another theme is that our interpretations and misconceptions of animals are based on our own ideas. Thus, for example, in the middle ages people wanted moral instructions, so they found moral and immoral animals. As Cooke says, a good religious allegory trumps the truth every time. In terms of misinformation, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, is the villain of the book, with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of erroneous information, apparently made up out of whole cloth and presented with confident, pompous authority. The truth, however, as Cooke presents it, is much more eye-opening than moral allegory. There's the millennia-long search for the eel's gonads (which Sigmund Freud tried looking for early in his career). The debunking of the myth that the beaver throws his testicles at pursuing predators. Sloths and their poop problem (when do they do it). The reverse sexual dimorphism of the hyena, their bizarre birth canals, and their intelligence. Oh, and the bats. There is a lot of torturing bats in the name of science. Also talk about bat penises, and did you know vampires used to be rumored to be able to turn into watermelons? There's the French scientist who created and fitted tiny pants and suspenders on frogs in order to find out what roles the males and females played in reproduction.As you can see, there's a wealth of conversational material here, and I didn't even mention the program to castrate hippos in Colombia. However, as titillating all this is, the book is not without some flaws. Despite correctly tut-tutting at the anthropomorphism of past naturalists, she is guilty of over dramatizing and anthropomorphizing when trying to shock us with lurid tales of ""panda orgies"" and ""penguin prostitution."" What she goes on to describe is not prostitution at all, but an adaptation in which females steal pebbles after distracting less fit males. She also hints at thrilling, sensationalized terms like necrophilia and homosexuality. While some same-sex partnership has been documented, a lot of what she talks about is no more than the unfettered and thoughtless mating instinct of a dog humping a human leg or the shoulder of a male dog. So while she is right to say that anthropomorphism is ""our major undoing"" in trying to study animals, her own less than subdued chapter hooks are misleading."
47,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636165-wolf,4,"Lucy Cooke’s book is designed as a light hearted read but with a serious purpose. Along the way, it not only entertains but informs. I challenge anyone not to find the biology of the creatures here - and the stories about them - both fascinating and compelling. She has a lovely way of telling her stories - about both animal and the humans who theorised about them, misjudged them, at times horrendously abused them and, sometimes, studied them - with wit and verve. At her best, this recalls the writing of Bill Bryson or Stephen Jay Gould’s popular science. The book would be a great present for anyone who likes their work or enjoys QI.Why not a full five stars, then? Well, I have an advance proof copy - and it is possible that there has been further correction made - but a certain sloppiness has left the book marred by some odd mistakes and slips. For example, the chapter on Eels appears to confuse the First and Second World Wars; at another point we are told that humans have a brain ‘seven times bigger than that of any animal’ (which would be remarkable if true but I suspect the crucial words ‘relative to body size’ have been missed off); the Magaliesberg mountains are said to be 100 years older than Everest (I think 100 times older is what was meant) and so on. I do hope these mistakes have been spotted and corrected. They might not be always the most significant but if as a non expert one can spot them it leads one to question other facts put forward in the book.Otherwise, thoroughly recommended."

There are plenty of facts both historical and scientific. Humor is sprinkled throughout.Even though there is humor, I didn't find it quite as funny as I expected it to be when the blurb compared the book to Mary Roach and Bill Bryson.

The chapters I enjoyed the most were the ones on sloths, hippos, pandas, and penguins.Just a note, a lot of the book has to do with reproduction.

Curious about eel gonads? Want to know if that rumour about beavers self-castrating (even the females) in order to evade capture has any whiff of truth? Sometimes the only thing stranger than what animals are capable of is what we thought they were capable of, and Lucy Cooke has a hearty chuckle on both sides. As well as being entertainingly written, it is chock full of fun tidbits of information about maligned, or just plain misunderstood critters that'll be great to throw out randomly in conversation just to see what people's faces look like when you tell them Hippos are most closely related to whales.I heartily recommend this book if you love animals, love facts about them, or want a good laugh."

As Cooke states in her conclusion, “The urge to anthropomorphize trips us up and obscures the truth.” Each chapter features a different animal and there are fascinating tidbits throughout. I most enjoyed the anthropological aspects, like why humans are historically hostile towards hyenas. Here are some fascinating things I learned… Hyenas are surprisingly intelligent and have highly developed social structures. A hippo’s closest relative is a whale. Though hippos are indigenous to Africa, there is a burgeoning population of them in South America thanks to Pablo Escobar. A vulture tagged by Israeli scientists was detained is Saudi Arabia for suspicion of being a Mossad spy.My only qualm was that Cooke incorporated some long-winded diatribes of historical naturalists who were so far off the mark, they came off as a bit ridiculous.

Swallows were believed to hibernate in a state of suspended animation at the bottom of a lake.

A fun page turner that has many tails about famous species.Among my favorites were: tales of the sloth’s bad rap, the panda’s overblown infertility, and the daring penguin adventure. All the chapters are fairly succinct, engaging, and at times surprising. Hope she continues to write more!! "

It's seriously bananas some of the stuff we used to think about animals, and the sheer volume of things we have yet to learn. Let's just hope we can turn our environment around so we have time to learn everything there is to know. "

Among Lucy’s professors at Oxford was Richard Dawkins, who is a world-renowned Zoologist and author. Lucy is passionate about conservation as well as her love of all sloth kind. She is referred to as the next David Attenborough in some circles.Her Curriculum Vitae includes a diverse range of skills including: television producer, director, award- winning documentary presenter, and filmmaker. Lucy has lecture at TED talks, was a New York Times best-selling author, and founded the Sloth Appreciation Society.In May, 2015 at the age of 45, Lucy was diagnosed with breast cancer. She changed her lifestyle as a result of the diagnosis and has an increased appreciation of life and love.Who is the Target Audience for The Truth About Animals?Any adult would enjoy this funny sojourn into the private and strange lives of animals, reptiles, and birds. Some subjects included for your edification are: the link between pregnancy and toads, stories about storks and their journeys, and tales of necrophilia in penguin communities. These subjects are woven together in a dialogue filled with irony and humor.The author’s style of writing reminds me of Gerard Durrell, author of My Family and Other Animals. If you enjoy well written prose, that are comprehensively researched, and delivered in an irreverent manner, then this could be your next favorite read.What is the Book About?The Truth About Animals is a collection of short stories about various creatures, and the different scientific approaches to the study of animals. Throughout the book your views may be challenged, concepts you had may be reversed or revised, as intricate details of the life of various creatures are revealed. You can expect to be introduced to the Sloth Appreciation Society, discover why Hippos leak, how slippery eels really are, and how bats aren’t as bad as you think. On the journey you will also meet the crazy scientists that used questionable methods to investigate animal senses, the scientist that took the elephant phallus to the face, and the men who believed that swifts sleep the entire winter under water.The genuine love and affection that Lucy has for all animal kind is replete throughout the book and, at times, is almost palpable. The message is simple and clear, we must protect habitats and the animals will do the rest. This position is made clear when she discusses the plight of the Chinese Pandas.I enjoyed the book because it was humorous and with each turn of a page, I learned something new. This book is immensely funny at times and subtly so at other times.In Conclusion>/b>You will enjoy this book if you are looking for fun and learning. Very few authors can write in the way that Lucy Cooke writes. Whilst she isn’t unique, she is a huge talent. This book is: well written, intelligently delivered, beautifully researched, and infinitely humorous. The Truth About Animals is a must have for anyone who loves nature."
59,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5962819-kahn,0,"Back in 2017 I started reading Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? – a book that answered this question (no) in the opening chapter, rendering the rest of the book moot. Turns out, this is the book I should have been reading. Written with passion and humour, Lucy Cooke picks her favourite animals and looks back at how scientific thinking has shifted over time – and how humans have spent a lot of time killing animals in the name of education and science while successfully managing to learn absolutely nothing. Sloths caused a lot of confusion back in the day, we've been wrong about pandas forever, and mooseseses actually have knees. All of the truths revealed here are actual revelations given what the “experts” from wayback claimed. Aristotle, it turns out, was a bit of an idiot. Especially where eels were concerned. And I now know things about penguins I wish I didn't. You also have to marvel at the brain that came up with the idea of strapping bombs to bats. While the past is grisly and at times barbaric, Cooke treads gently through the blood and corpses and guides us to the warm, funny places in each tale. (Yes, I was going to spell it the other way for LOLs...)In doing so, she has created a book packed full of fascinating insights and giggles, written in such an engaging way it's impossible to put down once you've started a new chapter. Science-based books can be dry and dull, but Lucy Cooke has dusted off that preconception and crafted a piece of work that will appeal to everyone. Even those of us who used to like penguins."
60,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"A further Christmas present, ‘The Unexpected Truth about Animals’ is a wholly delightful compendium of animal facts and fallacies. The extremely readable style makes it ideal for a long train journey, except insofar as I found it hard not to giggle repeatedly therefore got some odd looks. Cooke takes a different creature per chapter and explains what bizarre misconceptions Western science has held about it over the centuries. These already entertaining explanations are further enlivened by the inclusion of historic images, depicting these erroneous beliefs. Several of my favourite animals are included: pandas, sloths, and frogs. Despite the light-hearted tone, this is a thoroughly researched and informative book. I’m ashamed to admit that, despite my long term panda obsession, their chapter overturned a number of my assumptions. Indeed, I learned a lot from the whole book, which is a veritable treasure trove of amusing animal anecdotes. Having never given much thought to eels before, I now consider them to be rather fascinating. The joy this book gave me merits five stars, but I must deduct one because the author condemns anthropomorphisation of wildlife while repeatedly indulging in it. An excellent gift. "
61,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5983302-stephen,5,"As the Bill Bryson quote about the book says at the bottom of the front cover 'Endlessly fascinating' this book will not disappoint you. Filled with amazing facts that correct misunderstandings of our furry, feathered and water loving friends. It gives me a deeper understanding of the wonders of animal behavior, reinofces my acceptance of the theory of evolution and certainly starts putting the kabash on the fact that we, humans, think we are special in our uniqueness, just as Donald Trump, the Grifter-in-Chief has destroyed any belief that Amerika is unique. And of course others before the Donald have contributed to that misunderstanding as well. The book at time is astonihing, humbling and outrageously funny. Cooke's investigation into sloths, one of the slowest movers in the animal kingdom recalled a gift I gave to my older brother one year. I made a donation to the Baltimore Zoo in his honor and you got to pick the animal he was supporting with that donation. I gave him the three- towed sloth. It is a funny and enlightening read."
62,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11426356-jerrid-kruse,5,"This book provided insights into quirky animal behavior and the scientists who have misunderstood them. Eels, beavers, pandas, chimpanzees, and frogs are among some of the animals discussed. As the book teaches about animals, it does so through the history of science and the missteps along the way. For example, the ancient Greeks tried to understand where eels come from and literally thousands of years went by before the mystery was finally solved. Our notions about panda sex are based on our inability to correctly identify the sex of the species. The book makes clear that animals and scientists are far more interesting and weird than either is given credit for. As the book nears the end it makes important points about human interference and human identify within nature. "
63,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12975428-russell-atkinson,5,"The author is a zoologist and naturalist, but perhaps is better known for her television work on comedy and nature shows. That might explain why this book, which I had thought was a scientific treatment of unusual or little-known animal facts turned out to be enormously amusing. Certainly her frequent treatment of the sex lives of the featured animals added some spice, but her sardonic wit was evident throughout. I suspect she could make the history of linoleum hilarious. Don't mistake this for a dismissal of the book as frivolous, for it is very well documented and scientifically sound, at least so far as I can determine. I learned a lot and laughed a lot. It's difficult to give much higher praise.I cannot resist one smidgen of constructive criticism (a phrase that strikes fear or loathing into the heart of any author): she spends too much time debunking myths that were debunked decades ago, or even centuries ago. In other words, she tells us some of the ridiculous things people used to write or believe about various animals and then explains when and by whom those ideas were corrected. That really isn't anything about the animals but merely illustrative of how bad ""science"" used to be. That's a tad out of the description of the title, but the author was able to find a lot of humor there as well."
64,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/802351-amanda,4,"This was a fun, smart, sarcastic, funny book – I loved her wry writing style. I learned some fun animal factoids (hippos generate their own sunscreen! A wayward band of hippos lives in Colombia?!) but mostly this book emphasizes the importance of good science, and the supreme arrogance of humans. A lot of animals have suffered due to “bad marketing” – a human decides an animal is “gross”, definitively says so, and somehow it sticks. We force animals to try to fit what’s “good” and “right” in the human world, but animals are just being … themselves. On one hand, it’s funny to look back at all the “bad science” that went on centuries ago, on the other hand, it’s very sobering to realize how much of that still goes on today. I hope that people will read this book and will be challenged to learn good science, not label animals (particularly through our own arrogant lens), and that, as she said, that we’ll get our own population under control and start to contemplate not being such mass consumers.

But a wise reader should be cautioned that if all they read is the funny, they are missing history, animal facts and the warning that we still don’t know much about animals, so our presumption that we do should be cast away as a dangerous arrogance. There are more funny lines in this book than I can count, but my biggest takeaway was that as funny as the author is, she is wiser than she is funny. It’s really an amazing book."

What surprised me the most, probably, was that this book wasn't just a comical clearing up of misconceptions, but also a history of biology, evolution, the scientific process, and environmentalism to varying degrees. Cooke definitely calls us out for messing things up for not only ourselves but for the animals. There were some graphic details related to poaching and animal experimentation which I wasn't expecting, but for me, this book overall was worth reading, not only for the history and the interesting facts, but also simply because I enjoyed reading it."

I really love her style with laugh out loud anecdotes to quippy alliterations and perfect timing and placement of 'choice' words. She recaps historically inaccurate bestiaries which I found fascinating due to their inaccuracies and how science was conducted before any rigorous method was established. So many interesting and weird facts about these animals. Great read! "

Bryson is one of my favorite authors - funny, irreverent and wildly entertaining. I figured if Bryson likes Lucy Cooke's book, it must be fabulous. Well, not so much. Cooke chose 13 animals whose reputations are full of myths and misunderstandings and seeks to clear up the confusion. While there were some laugh out loud moments and some real gems and surprising facts, the book was overall weighed down with a bit too much academia. I wish Bryson had co-authored the book. He has a knack for taking deadly dull material and making it understandable, entertaining and funny, which ""The Truth About Animals"" could have used in large doses. Cooke obviously conducted a great deal of research and has undeniable expertise when it comes to zoology. But she has a difficult time making the facts in the book interesting. Instead, she relies on animal erotica (who knew penguins could be so amorous?) and bathroom humor to get her laughs. ""The Truth About Animals"" was a great book to read before bedtime....zzzz. "

Lucy Cooke's The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife is certainly among these gems. This book is a close-up examination of some of the most bizarre traits and behaviors of some of our friends in the animal kingdom. With each animal profile, the author looks at both our past and current understanding of that species and we our predecessors got it completely wrong and where we are still in the dark on why some animals do the things they do. And let me tell you, it cannot be overstated how hilarious some of the early naturalists' thought and musing were, especially on creatures they had no actual contact with! It's honestly hard to pick out any real flaws with this book. Perhaps the author refers back to the antics and writings of the 18th century naturalists of Lazzaro Spallanzani and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon too often. However, it would be a shame to have not included how crazy some of these earlier scientists thought and performed their experiments. Spallazani was an Italian biologist/physiologist with some... unorthodox ways of setting up experiments. It should be noted that many of these experiments would be considered animal abuse now, so keep that in consideration. The Comte de Buffon on the other hand was a French naturalist and writer who authored a thirty-six volume encyclopedia of Natural History, many of the volumes dealing with the animal world that include some insanely comical anecdotes and assumptions. The Truth About Animals isn't all just fluff though. It has an excellent balance of the comedic and hard science. There are many appearances of dedicated scientists both past and present making serious headway into furthering our understanding of the natural world. These vignettes of current scientists in the field add a nice dimension to the work by demonstrating that even crazy sounding science (such as biologists having to castrate wild hippos in Columbia!) is serious work with important implications. Lastly, this book leaves you wanting more despite how jam packed the book is with information on the animals covered in the book. Some of this information will be permanently burned into your brain such as the sloth version of Tinder... I particularly enjoyed the chapter on moose as they are an animal that I see somewhat frequently where I live. Many myths about moose are busted and I certainly learned new things about these northern giants, particularly when it comes to whether or not they can get drunk off all the apples they eat.  Overall, The Truth About Animals by Lucy Cooke was a blast to read and was a lot of fun. Not too many science books can claim that. The humorous references and anecdotes are spot on and show both the folly of our predecessors as well as how much further we still need to go ourselves. I highly recommend this book if you want an enjoyable book about the animal kingdom and you don't mind some laughter with your learning.  5 out of 5 stars."

101,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67047018-cavak,4,"For those wondering, The Truth About Animals has a limited focus on global wildlife and covers the following animals: eels, beavers, sloths, hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks, hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees.Two major themes are included with the coverage for these species: how our anthropomorphic beliefs in Western culture throughout the ages has obscured the truth of their behavior from surfacing in the public eye, and how our ignorance (and arrogance) throughout the centuries have led to unsettling consequences for the native environment or species. Sources often favor the earliest known scientific recording within European circles throughout the centuries, highlighting the laughably bizarre and scandalous details of misguided scientific papers or encyclopedias for our modern entertainment. Of course, public meltdowns and tug-of-wars between two opposing scientists are included too. Sometimes over subjects I least expected. Wow, these men really want to be right about bats' sight and hearing. Myths are summarized to support the human misconception parts. It's no secret that religious beliefs are the bigger influencer for this section though (it is going back as far as the sixteenth century, after all). Paradoxical instances are included too, since one man of the clergy will spread damaging misconceptions while another priest will prove a benign assessment centuries later. Several instances reminded me of this quote: ""There are no new breakthroughs in science, only the old generation dying so that the voices of the young can be heard."" But then opinions made by an animal's appearance (i.e. bats, vultures, moose, penguins, panadas, chimps) take the spotlight too. So don't worry, all major biases are in the same boat.I appreciate Cooke having the curiosity and determination to visit places of conservation in person. Especially when not all of these species are known for being ""cute and cuddly."" It adds an element of humor and empathy to the writing, hitting harder when the facts venture into the effects of humanity's blunders. All with approachable British wit. Rather close to the tone in a BBC documentary, so I was not surprised to learn that Cooke has done such work in the past. Believe me when I say that some truths are better in print than in video. Her well sourced book is a wonderful and simplified experience for even the most casual reader. You don't have to be invested in a particular scientific study to enjoy it.While I knew some of what was mentioned in this book before reading it, I still liked being informed. The Truth About Animals is a must-read for anyone with an inquisitive mind. Because it's humbling to know that even with all of humanity's technological advancements, we still don't know everything about the animals around us.I received the book for free through Goodreads Giveaways."

(from the conclusion)There's little I can say that other reviewers haven't already said. I've rarely read a non-fiction book so fascinating and so much fun. Cooke's sense of humor melds beautifully with her exhaustive knowledge. I'll be recommending this book to several friends!While I respect Cooke's ""faith"" in evolution (She calls it her religion.), as a Christ-follower who reads widely, I wish she had refrained from saying God ""bellowed"" two times. Such an offensive word wasn't necessary. A word of warning: If you're considering this book for your animal-obsessed tween or teen, read it yourself first. Every chapter talks about animal reproduction and reproductive organs. (There's a joke about panda porn.) Our kids have been on safaris and seen various animals ""in the act,"" so I was comfortable with my 15y.o. reading it.This book is as much about the history of zoology and our perception of animals as it is about animals themselves. If, like me, you're more of a history/anthropology/psychology buff than an animal fan (I would never touch an eel!), and if you, like me, love contradictions to conventional thinking, you will be delighted by The Truth About Animals."

104,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301240-patty,5,"Nonfiction about weird animal facts, which is possibly my very favorite kind of nonfiction, especially on days when I don't want to think too deeply. Cooke organizes this book around animal myths that many of us believe (or used to believe, once upon a time) and then presents the truth – which not infrequently is odder than the myths.Of course, some of the myths are pretty outrageous in and of themselves. I did not know that medieval Europeans thought beavers, when hunted, would tear off their testicles and throw them away as a distraction. I also did not know that early modern Europeans thought beavers had elaborate governments, complete with laws, police, and a class structure. I know their dams are impressive, but... wow, early modern Europeans. Wow.Though I love history almost as much as I love weird animal facts, most of the myths Cooke refutes are modern and more likely to be familiar to the average reader. Certainly I'd heard that pandas are really bad at sex and reproduction, and that moose get drunk on rotting fruit. I'm familiar with the stereotypes that sloths are lazy and that vultures are gross. I've seen the Disney documentaries and picture books starring penguins' sweet monogamous romances. I remember being told that storks bring babies (okay, probably no one reading The Truth About Animals thinks that last one is literally true, but it was interesting to find out where the myth came from!). These modern myths were possibly even more fascinating than the bizarre historical ones, because several times Cooke managed to overturn an assumption that I myself had been convinced was true. If you, like me, are a connoisseur of books about weird animal facts, you will see a few well-known stories reused here: that Freud dissected hundreds of eels looking for their missing testicles; Pablo Escobar's escaped Colombian hippos; the chimpanzee raised in a suburban American household; female hyenas' massive clitorises. However, The Truth About Animals had a much greater new-to-me/old-news ratio than I expect from a book in this genre. I also really loved Cooke's style, which was breezy and hilarious while still being informative and well-researched. Her writing reminded me of Mary Roach's, mixing silliness with in-depth considerations of context and background. Definitely recommended to anyone who has spent too much time watching animal videos on Youtube. I read this as an ARC via NetGalley."

It also tells of the historical ""knowledge"" spouted about these same animals in earlier centuries which makes me wonder about the ""facts"" that we assume to be true now and will find to be false in the future. It's a reminder about the importance of always questioning and never assuming the truth of facts we are presented with. Also, the chapter on frogs and its proposed explanation about why frog species around the world are dying off is particularly poignant. Sometimes I sadly imagine how wonderful the world would be if the human race hadn't ****** it up. "

107,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696608-dale,4,"Published by Basic Books in 2018.Zoologist Lucy Cooke explores some of the offbeat bits of the animal world in The Truth About Animals - a book that shows us that most of us think we know a lot about the animal world, but we really don't. None of the animals featured are obscure - they are all well-known, with the possible exception of the eel (at least in the United States). The animals featured in the book are: eels, beavers, sloths, hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks, hippos, moose, pandas, penguins and chimpanzees.Cooke usually begins with a look at the animal in question in historical texts so that we can see that these misunderstandings have been going on for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. For example, bats have been misunderstood and mis-classified since...well, forever. The struggle to figure out how exactly bats travel at night was especially gruesome, featuring scientists blinding live bats, plugging up their noses and coating their bodies with lacquer in an effort to determine exactly how they can fly so well in the dark.All too often, these animals are associated with an human-introduced invasive species of some sort. Sometimes, they are the victims of that species (frogs) and sometimes they are that species, as in the case of hippos. Did you know that there is a colony of hippos in Colombia? Four of them were introduced by the drug lord Pablo Escobar as a part of a personal zoo but they escaped when his drug empire fell. Now, there are more than 40.Every animal description has a long description of the sex life of the animal. Ironically, this usually comes after a withering commentary about how Victorian or medieval writers were overly concerned about the sex lives of animals. Sometimes it is interesting and has a larger point (as in the story of the eels), other times it is simply presented in a vulgar manner that detracts from the book. For example, when Cooke is discussing Hyenas she spends a lot of time talking about the fact that the genitalia of a female hyena look a great deal like those of a male - so much so that they are often confused for males without benefit of a very close inspection (which would be dangerous for most people). This setup makes it difficult for them to mate and makes giving birth a highly dangerous activity. All of that is interesting information. But, calling them ""the...Read more at: http://dwdsreviews.blogspot.com/2018/..."

109,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6854780-kend,4,"This book is STINKIN' hilarious, and I highly recommend it to everyone. With this one proviso: the author makes a couple of teeth-grinding missteps, and all as a result of style and voice. Cooke is an aficionado of the weird and the unusual in nature, and she highlights the ridiculousness of both nature and humanity's historic understanding of it by cracking jokes on a nigh-constant basis. The problem is, she sometimes uses language loosely and therefore imprecisely when she's joking, and the ""Hyena"" chapter includes both references to ""trans trickery"" and ""gender-bending"" (that one, repeatedly) when Cooke is really trying to say something along the lines of ""female hyenas may appear intersex but they are actually not."" Cooke probably does know, given things said elsewhere in the book, that gender and sexual orientation and sexual behavior are not one and the same thing, but joke-y treatments of terms such as these does nothing to help the cause of those who are actually part of the LGBTQIA+ community. So I'd skip that chapter if you're queer or nonbinary.Part of what kills me about this imprecision in joke-y language is that Cooke is SO precise when describing the macabre and tortuous experiments carried out on animals throughout history. This book will certainly not be for you if you are squeamish about animal cruelty, which has had pride of place in animal experimentation throughout history and even up to the present day. The ""Bat"" chapter is especially ... troublesome. Since a lot of experimentation has revolved around identifying how animals reproduce and navigate their worlds, you can imagine how uuuuughhh-inducing many of these scenes are.With all of these issues, it might surprise you to discover I loved this book, skipping in my brain over the hyena and bat chapters. The real value of this book is not in making jokes at the expense of innocent animals tortured for their secrets, but in developing a respect for the maturation of science as a discipline from something that left room for cruel animal experimentation to something that still endlessly interrogates our world and helps us ask ever-better questions of it, sans most of the evil human nature bits. The fact that we have moved from a world where we believed eels were born from beetle buts to a world where we ... don't ... is a beautiful thing."

Lucy Cooke goes through the history, myths (and their origins) and real facts about all the animals she covers, and it's clear she is passionate about the subject as well as extremely knowledgable. Warning: there are some parts where she goes into detail about misguided and cruel experiments done on animals (in the name of science) which may be tough for sensitive people like myself to stomach. I found I could bear it because know they didn't do it to be cruel, and they didn't have the same sense of animal rights/compassion that is more commonplace these days, though the bat chapter in particular got a little rough. A note on the audio book: she narrates it herself and I found her voice a little jarring. Also when she quotes something from any book written by a man she puts on the same kind of ""hurr durr, I'm a man"" voice (in lack of a better way to explain it) which gets a little tedious.

The title of the book should be ""The Unexpected Truth About Animal Reproduction."" Every chapter follows the same template (more or less) of: look at the crazy things people thought about animals hundreds of years ago (seemingly always quoting the Comte de Buffon) to this is actually the truth about this animal to let me tell you about how they reproduce. Lucy Cooke is undeniably hooked on studying animal reproduction. For these reasons, there were only a few chapters (Sloth, Hyena, Frog, Hippo) that were interesting. These chapters went beyond Cooke's typical template to tell us historical or scientific information that was extra interesting. Make these chapters into articles, and our work is done. Other chapters ranged from just ok to complete duds (the Moose chapter was terrible).There are several other weaknesses to Lucy Cooke's writing. I'll note 3.1) Her use of hyperbole. Cooke used hyperbole to set up almost every chapter. At each chapter's outset, she would say ""look at the crazy things people incorrectly through about animals"" with a snarky, condescending tone. She would then transition to ""but the truth is even crazier!"" However, her snarky/condescending tone implied general disrespect for the ways people have (sometimes earnestly) misunderstood animals. This made it a hard sell for the reader to have respect for and generate the proper appreciation of the truth.2) Her understanding of natural philosophy and the history of scientific study. Cooke constantly reminds the reader she was trained by Richard Dawkins, and mirrors his poor understanding of history and ignorance of how faith propelled scientific study. She believes that any time religion mixed with science the results were bad, and this is 100% false. It's easy to see the cracks in her logic, as she will quickly discredit past scientists for their religious associations if their findings were ludicrous. But for monks, priests, religious scholars, etc who contributed positively and appreciably to the field, she'll quickly skip over. That said, towards the end of the book Cooke says that evolution is her god so at least she's wearing her beliefs on her sleeve.3) Her leveling of the playing field. Cooke constantly criticizes attempts to anthropomorphize animals, which is a good criticism. However, she then takes the stance of ""this is everything we humans can learn from animals"" and actively breaks down the barrier between man and animals. Her very last sentence asks if there is much difference between humans and chimps. This is sad, as we humans for a variety of philosophical reasons she hasn't really wrestled with have lots of differences from animals. And much of these differences are good. If you read this far, skip this book. I had high hopes, but was very disappointed."

Their ideas, the glimpses into their lives are often just as entertaining and engaging as the animals themselves. The sincerity, with which the most absurd hypothesis were embraced, are enhanced as the author brings to light not just their most vocal advocates but also their dissenting compatriots, as in the case of Swedish Bishop Olaus Magnus firm belief in the then time honoured legend that swallows hibernated underwater over winter in great clumps. But as Lucy points out, ""Not everyone bought the hibernation story...Oxford-educated..[Charles] Morton...proposed the more rational hypothesis that swallows, as well as other seasonal birds like the stork, migrated to the Moon."" In fact, this book is full of similar delightful differences, down to outright feuds, including one Thomas Jefferson against a recurring character, the 'grandiose Comte de Buffon', who was responsible for the most amazing histrionic and over the top descriptions.The author also recounts more current pursuits, including her own, in the name of zoological science and these were equally fun to read, though also sometimes a wee bit disconcerting and lets just say that the intersection of the phrases 'beaver anal glands' and 'natural vanilla flavour' might have me looking a bit sideways at my next icecream.As for Lucy's writings about the animals themselves, these completely met and surpassed my expectations. To be honest, I was going to skip the chapter on eels (I came here for the mammals and avians) but I took a glance to see what angle she would take, what misinformation the humble eel (which turned out to be more extraordinary than humble) was saddled with. Welp, one chapter down I had an entirely new appreciation for eels, had been thoroughly entranced by stories of those plagued by the question of eel reproduction and was as ""giddy with discovery [as] Grassi [was when he] proclaimed the Strait of Messina...to be the breeding ground of all European eels, thereby claiming the lip-smacking fish and its extraordinary lifecycle as the property of the newly united Kingdom of Italy.""Basically, I am just fangirling this book for being not just the playfully clever look at animals and their myths that I expected it to be but also for all its extra goodies in the shape of; the morsels of history info, the random but awesome linguistics moment, and the necessary conversation around conservation."

(I suspect we'll know a lot more about their intelligence, communication and social behaviors, knowledge that will uncomfortably erase the distance between us and them -- a conclusion that Cooke circles toward at times, particularly in her discussion of chimpanzees.) She traces the long, often very confused history of research on animals with strong popular mythologies, from the beaver to the frog to the giant panda on the book's cover. Her discussions of animal research make clear that humans have routinely tortured and dismembered animals in often-failed attempts to learn their secrets. Retracing hundreds of years of scholarship, she explains why hyenas got a reputation for being evil and why no one could figure out how eels reproduce. She demonstrates that our perceptions of different species' behaviors have frequently been shaped by mythology, Biblical references and human moral preferences. These biases have overshadowed how animals actually live in the real world -- which can be far more amazing than what early scientists and writers imagined.Cooke's delight in the habits of the animals she observes rubs off on her readers. She sometimes goes over the top with her puns, alliteration and double entendres -- though the zaniness of her material can just about handle the prose. And there were some problems with structuring each chapter around a different animal; the prolific (and extravagantly misguided, though irresistibly named) Comte de Buffon has to be reintroduced in almost every chapter. But the book was endlessly entertaining, at least for me if not for my husband, whom I followed around the house reading animal trivia out loud for three days."

I've learned a lot about the different animals which are covered in the chapters, each of these is dedicated to a particular species; I think my favourites were the penguins and the frogs, but I loved every chapter.It was interesting to know how wrong our ancestors were especially a certain Comte de Buffon (which I couldn't resist pronouncing ""Bouffon"" which means fool), but the author put it all in perspective making it quite understood that future generation might laugh at our conclusions too... especially concerning eels because we don't seem to know a lot about them still like where do they come from (geographically and maybe also anatomically). It is also evident that time is running out on a lot of the species we don't know a lot about and that is sad on so many levels.For someone like me, who loves animals, but don't know that many facts about them... some ideas we have as a society in general got debunked like bats lap blood from open wounds (and I'm sure you know they do not turn into Romanian vampire) and do not suck it or inflict the wound (generally, I guess they are capable if enervated, but then they wouldn't stick around to lap while the victim was panicking); oh, and the majority of bats eat fruit, no blood at all in their diet.I'm so full of facts now, but I do not want this to turn into ""she said so much in her review there was nothing interesting anymore"". Lets just do a recap : great facts, lots of humour, fascinating science (sometimes very gross), great aside from the author (her asides in parenthesis are just hilarious, mostly running commentaries) and you'll have a fun informative time reading this (well, I did)I'll just underline something I haven't written a review in months and it took something really special to make me sit at my computer, which I normally have enough of at work, so this is a very special book and I seriously hope there's gonna be a second one with a new selection of animals in it."

This book covers various animals, offering facts and assessments about certain creatures that you never would have heard about in your grade school biology textbooks. Mainly focusing on the reproductive actions of a series of animals, this work looks to demystify various assumptions about said animals, cutting through centuries of human projection and erroneous research. Some of the things you will learn about animals from this work: - Sloths are deliberately slow and live most of their lives in trees...except when they need to defecate. They will come down from trees to do their business in the ground at certain points. This when they are most vulnerable. - Hippos secrete their own sunscreen, due to the fact that they do not have any fur or hair to keep the sun off their bodies. Also, as noted in South America, if they can’t mate, they tend to get very, very aggressive (thank you Pablo Escobar). - Hyenas were once thought hermaphrodites due to the fact that the female genitalia are shaped very similar to the males. Also, the females rule the roost for that species, and not the males. - Penguins are not virtuous creatures. While appearing cute and family oriented, they can display behavior that humans would consider perverted and criminal. - Beavers were once considered virtuous because, according to medieval literature, self-castrate to fend off hunters. Clearly, that is not true, but they also were prized for their rear organs that had properties similar to vanilla, as well as (alleged) properties that could handle female hysteria. - Panda are very, very picky when it comes to reproduction, and in the wild, are far more amorous then they are in the zoos. Their love lives...well, way more exciting in the wild. These any many other facts are in this work. The audiobook is quite engaging, as you have a British zoologist narrating her own work, so you get facts + British humor...quite a combination. Funny and engaging. If you check this one out, you have to go for the audiobook. "

Once I started this book however I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it and the way that it was written. It wasn't written like an information book and it wasn't written like a novel either. It took each chapter and that chapter alone was based on a specific creature of the animal kingdom and something that is truly unique about it, that we as humans are just learning about now. This book took myths and things that we once thought were true about animals and discussed what we now know is fiction and how it is so. Each chapter of the book focused on one main subject so this was like a bunch of mini books all combined. It gave lots of details and facts as well as stories or actual accounts to back up the myths and the truths about animals. Very interesting read and very different than what I'm normally used to reading however I am very glad that I got the chance to check it out. I really enjoyed how each segment was about a different animal and was labeled accordingly because that way when you are reading it if you won't like that particular animal or you are uninterested in it you can skip it and you don't miss out on any of the parts that you are interested in. Great read, it will change the way you look at all animals after you read this. I'm very glad that I got the chance to check it out. This is a must read for any animal lover or anyone looking to expand their knowledge in the animal kingdom."

Many chapters detail the very (very) lengthy processes that lead to insights that now seem obvious. Thinkers as great as Aristotle believed that many animals were not born but spontaneously came to be in some sort of divine magic. The origins of animals that drastically change form over their lifespan (think tadpoles growing into frogs) baffled scientists for decades. The chronicling of human error can get old at points. The stories illicit a great mix of embarrassment on behalf of mankind and wonder at how far we've come, and are all entertainingly told, but by the fifth chapter of ""Here's a history of false thought about THIS creature"" I started skimming. The book was great though, and Cooke's wonder at unappreciated animals like the sloth and panda (both which she makes the case are highly evolved survivors despite their reputations for being natural oddities that have inexplicably avoided extinction) is contagious. The book was written to point out the damage caused by humanizing animals (chimps smiling in movies or on greetings cards are showing nervousness or fear) and arrogantly considering ourselves as rulers of the world rather than accepting our place as one species coexisting with the rest of the world's fauna. The messages could easily have come across as preachy and self-righteous, but delivering them through tales of penguin prostitutes and esteemed scientists repeatedly making fools of themselves makes it hard not to agree with Cooke's ideas of how we should interpret animal behavior."

If you happen to pick up this book, (which currently has a ""Favorited by Nadia"" sticker on its review card at the bookstore I work in) you will have a great deal of fun learning about the wild scientific experiments that people have done (including crafting a very well-fitted pair of frog trousers) as well as learn more about the amazing evolutionary traits that our fellow creatures have gained over time (like the female hyena's pseudo-penis that gave early scientists a horrified shock).As with most books about our fabulous world of diverse creatures, we also get to hear a bit about how these unique individuals have either been driven close to extinction, or have actually been wiped out from certain areas in the world. This books has given me a great belly-laugh, taught me just a bit more about life on Earth, and I also have a stronger gratitude and appreciation for the many individuals who have dedicated their lives to restoring and protecting animal populations and well-being.

It is obvious very quickly that rather than share facts that might enhance conversations or teach us something we might exemplify, instead Cooke showers us with disgusting message after disgusting message of the most lewd facts she can muster. She emphasizes her true point to the book in the conclusion, that humans are rather dumb and animals should not be used as a moral compass’. She spends each chapter highlighting how scientists over the centuries wasted a lot of time and effort aggrandizing their own efforts in the end to mislead humans and how humanity has adopted ideas that have misshaped science. I just got really tired of the ‘fun’ facts being about animal gonads and animal sex and animal feces. It got old. Of course animals are animals and there is nothing ‘wrong’ about such knowledge. I’m not trying to use animals as some kind of religious standard. I don’t really want to hear about animal sex just for the sake of snickering about it. It’s just really well written sensationalized pop-culture science. Also, it doesn’t matter to me that she doesn’t believe in religion, but she is rather openly anti-religion and decides sharing these useless stories will be the best way of combating such thinking. I feel like there could be a lot more worthwhile knowledge to use about animals than just showing they are not what we typically think of them."

Although I'm hugely into animals and settling common myths about them (bats won't get caught in your hair, people, c'mon), the book was more informative than it was witty, and goes through extensive (but at times amusing) history of the animal's scientific research. I even found myself speed-reading through some chapters, such as 'Eels' and 'Storks' (plus, there are only 13 animals covered).Why do I feel so guilty admitting that? Maybe because I grew up in a science/biology/animal-centered home (also religious, which the author's seemingly biased opinion thinks the two can't coincide) that thrived on quoting from numerous animal encyclopedias on a daily basis, so I feel like my conscience is yelling at me for not enjoying this book as much as I should. 😞The book is written well and the information very thorough, so I would at least highly recommend this to someone possibly interested in a zoology degree.

It is indeed a natural history, but the focus is definitely on the sexual oddities of a select group of animals, along with the sexual interests and/or obsessions of the scientists who have studied them over the last 2,000 years. Lucy Cooke is a devoted zoologist, evolutionary biologist, (she studied under the likes of Richard Dawkins), and a damned good science writer for the general audience. The little tidbits readers learn about the animals she features here are surprising, fascinating, and sometimes a little disturbing. Cooke makes a brilliant observation in the book's conclusion that studying the mistakes and failures of scientists is just as interesting and revealing as studying their accomplishments. Some of the assumptions made by early observers of wildlife are outrageous and hilarious. Understanding how we have arrived at the current knowledge base is important in determining how we move forward with greater and more amazing discoveries in the natural world.As much as I admire Cooke as a researcher and writer, I do wish a professional had read this Audible version of the book. Reading is not her greatest skill. Nevertheless, I recommend this book to anyone interested in the strange habits of wildlife that you might not see on television or anywhere else. Fun stuff."

I dare you to read this book and not go around spouting random animal fun-facts to all of our friends and family.I’ve been an animal lover since I was very little (Animal Planet was my favorite TV channel for many years), so this book was a treat for me. Not only did I learn a lot about animals that I never thought to research before, but I did so in an incredibly fun way. Cooke knows how to impart knowledge without making it feel like a chore for the reader. Her writing is funny, engaging, and full of clever puns and chuckle-inducing, “dad”-like humor.Cooke clearly takes her zoological work very seriously, but she has the power to make light of the more humorous facts about animals in a lighthearted way. Animals are multifaceted, and not all of those facets need to be treated with the same level of brow-furrowing seriousness.I only wish that this book was longer!

Blending together history, scientific research, and natural observation, this book is truly incredible. I learned so much and highly recommend it to other naturalist enthusiasts. I was, however, saddened to learn just how violent and cruel scientists, explorers, and naturalists have been in their efforts to uncover the truth about many species.I'm rating this book as 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the author had provided more judgement and decrying of the violent methods employed by historical scientists and modern-day poachers. In this time of climate change, overfishing, deforestation, and poaching, we can't really afford to let readers draw their own conclusions. I hope more people read this book and understand why having kids and consuming limitless swaths of land and resources IS the problem. This world is not for humankind only. I was also bothered by the use of the word ""discovered,"" as in ""such-and-such a species wasn't discovered until 1849,"" when really, plenty of indigenous people knew such an animal existed.

Lucy Cooke also writes in a refreshingly humorous way; I found myself chuckling at almost every page in the book. Jokes aside, the book really does a lot in changing the perspective regarding the animals. Some misconceptions were outdated, not so widespread today as they were before the age of internet, but still, it was interesting to read what our ancestors thought about our world fauna, what was behind these ideas, and what the truth really is.Humans tend to anthropomorphize animals in an effort to make sense of our own behaviour, but, as this book points out, we shouldn't. Their quirks and anatomy designs affect their chances for survival and each of them has its purpose and place in its environment. Even mosquitos, who I often wish to eradicate completely, have their purpose. (Somewhere. Not on my skin.) It's not up to us how animals should behave and look like, nor we should judge them if they do not fit our standards.

It will open your eyes to frankly an amazing planet with some amazing animals and then further proceed to let you know what we have done to try and figure out how it has worked (including throwing birds in rivers to quell the notion they migrated to the moon, the adventures of Sigmund Freud- eel gonad hunter, along with a whole host of other weird, disturbing or outright fascinating tales). If you don't own it, what on earth are you waiting for. I think books are a great value for money; the emotion and time that you get out of them for usually a relatively cheap price of £8.99.

At times it was tough to read about scientific experimentation that took place back in the day but those experiments did happen so it is important to read about. However, the author did not focus on that for the most part. She mostly focussed on how our understanding of animals has changed through the ages.It was, indeed, fascinating to read about.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Mary Roach (the author infuses a similar sense of humour as Roach to this book) and/or is interested in the animal world.I'd like to thank the publishers who sent me a digital review copy of this book on net galley in exchange for an honest review."

This quote could be an intro for this book. Lucy Cooke takes you on a ride through the history of zoology, from the suppositions that made up ancient 'science' to modern knowledge about various species. She picks 13 groups of animals (from as large as all frogs to as specific as chimpanzees). For each, she relates early discoveries (and folklore) and systematically debunks the fallacy to replace it with current knowledge. Along the way, she tells the stories of the early explorers and of her own encounters with each group. Personally, I loved this book. Shattering misconceptions has always been favorite reading for me and this book fits this exactly. The early beliefs range from ridiculous ideas to intentionally hidden facts. Each had their own charm and reasons and Lucy Cooke shows how good science dismantles the superstitions and presents a story all the more fascinating for being true.

I had no idea that bats were actually considered to be used as mini-bomb carriers into Japan during WWII. It was seriously considered and studied until a few errant bats burned down most of the military base at Carlsbad. Moose get drunk! They love fermented apples and get pleasantly tipsy. A certain species of frog was so successful in detecting pregnancy in human urine that they replaced the cruel 'rabbit test' until they themselves were replaced by modern pregnancy tests. People used to believe that when they were not seeing birds in their area that they flew to the moon (quite the migration) rather than just moved to a warmer climate for awhile. A growing herd of hippopotamus has been thriving in Columbia, South America in Andean ponds. Obviously way out of their element, they were introduced into the area by a billionaire drug lord who wanted a private menagerie. Said drug lord has since been murdered and the hippos left to procreate at will. Public outcries over destroying the animals has led to hippo castration. What a job.

There's 13 animals listed here, from the sloth, to the hyena, from the chimp to the eel, via the vulture, the entire animal kingdom is covered in one form or another. Starting from the bestiaries, the author looks at the myths surrounding each animal, where they came from, and what the actual truth is. All backed up with copious foot notes, and references. The author goes through what was originally believed and how science eventually got to the truth. To be honest, it doesn't really show scientists in a good light, some of the old experiments would get you arrested now. This is not to say though that it's a dry lecture. The author has a real way with words, which makes the book feel more like a chat. It's just full of interesting little facts, that I virtually guarantee you will not be able to keep to yourself.

I applaud Cooke's statement that ""with the rise of efforts to discredit science, there has never been a greater need for truth."" The readability of the text lowered my review. The writing could have been more polished and Cooke should have used some discretion when choosing rare, complicated words.

I'm not entirely sure how you can make all that good stuff boring but, for me, she managed all too well.Several clangers with English, such as muddling illicit/elicit, and a very Eurocentric view of things such as when she was talking about not being able to equate the meaning of a smile in chimps with what it means in humans - well, what does it mean in humans? Very different things in different parts of the world. In some places a smile is an insult, and in others a sign of severe social embarrassment or unease (usually accompanied by a giggle).

It manages to cover all the bases of a good animal book, being funny, filled with interesting facts and informative about conservation. Along the way I learnt that we still don't really know exactly where eels gonads are, the (slightly eye-watering) tale of the hyena's pseudo-penis (which was already as staple fact of mine, but it turned out to be even more odd than I had imagined) and that panda's aren't quite the bumbling, sex shy voluntary vegetarians that we often think they are.

Because her book does bear the faintest echo of that particular style of presentation. Thankfully it was faint enough that it did not detract from my enjoyment of the rest of the book. This is not my field of study, so I can't vouch for its scientific value. Was it a little bit sensationalist? Sure. But it's also worth reading for the sheer entertainment value. It's laugh out loud funny at points. It's still a bit western-centric -- though it never got to the Dawkin level of squinting, and there is a degree of sincerity in the author's writing that does help.Mostly though: this is one of the most entertaining zoology books I've ever read."

Originally in the library looking for books on wolves, I decided to give this a go, and was overjoyed when it revealed itself to be an interesting, funny peek into the myths and lives of thirteen very different animals. I enjoyed how humble it was, not overstating anything in its descriptions and humour, while acknowledging that more advancements in our understanding of these creatures was sure to follow.I also respected that she shared when she herself had adverse reactions to the creatures she was studying, but didn’t let any of these feelings get in the way of her understanding them better. It shows a strength of character that makes me respect her all the more, and I look forward to reading more works of hers."

Providing a detailed look at how animals were portrayed throughout history, this book both served as an interesting insight into animals while also looking at how we as a society have viewed them.I first discovered this book when Lucy Cooke did a segment on Radio Lab about eels (which is pulled from this book). She has such a rich personality and tells such incredible anecdotes that I had to read the book.While sometimes, it feels the book is a bit too sex oriented, I suppose it makes sense when you consider that reproduction is a big part of how animals evolve and take on the traits that they have.Lots of fun and interesting stories in this book, I highly recommend it!"

Fascinating and funny.The writing is excellent, easy to read and humorous, but meaty enough for curious minds.The subject matter is terrific. It's not just about strange and surprising aspects of animal life, but also about how they were discovered—or covered up—by scientists and explorers. It is maybe a bit heavy on the sexual habits of animals, when there are many other fascinating aspects of life, but that is the only slight criticism I have with the book. The structure is perfect: different chapters about different animals, each one long enough to go into the fascinating details but not too long to feel dragged out. I will probably read this again, it's that good. And if Lucy Cooke wrote another similar book, I'd read it in a heartbeat. More accurate rating: 5+"

This book is what it claims to be: a bunch of crazy stories about what people, many of them scientists from the Middle Ages, thought they knew about animals and their behaviour. Most of these myths still influence what we believe to be true about the sloth, the penguins and the pandas, to name only a few of them. A biologist myself, I am surprised to see how much I learned from that book, especially about eels and pandas! I may not agree with the opinions of all people Lucy met, but I am please to read about so many entusiastic people working to conserve animals all over the world. Last but not least, the book is hilarious. A good bedside read!"

The author narrated it, which I usually like, but she has a somewhat grating, shrill voice that accents sentences in odd places. I ended up just reading this one in the end vs listening to it on audiobook.For CONTENT, the book was a hoot! Loved it -- there were great anecdotes about bats, chimpanzees, ""drunken moose"", hippos, all kinds of animal behavior and physiology that I didn't know before. The book also went into the history of animal research from hundreds of years ago. It was interesting to see what people thought even 60 or 70 years ago about some of our animal physiology and behavior.Great book if you like animal sciences and just plain interesting stories about animals. Just maybe skip the audiobook."

As an aspiring animal behavior analyst, this was a fantastic and truly fascinating read. I loved the background in animal myths provided and the research done to debunk them. It has really peaked my interest in looking into more of those myths for my future research. It has also expanded my knowledge of different species that I may like to work with in the future.

168,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/868033-nate,3,"Cooke's book, the Truth About Animals, is a cursory dive into the absurdist history of human interaction with the natural world. Cooke takes 13 different animals who have been misrepresented over the years and goes into the history of how they were described by early naturalists and early fiction writers, and then discusses their more unique characteristics and traits. It's a fascinating journey into the lives of Eel, beaver, sloths, hyena, vultures, bats, frogs, storks, the hippopotamus, the moose, the panda, the penguin, and chimpanzee. I think the most interesting thing I learned was how a certain species of frog was used to successfully test conduct pregnancy tests, prior to the modern versions."

Providing a combination of the history of the natural history of various animals alongside details of their habits and quirks. Here we learn of the ways that people have thought about animals through the ages especially their misconceptions so that you get an idea of how dynamic science is and that we are discovering more all the time. The book is written with a humorous style and you can feel the love for animals that the author has, I admire the way the author uses good scientific facts and relates them in an extremely accessible way. I would encourage Lucy Cooke to write more as I have learnt so much and enjoyed doing so too. #TheTruthAboutAnimals #NetGalley"

We need not be afraid of these behaviours - they are not here to instruct us. Whether a penguin is gay, straight, or having sex with a frozen head has no bearing on our own sexuality. Despite what we may think, we are not the centre of the animal universe.” An absolutely enthralling read! I loved every page. It has filled me with the brim to facts about animals I could have never imagined, and has broken stigma, stereotypes, and myths within my mind that I was not aware I was holding.

Apart from those animals mentioned above, she also spends a chapter each on eels, sloths, hyenas, frogs, vultures, storks, beavers, and my favorite--penguins.

I will say that the author does seem to have a fascinating with male anatomy and the long explanations about the length and size of said anatomy did plod in times.

But I got this book for Christmas, and after debating whether or not it would be worth my time, I decided to read it. Glad I did. It is well written, and I must admit I learned a thing or two. Linnaeus' thoughts on eels were particularly interesting. She managed to devote a chapter to my favorite animal, the spotted hyena, so she gets brownie points for that too.

That hyena females had a pseudo-penis that makes them externally almost indistinguishable from males? That some migratory birds have stopped migrating due to climate change or depopulation or both?

179,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4236601-popup-ch,4,"A lighthearted, but seriously researched book about odd animal characteristics, and especially about human misconceptions bout them. The main bug-bear is Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, who had singularly odd ideas about most animals, and a platform to broadcast them to the entire scientific establishment. The writing style is very playful, with a language littered with alliterations. The audiobook is narrated by the author, and she occasionally gets over-excited, but it's still an impressive performance. She did once participate in 'no such thing as a fish', and this book is written in much the same vein."

Well now I want to look that up to see what kind of math makes you want to fight! Each of the 12 chapters discuss the myths and discoveries regarding one animal. That was all well and good regarding the panda bear, but the gory details about eels went on forever it seemed to me.

Unfortunately, it takes some determination to get to those. The early portions of the book seem like endless lists of all the incorrect ""scientists"" that have come before Cooke. While some of the are interesting simply because of how outlandish they are and some explain popular myths and even fairytales, the majority almost seem like Cooke is aiming to point out her and her fellow current naturalists' superiority over those who came before.

She looks at several strange ancient beliefs, misunderstandings, and odd attributions peoples had about these animals through the ages, how then tells how those erroneous beliefs were discarded as further tests and experiments revealed new information.

For someone who uses their sources so consistently across so many of her chapters, it's striking and a little grating that she lampoons them so many times, and in such similar ways. After a while Cooke's frequent complaints really start to grate, and one wonders if she could read them *in historical context* before deriding them so simplistically. Such contempt wears down an otherwise delightful book that taught me many new things about different animals from around the world. "

Cooke identifies anthropomorphism and arrogance as the two main reasons why we misunderstand animals and are in danger of wiping out so much precious biodiversity.

It's the first book where I had to open my dictionary more than thrice. The reason why I'm saying this is I have a fairly good vocabulary and a respectable grasp on English (being into a similar kind of job).

Some of the sections are either the source for the Radiolab episodes or inspired them - which came first, the penguin or the egg?

If the man wrote anything about an animal, you can be sure that, not only was it false, but it would strain the imagination of those who live outside of reality.

There were a plethora of anecdotes surrounding many of the people who have studied Nature & Animals over the centuries.Nevertheless, an entertaining and enjoyable read. The author's voice comes through as if the book is a direct transcript of her recounting these tales to a friend."
208,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1945096-katie,4,"Hilarious. My favorite tidbit - I was unaware that the religious right assumed the penguin as their mascot after the movie March of the Penguins was released, due to the narrative of penguins valuing monogamy and family values. Little did they know, penguins have been known to be gay, to barter for sex (engage in prostitution), and have sex with the frozen remains of other dead penguins. WHOOPS. "
209,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24088797-kiirstin,4,"Hilarious and unsettling. Cooke writes well and has a great, if sometimes dark, sense of humour. She also points out how wrong, for how long, we have been about certain animals. The consequence of our species' hubris is not always spelled out but it doesn't really need to be; it's never good. An excellent, entertaining mythbusting book with fascinating facts that points towards reconsidering our relationship with the entire natural world."

And it’s so fascinating how many times scientists have made incorrect assumptions about animals over the course of our history, assigning human characteristics and motivations...and interesting how some of those notions linger even today (like that wildebeests are evil and bats a bad omen, etc) I loved it, totally entertaining and well written (aka not boring!)

Really fun examples of how so-called scientists have repeatedly failed to understand animals. I really enjoyed it. I only wish the book had done more than merely nod at Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, which I feel is a more serious and impactful work on the nature of how deeply we misunderstand other species.
