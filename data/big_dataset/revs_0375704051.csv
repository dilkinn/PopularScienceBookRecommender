0,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,5,"The crux of the book is the work Sacks began in the mid-1960s with dozens of post-encephalitic patients at Bronx's Beth Abraham hospital, then called the Bronx Home for Incurables and disguised here as Mount Carmel. These patients were infected in 1918 by the encephalitis lethargica virus, or sleepy sickness. (Not to be confused with the worldwide influenza pandemic of that same year.) Those who survived were able afterwards to lead normal lives for years and sometimes decades until they were stricken with Parkinson's disease-like symptoms: locked and rigid postures that turned them into living statuary (akinesia), hurrying gait (festination), frozen skewed gaze (oculogyyric crises), and so on. These patients did not have Parkinson's disease proper, but because the encephalitis reduced the neurotransmitter dopamine in the part of their brain known as the substantia nigra they experienced identical, if somewhat more severe symptoms than actual Parkinson's patients. They were to become know as post-encephalitics.In 1969 L-DOPA's cost came down sufficiently that Dr. Sacks began to prescribe it for his post-encephalitic patients. The results were at once miraculous and disastrous. In a matter of weeks, sometimes overnight, Sacks's patients were ""awakened"" from what for many had been decades of immobility, incommunicability, and dependence on high levels of nursing care. Suddenly these frozen figures were walking and talking, their personalities, in hiatus for so long, perfectly preserved. Dr. Sacks reviews the cases here of 20 such patients, from their often sudden awakening to the onset and growing severity of side effects. Awakenings is in the final analysis a tragedy. Few of Sacks patients could tolerate the long term effects of L-DOPA. Not a few regretted ever being treated with it. For a handful it provided a vastly improved quality of life. They became social again, needed far less nursing care, but the effects of the drug were highly unstable. In an appendix added to the 1990 edition, Sacks and a colleague analyze patient responses to L-DOPA using the then emerging discipline of chaos theory. This appears only in the 1990 edition since the discipline did not exist when Sacks and his patients began their trials of the levodopa in '69. Dr. Sacks never met a footnote he didn't love. The book is chockful of them. Those too long to fit alongside the text are included as appendices. Ninety-five percent of them seem to me indispensable. Sacks is a great thinker of immense erudition who possesses a highly readable prose style. The primary text provides straightforward exposition, but when read in conjunction with the footnotes--where much of the real meat of the book resides--it can at times take on an almost fiction-like discursiveness.Of Sacks's dozen or so books, I've read all but three. Awakenings is his magnum opus, his manifesto and policy declaration. In it he lays out his positions on the then current neurology of the day (Awakenings was first published in 1973) which he lambastes as coldly empirical and lacking a complementary metaphysical component. In America, and no doubt much of the West, these were the last years of the Physician as God. There was little public knowledge of medicine then, unlike today, and the doctor's role in a crisis was usually unquestioned. Today second opinions are sought with regularity, ""integrative"" approaches to healing more readily embraced, and there is a vast industry based on purveying medical knowledge to the general public. You can see this great change perhaps best in the way pharmaceutical companies now advertise directly to the public in a way they never did during the Awakenings period. Sacks is here an articulate proponent for a more human, less coldly analytical medicine, and his endorsement for such an approach, which includes close interpersonal relationships with patients, is a clarion call. Fascinating, meticulous, and highly recommended.One appendix is devoted to the many dramatizations of Awakenings on stage and screen. There's Harold Pinter's one-act play A Kind of Alaska, an original documentary film, and the feature film, which retained Sacks as a consultant. I found his descriptions here of DeNiro preparing for his role as Leonard L. fascinating."
1,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1122708-megan,5,"Reading this makes me wish all doctors approached medical practice the way Dr. Sacks does. His clinical grasp of neurology is impressive, but his humanity, compassion, and philosophical approach lend him a more effective manner than other clinicians. His ability to present the conditions of his patients and their treatment as more than either/or, as more than a list of data points, is what makes this book a classic. A basic familiarity with neurology makes this an easier read; he uses a lot of medical terms to describe symptoms and treatments. However, he goes beyond symptoms to see how the patients in his care interact with their disease, treatment, and environment as unique individuals. Science in general and medicine in particular have been on a decades-long reductionist trend - as though all conditions can be boiled down to the one gene, the one protein, the one chemical that will take care of it all. In reality, life is too complex for that to work most of the time. Dr. Sack's ability to approach patients as whole, unique beings full of life is the key to his popularity as a physician and writer."

3,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3724993-ashley,3,"Eh, this book was somewhat of a let down I thought. There is a marvelous story here, but this book couldn't decide if it wanted to be a clinical write up of these patients, or appeal to the masses. It tried to walk the line between the two and failed. Just as I would get into the story about a patient, a bunch of medical terms about their condition would pop up, I'd have NO clue what they meant, and the enchantment would end. Three stars for the effort, and because the substance is pretty amazing. "
4,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,4,"The story is thrilling: the sleepy sickness epidemic that followed WWI left many people with profound Parkinsonian symptoms; some were hardly able to move, never spoke, seemed frozen in time for forty years. A large number of these patients were under Sacks' care at Mount Carmel hopital in New York in 1969 when he decided to try giving them the new drug L-DOPA, and witnessed many of them coming suddenly, vividly to life. But this blurb summary is a gross simplification! Sacks is at pains even in the introductions to point out that L-DOPA is extremely unpredictable, producing different effects even in the same patient, and always leads to some 'tribulations'. Also, the case studies that form the dramatic heart of the book were less fascinating to me than Sacks' writing around them. In a way, the case studies are richly personal: Sacks insists again and again on treating patients as people, that 'nothing can be reduced to anything' and that 'if we do not listen to our patients we will never learn anything'. However, the clinical detail is extensive and given in terminology that takes time to get used to. When Sacks reflects on their implications, in contrast, he writes in expansive, lucid prose, linking the mysteries of Parkinsonism to quantum mechanics and to lyrical, existential poetry.This is a wonderful book for writers, because, as often in Sacks' work, it goes to the heart of what forms character, identity, personality. When he asserts that 'style is the deepest thing in one's being', I am struck by the resonance with some of the most thought-provoking philosophy and criticism I have read. The succinct expression here is powerful, and it is fleshed out by meditations on the notion of health as musicality and free flow, of being as moving, which the 'phantasmagoria' of Parkinsonism most graphically disrupts and distorts.A section on stage and screen interpretations of the original work is included. Sacks, initially concerned that any adaptation would be 'unreal' was delighted by Pinter's response A Kind of Alaska: ""I felt Pinter had given me as much as I gave him: I had given him a reality - and he had given me one back.""Ultimately, Sacks eloquently calls for an existential medicine. Over and over he emphasises how deeply affected patients are by their effective imprisonment in a 'Total Institution' and describes how they respond to music, visitors, trips out, as well as to the physical and care environment, in extraordinary and radical ways. Awakenings allows us to glimpse deep truths about health and disease, and their integrity with personhood, that should transform the ways we think about them."
5,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17496868-joanne-annabannabobanna,5,"Simply astonishing. My first experience with Oliver Sachs, long before any movie. Stumbled across it while browsing a tiny one room library located in the charming community of Vankleek Hill, Ontario where I lived at the time, and immediately became absorbed by the history of the so-called Spanish flu, its effects and the incredible results produced by Sachs' medical intervention. Not least affecting was the eloquence with which Sachs wrote about the patients in his care, provoking intense feelings of empathy and compassion for the patients. Everyone should read this in order to experience the same profound awakening I have, I thought at the time. Then came the movie. As much as I respect Penny Marshall's directing abilities and enjoy some of Robin Williams' work, the movie has to be one of the biggest disappointments of all time, in my book."
6,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17463213-j-m-hushour,5,"This is a fascinating and often very moving account of Sacks' famous experiments using a new-at-the-time dopamine medication to treat the ""sleeping"" victims of the encephalitis lethargica outbreak in the early 20th century. Excoriated at the time for cautioning on L-DOPA's ""miraculous"" nature, Sacks takes the reader on a case-by-case study detailing the medicine's effects on patients who had been virtually catatonic/comatose for decades. These case studies are startling, weird, disturbing, and in the end frustrating. Most of the patients had horrible side effects after their brief ""awakenings"", and only a few persisted on L-DOPA with varying degrees of success. Some of Sacks' observations and findings will startle even now in our more ""caring"" age: Parkinsonian effects can be countered by less clinical care and environments; surrounding the supposedly catatonic with what they love (including and probably most especially family) can have as much of an effect as medication.Perhaps the big takeaway here from Sacks' post-case study chapters is on how little we still understand about how the individual brain actually works and how treating things as pathologies might be less valuable than understanding the person undergoing them."
7,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2392570-kati,2,"I‚Äôm going to try to limit my rating to the quality of the book itself and not the events it portrays. I‚Äôm afraid under that criteria I can‚Äôt rate Awakenings any better than a ‚Äò2‚Äô for the majority of it, although the portions added in 1982 and 1990 are better written than the original material from 1972. This book has an unfortunate quality of being neither here nor there. Much of the book is filled with highly technical terms and seems that it was not really written with the layman in mind, and yet often Sacks starts waxing philosophical in a way not suitable for a strictly medical case study. He also does a poor job of expressing why he continued trying L-DOPA on new patients despite the large number of often spectacular, sometimes perhaps fatal, failures in this population ‚Äî failures that happened quite quickly. (Most ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô lasted only a few days to a few weeks in the luckiest cases and then started to collapse into intolerable agitative symptoms.) His descriptions to me read as though most of the patients ended up worse off after L-DOPA than they were before, a rather impressive feat given how badly off they were to start. The 1982 epilogue suggests there were therapeutic benefits that weren't well described compared to the negative effects, and patients who did better but were not spectacular enough to include in the 20 presented case studies, but some of the included cases still seem grossly irresponsible to me as a reader. The writing also seems as though Sacks at this time fundamentally lacked an of understanding of how other people worked. This is not as strange as it seems at first glance, since Sacks is not a psychologist. He‚Äôs a neurologist who has struggled with near-paralyzing shyness. In the additions written in 1982 and 1990 he seems to have outgrown some of that psychological ignorance, but unfortunately the 1972 portion where it is present is the meat of the book. I would also be remiss if I did not mention that the book contains 173 footnotes, many of them essay length. In my opinion, this is just bad writing technique. The material should have either been incorporated into the body of the work, or omitted entirely."
8,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,4,"This was the first of Sacks's books I read, and I had never read anything like it. The discovery that a chemical could bring 'frozen' people to consciousness again after an apparent sleep of years, was mind blowing to read about - and literally mind blowing for some of those who emerged for a time from the effects of their meningitis and then sank out of consciousness again. Sacks recorded the process as a scientist, and a man who is deeply concerned about the human condition and for his patients as people.It's a long book, but this is necessary to tell the stories of the group who trialled l.Dopa with the insight and compassion Sacks gives them.For me, the film came nowhere near the real meaning of the book, because it only told the story of a very few patients and focused on one. This made for human drama, but lost the scale of the double tragedy."
9,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,4,"I am struggling to find words to describe my feelings of amazement at the case histories set out in this book, and my wonderment at what a strange place the mind can be. For anyone unaware of the background, in the sixties Dr. Sacks worked with survivors of an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica that began in Central Europe in 1916 and lasted for about 10 years, affecting an estimated 5 million people worldwide. In the severest cases, such as Dr. Sacks‚Äô patients, survivors were left in a near catatonic state, behaving with near total apathy and indifference to the world around them. By the 1960s it had been established that the victims of post-encephalitic conditions were lacking the neurotransmitter dopamine, and the drug L-Dopa was developed in an attempt to compensate. Initially the results were startling, with patients who had been profoundly ill for decades suddenly ‚Äúawakening‚Äù, sometimes within hours of receiving L-Dopa. Unfortunately, within a few weeks a large majority of the patients began to manifest new illnesses, the variety and complexity of which are too great for this review. Overall, L-Dopa‚Äôs effect on patients ranged from the beneficial to the catastrophic. The story is told through 20 individual case histories presented by the author, followed by a variety of reflections, postscripts and appendices, where Dr Sacks makes the case against a ‚Äúmechanistic‚Äù approach to medicine, and the tendency to treat patients as replicas of each other (the book was written in 1972, so this argument was probably more radical then than it sounds now). Dr. Sacks is eloquent in drawing conclusions, but at times I found his detailed arguments quite dense, and his writing style a bit too florid for my taste. It‚Äôs for this reason that I haven‚Äôt given the book a 5-star rating. It deserves that in every other aspect.In 1990 the book was made into a film starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. The last of the appendices provides a fascinating account of the making of the film. I haven‚Äôt seen it, but will look out for it now."
10,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/645003-pj-who-once-was-peejay,5,"This is a true story about people who became prisoners of their own brains, their own brain chemistry. Just after World War I an epidemic of sleeping sickness froze these patients in a trance-like state. Long thought to be untreatable, they were suddenly brought back to life in 1969 when Dr. Oliver Sacks gave them the drug L-DOPA. They woke to a world that had changed utterly in the intervening years. Some of them were able to adjust, some could not deal with the changes in the world and in themselves and lapsed back into their frozen state.But this isn't just a sad story. There's also something numinous about this book. It's far more profound and amazing than the movie that it's based upon it. That was a good movie, but the Robert DeNiro character--as is a necessity when condensing a book for film--is really a composite of many people. What makes the book so much deeper and richer are the many stories of the patients Oliver Sacks deals with, how their spirits soared, or didn't, what it means to be a human being. Their struggles to come out of the horrific consequences of their disease into a new life are a testament to the human spirit, both positive and negative. Sacks' writing is as profound as the story he tells."

I‚Äôve noticed there are a lot of books out now about disease. Its like the new fad. I have a condition called papilledma. Its not deadly, which I am blessed by GOD for that. I don‚Äôt like reading about people suffering because I know how it feels. I have watched enough people be sick and I don‚Äôt want to read about it. That‚Äôs my personal choice. But this book was very insightful.I am very blessed to have a husband that God blessed me with to support me. I love you JacobMy Review:Awakenings is a very moving tale. It is Sacks‚Äôs opus about the encephalitis lethargica virus. Very dramatic and full of heart, we suffer with Sacks as he suffers with his patients as they experience an awakening from their catatonic trances after he gives them L-DOPA. We then watch the journey for those who can adjust and those who cannot. A very touching book of not just medicine and science, but of hope and compassion. "
12,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"This is the astonishing true story of a group of people aflicted with a severe 'sleeping' sickness who were awakened for a while by a drug called L Dopa. It is full of personal moments of extreem grief and happiness and wonder. It is a story of clinical experimentation and individual care and understanding.A very good film of it has also been made with Robin Williams as Oliver Sacks. I think, as usual, the book is better than the film, but the film gives a good feel for the story line if not actually much of the detail."
13,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957217-laurel,5,"A couple quotes that deeply resonated with me:""Some of these patients had achieved a state of icy hopelessness akin to serenity: a realistic hopelessness, in those pre-dopa days: they knew they were doomed, and they accepted this with all the courage and equanimity they could muster. Other patients (and, perhaps, to some extent, all of these patients, whatever their surface serenity) had a fierce and impotent sense of outrage: they had been swindled out of the best years of life; they were consumed by the sense of time lost, time wasted; and they yearned incessantly for a twofold miracle ‚Äì not only a cure for their sickness, but an indemnification for the loss of their lives. They wanted to be given back the time they had lost, to be magically replaced in their youth and their prime.""""The terrors of suffering, sickness and death, of losing ourselves and losing the world, are the most elemental and intense we know; and so too are our dreams of recovery and rebirth, of being wonderfully restored to ourselves and the world.‚Äù"
14,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29272226-jean-cole,3,"After the flu epidemic of the 1920s there was another epidemic which I was not aware of. It was called ""sleeping sickness"", technical term ""encephalitis lethargica"". Literally millions of people fell to this disease, whose main symptoms are absolute loss of motion and speech. This condition is related in some way to Parkinson's Disease. A good number of these people were hospitalized in Mount Carmel hospital in New York for decades with no change in their condition. Then in the 1960s Dr. Oliver Sacks began treating these patients with a drug known as L-DOPA.This book contains information about the disease itself and case histories collected by Dr. Sacks. Sadly, the typical arc for these poor people was abrupt return to motion and speech, followed by such extreme levels of action that the doctors were compelled to withdraw the L-DOPA. There were just a handful of patients who were able to resume a ""normal"" life among the hundreds treated by Dr. Sacks.This is a highly technical book and the case histories became somewhat repetitive for me, so I was glad I decided to read the after-matter, including a section called Perspectives. Here Dr. Sacks stresses the tendency of the medical community to treat the disease, not the person. His point being that even after having been literally immobile for decades, these patients were, for the most part, filled with joy and gratitude for even the briefest return to participating in their world. He laments the concentration on treating the symptoms versus the treatment of the human being who is suffering these symptoms.Those with an interest in medicine or the treatment of Parkinson's disease will find this interesting, but it's not an easy read by any means."
15,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"Oliver Sacks M.D. was an eminent neurologist. He died in his home in New York City at age 82 in August 2015. Dr. Sacks has written many books but is most famous for his book ‚ÄúAwakenings.‚Äù On hearing of his death, I decided to read his book again.In 1966 while working as a neurologist for Mount Carmel Hospital in the Bronx he noted many patients had spent decades in a strange frozen state with some symptoms of Parkinson‚Äôs disease. They were the survivors of the 1916-1917 encephalitis (Sleeping Sickness) epidemic that swept the world during World War I. I studied about this epidemic in school but remember seeing patient in this frozen state from the brief epidemic that hit the central states and prairie provinces of Canada in the early 1950s. Sacks treated these patients with an experimental drug called L-dopa, which enabled many of the patients to recover. The book is a collection of stories about the recovery of some of the patients. The book is written using medical terminology so non scientific reads may have a problem with frequent trips to the dictionary.A play by Harold Pinter was successful and a 1990 film starring Robert De Niro and Robin Williams was on the Oscar list. I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. Jonathan Davis did a good job narrating the book."

Published in 1973, Sacks was still very much writing as a professional neurologist and had not yet fully found his authorial voice. While still an interesting and thought-provoking tale, this book has much more the dryness, and critical apparati, of the academy. "
17,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11926763-cain-s,5,"Movement and Sleep in Parkinsonians  The idea that our bodies and minds are totally separate in their functioning and existence is a rather simplistic and erroneous view. The two are connected in several uncanny ways and influence the functioning of each other very profoundly. The object of this paper‚Äôs study is the book Awakenings by Oliver Sacks. We will concern ourselves with the way the biological and psychological processes of movement which correlate with Parkinson‚Äôs general symptoms. Our particular focus will be on the issues pertaining to Encephalitis Lethargica (sleep pattern disturbances) and the Parkinsonian (motion and rigidity) connection as it relates directly to the work of Sack‚Äôs book on Parkinsonian symptomatology in connection with Encephalitis Lethargica patients. When Encephalitis Lethargica first made its appearance in 1916-1917 it was not recognized as such because the symptoms were so very different in type and degree that it was not possible to generalize them as belonging to one condition; in fact, it seemed like several new diseases had come about at one time (Sacks, p. 12, 1991). Although there were smaller sporadic bursts of this sickness prior to 1916, there was never so much wide spread incidence and deaths of one third of patients suffering from sleeping sickness related complications (Sacks, 1991). The patients typically suffered by way of becoming fixed in a listless awareness, though they were conscious they could not act based on this consciousness, and were made statuesque (Sacks, p. 14, 1991). This immobility was caused by a negative influence which created an absolute resistance to the will of the patient, it was found that in phases Encephalitic patients could speak in a circular and restricted way; alongside this phase, involuntary movements of a variety of kinds were also observed (Sacks, p. 16, 1991). That the condition of Post-Encephalitic patients was not entirely physiological was established by the invariance of symptoms across cases with and without lesions on certain areas of the brain, and it was understood that there were other reasons which played part too (Sacks, 1991). Sacks also focuses on the environment of the hospital (Mount Carmel‚Äôs) as being of importance in the way it enhances or deteriorates the patient‚Äôs reactions to treatment procedures; often ‚Äú‚Ä¶giving them a sense of being people, and not condemned prisoners in a vast institution‚Ä¶‚Äù could play a part in improving the patient‚Äôs overall health (Sacks, p. 26, 1991). Mazurkiewicz‚Äôs theory of psychophysiology holds that feelings are independent of thought processes and that they help interpret the way in which a person responds to objective impressions created by his interaction with stimulus (Kokoszka, 2007). In Kokoszka‚Äôs account of Mazurkiewicz‚Äôs ‚Äúscale of dissolution‚Äù the symptomatology associated with illness in general marks a patient‚Äôs regressive and inadvertent behavior as ‚Äòa shallow neurotic dissolution which does not disturb deeper levels of personality‚Ä¶‚Äù but this does erode the loss of control on actions such that excessive excitement cannot be suppressed and actions are made inconsistent (Kokoszka, p. 17, 2007). This is peculiarly interesting because patients of Post Encephalitic Parkinson in Sack‚Äôs book represent a wide spectrum of inadvertent and uncontrolled action, with a low ability of control while maintaining whole personalities. Our first case for analysis, related to movement, is that of Leonard L[1]., in Awakenings, who had lost all mobility due to his Parkinson‚Äôs condition, and could make very limited movement with one hand making him dependent on his mother for all basic things (Sacks, p. 203, 1991). He had the facility to spell out small messages using which he could communicate with others, but for his handicap he was profoundly intelligent and quick witted (Sacks, 1991). Sack‚Äôs understanding of the nature of restriction of movement that comes from Parkinson‚Äôs comes from Leonard‚Äôs ability at describing these in forceful and vivid metaphors; at one time he said it was like ‚Äúthe goad and the halter‚Äù which impelled him to action and then stopped him back (Sacks, p. 204, 1991). The main merit of the theory of psychophysiology as developed by Mazurkiewicz is that it can account for the overall sphere of human activity to be contained within the neurological and psychical thus allowing psychiatric practitioners to take active part in the rehabilitation of physiologically challenged patients (Kokoszka, 2007). Sack‚Äôs would agree that that humane treatment encompasses the catering to natural instincts of patients as human beings, and that within the organization of hospitals this should be a point of orientation while determining policies[2]. The distinction between ballistic and corrected feedback of movements by muscles is a vital capability which allows convenient motions through acts which require more or less accuracy and skill according to feed back from the senses (Kalat, p. 231, 2009). The motor programs which facilitate fixed movements and actions such that they can be done without thought (Kalat, 2009), but for a patient with Parkinson‚Äôs like Leonard L. this is not the case and being 30 years of age he was still infantilized and depended on his mother to change or bathe him (Sacks, 1991). But after his initial awakening on L-Dopa when he was able to move freely and express his inner life, he suddenly relapsed into over activity in the sense of losing control over corrected feedback movements (Sacks, 1991). This was also the time when his feelings of relief and happiness had reached a pathological pitch; he was grandiose and over-excitable without control and curb on his feelings (Sacks, p. 210, 1991). Thus, the connection between mind states and motor activity seem to be interacting at the sites in the brain where ballistic and corrected movements are coordinated with sensory stimulus. Parkinson‚Äôs disease is a disease of the basal ganglia, more specifically the region called corpus ‚Äú‚Ä¶striatum‚Äù which ‚Äúreceives excitatory input from several areas of the cerebral cortex as well as inhibitory and excitatory input from the dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)‚Äù (Hauser, 2011). The deficiency of dopamine is one of the reasons of this disease (Hauser, 2011), however it cannot account for all the symptoms created in terms of cognitive functioning by the Parkinson disease (Forgacs & Bodis-Wollner, 2004). Troster et al were able to establish that depression induced impairment of the brain organs connected with conceptualization and visuo-constructive tasks, thus showing the depression increased cognitive damage in Parkinson patients (Troster et al, 1995). Leonard‚Äôs condition too distorted his sense of space and location, perhaps because of the depressive/ repressive atmosphere of the hospital which could not accommodate his sexual frustrations, and he took on tics, palilalia and other involuntary motions with a sexual nature (Sacks, 1991). Sack‚Äôs recounts how his indiscriminating, indeed helpless sexual behavior caused him to be put into a punishment cell and deprived of company (Sacks, p. 216, 1991); thus given the situations which are to be maintained in the organization of a hospital make it difficult if not impossible to accommodate the human element of the patients. Lundkvist, Kristensson and Bentivoglio ( 2004) suggest that sleeping sickness is caused by a causative agent, a parasite called Trypanosoma brucei which affect the circumventrical brain organs leading to inflammation of hypothalamic structures, these areas of the brain affect the circadian rhythms which regulate sleep patterns in human beings (Lundkvist et al., 2004). Thus we see that a physiological agent introduces lesions in the brain which goes on to constitute the physical symptomatology of Encephalitic patients. The interaction between circadian rhythms and homeostatic processes which regulate sleep patters broadly may be affected by more than mere lesions in the brain as has been seen in research with mice and monkeys who showed that total sleep was unchanged in amount (Lundkvist et al., 2004). A disturbance in sleep and wakefulness patter may be brought about by the action of parasites which weaken the ‚Äúflip-flop‚Äù function of the mutually inhibiting switch between brain mechanisms (Lundkvist et al, 2004). The switch between the homeostatic processes and circadian rhythms is dependent on the secretion of dopamine which mediates between the two interfaces and thus control sleep-patterns (Manglapus et al, 1999; Pozdeyev et al 2008). Thus in animals (quails and mice) it has been established that dopamine based interactions between circadian rhythms can change the sleeping pattern[3], perhaps such treatment for Parkinsonian patients too result in change of patterns of sleep. In any case Post Encephalitic patients in Awakenings have had a history of pathological sleep conditions (Sacks, p. 39, 1991). We will now consider the case of Frances D. because it is associated with our analysis of movement in Parkinson patients in Awakenings[4]. Beginning with insomnia and respiratory crises which were infrequent Frances started experiencing staring attacks and rigidity, or frozenness like she was entranced (Sacks, 1991). Post treatment with L-Dopa Frances experienced along with the stabilization of her motor rigidity some exacerbation of hypersensitivity, insomnia during attacks and an odd combination of opposing desires (sacks, 1991). Insomnia among Parkinson patients may be due to motor disability, depression or pain, additionally levodopa treatment may induce hallucinations (Hauser, 2004). The incidence of hallucinations in Parkinsonian patients generally causes more daytime sleepiness, as the incidence of REM sleep is reported, and hallucinators also reported daytime hallucinations (Arnulf et al, 1999). Frances too suffered from attacks which kept her awake, the intensity of the discomfort in breathing-breath holding which resulted sometimes in the increase of blood pressure to as high as 170/ 100, during treatment by L-dopa (Sacks, p. 47, 1991). Her symptoms however showed great intensification around specific dynamics other than psycho-physiological states, moods and circumstances: this was later confirmed as Dr. Sack‚Äôs presence on the scene which aggravated or brought on the symptoms (Sacks, p. 49, 1991). She also had monstrous dreams, or hallucinations which disturbed her mental state and caused her to sleep less soundly; in due course her occasional rigidity could be managed by the use of music which helped her break free from the trance (sacks, 1991). She kept a diary which was filled with the predicament of being a prisoner in a total institution which felt like being reduced to a child, but on the whole she is fit for a good part of the year and her attacks are less frequent and can be managed (Sacks, p. 64, 1991). Only during attacks her sleep was her sleep disturbed significantly enough for her to be awake at night, and groggy in the day (Sacks, 1991). Her almost normal situation depended on her mental adaptation to the situations he was put into once she was put up into the institution for good. But this adjustment is a matter of temperament, which is not the same with everyone, and because the effects of L-dopa on her were not totally unmanageable within the organizational means of the hospital (Sacks, 1991). Dreams with significant stimulating content and REM states are typical of Parkinson‚Äôs patients, though less frequently found in younger people, and it results in tiredness which needs to be treated (Lee Chiong ed., p. 163). For Frances this treatment worked out fine under the aegis of Dr. Sacks but it could not be the case for all patients in a terminal institution. This may be because of a variety of reasons like the etiology of the particular patient, the response to medication and also to a large extent the environment of such an institution. While it is understandable that Mount Carmel Hospital New York could not accommodate the sexual needs of Leonard L., but the general civility and cordiality accorded to all humans is the prerogative of all patients. Faced with their sickness and slim chances of complete recovery it becomes the foremost ethical concern to remove the unnecessary troubles from their life. Dr. Sacks often speaks in the book about how a little more social experience, excursions into the city for movies and other such experiences helped these patients immensely (1991). I agree that this is a necessary step, as also is the need of complete support from the patient‚Äôs family, without pathological attention between members like in the case of Leonard‚Äôs mother who encouraged his sexual suggestions underhand.

I hadn't planned to use this one- I've actually seen the movie before (albeit some years ago). I was just on a science kick and had read Sacks' Musicophelia and really enjoyed it. But I really wanted to watch the movie again after reading this. I really wish I would have read the book first; usually I don't feel that strongly whether I read the novel or watch the movie first. But I picked up on so many details and so many lines from the movie that I missed the first time around because I'd read Awakenings. For those not familiar with either, Oliver Sacks is a doctor who, in the 1960s, worked with Parkinson's patients as well as patients suffering from post-encephalitic syndrome. From 1917 to the 1920s, there was an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, or ""sleeping sickness."" Those stricken by this generally rare disease would go on to develop Parkinsonian-like symptoms later in life. By the time Sacks saw them, the majority of them were in a frozen state, unable to communicate and generally immobile. Brief moments of a dim ""awakening"" were noted with some stimulus, but these were the smallest flashes of light. Sacks tried what was then an experimental drug L-Dopa, with varying degrees of success. In his book, Sacks chronicles the stories of many of his patients (including a couple of patients outside of Mount Carmel and a couple of patients who had actual Parkinsons). Many of his patients (who were given a pseudonym) were able to write down their feelings when they were locked inside their immobile, unresponsive bodies as well as their feelings as they took L-Dopa and other medications. The book I read is a 1990 update, which included more footnotes than the original (according to Sacks) plus offered an update on the patients and his feelings about the movie. All but one of the patients had died by 1990. The surviving patient, whom he identifies as Lillian T., actually makes a cameo in the movie; I *think* I spotted her but am not sure. First off, about the book itself. I highly recommend it. Sacks' is a wonderful storyteller, and his narrative is generally conversational and easy to follow. He really makes an effort to portray his patients not just as clinical cases, but as real people. My one quibble was the copious amount of footnotes. Now, sometimes they had interesting information, but I felt they could have been worked into the narrative of the main part itself. Much of it just got too distracting. But this is minor. I loved reading his insights about the movie, which he seemed to be a fan of. He had especially high praise for Robert DeNiro, who portrayed Leonard, one of the patients (and there really was a ""Leonard""; DeNiro's character was heavily based on the patient given that pseudonym). DeNiro's acting and portrayal of a post-encephalitic patient fooled Sacks himself, by his own admission. Sacks also marveled at Williams' talent for mimicry, at how well the actor got the mannerisms of the doctor (Williams' character Dr. Sayer is a fictional portrayal of Sacks himself). There are many details, many lines that come straight from the pages of the book and from Sacks' notes. The demand for a steak. The feeling of being caught in a sort of time warp. In one patient's case, the despair of knowing his family had essentially fallen apart. The card game. Catching the ball. Sometimes the family's not-so-positive reactions (captured by Leonard's mother) All of these are details from various cases. Really, I was stunned how true to the book the movie was, and Sacks while acknowledging that some liberties were taken with the facts, stated he was thrilled with how the movie got the feelings, the emotions right.There were, of course, some differences. I can, for the most part, understand why the differences were made for the movie, which I enjoyed even more the second time around. One, as Sacks notes, there was no major ""Awakening"" one night of all the patients. The patients were all given L-Dopa at various time spanning at least a couple of months. However, Sacks said this moment captured the feeling of what it was like to watch a patient who had been unresponsive for decades walk, talk, eat, laugh and interact with the world. One minor detail also is why L-Dopa was started: It was, indeed, very expensive when the drug first came out but by 1969, the price had fallen enough to make a wide testing feasible. Again, minor point and the solidarity of the staff made for a great moment. The only major difference I saw between the book and movie that bothered me a little were the reactions of the patients to L-Dopa, although I will confess I honestly don't know how they could have done this more honestly without making a four-hour movie or making it very confusing for the viewer. In the movie, L-Dopa is shown to wear off in a way (at least that is the impression I got), and all the patients eventually reverted back to their inert state. I was left with the impression the first time around was that L-Dopa was ultimately a failure. What actually happened is a heck of a lot more complicated. The truth is, the response to L-Dopa was all over the map. A couple of the patients responded extremely well to it, and were able to live out more or less normal lives. A few patients responded well at first, then developed other problems but with a dose adjustment managed to strike a medium between being catatonic and flying off the walls, having uncontrollable tics or other complications related to the drug. Some, after a period of ""awakening"" went on to develop complications that, even with adjustments, never entirely went away. These patients tended to develop a sensitivity to L-Dopa. Some developed coping mechanisms, but others were left to struggle with tics, uncontrolled movements, sleeplessness, emotional outbursts and more. And for a couple of patients there was no therapeutic benefit at all; Sacks described one of those cases as ""catastrophic"" and you could tell from his writing he really questioned himself and his tests after this sad case.So I guess my final verdict is this: both the movie and the book are excellent. Do understand the movie, by necessity, does take some liberties with the facts (and it even advertises itself as a fictionalized version of events so there's no intentional ploy at dishonesty here). I do recommend, if possible, that people read the book first because there are so many details in the movie that come from real life.Currently reading: Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley."
19,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9271767-kathryn,3,"Awakenings relates the neurologist Oliver Sacks‚Äô experience in a NYC clinic, where he worked with resident patients who came down with encephalitis lethargica (called ‚Äúsleeping sickness‚Äù) during an epidemic that lasted from 1915-1926 and killed millions in Europe and the US. Forty years later, survivors imprisoned in Parkinson‚Äôs-like immobility and stupor are offered the experimental drug L-DOPA. Following decades-long slumbers, the patients come back to life and out of their frozen states, awakening to a world scarcely known to them.Sacks is devoted to his patients as fellow human beings, as friends and neighbors, poignantly attesting to their humanity and ‚Äústruggle to maintain identity‚Äù while in the throes of illness. The patients aren‚Äôt butterflies pinned under glass or mice in a cage; they are always painfully human, with disappointments, appetites, and joys, longing and deserving to be made whole and brought out of their imposed isolation. They were wonderfully, terribly real. Profuse literary references ranging from Donne to Joyce on the nature of disease place the stories in a universal context of loss and bafflement.I had flattered myself by thinking that I had more than a passing interest in neurology, but this difficult book challenged that. While the case studies presented here were brilliant, the ensuing discussion‚Äîwith page after page on chaos theory, metaphysics, and ontology, not to mention lay terms like ‚Äúmacro-quantal‚Äù and ‚Äúphase-space‚Äù‚Äîcompletely overtaxed my brain cells. We went from neurology to neuralgia in no time flat.Which is a pity, because the remarkable lives portrayed here moved me a great deal. The mistake I made was boring through all of the accompanying material. Encasing the core story of the patients are two prefaces, a foreword, a prologue, a four-part reflective section, an epilogue, a postscript, seven lengthy appendices, and a glossary, not to mention copious footnotes. I daftly assumed I was smart enough to keep up with it all. The appendices were completely over my head, and I heaved an enormous sigh of relief upon finishing. There is no way this book was written with the general public in mind.My recommendation is to read everything from the prologue to the end of the case studies section, and then read the last appendix about the various derivative works. Then watch the 1990 film and related clips on YouTube. (Or watch the movie first and pick up the book if you feel compelled to know more.) These are enriching and will surely make your eyes mist and heart warm greatly. The rest of the book is sure to make most non-scientists‚Äô heads cloud over, detracting from this masterpiece."
20,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16572738-rose,2,"I was excited when my book group selected this book, as I remembered loving the feature film it inspired. However, my enthusiasm was quickly dampened within the first several pages -- not because of the content, but because of the writing style I encountered. The text is so full of medical jargon and clinical explanations (including footnoted expansions of the text which often take up close to or more than half of the printed page) that reading it was WORK, not pleasure. After the introductory material and the first 8 of the patient case histories, I moved on to the supplemental material about how director Penny Marshall and actors Robin Williams and Robert De Niro prepared for the feature film. That part, at least, was readable -- and quite enjoyable, especially as I had just re-watched the movie the night before.It's evident to me that Dr. Sacks had a far different audience in mind as he was writing this book than the general reading public. If he intended this book to be read by a wider audience than those in the medical sciences, he either missed the mark or was grossly misled by his editor in thinking he had reached it. I found the subject matter fascinating, but obscured by the language he used to report his experiments with using L-Dopa as treatment for post-encephalitis lethargica patients. The book reads like a clinical journal, not a story. And while the book is titled ""Awakenings,"" neither the patients nor Dr. Sacks himself comes to life on the page. Although the movie is not an exactly accurate portrayal of this amazing event in the history of treating Parkinsonian-like symptoms and victims who had been catatonic for 30 years of more, it is a more human, enlightening treatment of Dr. Sacks's work with these people. I'd suggest seeing the movie first, then reaching for the book as additional reference material if you want to try to learn more about the experiment or the encephalitis-lethargica pandemic of the 1920s. I had such high hopes for this book. Sadly, they were dashed. Perhaps another writer somewhere can turn this report into a narrative which more of us can appreciate, because the story of what happened is certainly worth telling -- and reading about."
21,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70211-claudia,4,"Sacks must be brilliant...allusions from science (of course), but also art, literature, philosophy...he connects them all.Summer of '69 was a busy one: Woodstock, Apollo 11 to the moon, and L-dopa tried on Parkinson's patients in a small eastern hospital. Patients whose Parkinsons was brought on by flu epidemics in the 20's and 30's, and who had lived as prisoners of their bodies since then.He tells the story of each patient...his or her past, and the course on L-dopa...in the epilogue he continues the stories with the sad deaths of many of them.He tells the story of AWAKENINGS on stage and film, and what each presentation brought to his understanding.I listened to these stories, knowing the wonderful awakenings would all end badly...I wanted Sacks to stop...But as the story continued, he convinced me that even if the awakenings were temporary, they brought new richness to the lives of his patients."
22,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209866-kenneth-rathburn,5,"Oliver Sacks' book about a group of mental patients who undergo an experiment goes through a wide variety of emotions, all of which contribute feeling and power to one of the greatest stories I've ever had the pleasure of reading. What we're provided is a tale that begins with mild interest, shortly becomes heart-warming and, before long, entrancing before the last chapters conclude a read that's just too great to spoil. This is one of those few books that honestly made me look at life and the privileges those of us ""normal"" people have with gratitude but also disdain. It's a strong emotion, but tough to explain without giving the details and overall plot away. The awakened patients in this book become vivid in a wide spectrum during the middle act and make the experience of reading all the more enthralling. To put it simply: easily one of the best books I've read."
23,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10922889-donna,1,"I really wanted to like this book, but I found it to be overly technical, the writing style to be kind of grandiose, and the story of what appeared to be experimentation on patients that would not fly today pretty horrifying. There were few success stories here."
24,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4463803-aaron-wolfson,5,"(This analysis also appears on my blog, Profound Reading.)What most struck me about reading Awakenings was how little I knew about Parkinsonism. I thought it was just a shaking disease, a ‚Äúfact‚Äù I ‚Äúlearned‚Äù from the two most famous people with Parkinson‚Äôs, Muhammad Ali and Michael J. Fox.In truth Parkinson‚Äôs is so much more; it‚Äôs probably among the most variable, elusive disorders known to man. Common symptoms include rigidity, catatonia, masking (expressionless face, voice, or posture), blocking, sleep disorders, and much more. Clinically called akinesia, but more expressively described by Sacks:There are many different forms of akinesia, but the form which is exactly antithetical to hurry or pulsion is one of active retardation or resistance which impedes movement, speech, and even thought, and may arrest it completely. Patients so affected find that as soon as they ‚Äòwill‚Äô or intend or attempt a movement, a ‚Äòcounter-will‚Äô or ‚Äòresistance‚Äô rises up to meet them. They find themselves embattled, and even immobilized, in a form of psychological conflict ‚Äî force against counter-force, will against counter-will, command against countermand.However, this is only one side of Parkinsonism, as the quote above hints at. The ‚Äúhurry or pulsion‚Äù (clinically akathisia) is actually the first quality of Parkinsonism described in the 1800s. Hurry is also called in the literature festination, an adroit concept that Sacks calls ‚Äúperhaps the most characteristic feature of Parkinsonism.‚ÄùFestination consists of an acceleration (and with this, an abbreviation) of steps, movements, words, or even thoughts ‚Äî it conveys a sense of impatience, impetuosity, and alacrity, as if the patient were very pressed for time; and in some patients it goes along with a feeling of urgency and impatience, although others, as it were, find themselves hurried against their will.Thus it seems to me that the major characteristic of Parkinsonism is a struggle with an inner force that is not one‚Äôs own, that alternately urges activity or confounds it, with little in-between (‚Äúin-between‚Äù being a state of control ‚Äî the state we think of as normal). It‚Äôs almost impossible to imagine what this must be like. Sacks is an extremely empathetic physician and writer, and he takes pains to try to describe what it‚Äôs like to have Parkinson‚Äôs. However just as often, its his patients themselves who provide the most eloquent metaphors (for metaphor is the only vehicle we really have for understanding this).[It is] like being stuck on an enormous planet. I seemed to weigh tons, I was crushed, I couldn‚Äôt move. ‚Äî Helen K.I think of a map; then a map of that map; then a map of that map of that map‚Ä¶ Worlds within worlds within worlds within worlds‚Ä¶ Once I get going I can‚Äôt possibly stop. It‚Äôs like being caught between mirrors, or echoes, or something. Or being caught on a merry-go-round which won‚Äôt come to a stop. ‚Äî Rose R.Sacks‚Äôs patients, whose case histories he recounts in Awakenings, are a special group of Parkinsonian patients called post-encephalitics. They are the survivors of the great sleeping-sickness epidemic of 1916-27, which I‚Äôd never heard of before. (Mencken: ‚ÄúThe epidemic is seldom mentioned, and most Americans have apparently forgotten it. This is not surprising. The human mind always tries to expunge the intolerable from memory, just as it tries to conceal it while current.‚Äù)The sleeping-sickness, actually a viral disease called encephalitis lethargica, struck no two patients in exactly the same way ‚Äî this baffled the medical community. Many sufferers slipped in to irreversible comas, while others became so aroused that they died of insomnia. Those who didn‚Äôt die tended to fall gradually into a deep Parkinsonism, especially of the ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù variety, and had to be institutionalized. Sacks epitomizes their dreadful state with a quote from Donne: ‚ÄúAs Sicknes is the greatest misery, so the greatest misery of sicknes, is solitude‚Ä¶ Solitude is a torment which is not threatened in hell itselfe.‚ÄùI ceased to have any moods. I ceased to care about anything. Nothing moved me ‚Äî not even the death of my parents. I forgot what it felt like to be happy or unhappy. Was it good or bad? It was neither. It was nothing. ‚Äî Magda B.This is when Dr. Sacks appears. In 1966 he arrived at a hospital in New York, where he oversaw a ward of about 80 post-encephalitics. He soon learned about a new so-called ‚Äúmiracle drug‚Äù called L-DOPA, which promised to reverse the effects of Parkinsonism. After putting it off for two years, he began starting his patients on it in 1969.L-DOPA‚Äôs effects on the post-encephalitic patients were instant and incredible; it generated the titular ‚Äúawakenings‚Äù that have become almost famous, much more famous than what really happened. In actuality the awakenings were short-lived, and patients soon reacted to the drug in all sorts of bizarre and different ways, with the common thread that each saw a resurgence and even intensification of Parkinsonism. Many had to stop taking L-DOPA, after which they became even more confined than they‚Äôd been pre-DOPA. I was reminded of Charlie Gordon‚Äôs fate in Flowers for Algernon: was it worth it to experience the highest of highs, only to sink back to the depths below, or was it better to have gone through none of it at all?Sacks takes us through the case histories of a selection of these patients, and he shows us how they progress through three stages of L-DOPA. We experience their explosive reactions to the drug (‚Äúawakenings‚Äù), their ‚Äútribulations‚Äù with it after the adverse reactions appear, and for some, ‚Äúaccommodations‚Äù ‚Äî these patients managed to achieve a homeostatis on L-DOPA that gave them a somewhat-normal life again.For the latter, these immensely strong individuals, the journey from encephalitis through L-DOPA strikes me as a characteristic example of Joseph Campbell‚Äôs hero‚Äôs journey ‚Äî only for them, the period of wandering in the wilderness lasted decades. Alternatively, the three-stage sequence of response to the drug could be its own, highly-compressed example. The post-encephalitic Parkinsonian hears the siren call of L-DOPA, which calls her forth into an uncharted space, where after an initial elation, she endures the harshest tests of her will and character, to ultimately persevere and return to the sphere of Parkinsonism, eternally wise and unbreakable.Sacks reaches his greatest heights when discussing what the existence of Parkinsonism (and disease generally) means for our conceptions of life and ‚Äúbeing-in-the-world.‚Äù Reading him made me grateful for my capability to move in and manipulate my own space ‚Äî so easy to take for granted.The terrors of suffering, sickness, and death, of losing ourselves and losing the world, are the most elemental and intense we know; and so too are our dreams of recovery and rebirth, of being wonderfully restored to ourselves and the world.‚Ä¶Common to all worlds of disease is the sense of pressure, coercion, and force; the loss of real spaciousness and freedom and ease; the loss of poise, of infinite readiness, and the contractions, contortions, and postures of illness: the development of pathological rigidity and insistence.‚Ä¶Health is infinite and expansive in mode, and reaches out to be filled with the fullness of the world; whereas disease is finite and reductive in mode, and endeavors to reduce the world to itself.But what I gained most from Awakenings was learning about the greatest gift one can give to a person with Parkinson‚Äôs: companionship. It is togetherness that frees them from their inner constraints, so they may move freely again. Sacks describes patients who are rigid and unable to walk, until they receive the slightest touch ‚Äî this seems to revive them, recall them to the world, and impel them to get up and go. Patients who normally struggle to walk without festinating can swagger gracefully down the corridors if they are walking with someone.I can do nothing alone. I can do anything with ‚Äî with music or people to help me. I cannot initiate, but I can fully share. You ‚Äúnormals,‚Äù you are full of ‚Äúgo,‚Äù and when you are with me I can partake of all this. The moment you go away I am nothing again. ‚Äî Edith T.When you walk with me, I feel in myself your own power of walking. I partake of the power and freedom you have. I share your walking powers, your perceptions, your feelings, your existence. Without even knowing it, you make me a great gift. ‚Äî Edith T.Feeling the fullness of the presence of the world depends on feeling the fullness of another person, as a person; reality is given to us by the reality of people; reality is taken from us by the unreality of un-people; our sense of reality, of trust, of security, is critically dependent on human relation.How profound, how amazing it is to be ‚Äúfull of ‚Äògo.'‚Äù This is a lesson that applies to all aspects of life: if you have something, some quality or flair, that others don‚Äôt, do your best to use it and treasure it and share it while you can. Make connections. Envelop yourself in fullness and reality."
25,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: Chronicles the experience of post-encephalitis patients existing as prisoners in their own bodies in a trance-like state, who, when treated with L-DOPA, experienced dramatic ""awakenings"" nearly always followed by debilitating side effects, often resulting with withdrawal of the drug, and a return to their former state.From 1916 to 1927, there was an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, or ""sleeping sickness."" The sickness often resulted in a period of profound lethargy, sometimes ending in a return to normal or nearly normal life. A number of patients experienced symptoms of Parkinsonism, leading to increasing paralysis and necessitating institutionalization. Many lived as prisoners in their own bodies, limited in movement and speech.Oliver Sacks, in this book chronicles his work with a group of such patients, some institutionalized for as long as forty years in Mount Carmel Hospital in New York. During the time that he was caring for them, a new drug, L-DOPA, began to be used with great effect on Parkinson's patients, and since these patients symptoms were similar, Saks, and other attempted to use the drug with them with dramatic, and ultimately, troubling, effects.After introductory chapters on Parkinsonism, sleeping sickness, Mount Carmel, and L-Dopa, he describes the patient history of twenty patients who he treated with this drug. It turns out they responded very differently than Parkinson's patients. Nearly all of them experienced ""awakenings"" where they regained the ability to move and speak. One patient, Leonard L. described the experience as follows:""I feel saved. . . I feel like a man in love. I have broken through the barriers which cut me off from love. . . . I have been hungry and yearning all my life, . . . and now I am full. Appeased. Satisfied. I want nothing more. . . . L-DOPA is a blessed drug, it has given me back the possibility of life. It has opened me out where I was clammed tight shut before. . . . If everyone felt as good as I do, nobody would think of quarrelling or wars. Nobody would think of domination or possession. They would simply enjoy themselves and each other. The would realize that Heaven was right here down on earth.""Sadly, with few exceptions, these awakenings did not last but turned into wide awake nightmares. Coherent speech would become rushed faster and faster, and degenerate into repeating of words or phrases. ""Tics"" would appear and become debilitating. Movement would accelerate to the point that the person could harm themselves. Psychological changes occurred as well and a normal personality would generate into mania.The histories describe the heart-wrenching efforts to bring these symptoms under control by reducing dosages. Sometimes things were so bad that they had to withdraw the drug, leading to a return to a trance-like or coma-like state. He also describes three stages he observed patients going through: awakening, tribulation (side effects is too mild to describe this stage) and accommodation. Some are able to resume L-DOPA, and some not. What is striking is how they come to terms with their dashed expectations and suffering. Leonard writes, ""I am a living candle. I am consumed that you may learn. New things will be seen in the light of my suffering.""Sacks also observes how significant the human connection is with his patients, and how they do significantly better when there is at least one person in their lives with whom they connect, whether someone on the ward, or a family member or friend. For one patient, the chance to cobble shoes again enhanced his physical well-being and checked his descent into profound Parkinsonism.He concludes with some profound reflections on the nature of disease and the human personality. Sacks then includes series of fascinating appendices at the end of the book exploring the history of ""sleeping sickness,"" the past experiences of ""miracle drugs,"" and the electrical basis of awakenings. Two of the most fascinating were his studies of the different perceptions of space and time of his patients, and the application of chaos theory to understanding patient responses to L-DOPA, which did not follow any orderly progression.The last appendix is an account of the various radio, stage, and screen adaptations of Awakenings. Most notable is his description of working with actors Robert De Niro and the late Robin Williams and director Penny Marshall on the film version of Awakenings. He pays a wonderful tribute to their craft in getting ""inside"" what it was like to be one of these patients and the portrayal of fifteen ""awakenings"" at once and the chaos, brilliantly choreographed by Marshall.Sacks gives us a narrative that helps us understand the often heartbreaking process of medical research, where advances and setbacks often come together, and where, more than science, the bond between doctors and other caregivers and patients remains paramount, whether treatments effect cure or not. Through one rare condition, Saks gives us a lens into the human condition we all share."
26,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2044236-nyamka-ganni,4,It is a very fascinating and deeply saddening story at the same time. It‚Äôs about group of patients who re-awakened after years of death-like state (caused by post encephalitis or sleeping sickness) in 1969. It made me think about what it means to be alive and free thinking individual. How life on this earth is so very fleeting. How we waste it most of the time. 
27,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14269090-ann,3,"It was not at all what I expected. While the subject matter could interest a lay reader, it was written in extremely technical medical language, and there were times where I was sure I would give this book only 1 star, if I ever managed to finish it. My eyes would glaze over page after page of words that I didn't recognize and were not in the Kindle's built-in dictionary. The glossary in the back is not easy to access in an e-book. Dr. Oliver Sacks writes about his experience treating patients with post-encephalitic Parkinsonism years after having been victims of the great sleeping sickness epidemic at the end of World War I. Dr. Sacks cared for these patients before and after the advent of the alleged ""miracle drug"" L-Dopa (levodopa) in 1969, which, had remarkable ""awakening"" effects that gave new hope to his patients but were soon countered by intolerable adverse effects. Reactions varied among individuals, and the main body of the book is devoted to 20 case studies. I liked the fact that Dr. Sacks regarded his patients as whole persons and came to love them. My favorite part of the book was in the Appendix, where Dr. Sacks discusses the making of several films and dramas based on his book. Talented actors (such as Robert De Niro, who played a starring patient role in the 1990 movie) did intensive research, including direct contact with patients, to learn to play their afflicted characters convincingly, achieving astounding success, according to consulted patients themselves. While this segment was the most interesting to me, I could not have appreciated it without having the rest of the book. There were other rewards as well, so I am glad I persevered with this challenging work."

But I am so thankful that I read this book & must say, even at the beginning of my thoughts & comments, that I highly recommend this work of Sacks. The man has a brilliant mind, very worthy of our appreciation. I could not have read this book, had I not read ALL of the preliminary notes which take the reader well into the book and give one such as myself a very good background before going into the case studies of these special patients.I found the book to be so much better than the movie, which I thought wonderful & which left me speechless!The ""sleepy sickness"" that masks itself as Parkisonism would be difficult to garner understanding from without those previously mentioned notes. Oliver Sacks is a gifted writer. His prose is often times overly medical but again, please read the notes before beginning the case studies. The beauty of his words in regards to how medicine should be practiced and how the overly technical aspects of medicine are denying the original feeling & healing that is the true basic of the medical practice have made this book a must read for all those going into the medical field. I could go on and on but will just say: Please read this book if you have any interest in an extraordinary disease and the extraordinary processes which both the patients, other doctors, nurses & medical personnel go through long with Dr. Sacks.__________________________________________________‚ÄãFrom Wikipedia regarding the ""sleepy sickness"":""Encephalitis lethargica or von Economo disease is an atypical form of encephalitis. Also known as ""sleepy sickness"" (distinct from tsetse fly-transmitted sleeping sickness), it was first described in 1917 by the neurologist Constantin von Economo and the pathologist Jean-Ren√© Cruchet. The disease attacks the brain, leaving some victims in a statue-like condition, speechless and motionless. Between 1915 and 1926, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread around the world. Nearly five million people were affected, a third of whom died in the acute stages. Many of those who survived never returned to their pre-existing ""aliveness"". ""They would be conscious and aware - yet not fully awake; they would sit motionless and speechless all day in their chairs, totally lacking energy, impetus, initiative, motive, appetite, affect or desire; they registered what went on about them without active attention, and with profound indifference. They neither conveyed nor felt the feeling of life; they were as insubstantial as ghosts, and as passive as zombies."" No recurrence of the epidemic has since been reported, though isolated cases continue to occur."""
29,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6110237-andreea,4,"When I started to read ‚ÄúAwakenings‚Äù I was prepared to discover a number of medical cases of patients that suffered from the post-encephalitic syndrome. I was acquainted with the opinion of Dr. Sacks regarding the presentation of medical results not only in a pure mathematical form, but also as individual cases. Because you can not reduce someone‚Äôs context and being to just numbers. However, this book is so much more. It is a book of discovery from several points of view. We discover Dr. Sacks applying what he preaches: trying to understand the context, the ‚ÄúI‚Äù, of each and everyone of his patients, going beyond just administering x mg of this or y mg of that medicine and waiting for the results. He listens to his patients and their families. He tries to understand what triggers their behaviour and what the hospital can do to make their lives better. He always puts the welfare of the human being first. And he allows us to discover his patients as human beings, by presenting their disease in their own words.The book went through several editions since it was first published. With each new edition Dr. Sacks tried to improve it and make it more readable. Not until the last pages of the book did I understand that he wanted to tell the story of this peculiar disease to as large an audience as possible. And even after witnessing so many things with his patients, Dr. Sacks can still be surprised. He saw several adaptations of his book as theatre and radio plays, documentary and Hollywood movie. He impersonated his real self in the radio play and served as a ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù for Penny Marshall‚Äôs ‚ÄúAwakenings‚Äù starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. He was impressed by the way actors studied their roles and especially by Robert De Niro‚Äôs dedication. Not only did he talk to the last survivors of the post encephalitic syndrome, but he was absorbing and practicing their states even in real life:Ed W. told Bob that sometimes he might be completely frozen for hours, completely unable to get out of his chair or bed. Bob told me that he would sit and thing of being frozen like this, of not being able to get out of bed - he would think about this intensely, almost hypnotically for hours; he would imagine the inner quality of frozenness, at such times. [‚Ä¶] One of the greatest, and most paradoxical, challenges of all was imagining nothingness, which Leonard L. himself, and many other post-encephalitics, would often experience. Bob and I spent hours talking about nothingness, and the different sorts of nothingness patients might experience; this was a challenge Bob took very seriously - he quoted Beckett to me once: ‚ÄòNothing is more real than nothing.‚Äô"

It was the first movie I cried in--a profound moment in my development. Now, over 20 years later, I've finally read the book that inspired Penny Marshall's adaptation.Oliver Sacks is a remarkable writer, especially for a physician and scientist; his prose makes his real-life characters vividly alive in my mind. His approach to this book was unique, especially in 1973 when it was first published. It is essentially a series of medical case-histories, but written for a popular audience. Sacks' approach was brilliant in that it retained a level of professionalism that entrenched his work with the medical community, yet it had a level of readability that made it reach far into the public. It thus raised overall levels of understanding about Parkinsonism and other broader medical issues.The application of broader medical topics to Sacks' discussion of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism is really the true genius of the book. After completing his case histories, Sacks engages in a discussion of the treatment of disease (using the patients at hand as a launching point) that calls for a revised approach to medicine for both doctors and patients. I won't go into it here, but I will say that he makes some very important and thought-provoking points. Give the book a read.I held back one star because in spite of the book's surprising readability, it still has the faint earmarks of the work of a doctor. At times the writing wanders into the clinical, at which point Sacks usually reins it in, but a bit too late. He also uses a LOT of unfamiliar medical and neurological terms that make certain parts--especially toward the beginning--difficult to understand. There is a glossary of terms in the appendix, but it is not comprehensive enough.Still, I highly recommend this. "
32,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,3,"I really enjoyed reading all the encephalitis lethargica cases in this book. It made me think of how awesome human brains are. Human brains are incredibly interesting and mysterious at the same time. Through Dr. Sacks meticulous and lyrical writing, one can tell that Dr. Sacks was a very compassionate physician. His humanity shone through his reflections on these cases, and his opinions on the health care system.This is the second book of Dr. Sacks' I have read. I haven't gotten tired of his narratives; however, his writing does drag on a bit from time to time. And the amount of footnotes in this book! It was rather distracting.The movie adaptation sort of amalgamated symptoms from different patients and made new patients out of the real ones. The movie had a more upbeat flavour to it and it eliminated many of the common (somewhat grotesque) side effects of L-DOPA, which I guess would be too disturbing for some viewers. I would recommend both the movie and the book. It's a 3-star book for me."
33,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274569-tanya,5,"After having read another Oliver Sacks book, I picked this up just because I enjoyed the 1990 movie with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. This turned out to be an amazing story. The book is about Dr. Sacks's actual experiences with a new drug and several dozen patients suffering from post-encephelatic lethargica, a form of Parkinsons. Unlike Dr. Sayer in the movie, Dr. Sacks encountered a wide variety of responses to the drug, L-dopa. In fact, every patient's response was unique although most of them followed a pattern of ""awakening, tribulation, and accommodation."" For the first 200 pages, I had a hard time putting the book down but I got somewhat bogged down in his wrap-up in the last 50. It was more difficult to understand and wasn't holding my attention, but I got through it, still with a tremendous appreciation for what he did, what these patients went through before and after the drug, and the intricate workings of the human brain. "
34,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93853-simon,4,"More engrossing than the fact that Dr. Oliver Sacks' 'extinct volcanoes' (post-encephalitic patients) 'awoke' after having received L-Dopa are the reports of how these patients coped with their individual ""eruptions."" Despite having their 'higher faculties' (intelligence, judgment, humor) undisturbed by their crippling illnesses, most patients emerged gloriously from years of 'Sleeping Sickness' only to relapse - forcing either a troublesome accommodation to 'side effects' or a complete pre-dopa reversion. Worse yet was the inevitable addiction patients suffered to L-Dopa, despite Sacks' efforts to 'titrate' their medications and 'balance' their hyperbolic states. Though repetitive in their lessons, the book's numerous prologues and epilogues provide sufficient background on Parkinson's Disease, the 'Sleeping Sickness', Western medicine, and the patients' fates to round out the story."
35,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,5,"This is clearly Sacks' piece de resistence, and you can tell because it's been through a half-dozen editions, all of which bear significant revisions and new footnotes. And there's a reason. I was deeply affected by the case studies in this book, and you can see Sacks' wonder show through on the pages.On the down side, it contains too many footnotes, many of which are random tangents to the subject. I ended up skipping about 1/3 of them to keep the cohesion of the narrative.It's worth reading the voluminous appendices. The basic story of the L-Dopa trial on post-encephalitic patients is a pretty depressing one, all told. But subsequent advances that Sacks describes in the later versions gives the whole thing a great note of triumph. "

After reading ""Hallucinations"" I decided to settle in and finally read this one. It took a while to get into it--up until the case studies--then it took off. Amazing, beautiful, heart-breaking, strange--some of the stories read like horror fiction. This edition of the book is also odd (I don't know if there's a newer one): there are so many footnotes added that it's like there's a separate book in fine print running along the bottom of almost every page. Some footnotes go one for several pages, almost David Foster Wallace-like. I'll try to read/re-read more of his books this year."

This is more than just the case studies of those post-encephalitic Parkinsonian patients Dr. Sacks treated in the 60s with the new miracle drug L-Dopa. It gives a renewed optimism to those who work with any type of patient in the potential for recovery by realizing the patient is much more than just the physiological aspect of his body. ""One sees that beautiful and ultimate metaphysical truth, which has been stated by poets and physicians and metaphysicians in all ages- by Leibniz and Donne and Dante and Freud: that Eros is the oldest and strongest if the gods; that Love is the alpha and omega of being; and that the work of healing, of rendering whole, is, first and last, the business of Love."""

Oliver Sacks was not as easy to understand as he is in the fantastic The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.Although the epidemic that these people experienced in the early twentieth century appears to be as mysteriously gone as it was mysterious begin, I believe we need to be aware of the past and to remember the people who endured its hardships. Moreover, we do well to remember how fragile our lives and health are and live with gratitude. We, too, are not immune to future ""plagues."" There is much the art of medicine still does not understand."

Sacks' descriptions of the people he came to know in the hospital and of how the disabling symptoms of the disease affected the course of their lives was so heartrending that I couldn't get past the first couple of patient accounts. The book, first published in 1973, is incredibly relevant today because of how thoroughly Sacks chronicles the false hope of the ""miracle drug"" L-DOPA, and in doing so highlights the very currrent headlines regarding drug companies and their practices.

In historical context (considering the pushback from the academic neuroscience community) this makes sense, but to me, it made the book a less enjoyable read than his others (like Hallucinations, or The Man who mistook his wife for a hat). I would still recommend this book for the wonderfully descriptive case studies, but I have to admit that I gave up on many of the footnotes and ended up skimming a lot of the final commentary."

That illness then gets replace with another coping mechanism, which we call a side effect. The greatest value from this book comes from the reminder that we are whole beings with experiences and unmet needs that cannot be met with the addition of a drug or drugs. Here are some notes that I jotted down while reading.One third of the way through the book, in every case so far Oliver Sacks increased the does to 3 grams/day and saw bizarre symptoms (problems were sometimes there before the dose increase). It made me wonder if a smaller dose might have been more effective. But no, getting the dosage right was a balancing act that tended to get more difficult after the patient had been on L-DOPA for a while.Lucy K was lucid for one day. Even increasing the dose to 5 grams/day did not bring her back. She died 2 years later. Several patients had a similar response: They tried the medicine that brought back some normalcy, found life still unacceptable, got discouraged and wasted away‚ÄúWe rationalize, we dissimilate, we pretend: we pretend that modern medicine is a rational science, all facts, no nonsense, and just what it seems. But we have only to tap it‚Äôs glossy veneer for it to split wide open, and revealed to us it‚Äôs roots and foundations, it‚Äôs old dark heart of metaphysics, mysticism, magic, and myth.‚Äù (Page 28-29 of 408)Miriam H at almost halfway through the book told the Dr. to resume L-DOPA and she wouldn‚Äôt have complications. He did and she continued to function well on it. Some other patients also correctly told how their future health would go.‚ÄúShe goes mad in your madhouse because she is shut off from life.‚Äù (Page 160)Some of his patients develop Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms early in life, others in their 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs.Footnote 88: ‚ÄúLife changes, powerful emotions, cannot only exacerbate, but can precipitate parkinsonism. ‚Ä¶ it has been shown that dopamine levels may be reduced in the brain by 30-50% without producing any clinical symptoms; but that if it is reduced still further, to less than 20% of normal, parkinsonian symptoms promptly appear. (Pages 191-193, yes, an extended footnote)‚ÄúIn the sixteenth month on L-DOPA ... (Mr. E‚Äôs return) to Mount Carmel Hospital ... caused a wave of apprehension among the seventy other Parkinsonian patients receiving L-DOPA. They had seen Mr. E. leave in triumph, and now they saw his tragic return.‚Äù (Page 196)A number of patients, including Mr. E. Managed to achieve some level of a normal life with or without L-Dopa.Being trapped in the Parkinsonian state was described as: ‚Äòa mixture of nagging and pushing and pressure, with being held back and constrained and stopped. ... The absence is a terrible isolation and coldness and shrinking - more than you can imagine, Dr. Sacks ... a bottomless darkness and unreality. ... a sort of total calmness a nothingness, which is by no means unpleasant. It‚Äôs a letup from the torture. ... it‚Äôs something like death.‚Äô (Page 205)L-DOPA crosses the protective blood‚Äìbrain barrier, whereas dopamine itself cannot.[4]Thus, l-DOPA is used to increase dopamine concentrations in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia.

One observes this even in out-patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease, ... and may be considerably in excess of ‚Äònormal‚Äô needs;‚Äù (Page 268-269)The L-DOPA experiment wasn‚Äôt as dire as I understood it to be before I read the book. ‚ÄúWe still have more than fifty survivors at Mount Carmel, most of whom require, and are maintained on, L-DOPA.‚Äù (Page 278)Contact with other humans is crucial. ‚ÄúMany a Parkinsonian cannot walk by himself ... yet he may walk perfectly if there is someone with him.‚Äù (Page 281)"
51,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"My 4th book from Sacks and it didn't disappoint. It tells the story of Sack's patients affected with either Parkinson or most often encephalitis lethargica, also known as sleeping sickness, which resembles Parkinsonism, with perhaps somewhat more severe symptoms. While the disease is known more for its motor symptoms, like bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity of the limbs, and postural instability, it also impacts mood and cognition. People become speechless and motionless as if their ""soul"" has left. The book brilliantly captures the lives and the experiences of these patients, and how they experience the world and themselves. The disease causes the death of cells in the substantia nigra (a region of the midbrain), which makes it not being able to have sufficient dopamine, which is largely responsible for motivational salience (motivation that elicits behaviour). In the 1950s and 60s, L-Dopa appeared as a treatment for Parkinsonism. Unlikely dopamine itself, it could pass the blood-brain barrier, increasing dopamine concentrations. The book describes Sack's experience with this treatment on his patients. As Parkinsonism progresses, people become more and more ""shutdown"", losing touch with reality and increasingly self-absorbed into a reality of nothingness. With L-dopa, however, most seem to experience an ""awakening"", and hence the title of the book. That awakening being extreme enough that sometimes people were miraculously cured, having little or no symptoms of Parkinsonism. Reading the stories of these patients, re-emerging into the world, and being cured almost overnight, feels like reading a novel. However, this miracle soon becomes apparent that this is indeed the real world, and while L-Dopa has recovered the souls of many patients, it's not always the case, and it's not free of complications. While a lack of dopamine causes a trance-like state, L-Dopa often seemed to cause an excess... of everything. Both motor and neurological. Rigidity is replaced by spontaneous irregular ticks, and cognition now seems to be in a pathological and permanent overdrive. Throughout the book, Sacks gives the stories of his patients and how they reacted to L-Dopa. When everything went right, when everything went wrong, and anything in between. An exploration of Parkinsonism, the hidden biological nature of behaviour, and as with all of Sack's books, an exploration of humanity. This book is a unique experience, and there are many things one can gain from it. Perhaps one that most stuck with me is how little we understand about the brain. How far away we are from making reliable predictions and being humble about its complexity and unpredictability, which Sacks tries to connect to chaos theory in one of the last chapters, being a new field at the time. I was constantly amazed at how in most of the stories, the reactions make almost no sense at all. One hopes that we finally achieved understanding. That we have a cure, and we can predict its outcome. But we can't. The massive amount of variance in relationship to L-Dopa, not only between patients, but in the same patient, and how often logic gets thrown out of the window, is baffling. I was also perplexed at how often psychology, in a more layman's terms, seemed to infiltrate neurology. This is supposedly a field rooted in biology, in objectivity. Yet, it's clear that a more subjective, personal, and human aspect of it remains. It's a painful reminder of our ignorance, and likely our flawed division of biological and psychological approaches. Awakenings is definitely Sack's magnum opus. A classic of neurology and I'd argue of the best non-fiction books ever written."
52,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1347421-diem,5,"The first time I watched the film version of ""Awakenings"" was probably in 1991. I would have been about 20 and it would have been about 6 years since my father's mind and body had been ravaged by a catastrophic stroke. Six years is a long time and time enough to adjust to a new life with a new kind of father but it was too soon to see the movie. There is a scene in which a woman is visiting the hospital to see her father and has lunch with Leonard, the character played by the incomparable Robert De Niro. She says this: ""Sometimes I think I see something. I think I see a change. And for a moment, I see him like he was before the stroke. And then it's gone. And I'm not sure that I saw anything."" Because of this scene and the fantasy wish fulfillment of neurologically impaired patients awakening from their affliction, I was heartbroken by the movie and remained so for months after seeing it. Fast forward 25-ish years and watching the movie with my teenaged daughter. While still deeply moved by the film, my soul wasn't crushed by it and I became intensely curious about the real story. Having just listened to Dr. Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" I was prepared for how scholarly and clinical his writing can be. Many people lament his clinical vernacular but I find that part easy enough to piece together. I have a layman's familiarity with neurology. That combined with a basic understanding of prefixes and suffixes can go a long way. If you understand hyperkinesia then akinesia should present no challenge. What bewildered and amazed me were his references to the great minds of a multitude of disciplines. He either quoted or referenced: Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Hume, Schopenhauer, John Donne, Dali, Kant, Leibniz. And this is a truncated list. It is also important that no lesser minds than these informed both his writing and his work in the field of neurology. He addresses this importance in the chapter where he speaks of how fundamentally important it is to science to never neglect or abandon the ontological in pursuit of the purely empirical. This is his appeal, in my opinion, to all of the STEM obsessed students of today to enrich their education with the study of philosophy, art, music, literature and history. This need to be well acquainted with the whole world of human experience is poignantly illustrated by how critical HIS knowledge of such was to his work with post-encephalitic patients who challenged any previously understood notions of being and existence. Many of these victims of the ""Sleepy Sickness"" of the 1920s had been in a state of seeming frozen catatonia for 40 years. And yet, upon being administered the drug L-Dopa they were able to report, in clear and compelling language, that they had been conscious and aware the entire time. The clinical picture can only get you so far in your understanding of this phenomenon. If knowing that this nightmarish existence can occur outside the realm fairytales and sci-fi novels doesn't keep you awake for at least a few extra minutes, then you're doing science wrong. Some of my daymares involve memories of my father in the early years after his stroke trying to talk to us from his wheelchair. He would get started okay but then his brain would jam, almost visibly, and his mouth already contorted by right-side paralysis would contort even more grotesquely. Then garbled, ghoulish sounds would erupt from him where he clearly intended words to be. He would stop and start again several times to no avail and not infrequently this process would end with him punching the air with his left fist and screaming through angry tears, ""I know! Dammit! I know! But I can't say it!""I imagine that now, after reading Awakenings. But I imagine Leonard screaming and punching the air in only his mind. And with no one to hear him say it. And with no one even knowing he thought it. Because while he was screaming and punching in his mind, his body was frozen and his eyes glassy and vacant. It haunts me. The stories, beautifully presented case studies, from the hospital are gripping. Sacks presents each study in a, yes, deeply clinical way but also in a deeply personal way. Each 'case' is a fully fleshed out person with a backstory and a personality and a family. Not always a nice personality and not always a nice family, but this is a real story. I was deeply appreciative of how sensitive Sacks was in making each patient fully human. It was particularly important to me because my father spent several months, in a rehabilitative hospital once he left the regular hospital. He was on the head trauma floor and I remember my first visit there in flashes of great detail. The way the floor was more tightly secured than the regular hospital had been and the way my mother warned me before I went in, that it might be upsetting. What she was referring to, I quickly found out, was that unlike the regular hospital the head trauma ward could be loud. Very loud.At the time that my father was admitted, there was a patient on the floor that spent much of the day screaming. I don't recall him screaming anything in particular. Just his rage filled screaming as if he were in terrible pain. I do not remember what had happened to him but I have never forgotten his screaming. My father shared his room with a quiet young man named William who was not in the room the first time I visited. But he was there the next day when my mother dropped me off to sit with my dad for a few hours while she did some errands. I walked into the room and he sat up suddenly and said, ""Wow. You're so pretty.""No one under the age of 37 had ever told me I was pretty. I didn't have the kind of look that appealed to young people of that time. I was always popular with older men and could have dated any number of my dad's friends or my friend's dads had I been inclined that way. But I wasn't. Anyway, it wasn't lost on me that the first person within 10 years of my own age to tell me I was pretty was in the hospital for severe head trauma. William had been in a motorcycle accident and he was clearly in very bad shape. He had suffered considerable brain damage but seemed cheerfully unaware of it. Over the next few weeks I would meet his parents and his fianc√©e and they got used to me sitting in a corner, watching my dad sleep or stare blankly at the television. So used to me that I become the unwitting witness to a moment so private and awful that I recall it like it has just happened. William's fiancee was visiting. She was sitting in the chair right in front of the room's one large window. She was a young woman, early 20s, with puffy blonde hair. William sat next to her in his wheelchair. They were holding hands and she was trying to talk to him and he was being silly. But not in a cute way. In a disjointed, childish way. She suddenly stopped talking and her whole body visibly crumpled into itself. Her head sagged forward and her shoulders heaved but she remained absolutely silent. William suddenly stopped being silly. He wheeled closer and wrapped his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Please don't cry. Don't cry. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. I'm going to get better."" But, if William believed what he was saying, he was the only one. I was only 16 but I knew in that moment that she knew it wasn't going to be okay and William wasn't going to get better. I felt like I had just witnessed the moment that two lives had been violently and horribly changed forever. Two lives spectacularly but quietly exploding in front of a hospital window on a sunny afternoon.So, what I took away from that horrible episode and what I carry with me every time I visit or even pass a hospital is that every single window represents a set of lives and stories that will break your heart if you listen to them. And someone needs to listen to them. And that someone might as well be a physician. And that physician was Dr. Sacks. And he left us this book and this book is asking us to start caring about the stories. And it is especially asking doctors to start caring about the stories. I mean, it is doing a lot of other things too. It is too appalling that Sacks has written this tremendous book of a million layers and all I'm going to say about it is that I liked it and I think anyone considering going into medicine should read it. But, there are other reviews and my kids are asking to be fed. Read the book. "
53,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633038-jesse-field,4,"As Doris Lessing‚Äôs blurb on the paperback says, ‚ÄúIt makes you aware of what a knife-edge we live on.‚Äù The edge between functional cognition and severe pathology that calls into question what selfhood even means. Also the edge between fitting into society, more or less, and being rejected by it fully, as so many of us have worried over.I took in the narratives of the patients all at once, a rush of reading that leaves one harrowed, bemused, and, God help me, almost bored by the end. In the introduction and conclusion, Sacks‚Äô ability to squeeze such incredible meaning from his narrative drag me back to attention. The effective and anticipated climax was a brief questioning of the nature of scientific truth-seeking, a theme ever-present in this text:We have spoken of the Parkinsonian as ‚Äòlost in space and time,‚Äô and as harbouring a ‚Äòchaos of broken clocks and rulers.‚Äô One might say that these are Kantian formulations of his state, for they correspond with the central Kantian notion that space and time are the essential forms of experience, that space and time (or, rather, the sense of space and time) are ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô of the organism or mind. Thus, where we spoke previously of a relativistic or Einsteinian delirium, we might now, even more fundamentally, speak of a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô delirium ‚Äì and ultimate akinesia as being ‚ÄòaKantia.‚ÄôIf Kant, in his first Critique, dealt with space and time as the essential (‚Äòa priori synthetic‚Äô) forms of the experience (and thus of perception and motion), he deals in his other Critiques with agency, the will, ‚ÄòI‚Äô (and as ‚ÄòI‚Äô being defined by its will ‚Äì ‚ÄòVolo ergo sum‚Äô). Thus the considerations we have been impelled to require all of Kant‚Äôs thought.Are such considerations outside the proper domain of ‚Äòscience‚Äô? They are outside the science, for this not only denies the ideal forms of experience, but disallows any ‚Äòpersonal identity.‚Äô But they point, or so I believe, to a greater and more generous conception of ‚Äòscience,‚Äô which can embrace all the phenomena we have discussed. Such a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô science, I think, is the science of the future.Thus, in what might appear an extraordinarily small field ‚Äì the study and treatment of post-encephalitic patients ‚Äì we find unexpectedly vast vistas emerging. We see before us, in exemplary form, the thrilling shapes of the medicine of the future, a perfectly rational yet practical scientific medicine, and an utterly beautiful and elemental ‚Äòexistential‚Äô medicine.Despite the rush of epiphany feeling generated in this passage, however, turning back to re-read leaves us as unsatisfied as when we review and write down our dreams. What position, or role, does the Will have from the second and third Critiques? Was Schopenhauer on the right track? Sacks merely grazes the surface of something here, then takes on the mantle of the logical positivist, preaching of a better future, even when the conflicts of his own humanity and the troubled history of Mt. Carmel Hospital would seem to indicate something less sanguine. Oh well. The work remains a powerful crossover from ethnographic narrative to dramatic production. And in what other story collection can we learn words like ‚Äúoculogyria,‚Äù ‚Äúpalilalia,‚Äù and ‚Äúfestinating.‚Äù One worries only slightly that we‚Äôve all made a circus of the patients, for it seems okay as long as we remember, we are part of the circus, too."
54,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035284-brian-bess,4,"When the sleepers wakeWhen I saw the 1990 film ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô, with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, I knew that lurking beneath the sentimentalized story was a more powerful one that could have been accepted as science fiction if it had occurred even a couple of decades earlier. What happened in 1969, at Mount Carmel Hospital (the fictionalized hospital where Oliver Sacks was a resident neurologist) was an extraordinary sequence of events impacting dozens of victims of sleeping-sickness aka encephalitis lethargica. These patients had varying degrees of affliction occurring in the wake of the influenza epidemic that swept the country in 1918, some virtually catatonic, others alternately lucid and stable, most experiencing tics, tremors, palsy and various manifestations of the Parkinson-like illness. Following the medical hype surrounding L-DOPA, then seen as a miracle drug, many of these patients were administered the drug and virtually all of them reacted to it in powerfully dramatic ways. Some were jolted out of a decades long sleep. For example, Rose R., had been in this comatose state since 1926 and was severely traumatized to realize that over 40 years of her life were gone and that she had awakened to a world of the future. Rose knew that it was 1969 but just wished that it were 1926. Each of the patients reacted in a wholly unique way, reinforcing Sacks‚Äô belief that too much of the emphasis of modern medicine has been placed on a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô therapy that is assumed to work the same way every time in every circumstance. He contends that modern medicine has dehumanized patients and reduced them to numbers and statistics on a massive medical chart. Just as each of us have unique personalities, so each of us have unique biological and psychological compositions that results in each person reacting to uniform stimuli and medication differently.Sacks structures the book in a way that illustrates his therapeutic philosophy. His introduction provides historical background on the sleeping sickness that afflicted a large number of people during the 1920‚Äôs, along with explanations of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Parkinsonism, the institutional structure of Mount Carmel and the emergence of L-DOPA‚Äôs use. The next section is a collection of case studies, narratives of the experiences of 20 of the patients that were given the drug at Mount Carmel in 1969. The third, ‚ÄòPerspectives‚Äô provides conclusions and commonality in the arc of the trajectory common to most of the patients as they improved, then reverted in response to varying dosages of L-DOPA. His epilogue follows what happened to each of the 20 patients in subsequent years after the initial book publication. In essence, he is providing the medical foundation of the story, followed by individual narratives, followed by therapeutic and philosophic conclusions. As he states:‚ÄúRunning throughout the book is a metaphysical theme‚Äîthe notion that it is insufficient to consider disease in purely mechanical or chemical terms; that it must be considered equally in biological or metaphysical terms, i.e., in terms of organization and design.‚ÄùWhat ensues is a book that has a split personality. We are reading psychological ‚Äòcase histories‚Äô, complete with medical jargon and terminology for describing symptoms (a glossary of medical terms is supplied) alternating with Sacks‚Äô very subjective rendering of the personalities of the patients along with his personal assessments. He includes quotes from poets ranging from John Donne to T.S. Eliot and allows himself to wax poetic and go on philosophic tangents with references to Leibniz and Kant. Just as he fictionalizes Beth Abraham Hospital where he worked into Mount Carmel, he presumably uses fictitious names for his 20 patients i.e. Rose R., Frances D., Aaron E., Leonard L. This personalization is at odds with his formal referral to them throughout their section as Mr. L., Miss I., etc. Although he attempts to treat each of them as unique cases, most of them begin to run together, with a few standing out as more distinct and memorable. Some of these patients are quite articulate. Rose R., for example, describes her condition:‚ÄúOnce I get going I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like being caught between mirrors, or echoes, or something. Or being caught on a merry-go-round which won‚Äôt come to a stop.‚ÄùHe concludes his case histories with Leonard L., the character so movingly portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film. Leonard is the most literate and literary patient on the ward. During the times when he had ownership of his faculties he would write brilliant book reviews. Sacks admits that he learned more from Leonard than from any other patient he ever had and that he deserves a book to himself. Leonard had intermittent times until his thirties when he was somewhat functional. He was always a compulsive reader and would continue reading even when he was otherwise unable to communicate. He experienced a particularly codependent relationship with his mother. His mother needed to be needed as much or more than he needed her. His reaction to L-DOPA was particularly erratic. He became vitalized, filled with curiosity and awe with everything at first, feeling compelled to suck the marrow out of every bit of life he encountered. This tipped over into compulsive and destructive tendencies as he became overly sexual, accosting nurses and staff to the point when he was physically rebuffed, considering himself a new messiah, expounding the gospel of L-DOPA. He would masturbate compulsively or he would write his autobiography for 12 to 15 hours a day. He was particularly tragic in that he was aware of what was happening to him and that he was teetering out of balance into a chaotic unknown. He articulated the dilemma of all the patients when he wrote at the end of his autobiography, ‚ÄúI am a living candle. I am consumed that you may learn. New things will be seen in the light of my suffering.‚Äù Leonard is the tragic Hamlet of this tale. He obviously moved Oliver Sacks and he was the most relatable character for me.I commend Oliver Sacks for his very humane, compassionate approach to these patients, which he considers extraordinarily courageous and tenacious. I applaud his approach toward treating pathologic neurological conditions, even if I consider that his execution falls a bit short of his aspirations. I have seen YouTube interviews with him and I can see that he was a very warm individual and I can understand why patients would trust him with their lives. ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô is a fitting epitaph that does justice to these noble sufferers and presents a medical approach that I wish more doctors would apply."

Influenza is scary because it has the potential to kill so many of the people it infects. While encephalitis lethargica killed roughly 30% of its victims, it left the survivors with a variety of movement disorders, tics, catalepsy, and so on, that left these people with existences that many might consider worse than death. In Awakenings, Dr. Oliver Sacks shares a series of case histories of people with post-encephalitis who were treated with a new ‚Äúwonder drug‚Äù called L-DOPA in the summer of 1969. This deeply human and humane series of case studies reveals the complications of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù from years of immobility and nothingness and heart-breaking after effects of L-DOPA that were sometimes worse than the patients‚Äô original conditions. Above all, Awakenings stands as some of the best medical writing I‚Äôve ever read because of Dr. Sacks‚Äô approach to his patients‚Äîa blend of empathy, curiosity, art, and science...Read the rest of my review at A Bookish Type."

It was the first movie I cried in--a profound moment in my development. Now, over 20 years later, I've finally read the book that inspired Penny Marshall's adaptation.Oliver Sacks is a remarkable writer, especially for a physician and scientist; his prose makes his real-life characters vividly alive in my mind. His approach to this book was unique, especially in 1973 when it was first published. It is essentially a series of medical case-histories, but written for a popular audience. Sacks' approach was brilliant in that it retained a level of professionalism that entrenched his work with the medical community, yet it had a level of readability that made it reach far into the public. It thus raised overall levels of understanding about Parkinsonism and other broader medical issues.The application of broader medical topics to Sacks' discussion of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism is really the true genius of the book. After completing his case histories, Sacks engages in a discussion of the treatment of disease (using the patients at hand as a launching point) that calls for a revised approach to medicine for both doctors and patients. I won't go into it here, but I will say that he makes some very important and thought-provoking points. Give the book a read.I held back one star because in spite of the book's surprising readability, it still has the faint earmarks of the work of a doctor. At times the writing wanders into the clinical, at which point Sacks usually reins it in, but a bit too late. He also uses a LOT of unfamiliar medical and neurological terms that make certain parts--especially toward the beginning--difficult to understand. There is a glossary of terms in the appendix, but it is not comprehensive enough.Still, I highly recommend this. "
62,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,3,"I really enjoyed reading all the encephalitis lethargica cases in this book. It made me think of how awesome human brains are. Human brains are incredibly interesting and mysterious at the same time. Through Dr. Sacks meticulous and lyrical writing, one can tell that Dr. Sacks was a very compassionate physician. His humanity shone through his reflections on these cases, and his opinions on the health care system.This is the second book of Dr. Sacks' I have read. I haven't gotten tired of his narratives; however, his writing does drag on a bit from time to time. And the amount of footnotes in this book! It was rather distracting.The movie adaptation sort of amalgamated symptoms from different patients and made new patients out of the real ones. The movie had a more upbeat flavour to it and it eliminated many of the common (somewhat grotesque) side effects of L-DOPA, which I guess would be too disturbing for some viewers. I would recommend both the movie and the book. It's a 3-star book for me."
63,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274569-tanya,5,"After having read another Oliver Sacks book, I picked this up just because I enjoyed the 1990 movie with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. This turned out to be an amazing story. The book is about Dr. Sacks's actual experiences with a new drug and several dozen patients suffering from post-encephelatic lethargica, a form of Parkinsons. Unlike Dr. Sayer in the movie, Dr. Sacks encountered a wide variety of responses to the drug, L-dopa. In fact, every patient's response was unique although most of them followed a pattern of ""awakening, tribulation, and accommodation."" For the first 200 pages, I had a hard time putting the book down but I got somewhat bogged down in his wrap-up in the last 50. It was more difficult to understand and wasn't holding my attention, but I got through it, still with a tremendous appreciation for what he did, what these patients went through before and after the drug, and the intricate workings of the human brain. "
64,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93853-simon,4,"More engrossing than the fact that Dr. Oliver Sacks' 'extinct volcanoes' (post-encephalitic patients) 'awoke' after having received L-Dopa are the reports of how these patients coped with their individual ""eruptions."" Despite having their 'higher faculties' (intelligence, judgment, humor) undisturbed by their crippling illnesses, most patients emerged gloriously from years of 'Sleeping Sickness' only to relapse - forcing either a troublesome accommodation to 'side effects' or a complete pre-dopa reversion. Worse yet was the inevitable addiction patients suffered to L-Dopa, despite Sacks' efforts to 'titrate' their medications and 'balance' their hyperbolic states. Though repetitive in their lessons, the book's numerous prologues and epilogues provide sufficient background on Parkinson's Disease, the 'Sleeping Sickness', Western medicine, and the patients' fates to round out the story."
65,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,5,"This is clearly Sacks' piece de resistence, and you can tell because it's been through a half-dozen editions, all of which bear significant revisions and new footnotes. And there's a reason. I was deeply affected by the case studies in this book, and you can see Sacks' wonder show through on the pages.On the down side, it contains too many footnotes, many of which are random tangents to the subject. I ended up skipping about 1/3 of them to keep the cohesion of the narrative.It's worth reading the voluminous appendices. The basic story of the L-Dopa trial on post-encephalitic patients is a pretty depressing one, all told. But subsequent advances that Sacks describes in the later versions gives the whole thing a great note of triumph. "

After reading ""Hallucinations"" I decided to settle in and finally read this one. It took a while to get into it--up until the case studies--then it took off. Amazing, beautiful, heart-breaking, strange--some of the stories read like horror fiction. This edition of the book is also odd (I don't know if there's a newer one): there are so many footnotes added that it's like there's a separate book in fine print running along the bottom of almost every page. Some footnotes go one for several pages, almost David Foster Wallace-like. I'll try to read/re-read more of his books this year."

Sacks' descriptions of the people he came to know in the hospital and of how the disabling symptoms of the disease affected the course of their lives was so heartrending that I couldn't get past the first couple of patient accounts. The book, first published in 1973, is incredibly relevant today because of how thoroughly Sacks chronicles the false hope of the ""miracle drug"" L-DOPA, and in doing so highlights the very currrent headlines regarding drug companies and their practices.

That illness then gets replace with another coping mechanism, which we call a side effect. The greatest value from this book comes from the reminder that we are whole beings with experiences and unmet needs that cannot be met with the addition of a drug or drugs. Here are some notes that I jotted down while reading.One third of the way through the book, in every case so far Oliver Sacks increased the does to 3 grams/day and saw bizarre symptoms (problems were sometimes there before the dose increase). It made me wonder if a smaller dose might have been more effective. But no, getting the dosage right was a balancing act that tended to get more difficult after the patient had been on L-DOPA for a while.Lucy K was lucid for one day. Even increasing the dose to 5 grams/day did not bring her back. She died 2 years later. Several patients had a similar response: They tried the medicine that brought back some normalcy, found life still unacceptable, got discouraged and wasted away‚ÄúWe rationalize, we dissimilate, we pretend: we pretend that modern medicine is a rational science, all facts, no nonsense, and just what it seems. But we have only to tap it‚Äôs glossy veneer for it to split wide open, and revealed to us it‚Äôs roots and foundations, it‚Äôs old dark heart of metaphysics, mysticism, magic, and myth.‚Äù (Page 28-29 of 408)Miriam H at almost halfway through the book told the Dr. to resume L-DOPA and she wouldn‚Äôt have complications. He did and she continued to function well on it. Some other patients also correctly told how their future health would go.‚ÄúShe goes mad in your madhouse because she is shut off from life.‚Äù (Page 160)Some of his patients develop Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms early in life, others in their 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs.Footnote 88: ‚ÄúLife changes, powerful emotions, cannot only exacerbate, but can precipitate parkinsonism. ‚Ä¶ it has been shown that dopamine levels may be reduced in the brain by 30-50% without producing any clinical symptoms; but that if it is reduced still further, to less than 20% of normal, parkinsonian symptoms promptly appear. (Pages 191-193, yes, an extended footnote)‚ÄúIn the sixteenth month on L-DOPA ... (Mr. E‚Äôs return) to Mount Carmel Hospital ... caused a wave of apprehension among the seventy other Parkinsonian patients receiving L-DOPA. They had seen Mr. E. leave in triumph, and now they saw his tragic return.‚Äù (Page 196)A number of patients, including Mr. E. Managed to achieve some level of a normal life with or without L-Dopa.Being trapped in the Parkinsonian state was described as: ‚Äòa mixture of nagging and pushing and pressure, with being held back and constrained and stopped. ... The absence is a terrible isolation and coldness and shrinking - more than you can imagine, Dr. Sacks ... a bottomless darkness and unreality. ... a sort of total calmness a nothingness, which is by no means unpleasant. It‚Äôs a letup from the torture. ... it‚Äôs something like death.‚Äô (Page 205)L-DOPA crosses the protective blood‚Äìbrain barrier, whereas dopamine itself cannot.[4]Thus, l-DOPA is used to increase dopamine concentrations in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia. (Wikipedia)The chapter ‚ÄúTribulation‚Äù is summed up in this statement: ‚ÄúThe perverse need for illness ‚Äî both in patients themselves, and sometimes in those who are close to them ‚Äî must be a major determinant in casing relapses, the most insidious enemy of the will-to-get-better:‚Äù (Page 263) ... ‚Äúwe must ... deal with the person and his being-in-the-world.‚Äù (Page 265)‚ÄúThe need for rest becomes especially important, whether in the form of night-sleep, ‚Äònaps,‚Äô ‚Äòtaking it easy,‚Äô or ‚Äòrelaxation.‚Äô ... One observes this even in out-patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease, ... and may be considerably in excess of ‚Äònormal‚Äô needs;‚Äù (Page 268-269)The L-DOPA experiment wasn‚Äôt as dire as I understood it to be before I read the book. ‚ÄúWe still have more than fifty survivors at Mount Carmel, most of whom require, and are maintained on, L-DOPA.‚Äù (Page 278)Contact with other humans is crucial. ‚ÄúMany a Parkinsonian cannot walk by himself ... yet he may walk perfectly if there is someone with him.‚Äù (Page 281)"
81,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"My 4th book from Sacks and it didn't disappoint. It tells the story of Sack's patients affected with either Parkinson or most often encephalitis lethargica, also known as sleeping sickness, which resembles Parkinsonism, with perhaps somewhat more severe symptoms. While the disease is known more for its motor symptoms, like bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity of the limbs, and postural instability, it also impacts mood and cognition. People become speechless and motionless as if their ""soul"" has left. The book brilliantly captures the lives and the experiences of these patients, and how they experience the world and themselves. The disease causes the death of cells in the substantia nigra (a region of the midbrain), which makes it not being able to have sufficient dopamine, which is largely responsible for motivational salience (motivation that elicits behaviour). In the 1950s and 60s, L-Dopa appeared as a treatment for Parkinsonism. Unlikely dopamine itself, it could pass the blood-brain barrier, increasing dopamine concentrations. The book describes Sack's experience with this treatment on his patients. As Parkinsonism progresses, people become more and more ""shutdown"", losing touch with reality and increasingly self-absorbed into a reality of nothingness. With L-dopa, however, most seem to experience an ""awakening"", and hence the title of the book. That awakening being extreme enough that sometimes people were miraculously cured, having little or no symptoms of Parkinsonism. Reading the stories of these patients, re-emerging into the world, and being cured almost overnight, feels like reading a novel. However, this miracle soon becomes apparent that this is indeed the real world, and while L-Dopa has recovered the souls of many patients, it's not always the case, and it's not free of complications. While a lack of dopamine causes a trance-like state, L-Dopa often seemed to cause an excess... of everything. Both motor and neurological. Rigidity is replaced by spontaneous irregular ticks, and cognition now seems to be in a pathological and permanent overdrive. Throughout the book, Sacks gives the stories of his patients and how they reacted to L-Dopa. When everything went right, when everything went wrong, and anything in between. An exploration of Parkinsonism, the hidden biological nature of behaviour, and as with all of Sack's books, an exploration of humanity. This book is a unique experience, and there are many things one can gain from it. Perhaps one that most stuck with me is how little we understand about the brain. How far away we are from making reliable predictions and being humble about its complexity and unpredictability, which Sacks tries to connect to chaos theory in one of the last chapters, being a new field at the time. I was constantly amazed at how in most of the stories, the reactions make almost no sense at all. One hopes that we finally achieved understanding. That we have a cure, and we can predict its outcome. But we can't. The massive amount of variance in relationship to L-Dopa, not only between patients, but in the same patient, and how often logic gets thrown out of the window, is baffling. I was also perplexed at how often psychology, in a more layman's terms, seemed to infiltrate neurology. This is supposedly a field rooted in biology, in objectivity. Yet, it's clear that a more subjective, personal, and human aspect of it remains. It's a painful reminder of our ignorance, and likely our flawed division of biological and psychological approaches. Awakenings is definitely Sack's magnum opus. A classic of neurology and I'd argue of the best non-fiction books ever written."
82,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1347421-diem,5,"The first time I watched the film version of ""Awakenings"" was probably in 1991. I would have been about 20 and it would have been about 6 years since my father's mind and body had been ravaged by a catastrophic stroke. Six years is a long time and time enough to adjust to a new life with a new kind of father but it was too soon to see the movie. There is a scene in which a woman is visiting the hospital to see her father and has lunch with Leonard, the character played by the incomparable Robert De Niro. She says this: ""Sometimes I think I see something. I think I see a change. And for a moment, I see him like he was before the stroke. And then it's gone. And I'm not sure that I saw anything."" Because of this scene and the fantasy wish fulfillment of neurologically impaired patients awakening from their affliction, I was heartbroken by the movie and remained so for months after seeing it. Fast forward 25-ish years and watching the movie with my teenaged daughter. While still deeply moved by the film, my soul wasn't crushed by it and I became intensely curious about the real story. Having just listened to Dr. Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" I was prepared for how scholarly and clinical his writing can be. Many people lament his clinical vernacular but I find that part easy enough to piece together. I have a layman's familiarity with neurology. That combined with a basic understanding of prefixes and suffixes can go a long way. If you understand hyperkinesia then akinesia should present no challenge. What bewildered and amazed me were his references to the great minds of a multitude of disciplines. He either quoted or referenced: Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Hume, Schopenhauer, John Donne, Dali, Kant, Leibniz. And this is a truncated list. It is also important that no lesser minds than these informed both his writing and his work in the field of neurology. He addresses this importance in the chapter where he speaks of how fundamentally important it is to science to never neglect or abandon the ontological in pursuit of the purely empirical. This is his appeal, in my opinion, to all of the STEM obsessed students of today to enrich their education with the study of philosophy, art, music, literature and history. This need to be well acquainted with the whole world of human experience is poignantly illustrated by how critical HIS knowledge of such was to his work with post-encephalitic patients who challenged any previously understood notions of being and existence. Many of these victims of the ""Sleepy Sickness"" of the 1920s had been in a state of seeming frozen catatonia for 40 years. And yet, upon being administered the drug L-Dopa they were able to report, in clear and compelling language, that they had been conscious and aware the entire time. The clinical picture can only get you so far in your understanding of this phenomenon. If knowing that this nightmarish existence can occur outside the realm fairytales and sci-fi novels doesn't keep you awake for at least a few extra minutes, then you're doing science wrong. Some of my daymares involve memories of my father in the early years after his stroke trying to talk to us from his wheelchair. He would get started okay but then his brain would jam, almost visibly, and his mouth already contorted by right-side paralysis would contort even more grotesquely. Then garbled, ghoulish sounds would erupt from him where he clearly intended words to be. He would stop and start again several times to no avail and not infrequently this process would end with him punching the air with his left fist and screaming through angry tears, ""I know! Dammit! I know! But I can't say it!""I imagine that now, after reading Awakenings. But I imagine Leonard screaming and punching the air in only his mind. And with no one to hear him say it. And with no one even knowing he thought it. Because while he was screaming and punching in his mind, his body was frozen and his eyes glassy and vacant. It haunts me. The stories, beautifully presented case studies, from the hospital are gripping. Sacks presents each study in a, yes, deeply clinical way but also in a deeply personal way. Each 'case' is a fully fleshed out person with a backstory and a personality and a family. Not always a nice personality and not always a nice family, but this is a real story. I was deeply appreciative of how sensitive Sacks was in making each patient fully human. It was particularly important to me because my father spent several months, in a rehabilitative hospital once he left the regular hospital. He was on the head trauma floor and I remember my first visit there in flashes of great detail. The way the floor was more tightly secured than the regular hospital had been and the way my mother warned me before I went in, that it might be upsetting. What she was referring to, I quickly found out, was that unlike the regular hospital the head trauma ward could be loud. Very loud.At the time that my father was admitted, there was a patient on the floor that spent much of the day screaming. I don't recall him screaming anything in particular. Just his rage filled screaming as if he were in terrible pain. I do not remember what had happened to him but I have never forgotten his screaming. My father shared his room with a quiet young man named William who was not in the room the first time I visited. But he was there the next day when my mother dropped me off to sit with my dad for a few hours while she did some errands. I walked into the room and he sat up suddenly and said, ""Wow. You're so pretty.""No one under the age of 37 had ever told me I was pretty. I didn't have the kind of look that appealed to young people of that time. I was always popular with older men and could have dated any number of my dad's friends or my friend's dads had I been inclined that way. But I wasn't. Anyway, it wasn't lost on me that the first person within 10 years of my own age to tell me I was pretty was in the hospital for severe head trauma. William had been in a motorcycle accident and he was clearly in very bad shape. He had suffered considerable brain damage but seemed cheerfully unaware of it. Over the next few weeks I would meet his parents and his fianc√©e and they got used to me sitting in a corner, watching my dad sleep or stare blankly at the television. So used to me that I become the unwitting witness to a moment so private and awful that I recall it like it has just happened. William's fiancee was visiting. She was sitting in the chair right in front of the room's one large window. She was a young woman, early 20s, with puffy blonde hair. William sat next to her in his wheelchair. They were holding hands and she was trying to talk to him and he was being silly. But not in a cute way. In a disjointed, childish way. She suddenly stopped talking and her whole body visibly crumpled into itself. Her head sagged forward and her shoulders heaved but she remained absolutely silent. William suddenly stopped being silly. He wheeled closer and wrapped his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Please don't cry. Don't cry. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. I'm going to get better."" But, if William believed what he was saying, he was the only one. I was only 16 but I knew in that moment that she knew it wasn't going to be okay and William wasn't going to get better. I felt like I had just witnessed the moment that two lives had been violently and horribly changed forever. Two lives spectacularly but quietly exploding in front of a hospital window on a sunny afternoon.So, what I took away from that horrible episode and what I carry with me every time I visit or even pass a hospital is that every single window represents a set of lives and stories that will break your heart if you listen to them. And someone needs to listen to them. And that someone might as well be a physician. And that physician was Dr. Sacks. And he left us this book and this book is asking us to start caring about the stories. And it is especially asking doctors to start caring about the stories. I mean, it is doing a lot of other things too. It is too appalling that Sacks has written this tremendous book of a million layers and all I'm going to say about it is that I liked it and I think anyone considering going into medicine should read it. But, there are other reviews and my kids are asking to be fed. Read the book. "
83,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633038-jesse-field,4,"As Doris Lessing‚Äôs blurb on the paperback says, ‚ÄúIt makes you aware of what a knife-edge we live on.‚Äù The edge between functional cognition and severe pathology that calls into question what selfhood even means. Also the edge between fitting into society, more or less, and being rejected by it fully, as so many of us have worried over.I took in the narratives of the patients all at once, a rush of reading that leaves one harrowed, bemused, and, God help me, almost bored by the end. In the introduction and conclusion, Sacks‚Äô ability to squeeze such incredible meaning from his narrative drag me back to attention. The effective and anticipated climax was a brief questioning of the nature of scientific truth-seeking, a theme ever-present in this text:We have spoken of the Parkinsonian as ‚Äòlost in space and time,‚Äô and as harbouring a ‚Äòchaos of broken clocks and rulers.‚Äô One might say that these are Kantian formulations of his state, for they correspond with the central Kantian notion that space and time are the essential forms of experience, that space and time (or, rather, the sense of space and time) are ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô of the organism or mind. Thus, where we spoke previously of a relativistic or Einsteinian delirium, we might now, even more fundamentally, speak of a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô delirium ‚Äì and ultimate akinesia as being ‚ÄòaKantia.‚ÄôIf Kant, in his first Critique, dealt with space and time as the essential (‚Äòa priori synthetic‚Äô) forms of the experience (and thus of perception and motion), he deals in his other Critiques with agency, the will, ‚ÄòI‚Äô (and as ‚ÄòI‚Äô being defined by its will ‚Äì ‚ÄòVolo ergo sum‚Äô). Thus the considerations we have been impelled to require all of Kant‚Äôs thought.Are such considerations outside the proper domain of ‚Äòscience‚Äô? They are outside the science, for this not only denies the ideal forms of experience, but disallows any ‚Äòpersonal identity.‚Äô But they point, or so I believe, to a greater and more generous conception of ‚Äòscience,‚Äô which can embrace all the phenomena we have discussed. Such a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô science, I think, is the science of the future.Thus, in what might appear an extraordinarily small field ‚Äì the study and treatment of post-encephalitic patients ‚Äì we find unexpectedly vast vistas emerging. We see before us, in exemplary form, the thrilling shapes of the medicine of the future, a perfectly rational yet practical scientific medicine, and an utterly beautiful and elemental ‚Äòexistential‚Äô medicine.Despite the rush of epiphany feeling generated in this passage, however, turning back to re-read leaves us as unsatisfied as when we review and write down our dreams. What position, or role, does the Will have from the second and third Critiques? Was Schopenhauer on the right track? Sacks merely grazes the surface of something here, then takes on the mantle of the logical positivist, preaching of a better future, even when the conflicts of his own humanity and the troubled history of Mt. Carmel Hospital would seem to indicate something less sanguine. Oh well. The work remains a powerful crossover from ethnographic narrative to dramatic production. And in what other story collection can we learn words like ‚Äúoculogyria,‚Äù ‚Äúpalilalia,‚Äù and ‚Äúfestinating.‚Äù One worries only slightly that we‚Äôve all made a circus of the patients, for it seems okay as long as we remember, we are part of the circus, too."
84,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035284-brian-bess,4,"When the sleepers wakeWhen I saw the 1990 film ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô, with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, I knew that lurking beneath the sentimentalized story was a more powerful one that could have been accepted as science fiction if it had occurred even a couple of decades earlier. What happened in 1969, at Mount Carmel Hospital (the fictionalized hospital where Oliver Sacks was a resident neurologist) was an extraordinary sequence of events impacting dozens of victims of sleeping-sickness aka encephalitis lethargica. These patients had varying degrees of affliction occurring in the wake of the influenza epidemic that swept the country in 1918, some virtually catatonic, others alternately lucid and stable, most experiencing tics, tremors, palsy and various manifestations of the Parkinson-like illness. Following the medical hype surrounding L-DOPA, then seen as a miracle drug, many of these patients were administered the drug and virtually all of them reacted to it in powerfully dramatic ways. Some were jolted out of a decades long sleep. For example, Rose R., had been in this comatose state since 1926 and was severely traumatized to realize that over 40 years of her life were gone and that she had awakened to a world of the future. Rose knew that it was 1969 but just wished that it were 1926. Each of the patients reacted in a wholly unique way, reinforcing Sacks‚Äô belief that too much of the emphasis of modern medicine has been placed on a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô therapy that is assumed to work the same way every time in every circumstance. He contends that modern medicine has dehumanized patients and reduced them to numbers and statistics on a massive medical chart. Just as each of us have unique personalities, so each of us have unique biological and psychological compositions that results in each person reacting to uniform stimuli and medication differently.Sacks structures the book in a way that illustrates his therapeutic philosophy. His introduction provides historical background on the sleeping sickness that afflicted a large number of people during the 1920‚Äôs, along with explanations of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Parkinsonism, the institutional structure of Mount Carmel and the emergence of L-DOPA‚Äôs use. The next section is a collection of case studies, narratives of the experiences of 20 of the patients that were given the drug at Mount Carmel in 1969. The third, ‚ÄòPerspectives‚Äô provides conclusions and commonality in the arc of the trajectory common to most of the patients as they improved, then reverted in response to varying dosages of L-DOPA. His epilogue follows what happened to each of the 20 patients in subsequent years after the initial book publication. In essence, he is providing the medical foundation of the story, followed by individual narratives, followed by therapeutic and philosophic conclusions. As he states:‚ÄúRunning throughout the book is a metaphysical theme‚Äîthe notion that it is insufficient to consider disease in purely mechanical or chemical terms; that it must be considered equally in biological or metaphysical terms, i.e., in terms of organization and design.‚ÄùWhat ensues is a book that has a split personality. We are reading psychological ‚Äòcase histories‚Äô, complete with medical jargon and terminology for describing symptoms (a glossary of medical terms is supplied) alternating with Sacks‚Äô very subjective rendering of the personalities of the patients along with his personal assessments. He includes quotes from poets ranging from John Donne to T.S. Eliot and allows himself to wax poetic and go on philosophic tangents with references to Leibniz and Kant. Just as he fictionalizes Beth Abraham Hospital where he worked into Mount Carmel, he presumably uses fictitious names for his 20 patients i.e. Rose R., Frances D., Aaron E., Leonard L. This personalization is at odds with his formal referral to them throughout their section as Mr. L., Miss I., etc. Although he attempts to treat each of them as unique cases, most of them begin to run together, with a few standing out as more distinct and memorable. Some of these patients are quite articulate. Rose R., for example, describes her condition:‚ÄúOnce I get going I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like being caught between mirrors, or echoes, or something. Or being caught on a merry-go-round which won‚Äôt come to a stop.‚ÄùHe concludes his case histories with Leonard L., the character so movingly portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film. Leonard is the most literate and literary patient on the ward. During the times when he had ownership of his faculties he would write brilliant book reviews. Sacks admits that he learned more from Leonard than from any other patient he ever had and that he deserves a book to himself. Leonard had intermittent times until his thirties when he was somewhat functional. He was always a compulsive reader and would continue reading even when he was otherwise unable to communicate. He experienced a particularly codependent relationship with his mother. His mother needed to be needed as much or more than he needed her. His reaction to L-DOPA was particularly erratic. He became vitalized, filled with curiosity and awe with everything at first, feeling compelled to suck the marrow out of every bit of life he encountered. This tipped over into compulsive and destructive tendencies as he became overly sexual, accosting nurses and staff to the point when he was physically rebuffed, considering himself a new messiah, expounding the gospel of L-DOPA. He would masturbate compulsively or he would write his autobiography for 12 to 15 hours a day. He was particularly tragic in that he was aware of what was happening to him and that he was teetering out of balance into a chaotic unknown. He articulated the dilemma of all the patients when he wrote at the end of his autobiography, ‚ÄúI am a living candle. I am consumed that you may learn. New things will be seen in the light of my suffering.‚Äù Leonard is the tragic Hamlet of this tale. He obviously moved Oliver Sacks and he was the most relatable character for me.I commend Oliver Sacks for his very humane, compassionate approach to these patients, which he considers extraordinarily courageous and tenacious. I applaud his approach toward treating pathologic neurological conditions, even if I consider that his execution falls a bit short of his aspirations. I have seen YouTube interviews with him and I can see that he was a very warm individual and I can understand why patients would trust him with their lives. ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô is a fitting epitaph that does justice to these noble sufferers and presents a medical approach that I wish more doctors would apply."

Influenza is scary because it has the potential to kill so many of the people it infects. While encephalitis lethargica killed roughly 30% of its victims, it left the survivors with a variety of movement disorders, tics, catalepsy, and so on, that left these people with existences that many might consider worse than death. In Awakenings, Dr. Oliver Sacks shares a series of case histories of people with post-encephalitis who were treated with a new ‚Äúwonder drug‚Äù called L-DOPA in the summer of 1969. This deeply human and humane series of case studies reveals the complications of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù from years of immobility and nothingness and heart-breaking after effects of L-DOPA that were sometimes worse than the patients‚Äô original conditions. Above all, Awakenings stands as some of the best medical writing I‚Äôve ever read because of Dr. Sacks‚Äô approach to his patients‚Äîa blend of empathy, curiosity, art, and science...Read the rest of my review at A Bookish Type."

It was the first movie I cried in--a profound moment in my development. Now, over 20 years later, I've finally read the book that inspired Penny Marshall's adaptation.Oliver Sacks is a remarkable writer, especially for a physician and scientist; his prose makes his real-life characters vividly alive in my mind. His approach to this book was unique, especially in 1973 when it was first published. It is essentially a series of medical case-histories, but written for a popular audience. Sacks' approach was brilliant in that it retained a level of professionalism that entrenched his work with the medical community, yet it had a level of readability that made it reach far into the public. It thus raised overall levels of understanding about Parkinsonism and other broader medical issues.The application of broader medical topics to Sacks' discussion of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism is really the true genius of the book. After completing his case histories, Sacks engages in a discussion of the treatment of disease (using the patients at hand as a launching point) that calls for a revised approach to medicine for both doctors and patients. I won't go into it here, but I will say that he makes some very important and thought-provoking points. Give the book a read.I held back one star because in spite of the book's surprising readability, it still has the faint earmarks of the work of a doctor. At times the writing wanders into the clinical, at which point Sacks usually reins it in, but a bit too late. He also uses a LOT of unfamiliar medical and neurological terms that make certain parts--especially toward the beginning--difficult to understand. There is a glossary of terms in the appendix, but it is not comprehensive enough.Still, I highly recommend this. "

Human brains are incredibly interesting and mysterious at the same time. Through Dr. Sacks meticulous and lyrical writing, one can tell that Dr. Sacks was a very compassionate physician. His humanity shone through his reflections on these cases, and his opinions on the health care system.This is the second book of Dr. Sacks' I have read. I haven't gotten tired of his narratives; however, his writing does drag on a bit from time to time. And the amount of footnotes in this book! It was rather distracting.The movie adaptation sort of amalgamated symptoms from different patients and made new patients out of the real ones. The movie had a more upbeat flavour to it and it eliminated many of the common (somewhat grotesque) side effects of L-DOPA, which I guess would be too disturbing for some viewers. I would recommend both the movie and the book. It's a 3-star book for me."

This turned out to be an amazing story. The book is about Dr. Sacks's actual experiences with a new drug and several dozen patients suffering from post-encephelatic lethargica, a form of Parkinsons. Unlike Dr. Sayer in the movie, Dr. Sacks encountered a wide variety of responses to the drug, L-dopa. In fact, every patient's response was unique although most of them followed a pattern of ""awakening, tribulation, and accommodation."" For the first 200 pages, I had a hard time putting the book down but I got somewhat bogged down in his wrap-up in the last 50. It was more difficult to understand and wasn't holding my attention, but I got through it, still with a tremendous appreciation for what he did, what these patients went through before and after the drug, and the intricate workings of the human brain. "
94,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93853-simon,4,"More engrossing than the fact that Dr. Oliver Sacks' 'extinct volcanoes' (post-encephalitic patients) 'awoke' after having received L-Dopa are the reports of how these patients coped with their individual ""eruptions."" Despite having their 'higher faculties' (intelligence, judgment, humor) undisturbed by their crippling illnesses, most patients emerged gloriously from years of 'Sleeping Sickness' only to relapse - forcing either a troublesome accommodation to 'side effects' or a complete pre-dopa reversion. Worse yet was the inevitable addiction patients suffered to L-Dopa, despite Sacks' efforts to 'titrate' their medications and 'balance' their hyperbolic states. Though repetitive in their lessons, the book's numerous prologues and epilogues provide sufficient background on Parkinson's Disease, the 'Sleeping Sickness', Western medicine, and the patients' fates to round out the story."

And there's a reason. I was deeply affected by the case studies in this book, and you can see Sacks' wonder show through on the pages.On the down side, it contains too many footnotes, many of which are random tangents to the subject. I ended up skipping about 1/3 of them to keep the cohesion of the narrative.It's worth reading the voluminous appendices. The basic story of the L-Dopa trial on post-encephalitic patients is a pretty depressing one, all told. But subsequent advances that Sacks describes in the later versions gives the whole thing a great note of triumph. "

After reading ""Hallucinations"" I decided to settle in and finally read this one. It took a while to get into it--up until the case studies--then it took off. Amazing, beautiful, heart-breaking, strange--some of the stories read like horror fiction. This edition of the book is also odd (I don't know if there's a newer one): there are so many footnotes added that it's like there's a separate book in fine print running along the bottom of almost every page. Some footnotes go one for several pages, almost David Foster Wallace-like. I'll try to read/re-read more of his books this year."

Oliver Sacks was not as easy to understand as he is in the fantastic The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.Although the epidemic that these people experienced in the early twentieth century appears to be as mysteriously gone as it was mysterious begin, I believe we need to be aware of the past and to remember the people who endured its hardships. Moreover, we do well to remember how fragile our lives and health are and live with gratitude. We, too, are not immune to future ""plagues.""

Sacks' descriptions of the people he came to know in the hospital and of how the disabling symptoms of the disease affected the course of their lives was so heartrending that I couldn't get past the first couple of patient accounts. The book, first published in 1973, is incredibly relevant today because of how thoroughly Sacks chronicles the false hope of the ""miracle drug"" L-DOPA, and in doing so highlights the very currrent headlines regarding drug companies and their practices.

In historical context (considering the pushback from the academic neuroscience community) this makes sense, but to me, it made the book a less enjoyable read than his others (like Hallucinations, or The Man who mistook his wife for a hat). I would still recommend this book for the wonderfully descriptive case studies, but I have to admit that I gave up on many of the footnotes and ended up skimming a lot of the final commentary."

That illness then gets replace with another coping mechanism, which we call a side effect. The greatest value from this book comes from the reminder that we are whole beings with experiences and unmet needs that cannot be met with the addition of a drug or drugs. Here are some notes that I jotted down while reading.One third of the way through the book, in every case so far Oliver Sacks increased the does to 3 grams/day and saw bizarre symptoms (problems were sometimes there before the dose increase). It made me wonder if a smaller dose might have been more effective. But no, getting the dosage right was a balancing act that tended to get more difficult after the patient had been on L-DOPA for a while.Lucy K was lucid for one day. Even increasing the dose to 5 grams/day did not bring her back. She died 2 years later. Several patients had a similar response: They tried the medicine that brought back some normalcy, found life still unacceptable, got discouraged and wasted away‚ÄúWe rationalize, we dissimilate, we pretend: we pretend that modern medicine is a rational science, all facts, no nonsense, and just what it seems. But we have only to tap it‚Äôs glossy veneer for it to split wide open, and revealed to us it‚Äôs roots and foundations, it‚Äôs old dark heart of metaphysics, mysticism, magic, and myth.‚Äù (Page 28-29 of 408)Miriam H at almost halfway through the book told the Dr. to resume L-DOPA and she wouldn‚Äôt have complications. He did and she continued to function well on it. Some other patients also correctly told how their future health would go.‚ÄúShe goes mad in your madhouse because she is shut off from life.‚Äù (Page 160)Some of his patients develop Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms early in life, others in their 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs.Footnote 88: ‚ÄúLife changes, powerful emotions, cannot only exacerbate, but can precipitate parkinsonism. ‚Ä¶ it has been shown that dopamine levels may be reduced in the brain by 30-50% without producing any clinical symptoms; but that if it is reduced still further, to less than 20% of normal, parkinsonian symptoms promptly appear. (Pages 191-193, yes, an extended footnote)‚ÄúIn the sixteenth month on L-DOPA ...

Managed to achieve some level of a normal life with or without L-Dopa.Being trapped in the Parkinsonian state was described as: ‚Äòa mixture of nagging and pushing and pressure, with being held back and constrained and stopped. ... The absence is a terrible isolation and coldness and shrinking - more than you can imagine, Dr. Sacks ... a bottomless darkness and unreality. ... a sort of total calmness a nothingness, which is by no means unpleasant.

111,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"My 4th book from Sacks and it didn't disappoint. It tells the story of Sack's patients affected with either Parkinson or most often encephalitis lethargica, also known as sleeping sickness, which resembles Parkinsonism, with perhaps somewhat more severe symptoms. While the disease is known more for its motor symptoms, like bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity of the limbs, and postural instability, it also impacts mood and cognition. People become speechless and motionless as if their ""soul"" has left. The book brilliantly captures the lives and the experiences of these patients, and how they experience the world and themselves. The disease causes the death of cells in the substantia nigra (a region of the midbrain), which makes it not being able to have sufficient dopamine, which is largely responsible for motivational salience (motivation that elicits behaviour). In the 1950s and 60s, L-Dopa appeared as a treatment for Parkinsonism. Unlikely dopamine itself, it could pass the blood-brain barrier, increasing dopamine concentrations. The book describes Sack's experience with this treatment on his patients. As Parkinsonism progresses, people become more and more ""shutdown"", losing touch with reality and increasingly self-absorbed into a reality of nothingness. With L-dopa, however, most seem to experience an ""awakening"", and hence the title of the book. That awakening being extreme enough that sometimes people were miraculously cured, having little or no symptoms of Parkinsonism. Reading the stories of these patients, re-emerging into the world, and being cured almost overnight, feels like reading a novel. However, this miracle soon becomes apparent that this is indeed the real world, and while L-Dopa has recovered the souls of many patients, it's not always the case, and it's not free of complications. While a lack of dopamine causes a trance-like state, L-Dopa often seemed to cause an excess... of everything. Both motor and neurological. Rigidity is replaced by spontaneous irregular ticks, and cognition now seems to be in a pathological and permanent overdrive. Throughout the book, Sacks gives the stories of his patients and how they reacted to L-Dopa. When everything went right, when everything went wrong, and anything in between. An exploration of Parkinsonism, the hidden biological nature of behaviour, and as with all of Sack's books, an exploration of humanity. This book is a unique experience, and there are many things one can gain from it. Perhaps one that most stuck with me is how little we understand about the brain. How far away we are from making reliable predictions and being humble about its complexity and unpredictability, which Sacks tries to connect to chaos theory in one of the last chapters, being a new field at the time. I was constantly amazed at how in most of the stories, the reactions make almost no sense at all. One hopes that we finally achieved understanding. That we have a cure, and we can predict its outcome. But we can't. The massive amount of variance in relationship to L-Dopa, not only between patients, but in the same patient, and how often logic gets thrown out of the window, is baffling. I was also perplexed at how often psychology, in a more layman's terms, seemed to infiltrate neurology. This is supposedly a field rooted in biology, in objectivity. Yet, it's clear that a more subjective, personal, and human aspect of it remains. It's a painful reminder of our ignorance, and likely our flawed division of biological and psychological approaches. Awakenings is definitely Sack's magnum opus. A classic of neurology and I'd argue of the best non-fiction books ever written."
112,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1347421-diem,5,"The first time I watched the film version of ""Awakenings"" was probably in 1991. I would have been about 20 and it would have been about 6 years since my father's mind and body had been ravaged by a catastrophic stroke. Six years is a long time and time enough to adjust to a new life with a new kind of father but it was too soon to see the movie. There is a scene in which a woman is visiting the hospital to see her father and has lunch with Leonard, the character played by the incomparable Robert De Niro. She says this: ""Sometimes I think I see something. I think I see a change. And for a moment, I see him like he was before the stroke. And then it's gone. And I'm not sure that I saw anything."" Because of this scene and the fantasy wish fulfillment of neurologically impaired patients awakening from their affliction, I was heartbroken by the movie and remained so for months after seeing it. Fast forward 25-ish years and watching the movie with my teenaged daughter. While still deeply moved by the film, my soul wasn't crushed by it and I became intensely curious about the real story. Having just listened to Dr. Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" I was prepared for how scholarly and clinical his writing can be. Many people lament his clinical vernacular but I find that part easy enough to piece together. I have a layman's familiarity with neurology. That combined with a basic understanding of prefixes and suffixes can go a long way. If you understand hyperkinesia then akinesia should present no challenge. What bewildered and amazed me were his references to the great minds of a multitude of disciplines. He either quoted or referenced: Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Hume, Schopenhauer, John Donne, Dali, Kant, Leibniz. And this is a truncated list. It is also important that no lesser minds than these informed both his writing and his work in the field of neurology. He addresses this importance in the chapter where he speaks of how fundamentally important it is to science to never neglect or abandon the ontological in pursuit of the purely empirical. This is his appeal, in my opinion, to all of the STEM obsessed students of today to enrich their education with the study of philosophy, art, music, literature and history. This need to be well acquainted with the whole world of human experience is poignantly illustrated by how critical HIS knowledge of such was to his work with post-encephalitic patients who challenged any previously understood notions of being and existence. Many of these victims of the ""Sleepy Sickness"" of the 1920s had been in a state of seeming frozen catatonia for 40 years. And yet, upon being administered the drug L-Dopa they were able to report, in clear and compelling language, that they had been conscious and aware the entire time. The clinical picture can only get you so far in your understanding of this phenomenon. If knowing that this nightmarish existence can occur outside the realm fairytales and sci-fi novels doesn't keep you awake for at least a few extra minutes, then you're doing science wrong. Some of my daymares involve memories of my father in the early years after his stroke trying to talk to us from his wheelchair. He would get started okay but then his brain would jam, almost visibly, and his mouth already contorted by right-side paralysis would contort even more grotesquely. Then garbled, ghoulish sounds would erupt from him where he clearly intended words to be. He would stop and start again several times to no avail and not infrequently this process would end with him punching the air with his left fist and screaming through angry tears, ""I know! Dammit! I know! But I can't say it!""I imagine that now, after reading Awakenings. But I imagine Leonard screaming and punching the air in only his mind. And with no one to hear him say it. And with no one even knowing he thought it. Because while he was screaming and punching in his mind, his body was frozen and his eyes glassy and vacant. It haunts me. The stories, beautifully presented case studies, from the hospital are gripping. Sacks presents each study in a, yes, deeply clinical way but also in a deeply personal way. Each 'case' is a fully fleshed out person with a backstory and a personality and a family. Not always a nice personality and not always a nice family, but this is a real story. I was deeply appreciative of how sensitive Sacks was in making each patient fully human. It was particularly important to me because my father spent several months, in a rehabilitative hospital once he left the regular hospital. He was on the head trauma floor and I remember my first visit there in flashes of great detail. The way the floor was more tightly secured than the regular hospital had been and the way my mother warned me before I went in, that it might be upsetting. What she was referring to, I quickly found out, was that unlike the regular hospital the head trauma ward could be loud. Very loud.At the time that my father was admitted, there was a patient on the floor that spent much of the day screaming. I don't recall him screaming anything in particular. Just his rage filled screaming as if he were in terrible pain. I do not remember what had happened to him but I have never forgotten his screaming. My father shared his room with a quiet young man named William who was not in the room the first time I visited. But he was there the next day when my mother dropped me off to sit with my dad for a few hours while she did some errands. I walked into the room and he sat up suddenly and said, ""Wow. You're so pretty.""No one under the age of 37 had ever told me I was pretty. I didn't have the kind of look that appealed to young people of that time. I was always popular with older men and could have dated any number of my dad's friends or my friend's dads had I been inclined that way. But I wasn't. Anyway, it wasn't lost on me that the first person within 10 years of my own age to tell me I was pretty was in the hospital for severe head trauma. William had been in a motorcycle accident and he was clearly in very bad shape. He had suffered considerable brain damage but seemed cheerfully unaware of it. Over the next few weeks I would meet his parents and his fianc√©e and they got used to me sitting in a corner, watching my dad sleep or stare blankly at the television. So used to me that I become the unwitting witness to a moment so private and awful that I recall it like it has just happened. William's fiancee was visiting. She was sitting in the chair right in front of the room's one large window. She was a young woman, early 20s, with puffy blonde hair. William sat next to her in his wheelchair. They were holding hands and she was trying to talk to him and he was being silly. But not in a cute way. In a disjointed, childish way. She suddenly stopped talking and her whole body visibly crumpled into itself. Her head sagged forward and her shoulders heaved but she remained absolutely silent. William suddenly stopped being silly. He wheeled closer and wrapped his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Please don't cry. Don't cry. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. I'm going to get better."" But, if William believed what he was saying, he was the only one. I was only 16 but I knew in that moment that she knew it wasn't going to be okay and William wasn't going to get better. I felt like I had just witnessed the moment that two lives had been violently and horribly changed forever. Two lives spectacularly but quietly exploding in front of a hospital window on a sunny afternoon.So, what I took away from that horrible episode and what I carry with me every time I visit or even pass a hospital is that every single window represents a set of lives and stories that will break your heart if you listen to them. And someone needs to listen to them. And that someone might as well be a physician. And that physician was Dr. Sacks. And he left us this book and this book is asking us to start caring about the stories. And it is especially asking doctors to start caring about the stories. I mean, it is doing a lot of other things too. It is too appalling that Sacks has written this tremendous book of a million layers and all I'm going to say about it is that I liked it and I think anyone considering going into medicine should read it. But, there are other reviews and my kids are asking to be fed. Read the book. "
113,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633038-jesse-field,4,"As Doris Lessing‚Äôs blurb on the paperback says, ‚ÄúIt makes you aware of what a knife-edge we live on.‚Äù The edge between functional cognition and severe pathology that calls into question what selfhood even means. Also the edge between fitting into society, more or less, and being rejected by it fully, as so many of us have worried over.I took in the narratives of the patients all at once, a rush of reading that leaves one harrowed, bemused, and, God help me, almost bored by the end. In the introduction and conclusion, Sacks‚Äô ability to squeeze such incredible meaning from his narrative drag me back to attention. The effective and anticipated climax was a brief questioning of the nature of scientific truth-seeking, a theme ever-present in this text:We have spoken of the Parkinsonian as ‚Äòlost in space and time,‚Äô and as harbouring a ‚Äòchaos of broken clocks and rulers.‚Äô One might say that these are Kantian formulations of his state, for they correspond with the central Kantian notion that space and time are the essential forms of experience, that space and time (or, rather, the sense of space and time) are ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô of the organism or mind. Thus, where we spoke previously of a relativistic or Einsteinian delirium, we might now, even more fundamentally, speak of a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô delirium ‚Äì and ultimate akinesia as being ‚ÄòaKantia.‚ÄôIf Kant, in his first Critique, dealt with space and time as the essential (‚Äòa priori synthetic‚Äô) forms of the experience (and thus of perception and motion), he deals in his other Critiques with agency, the will, ‚ÄòI‚Äô (and as ‚ÄòI‚Äô being defined by its will ‚Äì ‚ÄòVolo ergo sum‚Äô). Thus the considerations we have been impelled to require all of Kant‚Äôs thought.Are such considerations outside the proper domain of ‚Äòscience‚Äô? They are outside the science, for this not only denies the ideal forms of experience, but disallows any ‚Äòpersonal identity.‚Äô But they point, or so I believe, to a greater and more generous conception of ‚Äòscience,‚Äô which can embrace all the phenomena we have discussed. Such a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô science, I think, is the science of the future.Thus, in what might appear an extraordinarily small field ‚Äì the study and treatment of post-encephalitic patients ‚Äì we find unexpectedly vast vistas emerging. We see before us, in exemplary form, the thrilling shapes of the medicine of the future, a perfectly rational yet practical scientific medicine, and an utterly beautiful and elemental ‚Äòexistential‚Äô medicine.Despite the rush of epiphany feeling generated in this passage, however, turning back to re-read leaves us as unsatisfied as when we review and write down our dreams. What position, or role, does the Will have from the second and third Critiques? Was Schopenhauer on the right track? Sacks merely grazes the surface of something here, then takes on the mantle of the logical positivist, preaching of a better future, even when the conflicts of his own humanity and the troubled history of Mt. Carmel Hospital would seem to indicate something less sanguine. Oh well. The work remains a powerful crossover from ethnographic narrative to dramatic production.

What happened in 1969, at Mount Carmel Hospital (the fictionalized hospital where Oliver Sacks was a resident neurologist) was an extraordinary sequence of events impacting dozens of victims of sleeping-sickness aka encephalitis lethargica. These patients had varying degrees of affliction occurring in the wake of the influenza epidemic that swept the country in 1918, some virtually catatonic, others alternately lucid and stable, most experiencing tics, tremors, palsy and various manifestations of the Parkinson-like illness. Following the medical hype surrounding L-DOPA, then seen as a miracle drug, many of these patients were administered the drug and virtually all of them reacted to it in powerfully dramatic ways. Some were jolted out of a decades long sleep. For example, Rose R., had been in this comatose state since 1926 and was severely traumatized to realize that over 40 years of her life were gone and that she had awakened to a world of the future. Rose knew that it was 1969 but just wished that it were 1926. Each of the patients reacted in a wholly unique way, reinforcing Sacks‚Äô belief that too much of the emphasis of modern medicine has been placed on a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô therapy that is assumed to work the same way every time in every circumstance. He contends that modern medicine has dehumanized patients and reduced them to numbers and statistics on a massive medical chart. Just as each of us have unique personalities, so each of us have unique biological and psychological compositions that results in each person reacting to uniform stimuli and medication differently.Sacks structures the book in a way that illustrates his therapeutic philosophy. His introduction provides historical background on the sleeping sickness that afflicted a large number of people during the 1920‚Äôs, along with explanations of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Parkinsonism, the institutional structure of Mount Carmel and the emergence of L-DOPA‚Äôs use. The next section is a collection of case studies, narratives of the experiences of 20 of the patients that were given the drug at Mount Carmel in 1969. The third, ‚ÄòPerspectives‚Äô provides conclusions and commonality in the arc of the trajectory common to most of the patients as they improved, then reverted in response to varying dosages of L-DOPA. His epilogue follows what happened to each of the 20 patients in subsequent years after the initial book publication. In essence, he is providing the medical foundation of the story, followed by individual narratives, followed by therapeutic and philosophic conclusions. As he states:‚ÄúRunning throughout the book is a metaphysical theme‚Äîthe notion that it is insufficient to consider disease in purely mechanical or chemical terms; that it must be considered equally in biological or metaphysical terms, i.e., in terms of organization and design.‚ÄùWhat ensues is a book that has a split personality. We are reading psychological ‚Äòcase histories‚Äô, complete with medical jargon and terminology for describing symptoms (a glossary of medical terms is supplied) alternating with Sacks‚Äô very subjective rendering of the personalities of the patients along with his personal assessments. He includes quotes from poets ranging from John Donne to T.S. Eliot and allows himself to wax poetic and go on philosophic tangents with references to Leibniz and Kant. Just as he fictionalizes Beth Abraham Hospital where he worked into Mount Carmel, he presumably uses fictitious names for his 20 patients i.e. Rose R., Frances D., Aaron E., Leonard L. This personalization is at odds with his formal referral to them throughout their section as Mr. L., Miss I., etc. Although he attempts to treat each of them as unique cases, most of them begin to run together, with a few standing out as more distinct and memorable. Some of these patients are quite articulate. Rose R., for example, describes her condition:‚ÄúOnce I get going I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like being caught between mirrors, or echoes, or something. Or being caught on a merry-go-round which won‚Äôt come to a stop.‚ÄùHe concludes his case histories with Leonard L., the character so movingly portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film. Leonard is the most literate and literary patient on the ward. During the times when he had ownership of his faculties he would write brilliant book reviews. Sacks admits that he learned more from Leonard than from any other patient he ever had and that he deserves a book to himself. Leonard had intermittent times until his thirties when he was somewhat functional. He was always a compulsive reader and would continue reading even when he was otherwise unable to communicate. He experienced a particularly codependent relationship with his mother. His mother needed to be needed as much or more than he needed her. His reaction to L-DOPA was particularly erratic. He became vitalized, filled with curiosity and awe with everything at first, feeling compelled to suck the marrow out of every bit of life he encountered. This tipped over into compulsive and destructive tendencies as he became overly sexual, accosting nurses and staff to the point when he was physically rebuffed, considering himself a new messiah, expounding the gospel of L-DOPA. He would masturbate compulsively or he would write his autobiography for 12 to 15 hours a day. He was particularly tragic in that he was aware of what was happening to him and that he was teetering out of balance into a chaotic unknown. He articulated the dilemma of all the patients when he wrote at the end of his autobiography, ‚ÄúI am a living candle. I am consumed that you may learn. New things will be seen in the light of my suffering.‚Äù Leonard is the tragic Hamlet of this tale. He obviously moved Oliver Sacks and he was the most relatable character for me.I commend Oliver Sacks for his very humane, compassionate approach to these patients, which he considers extraordinarily courageous and tenacious. I applaud his approach toward treating pathologic neurological conditions, even if I consider that his execution falls a bit short of his aspirations. I have seen YouTube interviews with him and I can see that he was a very warm individual and I can understand why patients would trust him with their lives. ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô is a fitting epitaph that does justice to these noble sufferers and presents a medical approach that I wish more doctors would apply."

There was also a pandemic of a, to me, much more terrifying illness. Influenza is scary because it has the potential to kill so many of the people it infects. While encephalitis lethargica killed roughly 30% of its victims, it left the survivors with a variety of movement disorders, tics, catalepsy, and so on, that left these people with existences that many might consider worse than death. In Awakenings, Dr. Oliver Sacks shares a series of case histories of people with post-encephalitis who were treated with a new ‚Äúwonder drug‚Äù called L-DOPA in the summer of 1969. This deeply human and humane series of case studies reveals the complications of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù from years of immobility and nothingness and heart-breaking after effects of L-DOPA that were sometimes worse than the patients‚Äô original conditions. Above all, Awakenings stands as some of the best medical writing I‚Äôve ever read because of Dr. Sacks‚Äô approach to his patients‚Äîa blend of empathy, curiosity, art, and science...Read the rest of my review at A Bookish Type."

It was the first movie I cried in--a profound moment in my development. Now, over 20 years later, I've finally read the book that inspired Penny Marshall's adaptation.Oliver Sacks is a remarkable writer, especially for a physician and scientist; his prose makes his real-life characters vividly alive in my mind. His approach to this book was unique, especially in 1973 when it was first published. It is essentially a series of medical case-histories, but written for a popular audience. Sacks' approach was brilliant in that it retained a level of professionalism that entrenched his work with the medical community, yet it had a level of readability that made it reach far into the public. It thus raised overall levels of understanding about Parkinsonism and other broader medical issues.The application of broader medical topics to Sacks' discussion of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism is really the true genius of the book. After completing his case histories, Sacks engages in a discussion of the treatment of disease (using the patients at hand as a launching point) that calls for a revised approach to medicine for both doctors and patients. I won't go into it here, but I will say that he makes some very important and thought-provoking points. Give the book a read.I held back one star because in spite of the book's surprising readability, it still has the faint earmarks of the work of a doctor. At times the writing wanders into the clinical, at which point Sacks usually reins it in, but a bit too late. He also uses a LOT of unfamiliar medical and neurological terms that make certain parts--especially toward the beginning--difficult to understand. There is a glossary of terms in the appendix, but it is not comprehensive enough.Still, I highly recommend this. "
122,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,3,"I really enjoyed reading all the encephalitis lethargica cases in this book. It made me think of how awesome human brains are. Human brains are incredibly interesting and mysterious at the same time. Through Dr. Sacks meticulous and lyrical writing, one can tell that Dr. Sacks was a very compassionate physician. His humanity shone through his reflections on these cases, and his opinions on the health care system.This is the second book of Dr. Sacks' I have read. I haven't gotten tired of his narratives; however, his writing does drag on a bit from time to time. And the amount of footnotes in this book! It was rather distracting.The movie adaptation sort of amalgamated symptoms from different patients and made new patients out of the real ones. The movie had a more upbeat flavour to it and it eliminated many of the common (somewhat grotesque) side effects of L-DOPA, which I guess would be too disturbing for some viewers. I would recommend both the movie and the book. It's a 3-star book for me."
123,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274569-tanya,5,"After having read another Oliver Sacks book, I picked this up just because I enjoyed the 1990 movie with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. This turned out to be an amazing story. The book is about Dr. Sacks's actual experiences with a new drug and several dozen patients suffering from post-encephelatic lethargica, a form of Parkinsons. Unlike Dr. Sayer in the movie, Dr. Sacks encountered a wide variety of responses to the drug, L-dopa. In fact, every patient's response was unique although most of them followed a pattern of ""awakening, tribulation, and accommodation."" For the first 200 pages, I had a hard time putting the book down but I got somewhat bogged down in his wrap-up in the last 50. It was more difficult to understand and wasn't holding my attention, but I got through it, still with a tremendous appreciation for what he did, what these patients went through before and after the drug, and the intricate workings of the human brain. "
124,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93853-simon,4,"More engrossing than the fact that Dr. Oliver Sacks' 'extinct volcanoes' (post-encephalitic patients) 'awoke' after having received L-Dopa are the reports of how these patients coped with their individual ""eruptions."" Despite having their 'higher faculties' (intelligence, judgment, humor) undisturbed by their crippling illnesses, most patients emerged gloriously from years of 'Sleeping Sickness' only to relapse - forcing either a troublesome accommodation to 'side effects' or a complete pre-dopa reversion. Worse yet was the inevitable addiction patients suffered to L-Dopa, despite Sacks' efforts to 'titrate' their medications and 'balance' their hyperbolic states. Though repetitive in their lessons, the book's numerous prologues and epilogues provide sufficient background on Parkinson's Disease, the 'Sleeping Sickness', Western medicine, and the patients' fates to round out the story."
125,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,5,"This is clearly Sacks' piece de resistence, and you can tell because it's been through a half-dozen editions, all of which bear significant revisions and new footnotes. And there's a reason. I was deeply affected by the case studies in this book, and you can see Sacks' wonder show through on the pages.On the down side, it contains too many footnotes, many of which are random tangents to the subject. I ended up skipping about 1/3 of them to keep the cohesion of the narrative.It's worth reading the voluminous appendices. The basic story of the L-Dopa trial on post-encephalitic patients is a pretty depressing one, all told. But subsequent advances that Sacks describes in the later versions gives the whole thing a great note of triumph. "

After reading ""Hallucinations"" I decided to settle in and finally read this one. It took a while to get into it--up until the case studies--then it took off. Amazing, beautiful, heart-breaking, strange--some of the stories read like horror fiction. This edition of the book is also odd (I don't know if there's a newer one): there are so many footnotes added that it's like there's a separate book in fine print running along the bottom of almost every page. Some footnotes go one for several pages, almost David Foster Wallace-like. I'll try to read/re-read more of his books this year."

Oliver Sacks was not as easy to understand as he is in the fantastic The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.Although the epidemic that these people experienced in the early twentieth century appears to be as mysteriously gone as it was mysterious begin, I believe we need to be aware of the past and to remember the people who endured its hardships. Moreover, we do well to remember how fragile our lives and health are and live with gratitude. We, too, are not immune to future ""plagues.""

Sacks' descriptions of the people he came to know in the hospital and of how the disabling symptoms of the disease affected the course of their lives was so heartrending that I couldn't get past the first couple of patient accounts. The book, first published in 1973, is incredibly relevant today because of how thoroughly Sacks chronicles the false hope of the ""miracle drug"" L-DOPA, and in doing so highlights the very currrent headlines regarding drug companies and their practices.

In historical context (considering the pushback from the academic neuroscience community) this makes sense, but to me, it made the book a less enjoyable read than his others (like Hallucinations, or The Man who mistook his wife for a hat). I would still recommend this book for the wonderfully descriptive case studies, but I have to admit that I gave up on many of the footnotes and ended up skimming a lot of the final commentary."

That illness then gets replace with another coping mechanism, which we call a side effect. The greatest value from this book comes from the reminder that we are whole beings with experiences and unmet needs that cannot be met with the addition of a drug or drugs. Here are some notes that I jotted down while reading.One third of the way through the book, in every case so far Oliver Sacks increased the does to 3 grams/day and saw bizarre symptoms (problems were sometimes there before the dose increase). It made me wonder if a smaller dose might have been more effective. But no, getting the dosage right was a balancing act that tended to get more difficult after the patient had been on L-DOPA for a while.Lucy K was lucid for one day. Even increasing the dose to 5 grams/day did not bring her back. She died 2 years later. Several patients had a similar response: They tried the medicine that brought back some normalcy, found life still unacceptable, got discouraged and wasted away‚ÄúWe rationalize, we dissimilate, we pretend: we pretend that modern medicine is a rational science, all facts, no nonsense, and just what it seems. But we have only to tap it‚Äôs glossy veneer for it to split wide open, and revealed to us it‚Äôs roots and foundations, it‚Äôs old dark heart of metaphysics, mysticism, magic, and myth.‚Äù (Page 28-29 of 408)Miriam H at almost halfway through the book told the Dr. to resume L-DOPA and she wouldn‚Äôt have complications. He did and she continued to function well on it. Some other patients also correctly told how their future health would go.‚ÄúShe goes mad in your madhouse because she is shut off from life.‚Äù (Page 160)Some of his patients develop Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms early in life, others in their 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs.Footnote 88: ‚ÄúLife changes, powerful emotions, cannot only exacerbate, but can precipitate parkinsonism. ‚Ä¶ it has been shown that dopamine levels may be reduced in the brain by 30-50% without producing any clinical symptoms; but that if it is reduced still further, to less than 20% of normal, parkinsonian symptoms promptly appear.

Managed to achieve some level of a normal life with or without L-Dopa.Being trapped in the Parkinsonian state was described as: ‚Äòa mixture of nagging and pushing and pressure, with being held back and constrained and stopped. ... The absence is a terrible isolation and coldness and shrinking - more than you can imagine, Dr. Sacks ... a bottomless darkness and unreality. ... a sort of total calmness a nothingness, which is by no means unpleasant.

141,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"My 4th book from Sacks and it didn't disappoint. It tells the story of Sack's patients affected with either Parkinson or most often encephalitis lethargica, also known as sleeping sickness, which resembles Parkinsonism, with perhaps somewhat more severe symptoms. While the disease is known more for its motor symptoms, like bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity of the limbs, and postural instability, it also impacts mood and cognition. People become speechless and motionless as if their ""soul"" has left. The book brilliantly captures the lives and the experiences of these patients, and how they experience the world and themselves. The disease causes the death of cells in the substantia nigra (a region of the midbrain), which makes it not being able to have sufficient dopamine, which is largely responsible for motivational salience (motivation that elicits behaviour). In the 1950s and 60s, L-Dopa appeared as a treatment for Parkinsonism. Unlikely dopamine itself, it could pass the blood-brain barrier, increasing dopamine concentrations. The book describes Sack's experience with this treatment on his patients. As Parkinsonism progresses, people become more and more ""shutdown"", losing touch with reality and increasingly self-absorbed into a reality of nothingness. With L-dopa, however, most seem to experience an ""awakening"", and hence the title of the book. That awakening being extreme enough that sometimes people were miraculously cured, having little or no symptoms of Parkinsonism. Reading the stories of these patients, re-emerging into the world, and being cured almost overnight, feels like reading a novel. However, this miracle soon becomes apparent that this is indeed the real world, and while L-Dopa has recovered the souls of many patients, it's not always the case, and it's not free of complications. While a lack of dopamine causes a trance-like state, L-Dopa often seemed to cause an excess... of everything. Both motor and neurological. Rigidity is replaced by spontaneous irregular ticks, and cognition now seems to be in a pathological and permanent overdrive. Throughout the book, Sacks gives the stories of his patients and how they reacted to L-Dopa. When everything went right, when everything went wrong, and anything in between. An exploration of Parkinsonism, the hidden biological nature of behaviour, and as with all of Sack's books, an exploration of humanity. This book is a unique experience, and there are many things one can gain from it. Perhaps one that most stuck with me is how little we understand about the brain. How far away we are from making reliable predictions and being humble about its complexity and unpredictability, which Sacks tries to connect to chaos theory in one of the last chapters, being a new field at the time. I was constantly amazed at how in most of the stories, the reactions make almost no sense at all. One hopes that we finally achieved understanding. That we have a cure, and we can predict its outcome. But we can't. The massive amount of variance in relationship to L-Dopa, not only between patients, but in the same patient, and how often logic gets thrown out of the window, is baffling. I was also perplexed at how often psychology, in a more layman's terms, seemed to infiltrate neurology. This is supposedly a field rooted in biology, in objectivity. Yet, it's clear that a more subjective, personal, and human aspect of it remains. It's a painful reminder of our ignorance, and likely our flawed division of biological and psychological approaches. Awakenings is definitely Sack's magnum opus. A classic of neurology and I'd argue of the best non-fiction books ever written."
142,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1347421-diem,5,"The first time I watched the film version of ""Awakenings"" was probably in 1991. I would have been about 20 and it would have been about 6 years since my father's mind and body had been ravaged by a catastrophic stroke. Six years is a long time and time enough to adjust to a new life with a new kind of father but it was too soon to see the movie. There is a scene in which a woman is visiting the hospital to see her father and has lunch with Leonard, the character played by the incomparable Robert De Niro. She says this: ""Sometimes I think I see something. I think I see a change. And for a moment, I see him like he was before the stroke. And then it's gone. And I'm not sure that I saw anything."" Because of this scene and the fantasy wish fulfillment of neurologically impaired patients awakening from their affliction, I was heartbroken by the movie and remained so for months after seeing it. Fast forward 25-ish years and watching the movie with my teenaged daughter. While still deeply moved by the film, my soul wasn't crushed by it and I became intensely curious about the real story. Having just listened to Dr. Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" I was prepared for how scholarly and clinical his writing can be. Many people lament his clinical vernacular but I find that part easy enough to piece together. I have a layman's familiarity with neurology. That combined with a basic understanding of prefixes and suffixes can go a long way. If you understand hyperkinesia then akinesia should present no challenge. What bewildered and amazed me were his references to the great minds of a multitude of disciplines. He either quoted or referenced: Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Hume, Schopenhauer, John Donne, Dali, Kant, Leibniz. And this is a truncated list. It is also important that no lesser minds than these informed both his writing and his work in the field of neurology. He addresses this importance in the chapter where he speaks of how fundamentally important it is to science to never neglect or abandon the ontological in pursuit of the purely empirical. This is his appeal, in my opinion, to all of the STEM obsessed students of today to enrich their education with the study of philosophy, art, music, literature and history. This need to be well acquainted with the whole world of human experience is poignantly illustrated by how critical HIS knowledge of such was to his work with post-encephalitic patients who challenged any previously understood notions of being and existence. Many of these victims of the ""Sleepy Sickness"" of the 1920s had been in a state of seeming frozen catatonia for 40 years. And yet, upon being administered the drug L-Dopa they were able to report, in clear and compelling language, that they had been conscious and aware the entire time. The clinical picture can only get you so far in your understanding of this phenomenon. If knowing that this nightmarish existence can occur outside the realm fairytales and sci-fi novels doesn't keep you awake for at least a few extra minutes, then you're doing science wrong. Some of my daymares involve memories of my father in the early years after his stroke trying to talk to us from his wheelchair. He would get started okay but then his brain would jam, almost visibly, and his mouth already contorted by right-side paralysis would contort even more grotesquely. Then garbled, ghoulish sounds would erupt from him where he clearly intended words to be. He would stop and start again several times to no avail and not infrequently this process would end with him punching the air with his left fist and screaming through angry tears, ""I know! Dammit! I know! But I can't say it!""I imagine that now, after reading Awakenings. But I imagine Leonard screaming and punching the air in only his mind. And with no one to hear him say it. And with no one even knowing he thought it. Because while he was screaming and punching in his mind, his body was frozen and his eyes glassy and vacant. It haunts me. The stories, beautifully presented case studies, from the hospital are gripping. Sacks presents each study in a, yes, deeply clinical way but also in a deeply personal way. Each 'case' is a fully fleshed out person with a backstory and a personality and a family. Not always a nice personality and not always a nice family, but this is a real story. I was deeply appreciative of how sensitive Sacks was in making each patient fully human. It was particularly important to me because my father spent several months, in a rehabilitative hospital once he left the regular hospital. He was on the head trauma floor and I remember my first visit there in flashes of great detail. The way the floor was more tightly secured than the regular hospital had been and the way my mother warned me before I went in, that it might be upsetting. What she was referring to, I quickly found out, was that unlike the regular hospital the head trauma ward could be loud. Very loud.At the time that my father was admitted, there was a patient on the floor that spent much of the day screaming. I don't recall him screaming anything in particular. Just his rage filled screaming as if he were in terrible pain. I do not remember what had happened to him but I have never forgotten his screaming. My father shared his room with a quiet young man named William who was not in the room the first time I visited. But he was there the next day when my mother dropped me off to sit with my dad for a few hours while she did some errands. I walked into the room and he sat up suddenly and said, ""Wow. You're so pretty.""No one under the age of 37 had ever told me I was pretty. I didn't have the kind of look that appealed to young people of that time. I was always popular with older men and could have dated any number of my dad's friends or my friend's dads had I been inclined that way. But I wasn't. Anyway, it wasn't lost on me that the first person within 10 years of my own age to tell me I was pretty was in the hospital for severe head trauma. William had been in a motorcycle accident and he was clearly in very bad shape. He had suffered considerable brain damage but seemed cheerfully unaware of it. Over the next few weeks I would meet his parents and his fianc√©e and they got used to me sitting in a corner, watching my dad sleep or stare blankly at the television. So used to me that I become the unwitting witness to a moment so private and awful that I recall it like it has just happened. William's fiancee was visiting. She was sitting in the chair right in front of the room's one large window. She was a young woman, early 20s, with puffy blonde hair. William sat next to her in his wheelchair. They were holding hands and she was trying to talk to him and he was being silly. But not in a cute way. In a disjointed, childish way. She suddenly stopped talking and her whole body visibly crumpled into itself. Her head sagged forward and her shoulders heaved but she remained absolutely silent. William suddenly stopped being silly. He wheeled closer and wrapped his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Please don't cry. Don't cry. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. I'm going to get better."" But, if William believed what he was saying, he was the only one. I was only 16 but I knew in that moment that she knew it wasn't going to be okay and William wasn't going to get better. I felt like I had just witnessed the moment that two lives had been violently and horribly changed forever. Two lives spectacularly but quietly exploding in front of a hospital window on a sunny afternoon.So, what I took away from that horrible episode and what I carry with me every time I visit or even pass a hospital is that every single window represents a set of lives and stories that will break your heart if you listen to them. And someone needs to listen to them. And that someone might as well be a physician. And that physician was Dr. Sacks. And he left us this book and this book is asking us to start caring about the stories. And it is especially asking doctors to start caring about the stories. I mean, it is doing a lot of other things too. It is too appalling that Sacks has written this tremendous book of a million layers and all I'm going to say about it is that I liked it and I think anyone considering going into medicine should read it. But, there are other reviews and my kids are asking to be fed. Read the book. "
143,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633038-jesse-field,4,"As Doris Lessing‚Äôs blurb on the paperback says, ‚ÄúIt makes you aware of what a knife-edge we live on.‚Äù The edge between functional cognition and severe pathology that calls into question what selfhood even means. Also the edge between fitting into society, more or less, and being rejected by it fully, as so many of us have worried over.I took in the narratives of the patients all at once, a rush of reading that leaves one harrowed, bemused, and, God help me, almost bored by the end. In the introduction and conclusion, Sacks‚Äô ability to squeeze such incredible meaning from his narrative drag me back to attention. The effective and anticipated climax was a brief questioning of the nature of scientific truth-seeking, a theme ever-present in this text:We have spoken of the Parkinsonian as ‚Äòlost in space and time,‚Äô and as harbouring a ‚Äòchaos of broken clocks and rulers.‚Äô One might say that these are Kantian formulations of his state, for they correspond with the central Kantian notion that space and time are the essential forms of experience, that space and time (or, rather, the sense of space and time) are ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô of the organism or mind. Thus, where we spoke previously of a relativistic or Einsteinian delirium, we might now, even more fundamentally, speak of a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô delirium ‚Äì and ultimate akinesia as being ‚ÄòaKantia.‚ÄôIf Kant, in his first Critique, dealt with space and time as the essential (‚Äòa priori synthetic‚Äô) forms of the experience (and thus of perception and motion), he deals in his other Critiques with agency, the will, ‚ÄòI‚Äô (and as ‚ÄòI‚Äô being defined by its will ‚Äì ‚ÄòVolo ergo sum‚Äô). Thus the considerations we have been impelled to require all of Kant‚Äôs thought.Are such considerations outside the proper domain of ‚Äòscience‚Äô? They are outside the science, for this not only denies the ideal forms of experience, but disallows any ‚Äòpersonal identity.‚Äô But they point, or so I believe, to a greater and more generous conception of ‚Äòscience,‚Äô which can embrace all the phenomena we have discussed. Such a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô science, I think, is the science of the future.Thus, in what might appear an extraordinarily small field ‚Äì the study and treatment of post-encephalitic patients ‚Äì we find unexpectedly vast vistas emerging. We see before us, in exemplary form, the thrilling shapes of the medicine of the future, a perfectly rational yet practical scientific medicine, and an utterly beautiful and elemental ‚Äòexistential‚Äô medicine.Despite the rush of epiphany feeling generated in this passage, however, turning back to re-read leaves us as unsatisfied as when we review and write down our dreams. What position, or role, does the Will have from the second and third Critiques? Was Schopenhauer on the right track? Sacks merely grazes the surface of something here, then takes on the mantle of the logical positivist, preaching of a better future, even when the conflicts of his own humanity and the troubled history of Mt. Carmel Hospital would seem to indicate something less sanguine. Oh well. The work remains a powerful crossover from ethnographic narrative to dramatic production. And in what other story collection can we learn words like ‚Äúoculogyria,‚Äù ‚Äúpalilalia,‚Äù and ‚Äúfestinating.‚Äù One worries only slightly that we‚Äôve all made a circus of the patients, for it seems okay as long as we remember, we are part of the circus, too."
144,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035284-brian-bess,4,"When the sleepers wakeWhen I saw the 1990 film ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô, with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, I knew that lurking beneath the sentimentalized story was a more powerful one that could have been accepted as science fiction if it had occurred even a couple of decades earlier. What happened in 1969, at Mount Carmel Hospital (the fictionalized hospital where Oliver Sacks was a resident neurologist) was an extraordinary sequence of events impacting dozens of victims of sleeping-sickness aka encephalitis lethargica. These patients had varying degrees of affliction occurring in the wake of the influenza epidemic that swept the country in 1918, some virtually catatonic, others alternately lucid and stable, most experiencing tics, tremors, palsy and various manifestations of the Parkinson-like illness. Following the medical hype surrounding L-DOPA, then seen as a miracle drug, many of these patients were administered the drug and virtually all of them reacted to it in powerfully dramatic ways. Some were jolted out of a decades long sleep. For example, Rose R., had been in this comatose state since 1926 and was severely traumatized to realize that over 40 years of her life were gone and that she had awakened to a world of the future. Rose knew that it was 1969 but just wished that it were 1926. Each of the patients reacted in a wholly unique way, reinforcing Sacks‚Äô belief that too much of the emphasis of modern medicine has been placed on a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô therapy that is assumed to work the same way every time in every circumstance. He contends that modern medicine has dehumanized patients and reduced them to numbers and statistics on a massive medical chart. Just as each of us have unique personalities, so each of us have unique biological and psychological compositions that results in each person reacting to uniform stimuli and medication differently.Sacks structures the book in a way that illustrates his therapeutic philosophy. His introduction provides historical background on the sleeping sickness that afflicted a large number of people during the 1920‚Äôs, along with explanations of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Parkinsonism, the institutional structure of Mount Carmel and the emergence of L-DOPA‚Äôs use. The next section is a collection of case studies, narratives of the experiences of 20 of the patients that were given the drug at Mount Carmel in 1969. The third, ‚ÄòPerspectives‚Äô provides conclusions and commonality in the arc of the trajectory common to most of the patients as they improved, then reverted in response to varying dosages of L-DOPA. His epilogue follows what happened to each of the 20 patients in subsequent years after the initial book publication. In essence, he is providing the medical foundation of the story, followed by individual narratives, followed by therapeutic and philosophic conclusions. As he states:‚ÄúRunning throughout the book is a metaphysical theme‚Äîthe notion that it is insufficient to consider disease in purely mechanical or chemical terms; that it must be considered equally in biological or metaphysical terms, i.e., in terms of organization and design.‚ÄùWhat ensues is a book that has a split personality. We are reading psychological ‚Äòcase histories‚Äô, complete with medical jargon and terminology for describing symptoms (a glossary of medical terms is supplied) alternating with Sacks‚Äô very subjective rendering of the personalities of the patients along with his personal assessments. He includes quotes from poets ranging from John Donne to T.S. Eliot and allows himself to wax poetic and go on philosophic tangents with references to Leibniz and Kant. Just as he fictionalizes Beth Abraham Hospital where he worked into Mount Carmel, he presumably uses fictitious names for his 20 patients i.e. Rose R., Frances D., Aaron E., Leonard L. This personalization is at odds with his formal referral to them throughout their section as Mr. L., Miss I., etc. Although he attempts to treat each of them as unique cases, most of them begin to run together, with a few standing out as more distinct and memorable. Some of these patients are quite articulate. Rose R., for example, describes her condition:‚ÄúOnce I get going I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like being caught between mirrors, or echoes, or something. Or being caught on a merry-go-round which won‚Äôt come to a stop.‚ÄùHe concludes his case histories with Leonard L., the character so movingly portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film. Leonard is the most literate and literary patient on the ward. During the times when he had ownership of his faculties he would write brilliant book reviews. Sacks admits that he learned more from Leonard than from any other patient he ever had and that he deserves a book to himself. Leonard had intermittent times until his thirties when he was somewhat functional. He was always a compulsive reader and would continue reading even when he was otherwise unable to communicate. He experienced a particularly codependent relationship with his mother. His mother needed to be needed as much or more than he needed her. His reaction to L-DOPA was particularly erratic. He became vitalized, filled with curiosity and awe with everything at first, feeling compelled to suck the marrow out of every bit of life he encountered. This tipped over into compulsive and destructive tendencies as he became overly sexual, accosting nurses and staff to the point when he was physically rebuffed, considering himself a new messiah, expounding the gospel of L-DOPA. He would masturbate compulsively or he would write his autobiography for 12 to 15 hours a day. He was particularly tragic in that he was aware of what was happening to him and that he was teetering out of balance into a chaotic unknown. He articulated the dilemma of all the patients when he wrote at the end of his autobiography, ‚ÄúI am a living candle. I am consumed that you may learn. New things will be seen in the light of my suffering.‚Äù Leonard is the tragic Hamlet of this tale. He obviously moved Oliver Sacks and he was the most relatable character for me.I commend Oliver Sacks for his very humane, compassionate approach to these patients, which he considers extraordinarily courageous and tenacious. I applaud his approach toward treating pathologic neurological conditions, even if I consider that his execution falls a bit short of his aspirations. I have seen YouTube interviews with him and I can see that he was a very warm individual and I can understand why patients would trust him with their lives. ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô is a fitting epitaph that does justice to these noble sufferers and presents a medical approach that I wish more doctors would apply."

There was also a pandemic of a, to me, much more terrifying illness. Influenza is scary because it has the potential to kill so many of the people it infects. While encephalitis lethargica killed roughly 30% of its victims, it left the survivors with a variety of movement disorders, tics, catalepsy, and so on, that left these people with existences that many might consider worse than death. In Awakenings, Dr. Oliver Sacks shares a series of case histories of people with post-encephalitis who were treated with a new ‚Äúwonder drug‚Äù called L-DOPA in the summer of 1969. This deeply human and humane series of case studies reveals the complications of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù from years of immobility and nothingness and heart-breaking after effects of L-DOPA that were sometimes worse than the patients‚Äô original conditions.

It was the first movie I cried in--a profound moment in my development. Now, over 20 years later, I've finally read the book that inspired Penny Marshall's adaptation.Oliver Sacks is a remarkable writer, especially for a physician and scientist; his prose makes his real-life characters vividly alive in my mind. His approach to this book was unique, especially in 1973 when it was first published. It is essentially a series of medical case-histories, but written for a popular audience. Sacks' approach was brilliant in that it retained a level of professionalism that entrenched his work with the medical community, yet it had a level of readability that made it reach far into the public. It thus raised overall levels of understanding about Parkinsonism and other broader medical issues.The application of broader medical topics to Sacks' discussion of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism is really the true genius of the book. After completing his case histories, Sacks engages in a discussion of the treatment of disease (using the patients at hand as a launching point) that calls for a revised approach to medicine for both doctors and patients. I won't go into it here, but I will say that he makes some very important and thought-provoking points. Give the book a read.I held back one star because in spite of the book's surprising readability, it still has the faint earmarks of the work of a doctor. At times the writing wanders into the clinical, at which point Sacks usually reins it in, but a bit too late. He also uses a LOT of unfamiliar medical and neurological terms that make certain parts--especially toward the beginning--difficult to understand. There is a glossary of terms in the appendix, but it is not comprehensive enough.Still, I highly recommend this. "
152,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,3,"I really enjoyed reading all the encephalitis lethargica cases in this book. It made me think of how awesome human brains are. Human brains are incredibly interesting and mysterious at the same time. Through Dr. Sacks meticulous and lyrical writing, one can tell that Dr. Sacks was a very compassionate physician. His humanity shone through his reflections on these cases, and his opinions on the health care system.This is the second book of Dr. Sacks' I have read. I haven't gotten tired of his narratives; however, his writing does drag on a bit from time to time. And the amount of footnotes in this book! It was rather distracting.The movie adaptation sort of amalgamated symptoms from different patients and made new patients out of the real ones. The movie had a more upbeat flavour to it and it eliminated many of the common (somewhat grotesque) side effects of L-DOPA, which I guess would be too disturbing for some viewers. I would recommend both the movie and the book. It's a 3-star book for me."
153,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274569-tanya,5,"After having read another Oliver Sacks book, I picked this up just because I enjoyed the 1990 movie with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. This turned out to be an amazing story. The book is about Dr. Sacks's actual experiences with a new drug and several dozen patients suffering from post-encephelatic lethargica, a form of Parkinsons. Unlike Dr. Sayer in the movie, Dr. Sacks encountered a wide variety of responses to the drug, L-dopa. In fact, every patient's response was unique although most of them followed a pattern of ""awakening, tribulation, and accommodation."" For the first 200 pages, I had a hard time putting the book down but I got somewhat bogged down in his wrap-up in the last 50. It was more difficult to understand and wasn't holding my attention, but I got through it, still with a tremendous appreciation for what he did, what these patients went through before and after the drug, and the intricate workings of the human brain. "
154,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93853-simon,4,"More engrossing than the fact that Dr. Oliver Sacks' 'extinct volcanoes' (post-encephalitic patients) 'awoke' after having received L-Dopa are the reports of how these patients coped with their individual ""eruptions."" Despite having their 'higher faculties' (intelligence, judgment, humor) undisturbed by their crippling illnesses, most patients emerged gloriously from years of 'Sleeping Sickness' only to relapse - forcing either a troublesome accommodation to 'side effects' or a complete pre-dopa reversion. Worse yet was the inevitable addiction patients suffered to L-Dopa, despite Sacks' efforts to 'titrate' their medications and 'balance' their hyperbolic states. Though repetitive in their lessons, the book's numerous prologues and epilogues provide sufficient background on Parkinson's Disease, the 'Sleeping Sickness', Western medicine, and the patients' fates to round out the story."

And there's a reason. I was deeply affected by the case studies in this book, and you can see Sacks' wonder show through on the pages.On the down side, it contains too many footnotes, many of which are random tangents to the subject. I ended up skipping about 1/3 of them to keep the cohesion of the narrative.It's worth reading the voluminous appendices. The basic story of the L-Dopa trial on post-encephalitic patients is a pretty depressing one, all told. But subsequent advances that Sacks describes in the later versions gives the whole thing a great note of triumph. "

After reading ""Hallucinations"" I decided to settle in and finally read this one. It took a while to get into it--up until the case studies--then it took off. Amazing, beautiful, heart-breaking, strange--some of the stories read like horror fiction. This edition of the book is also odd (I don't know if there's a newer one): there are so many footnotes added that it's like there's a separate book in fine print running along the bottom of almost every page. Some footnotes go one for several pages, almost David Foster Wallace-like. I'll try to read/re-read more of his books this year."

Sacks' descriptions of the people he came to know in the hospital and of how the disabling symptoms of the disease affected the course of their lives was so heartrending that I couldn't get past the first couple of patient accounts. The book, first published in 1973, is incredibly relevant today because of how thoroughly Sacks chronicles the false hope of the ""miracle drug"" L-DOPA, and in doing so highlights the very currrent headlines regarding drug companies and their practices.

160,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10555108-christie,3,"I love Oliver Sacks and this is an interesting topic; however, compared to the other books that I've read by him, this one feels a little over-written, as though he is trying too hard to establish his perspective and literary style. In historical context (considering the pushback from the academic neuroscience community) this makes sense, but to me, it made the book a less enjoyable read than his others (like Hallucinations, or The Man who mistook his wife for a hat). I would still recommend this book for the wonderfully descriptive case studies, but I have to admit that I gave up on many of the footnotes and ended up skimming a lot of the final commentary."

I have no medical knowledge at all, yet Sacks brings me to an understanding of complex physical conditions,such is the power of his prose and conviction.What is really affecting is his insistence on the patient being a person, not just a study.

That illness then gets replace with another coping mechanism, which we call a side effect. The greatest value from this book comes from the reminder that we are whole beings with experiences and unmet needs that cannot be met with the addition of a drug or drugs. Here are some notes that I jotted down while reading.One third of the way through the book, in every case so far Oliver Sacks increased the does to 3 grams/day and saw bizarre symptoms (problems were sometimes there before the dose increase). It made me wonder if a smaller dose might have been more effective. But no, getting the dosage right was a balancing act that tended to get more difficult after the patient had been on L-DOPA for a while.Lucy K was lucid for one day. Even increasing the dose to 5 grams/day did not bring her back. She died 2 years later. Several patients had a similar response: They tried the medicine that brought back some normalcy, found life still unacceptable, got discouraged and wasted away‚ÄúWe rationalize, we dissimilate, we pretend: we pretend that modern medicine is a rational science, all facts, no nonsense, and just what it seems. But we have only to tap it‚Äôs glossy veneer for it to split wide open, and revealed to us it‚Äôs roots and foundations, it‚Äôs old dark heart of metaphysics, mysticism, magic, and myth.‚Äù (Page 28-29 of 408)Miriam H at almost halfway through the book told the Dr. to resume L-DOPA and she wouldn‚Äôt have complications. He did and she continued to function well on it. Some other patients also correctly told how their future health would go.‚ÄúShe goes mad in your madhouse because she is shut off from life.‚Äù (Page 160)Some of his patients develop Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms early in life, others in their 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs.Footnote 88: ‚ÄúLife changes, powerful emotions, cannot only exacerbate, but can precipitate parkinsonism. ‚Ä¶ it has been shown that dopamine levels may be reduced in the brain by 30-50% without producing any clinical symptoms; but that if it is reduced still further, to less than 20% of normal, parkinsonian symptoms promptly appear. (Pages 191-193, yes, an extended footnote)‚ÄúIn the sixteenth month on L-DOPA ... (Mr. E‚Äôs return) to Mount Carmel Hospital ... caused a wave of apprehension among the seventy other Parkinsonian patients receiving L-DOPA.

Managed to achieve some level of a normal life with or without L-Dopa.Being trapped in the Parkinsonian state was described as: ‚Äòa mixture of nagging and pushing and pressure, with being held back and constrained and stopped. ... The absence is a terrible isolation and coldness and shrinking - more than you can imagine, Dr. Sacks ... a bottomless darkness and unreality. ... a sort of total calmness a nothingness, which is by no means unpleasant.

One observes this even in out-patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease, ... and may be considerably in excess of ‚Äònormal‚Äô needs;‚Äù (Page 268-269)The L-DOPA experiment wasn‚Äôt as dire as I understood it to be before I read the book. ‚ÄúWe still have more than fifty survivors at Mount Carmel, most of whom require, and are maintained on, L-DOPA.‚Äù (Page 278)Contact with other humans is crucial. ‚ÄúMany a Parkinsonian cannot walk by himself ... yet he may walk perfectly if there is someone with him.‚Äù (Page 281)"
171,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"My 4th book from Sacks and it didn't disappoint. It tells the story of Sack's patients affected with either Parkinson or most often encephalitis lethargica, also known as sleeping sickness, which resembles Parkinsonism, with perhaps somewhat more severe symptoms. While the disease is known more for its motor symptoms, like bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity of the limbs, and postural instability, it also impacts mood and cognition. People become speechless and motionless as if their ""soul"" has left. The book brilliantly captures the lives and the experiences of these patients, and how they experience the world and themselves. The disease causes the death of cells in the substantia nigra (a region of the midbrain), which makes it not being able to have sufficient dopamine, which is largely responsible for motivational salience (motivation that elicits behaviour). In the 1950s and 60s, L-Dopa appeared as a treatment for Parkinsonism. Unlikely dopamine itself, it could pass the blood-brain barrier, increasing dopamine concentrations. The book describes Sack's experience with this treatment on his patients. As Parkinsonism progresses, people become more and more ""shutdown"", losing touch with reality and increasingly self-absorbed into a reality of nothingness. With L-dopa, however, most seem to experience an ""awakening"", and hence the title of the book. That awakening being extreme enough that sometimes people were miraculously cured, having little or no symptoms of Parkinsonism. Reading the stories of these patients, re-emerging into the world, and being cured almost overnight, feels like reading a novel. However, this miracle soon becomes apparent that this is indeed the real world, and while L-Dopa has recovered the souls of many patients, it's not always the case, and it's not free of complications. While a lack of dopamine causes a trance-like state, L-Dopa often seemed to cause an excess... of everything. Both motor and neurological. Rigidity is replaced by spontaneous irregular ticks, and cognition now seems to be in a pathological and permanent overdrive. Throughout the book, Sacks gives the stories of his patients and how they reacted to L-Dopa. When everything went right, when everything went wrong, and anything in between. An exploration of Parkinsonism, the hidden biological nature of behaviour, and as with all of Sack's books, an exploration of humanity. This book is a unique experience, and there are many things one can gain from it. Perhaps one that most stuck with me is how little we understand about the brain. How far away we are from making reliable predictions and being humble about its complexity and unpredictability, which Sacks tries to connect to chaos theory in one of the last chapters, being a new field at the time. I was constantly amazed at how in most of the stories, the reactions make almost no sense at all. One hopes that we finally achieved understanding. That we have a cure, and we can predict its outcome. But we can't. The massive amount of variance in relationship to L-Dopa, not only between patients, but in the same patient, and how often logic gets thrown out of the window, is baffling. I was also perplexed at how often psychology, in a more layman's terms, seemed to infiltrate neurology. This is supposedly a field rooted in biology, in objectivity. Yet, it's clear that a more subjective, personal, and human aspect of it remains. It's a painful reminder of our ignorance, and likely our flawed division of biological and psychological approaches. Awakenings is definitely Sack's magnum opus. A classic of neurology and I'd argue of the best non-fiction books ever written."
172,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1347421-diem,5,"The first time I watched the film version of ""Awakenings"" was probably in 1991. I would have been about 20 and it would have been about 6 years since my father's mind and body had been ravaged by a catastrophic stroke. Six years is a long time and time enough to adjust to a new life with a new kind of father but it was too soon to see the movie. There is a scene in which a woman is visiting the hospital to see her father and has lunch with Leonard, the character played by the incomparable Robert De Niro. She says this: ""Sometimes I think I see something. I think I see a change. And for a moment, I see him like he was before the stroke. And then it's gone. And I'm not sure that I saw anything."" Because of this scene and the fantasy wish fulfillment of neurologically impaired patients awakening from their affliction, I was heartbroken by the movie and remained so for months after seeing it. Fast forward 25-ish years and watching the movie with my teenaged daughter. While still deeply moved by the film, my soul wasn't crushed by it and I became intensely curious about the real story. Having just listened to Dr. Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" I was prepared for how scholarly and clinical his writing can be. Many people lament his clinical vernacular but I find that part easy enough to piece together. I have a layman's familiarity with neurology. That combined with a basic understanding of prefixes and suffixes can go a long way. If you understand hyperkinesia then akinesia should present no challenge. What bewildered and amazed me were his references to the great minds of a multitude of disciplines. He either quoted or referenced: Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Hume, Schopenhauer, John Donne, Dali, Kant, Leibniz. And this is a truncated list. It is also important that no lesser minds than these informed both his writing and his work in the field of neurology. He addresses this importance in the chapter where he speaks of how fundamentally important it is to science to never neglect or abandon the ontological in pursuit of the purely empirical. This is his appeal, in my opinion, to all of the STEM obsessed students of today to enrich their education with the study of philosophy, art, music, literature and history. This need to be well acquainted with the whole world of human experience is poignantly illustrated by how critical HIS knowledge of such was to his work with post-encephalitic patients who challenged any previously understood notions of being and existence. Many of these victims of the ""Sleepy Sickness"" of the 1920s had been in a state of seeming frozen catatonia for 40 years. And yet, upon being administered the drug L-Dopa they were able to report, in clear and compelling language, that they had been conscious and aware the entire time. The clinical picture can only get you so far in your understanding of this phenomenon. If knowing that this nightmarish existence can occur outside the realm fairytales and sci-fi novels doesn't keep you awake for at least a few extra minutes, then you're doing science wrong. Some of my daymares involve memories of my father in the early years after his stroke trying to talk to us from his wheelchair. He would get started okay but then his brain would jam, almost visibly, and his mouth already contorted by right-side paralysis would contort even more grotesquely. Then garbled, ghoulish sounds would erupt from him where he clearly intended words to be. He would stop and start again several times to no avail and not infrequently this process would end with him punching the air with his left fist and screaming through angry tears, ""I know! Dammit! I know! But I can't say it!""I imagine that now, after reading Awakenings. But I imagine Leonard screaming and punching the air in only his mind. And with no one to hear him say it. And with no one even knowing he thought it. Because while he was screaming and punching in his mind, his body was frozen and his eyes glassy and vacant. It haunts me. The stories, beautifully presented case studies, from the hospital are gripping. Sacks presents each study in a, yes, deeply clinical way but also in a deeply personal way. Each 'case' is a fully fleshed out person with a backstory and a personality and a family. Not always a nice personality and not always a nice family, but this is a real story. I was deeply appreciative of how sensitive Sacks was in making each patient fully human. It was particularly important to me because my father spent several months, in a rehabilitative hospital once he left the regular hospital. He was on the head trauma floor and I remember my first visit there in flashes of great detail. The way the floor was more tightly secured than the regular hospital had been and the way my mother warned me before I went in, that it might be upsetting. What she was referring to, I quickly found out, was that unlike the regular hospital the head trauma ward could be loud. Very loud.At the time that my father was admitted, there was a patient on the floor that spent much of the day screaming. I don't recall him screaming anything in particular. Just his rage filled screaming as if he were in terrible pain. I do not remember what had happened to him but I have never forgotten his screaming. My father shared his room with a quiet young man named William who was not in the room the first time I visited. But he was there the next day when my mother dropped me off to sit with my dad for a few hours while she did some errands. I walked into the room and he sat up suddenly and said, ""Wow. You're so pretty.""No one under the age of 37 had ever told me I was pretty. I didn't have the kind of look that appealed to young people of that time. I was always popular with older men and could have dated any number of my dad's friends or my friend's dads had I been inclined that way. But I wasn't. Anyway, it wasn't lost on me that the first person within 10 years of my own age to tell me I was pretty was in the hospital for severe head trauma. William had been in a motorcycle accident and he was clearly in very bad shape. He had suffered considerable brain damage but seemed cheerfully unaware of it. Over the next few weeks I would meet his parents and his fianc√©e and they got used to me sitting in a corner, watching my dad sleep or stare blankly at the television. So used to me that I become the unwitting witness to a moment so private and awful that I recall it like it has just happened. William's fiancee was visiting. She was sitting in the chair right in front of the room's one large window. She was a young woman, early 20s, with puffy blonde hair. William sat next to her in his wheelchair. They were holding hands and she was trying to talk to him and he was being silly. But not in a cute way. In a disjointed, childish way. She suddenly stopped talking and her whole body visibly crumpled into itself. Her head sagged forward and her shoulders heaved but she remained absolutely silent. William suddenly stopped being silly. He wheeled closer and wrapped his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Please don't cry. Don't cry. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. I'm going to get better."" But, if William believed what he was saying, he was the only one. I was only 16 but I knew in that moment that she knew it wasn't going to be okay and William wasn't going to get better. I felt like I had just witnessed the moment that two lives had been violently and horribly changed forever. Two lives spectacularly but quietly exploding in front of a hospital window on a sunny afternoon.So, what I took away from that horrible episode and what I carry with me every time I visit or even pass a hospital is that every single window represents a set of lives and stories that will break your heart if you listen to them. And someone needs to listen to them. And that someone might as well be a physician. And that physician was Dr. Sacks. And he left us this book and this book is asking us to start caring about the stories. And it is especially asking doctors to start caring about the stories. I mean, it is doing a lot of other things too. It is too appalling that Sacks has written this tremendous book of a million layers and all I'm going to say about it is that I liked it and I think anyone considering going into medicine should read it. But, there are other reviews and my kids are asking to be fed. Read the book. "
173,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633038-jesse-field,4,"As Doris Lessing‚Äôs blurb on the paperback says, ‚ÄúIt makes you aware of what a knife-edge we live on.‚Äù The edge between functional cognition and severe pathology that calls into question what selfhood even means. Also the edge between fitting into society, more or less, and being rejected by it fully, as so many of us have worried over.I took in the narratives of the patients all at once, a rush of reading that leaves one harrowed, bemused, and, God help me, almost bored by the end. In the introduction and conclusion, Sacks‚Äô ability to squeeze such incredible meaning from his narrative drag me back to attention. The effective and anticipated climax was a brief questioning of the nature of scientific truth-seeking, a theme ever-present in this text:We have spoken of the Parkinsonian as ‚Äòlost in space and time,‚Äô and as harbouring a ‚Äòchaos of broken clocks and rulers.‚Äô One might say that these are Kantian formulations of his state, for they correspond with the central Kantian notion that space and time are the essential forms of experience, that space and time (or, rather, the sense of space and time) are ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô of the organism or mind. Thus, where we spoke previously of a relativistic or Einsteinian delirium, we might now, even more fundamentally, speak of a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô delirium ‚Äì and ultimate akinesia as being ‚ÄòaKantia.‚ÄôIf Kant, in his first Critique, dealt with space and time as the essential (‚Äòa priori synthetic‚Äô) forms of the experience (and thus of perception and motion), he deals in his other Critiques with agency, the will, ‚ÄòI‚Äô (and as ‚ÄòI‚Äô being defined by its will ‚Äì ‚ÄòVolo ergo sum‚Äô). Thus the considerations we have been impelled to require all of Kant‚Äôs thought.Are such considerations outside the proper domain of ‚Äòscience‚Äô? They are outside the science, for this not only denies the ideal forms of experience, but disallows any ‚Äòpersonal identity.‚Äô But they point, or so I believe, to a greater and more generous conception of ‚Äòscience,‚Äô which can embrace all the phenomena we have discussed. Such a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô science, I think, is the science of the future.Thus, in what might appear an extraordinarily small field ‚Äì the study and treatment of post-encephalitic patients ‚Äì we find unexpectedly vast vistas emerging. We see before us, in exemplary form, the thrilling shapes of the medicine of the future, a perfectly rational yet practical scientific medicine, and an utterly beautiful and elemental ‚Äòexistential‚Äô medicine.Despite the rush of epiphany feeling generated in this passage, however, turning back to re-read leaves us as unsatisfied as when we review and write down our dreams. What position, or role, does the Will have from the second and third Critiques? Was Schopenhauer on the right track? Sacks merely grazes the surface of something here, then takes on the mantle of the logical positivist, preaching of a better future, even when the conflicts of his own humanity and the troubled history of Mt. Carmel Hospital would seem to indicate something less sanguine. Oh well. The work remains a powerful crossover from ethnographic narrative to dramatic production. And in what other story collection can we learn words like ‚Äúoculogyria,‚Äù ‚Äúpalilalia,‚Äù and ‚Äúfestinating.‚Äù One worries only slightly that we‚Äôve all made a circus of the patients, for it seems okay as long as we remember, we are part of the circus, too."
174,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035284-brian-bess,4,"When the sleepers wakeWhen I saw the 1990 film ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô, with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, I knew that lurking beneath the sentimentalized story was a more powerful one that could have been accepted as science fiction if it had occurred even a couple of decades earlier. What happened in 1969, at Mount Carmel Hospital (the fictionalized hospital where Oliver Sacks was a resident neurologist) was an extraordinary sequence of events impacting dozens of victims of sleeping-sickness aka encephalitis lethargica. These patients had varying degrees of affliction occurring in the wake of the influenza epidemic that swept the country in 1918, some virtually catatonic, others alternately lucid and stable, most experiencing tics, tremors, palsy and various manifestations of the Parkinson-like illness. Following the medical hype surrounding L-DOPA, then seen as a miracle drug, many of these patients were administered the drug and virtually all of them reacted to it in powerfully dramatic ways. Some were jolted out of a decades long sleep. For example, Rose R., had been in this comatose state since 1926 and was severely traumatized to realize that over 40 years of her life were gone and that she had awakened to a world of the future. Rose knew that it was 1969 but just wished that it were 1926. Each of the patients reacted in a wholly unique way, reinforcing Sacks‚Äô belief that too much of the emphasis of modern medicine has been placed on a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô therapy that is assumed to work the same way every time in every circumstance. He contends that modern medicine has dehumanized patients and reduced them to numbers and statistics on a massive medical chart. Just as each of us have unique personalities, so each of us have unique biological and psychological compositions that results in each person reacting to uniform stimuli and medication differently.Sacks structures the book in a way that illustrates his therapeutic philosophy. His introduction provides historical background on the sleeping sickness that afflicted a large number of people during the 1920‚Äôs, along with explanations of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Parkinsonism, the institutional structure of Mount Carmel and the emergence of L-DOPA‚Äôs use. The next section is a collection of case studies, narratives of the experiences of 20 of the patients that were given the drug at Mount Carmel in 1969. The third, ‚ÄòPerspectives‚Äô provides conclusions and commonality in the arc of the trajectory common to most of the patients as they improved, then reverted in response to varying dosages of L-DOPA. His epilogue follows what happened to each of the 20 patients in subsequent years after the initial book publication. In essence, he is providing the medical foundation of the story, followed by individual narratives, followed by therapeutic and philosophic conclusions. As he states:‚ÄúRunning throughout the book is a metaphysical theme‚Äîthe notion that it is insufficient to consider disease in purely mechanical or chemical terms; that it must be considered equally in biological or metaphysical terms, i.e., in terms of organization and design.‚ÄùWhat ensues is a book that has a split personality. We are reading psychological ‚Äòcase histories‚Äô, complete with medical jargon and terminology for describing symptoms (a glossary of medical terms is supplied) alternating with Sacks‚Äô very subjective rendering of the personalities of the patients along with his personal assessments. He includes quotes from poets ranging from John Donne to T.S. Eliot and allows himself to wax poetic and go on philosophic tangents with references to Leibniz and Kant. Just as he fictionalizes Beth Abraham Hospital where he worked into Mount Carmel, he presumably uses fictitious names for his 20 patients i.e. Rose R., Frances D., Aaron E., Leonard L. This personalization is at odds with his formal referral to them throughout their section as Mr. L., Miss I., etc. Although he attempts to treat each of them as unique cases, most of them begin to run together, with a few standing out as more distinct and memorable. Some of these patients are quite articulate. Rose R., for example, describes her condition:‚ÄúOnce I get going I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like being caught between mirrors, or echoes, or something. Or being caught on a merry-go-round which won‚Äôt come to a stop.‚ÄùHe concludes his case histories with Leonard L., the character so movingly portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film. Leonard is the most literate and literary patient on the ward. During the times when he had ownership of his faculties he would write brilliant book reviews. Sacks admits that he learned more from Leonard than from any other patient he ever had and that he deserves a book to himself. Leonard had intermittent times until his thirties when he was somewhat functional. He was always a compulsive reader and would continue reading even when he was otherwise unable to communicate. He experienced a particularly codependent relationship with his mother. His mother needed to be needed as much or more than he needed her. His reaction to L-DOPA was particularly erratic. He became vitalized, filled with curiosity and awe with everything at first, feeling compelled to suck the marrow out of every bit of life he encountered. This tipped over into compulsive and destructive tendencies as he became overly sexual, accosting nurses and staff to the point when he was physically rebuffed, considering himself a new messiah, expounding the gospel of L-DOPA. He would masturbate compulsively or he would write his autobiography for 12 to 15 hours a day. He was particularly tragic in that he was aware of what was happening to him and that he was teetering out of balance into a chaotic unknown. He articulated the dilemma of all the patients when he wrote at the end of his autobiography, ‚ÄúI am a living candle. I am consumed that you may learn. New things will be seen in the light of my suffering.‚Äù Leonard is the tragic Hamlet of this tale. He obviously moved Oliver Sacks and he was the most relatable character for me.I commend Oliver Sacks for his very humane, compassionate approach to these patients, which he considers extraordinarily courageous and tenacious. I applaud his approach toward treating pathologic neurological conditions, even if I consider that his execution falls a bit short of his aspirations. I have seen YouTube interviews with him and I can see that he was a very warm individual and I can understand why patients would trust him with their lives. ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô is a fitting epitaph that does justice to these noble sufferers and presents a medical approach that I wish more doctors would apply."

There was also a pandemic of a, to me, much more terrifying illness. Influenza is scary because it has the potential to kill so many of the people it infects. While encephalitis lethargica killed roughly 30% of its victims, it left the survivors with a variety of movement disorders, tics, catalepsy, and so on, that left these people with existences that many might consider worse than death. In Awakenings, Dr. Oliver Sacks shares a series of case histories of people with post-encephalitis who were treated with a new ‚Äúwonder drug‚Äù called L-DOPA in the summer of 1969. This deeply human and humane series of case studies reveals the complications of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù from years of immobility and nothingness and heart-breaking after effects of L-DOPA that were sometimes worse than the patients‚Äô original conditions.

It was the first movie I cried in--a profound moment in my development. Now, over 20 years later, I've finally read the book that inspired Penny Marshall's adaptation.Oliver Sacks is a remarkable writer, especially for a physician and scientist; his prose makes his real-life characters vividly alive in my mind. His approach to this book was unique, especially in 1973 when it was first published. It is essentially a series of medical case-histories, but written for a popular audience. Sacks' approach was brilliant in that it retained a level of professionalism that entrenched his work with the medical community, yet it had a level of readability that made it reach far into the public. It thus raised overall levels of understanding about Parkinsonism and other broader medical issues.The application of broader medical topics to Sacks' discussion of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism is really the true genius of the book. After completing his case histories, Sacks engages in a discussion of the treatment of disease (using the patients at hand as a launching point) that calls for a revised approach to medicine for both doctors and patients. I won't go into it here, but I will say that he makes some very important and thought-provoking points. Give the book a read.I held back one star because in spite of the book's surprising readability, it still has the faint earmarks of the work of a doctor. At times the writing wanders into the clinical, at which point Sacks usually reins it in, but a bit too late. He also uses a LOT of unfamiliar medical and neurological terms that make certain parts--especially toward the beginning--difficult to understand. There is a glossary of terms in the appendix, but it is not comprehensive enough.Still, I highly recommend this. "
182,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,3,"I really enjoyed reading all the encephalitis lethargica cases in this book. It made me think of how awesome human brains are. Human brains are incredibly interesting and mysterious at the same time. Through Dr. Sacks meticulous and lyrical writing, one can tell that Dr. Sacks was a very compassionate physician. His humanity shone through his reflections on these cases, and his opinions on the health care system.This is the second book of Dr. Sacks' I have read. I haven't gotten tired of his narratives; however, his writing does drag on a bit from time to time. And the amount of footnotes in this book! It was rather distracting.The movie adaptation sort of amalgamated symptoms from different patients and made new patients out of the real ones. The movie had a more upbeat flavour to it and it eliminated many of the common (somewhat grotesque) side effects of L-DOPA, which I guess would be too disturbing for some viewers. I would recommend both the movie and the book. It's a 3-star book for me."
183,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274569-tanya,5,"After having read another Oliver Sacks book, I picked this up just because I enjoyed the 1990 movie with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. This turned out to be an amazing story. The book is about Dr. Sacks's actual experiences with a new drug and several dozen patients suffering from post-encephelatic lethargica, a form of Parkinsons. Unlike Dr. Sayer in the movie, Dr. Sacks encountered a wide variety of responses to the drug, L-dopa. In fact, every patient's response was unique although most of them followed a pattern of ""awakening, tribulation, and accommodation."" For the first 200 pages, I had a hard time putting the book down but I got somewhat bogged down in his wrap-up in the last 50. It was more difficult to understand and wasn't holding my attention, but I got through it, still with a tremendous appreciation for what he did, what these patients went through before and after the drug, and the intricate workings of the human brain. "
184,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93853-simon,4,"More engrossing than the fact that Dr. Oliver Sacks' 'extinct volcanoes' (post-encephalitic patients) 'awoke' after having received L-Dopa are the reports of how these patients coped with their individual ""eruptions."" Despite having their 'higher faculties' (intelligence, judgment, humor) undisturbed by their crippling illnesses, most patients emerged gloriously from years of 'Sleeping Sickness' only to relapse - forcing either a troublesome accommodation to 'side effects' or a complete pre-dopa reversion. Worse yet was the inevitable addiction patients suffered to L-Dopa, despite Sacks' efforts to 'titrate' their medications and 'balance' their hyperbolic states. Though repetitive in their lessons, the book's numerous prologues and epilogues provide sufficient background on Parkinson's Disease, the 'Sleeping Sickness', Western medicine, and the patients' fates to round out the story."
185,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,5,"This is clearly Sacks' piece de resistence, and you can tell because it's been through a half-dozen editions, all of which bear significant revisions and new footnotes. And there's a reason. I was deeply affected by the case studies in this book, and you can see Sacks' wonder show through on the pages.On the down side, it contains too many footnotes, many of which are random tangents to the subject. I ended up skipping about 1/3 of them to keep the cohesion of the narrative.It's worth reading the voluminous appendices. The basic story of the L-Dopa trial on post-encephalitic patients is a pretty depressing one, all told. But subsequent advances that Sacks describes in the later versions gives the whole thing a great note of triumph. "

After reading ""Hallucinations"" I decided to settle in and finally read this one. It took a while to get into it--up until the case studies--then it took off. Amazing, beautiful, heart-breaking, strange--some of the stories read like horror fiction. This edition of the book is also odd (I don't know if there's a newer one): there are so many footnotes added that it's like there's a separate book in fine print running along the bottom of almost every page. Some footnotes go one for several pages, almost David Foster Wallace-like. I'll try to read/re-read more of his books this year."

""One sees that beautiful and ultimate metaphysical truth, which has been stated by poets and physicians and metaphysicians in all ages- by Leibniz and Donne and Dante and Freud: that Eros is the oldest and strongest if the gods; that Love is the alpha and omega of being; and that the work of healing, of rendering whole, is, first and last, the business of Love."""

Oliver Sacks was not as easy to understand as he is in the fantastic The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.Although the epidemic that these people experienced in the early twentieth century appears to be as mysteriously gone as it was mysterious begin, I believe we need to be aware of the past and to remember the people who endured its hardships. Moreover, we do well to remember how fragile our lives and health are and live with gratitude. We, too, are not immune to future ""plagues.""

Sacks' descriptions of the people he came to know in the hospital and of how the disabling symptoms of the disease affected the course of their lives was so heartrending that I couldn't get past the first couple of patient accounts. The book, first published in 1973, is incredibly relevant today because of how thoroughly Sacks chronicles the false hope of the ""miracle drug"" L-DOPA, and in doing so highlights the very currrent headlines regarding drug companies and their practices.

In historical context (considering the pushback from the academic neuroscience community) this makes sense, but to me, it made the book a less enjoyable read than his others (like Hallucinations, or The Man who mistook his wife for a hat). I would still recommend this book for the wonderfully descriptive case studies, but I have to admit that I gave up on many of the footnotes and ended up skimming a lot of the final commentary."

That illness then gets replace with another coping mechanism, which we call a side effect. The greatest value from this book comes from the reminder that we are whole beings with experiences and unmet needs that cannot be met with the addition of a drug or drugs. Here are some notes that I jotted down while reading.One third of the way through the book, in every case so far Oliver Sacks increased the does to 3 grams/day and saw bizarre symptoms (problems were sometimes there before the dose increase). It made me wonder if a smaller dose might have been more effective. But no, getting the dosage right was a balancing act that tended to get more difficult after the patient had been on L-DOPA for a while.Lucy K was lucid for one day. Even increasing the dose to 5 grams/day did not bring her back. She died 2 years later. Several patients had a similar response: They tried the medicine that brought back some normalcy, found life still unacceptable, got discouraged and wasted away‚ÄúWe rationalize, we dissimilate, we pretend: we pretend that modern medicine is a rational science, all facts, no nonsense, and just what it seems. But we have only to tap it‚Äôs glossy veneer for it to split wide open, and revealed to us it‚Äôs roots and foundations, it‚Äôs old dark heart of metaphysics, mysticism, magic, and myth.‚Äù (Page 28-29 of 408)Miriam H at almost halfway through the book told the Dr. to resume L-DOPA and she wouldn‚Äôt have complications. He did and she continued to function well on it. Some other patients also correctly told how their future health would go.‚ÄúShe goes mad in your madhouse because she is shut off from life.‚Äù (Page 160)Some of his patients develop Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms early in life, others in their 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs.Footnote 88: ‚ÄúLife changes, powerful emotions, cannot only exacerbate, but can precipitate parkinsonism. ‚Ä¶ it has been shown that dopamine levels may be reduced in the brain by 30-50% without producing any clinical symptoms; but that if it is reduced still further, to less than 20% of normal, parkinsonian symptoms promptly appear. (Pages 191-193, yes, an extended footnote)‚ÄúIn the sixteenth month on L-DOPA ... (Mr. E‚Äôs return) to Mount Carmel Hospital ... caused a wave of apprehension among the seventy other Parkinsonian patients receiving L-DOPA. They had seen Mr. E. leave in triumph, and now they saw his tragic return.‚Äù (Page 196)A number of patients, including Mr. E. Managed to achieve some level of a normal life with or without L-Dopa.Being trapped in the Parkinsonian state was described as: ‚Äòa mixture of nagging and pushing and pressure, with being held back and constrained and stopped. ... The absence is a terrible isolation and coldness and shrinking - more than you can imagine, Dr. Sacks ... a bottomless darkness and unreality. ... a sort of total calmness a nothingness, which is by no means unpleasant. It‚Äôs a letup from the torture. ... it‚Äôs something like death.‚Äô (Page 205)L-DOPA crosses the protective blood‚Äìbrain barrier, whereas dopamine itself cannot.[4]Thus, l-DOPA is used to increase dopamine concentrations in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia.

201,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"My 4th book from Sacks and it didn't disappoint. It tells the story of Sack's patients affected with either Parkinson or most often encephalitis lethargica, also known as sleeping sickness, which resembles Parkinsonism, with perhaps somewhat more severe symptoms. While the disease is known more for its motor symptoms, like bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity of the limbs, and postural instability, it also impacts mood and cognition. People become speechless and motionless as if their ""soul"" has left. The book brilliantly captures the lives and the experiences of these patients, and how they experience the world and themselves. The disease causes the death of cells in the substantia nigra (a region of the midbrain), which makes it not being able to have sufficient dopamine, which is largely responsible for motivational salience (motivation that elicits behaviour). In the 1950s and 60s, L-Dopa appeared as a treatment for Parkinsonism. Unlikely dopamine itself, it could pass the blood-brain barrier, increasing dopamine concentrations. The book describes Sack's experience with this treatment on his patients. As Parkinsonism progresses, people become more and more ""shutdown"", losing touch with reality and increasingly self-absorbed into a reality of nothingness. With L-dopa, however, most seem to experience an ""awakening"", and hence the title of the book. That awakening being extreme enough that sometimes people were miraculously cured, having little or no symptoms of Parkinsonism. Reading the stories of these patients, re-emerging into the world, and being cured almost overnight, feels like reading a novel. However, this miracle soon becomes apparent that this is indeed the real world, and while L-Dopa has recovered the souls of many patients, it's not always the case, and it's not free of complications. While a lack of dopamine causes a trance-like state, L-Dopa often seemed to cause an excess... of everything. Both motor and neurological. Rigidity is replaced by spontaneous irregular ticks, and cognition now seems to be in a pathological and permanent overdrive. Throughout the book, Sacks gives the stories of his patients and how they reacted to L-Dopa. When everything went right, when everything went wrong, and anything in between. An exploration of Parkinsonism, the hidden biological nature of behaviour, and as with all of Sack's books, an exploration of humanity. This book is a unique experience, and there are many things one can gain from it. Perhaps one that most stuck with me is how little we understand about the brain. How far away we are from making reliable predictions and being humble about its complexity and unpredictability, which Sacks tries to connect to chaos theory in one of the last chapters, being a new field at the time. I was constantly amazed at how in most of the stories, the reactions make almost no sense at all. One hopes that we finally achieved understanding. That we have a cure, and we can predict its outcome. But we can't. The massive amount of variance in relationship to L-Dopa, not only between patients, but in the same patient, and how often logic gets thrown out of the window, is baffling. I was also perplexed at how often psychology, in a more layman's terms, seemed to infiltrate neurology. This is supposedly a field rooted in biology, in objectivity. Yet, it's clear that a more subjective, personal, and human aspect of it remains. It's a painful reminder of our ignorance, and likely our flawed division of biological and psychological approaches. Awakenings is definitely Sack's magnum opus. A classic of neurology and I'd argue of the best non-fiction books ever written."
202,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1347421-diem,5,"The first time I watched the film version of ""Awakenings"" was probably in 1991. I would have been about 20 and it would have been about 6 years since my father's mind and body had been ravaged by a catastrophic stroke. Six years is a long time and time enough to adjust to a new life with a new kind of father but it was too soon to see the movie. There is a scene in which a woman is visiting the hospital to see her father and has lunch with Leonard, the character played by the incomparable Robert De Niro. She says this: ""Sometimes I think I see something. I think I see a change. And for a moment, I see him like he was before the stroke. And then it's gone. And I'm not sure that I saw anything."" Because of this scene and the fantasy wish fulfillment of neurologically impaired patients awakening from their affliction, I was heartbroken by the movie and remained so for months after seeing it. Fast forward 25-ish years and watching the movie with my teenaged daughter. While still deeply moved by the film, my soul wasn't crushed by it and I became intensely curious about the real story. Having just listened to Dr. Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" I was prepared for how scholarly and clinical his writing can be. Many people lament his clinical vernacular but I find that part easy enough to piece together. I have a layman's familiarity with neurology. That combined with a basic understanding of prefixes and suffixes can go a long way. If you understand hyperkinesia then akinesia should present no challenge. What bewildered and amazed me were his references to the great minds of a multitude of disciplines. He either quoted or referenced: Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Hume, Schopenhauer, John Donne, Dali, Kant, Leibniz. And this is a truncated list. It is also important that no lesser minds than these informed both his writing and his work in the field of neurology. He addresses this importance in the chapter where he speaks of how fundamentally important it is to science to never neglect or abandon the ontological in pursuit of the purely empirical. This is his appeal, in my opinion, to all of the STEM obsessed students of today to enrich their education with the study of philosophy, art, music, literature and history. This need to be well acquainted with the whole world of human experience is poignantly illustrated by how critical HIS knowledge of such was to his work with post-encephalitic patients who challenged any previously understood notions of being and existence. Many of these victims of the ""Sleepy Sickness"" of the 1920s had been in a state of seeming frozen catatonia for 40 years. And yet, upon being administered the drug L-Dopa they were able to report, in clear and compelling language, that they had been conscious and aware the entire time. The clinical picture can only get you so far in your understanding of this phenomenon. If knowing that this nightmarish existence can occur outside the realm fairytales and sci-fi novels doesn't keep you awake for at least a few extra minutes, then you're doing science wrong. Some of my daymares involve memories of my father in the early years after his stroke trying to talk to us from his wheelchair. He would get started okay but then his brain would jam, almost visibly, and his mouth already contorted by right-side paralysis would contort even more grotesquely. Then garbled, ghoulish sounds would erupt from him where he clearly intended words to be. He would stop and start again several times to no avail and not infrequently this process would end with him punching the air with his left fist and screaming through angry tears, ""I know! Dammit! I know! But I can't say it!""I imagine that now, after reading Awakenings. But I imagine Leonard screaming and punching the air in only his mind. And with no one to hear him say it. And with no one even knowing he thought it. Because while he was screaming and punching in his mind, his body was frozen and his eyes glassy and vacant. It haunts me. The stories, beautifully presented case studies, from the hospital are gripping. Sacks presents each study in a, yes, deeply clinical way but also in a deeply personal way. Each 'case' is a fully fleshed out person with a backstory and a personality and a family. Not always a nice personality and not always a nice family, but this is a real story. I was deeply appreciative of how sensitive Sacks was in making each patient fully human. It was particularly important to me because my father spent several months, in a rehabilitative hospital once he left the regular hospital. He was on the head trauma floor and I remember my first visit there in flashes of great detail. The way the floor was more tightly secured than the regular hospital had been and the way my mother warned me before I went in, that it might be upsetting. What she was referring to, I quickly found out, was that unlike the regular hospital the head trauma ward could be loud. Very loud.At the time that my father was admitted, there was a patient on the floor that spent much of the day screaming. I don't recall him screaming anything in particular. Just his rage filled screaming as if he were in terrible pain. I do not remember what had happened to him but I have never forgotten his screaming. My father shared his room with a quiet young man named William who was not in the room the first time I visited. But he was there the next day when my mother dropped me off to sit with my dad for a few hours while she did some errands. I walked into the room and he sat up suddenly and said, ""Wow. You're so pretty.""No one under the age of 37 had ever told me I was pretty. I didn't have the kind of look that appealed to young people of that time. I was always popular with older men and could have dated any number of my dad's friends or my friend's dads had I been inclined that way. But I wasn't. Anyway, it wasn't lost on me that the first person within 10 years of my own age to tell me I was pretty was in the hospital for severe head trauma. William had been in a motorcycle accident and he was clearly in very bad shape. He had suffered considerable brain damage but seemed cheerfully unaware of it. Over the next few weeks I would meet his parents and his fianc√©e and they got used to me sitting in a corner, watching my dad sleep or stare blankly at the television. So used to me that I become the unwitting witness to a moment so private and awful that I recall it like it has just happened. William's fiancee was visiting. She was sitting in the chair right in front of the room's one large window. She was a young woman, early 20s, with puffy blonde hair. William sat next to her in his wheelchair. They were holding hands and she was trying to talk to him and he was being silly. But not in a cute way. In a disjointed, childish way. She suddenly stopped talking and her whole body visibly crumpled into itself. Her head sagged forward and her shoulders heaved but she remained absolutely silent. William suddenly stopped being silly. He wheeled closer and wrapped his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Please don't cry. Don't cry. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. I'm going to get better."" But, if William believed what he was saying, he was the only one. I was only 16 but I knew in that moment that she knew it wasn't going to be okay and William wasn't going to get better. I felt like I had just witnessed the moment that two lives had been violently and horribly changed forever. Two lives spectacularly but quietly exploding in front of a hospital window on a sunny afternoon.So, what I took away from that horrible episode and what I carry with me every time I visit or even pass a hospital is that every single window represents a set of lives and stories that will break your heart if you listen to them. And someone needs to listen to them. And that someone might as well be a physician. And that physician was Dr. Sacks. And he left us this book and this book is asking us to start caring about the stories. And it is especially asking doctors to start caring about the stories. I mean, it is doing a lot of other things too. It is too appalling that Sacks has written this tremendous book of a million layers and all I'm going to say about it is that I liked it and I think anyone considering going into medicine should read it. But, there are other reviews and my kids are asking to be fed. Read the book. "
203,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633038-jesse-field,4,"As Doris Lessing‚Äôs blurb on the paperback says, ‚ÄúIt makes you aware of what a knife-edge we live on.‚Äù The edge between functional cognition and severe pathology that calls into question what selfhood even means. Also the edge between fitting into society, more or less, and being rejected by it fully, as so many of us have worried over.I took in the narratives of the patients all at once, a rush of reading that leaves one harrowed, bemused, and, God help me, almost bored by the end. In the introduction and conclusion, Sacks‚Äô ability to squeeze such incredible meaning from his narrative drag me back to attention. The effective and anticipated climax was a brief questioning of the nature of scientific truth-seeking, a theme ever-present in this text:We have spoken of the Parkinsonian as ‚Äòlost in space and time,‚Äô and as harbouring a ‚Äòchaos of broken clocks and rulers.‚Äô One might say that these are Kantian formulations of his state, for they correspond with the central Kantian notion that space and time are the essential forms of experience, that space and time (or, rather, the sense of space and time) are ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô of the organism or mind. Thus, where we spoke previously of a relativistic or Einsteinian delirium, we might now, even more fundamentally, speak of a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô delirium ‚Äì and ultimate akinesia as being ‚ÄòaKantia.‚ÄôIf Kant, in his first Critique, dealt with space and time as the essential (‚Äòa priori synthetic‚Äô) forms of the experience (and thus of perception and motion), he deals in his other Critiques with agency, the will, ‚ÄòI‚Äô (and as ‚ÄòI‚Äô being defined by its will ‚Äì ‚ÄòVolo ergo sum‚Äô). Thus the considerations we have been impelled to require all of Kant‚Äôs thought.Are such considerations outside the proper domain of ‚Äòscience‚Äô? They are outside the science, for this not only denies the ideal forms of experience, but disallows any ‚Äòpersonal identity.‚Äô But they point, or so I believe, to a greater and more generous conception of ‚Äòscience,‚Äô which can embrace all the phenomena we have discussed. Such a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô science, I think, is the science of the future.Thus, in what might appear an extraordinarily small field ‚Äì the study and treatment of post-encephalitic patients ‚Äì we find unexpectedly vast vistas emerging. We see before us, in exemplary form, the thrilling shapes of the medicine of the future, a perfectly rational yet practical scientific medicine, and an utterly beautiful and elemental ‚Äòexistential‚Äô medicine.Despite the rush of epiphany feeling generated in this passage, however, turning back to re-read leaves us as unsatisfied as when we review and write down our dreams. What position, or role, does the Will have from the second and third Critiques? Was Schopenhauer on the right track? Sacks merely grazes the surface of something here, then takes on the mantle of the logical positivist, preaching of a better future, even when the conflicts of his own humanity and the troubled history of Mt. Carmel Hospital would seem to indicate something less sanguine. Oh well. The work remains a powerful crossover from ethnographic narrative to dramatic production. And in what other story collection can we learn words like ‚Äúoculogyria,‚Äù ‚Äúpalilalia,‚Äù and ‚Äúfestinating.‚Äù One worries only slightly that we‚Äôve all made a circus of the patients, for it seems okay as long as we remember, we are part of the circus, too."
204,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035284-brian-bess,4,"When the sleepers wakeWhen I saw the 1990 film ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô, with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, I knew that lurking beneath the sentimentalized story was a more powerful one that could have been accepted as science fiction if it had occurred even a couple of decades earlier. What happened in 1969, at Mount Carmel Hospital (the fictionalized hospital where Oliver Sacks was a resident neurologist) was an extraordinary sequence of events impacting dozens of victims of sleeping-sickness aka encephalitis lethargica. These patients had varying degrees of affliction occurring in the wake of the influenza epidemic that swept the country in 1918, some virtually catatonic, others alternately lucid and stable, most experiencing tics, tremors, palsy and various manifestations of the Parkinson-like illness. Following the medical hype surrounding L-DOPA, then seen as a miracle drug, many of these patients were administered the drug and virtually all of them reacted to it in powerfully dramatic ways. Some were jolted out of a decades long sleep. For example, Rose R., had been in this comatose state since 1926 and was severely traumatized to realize that over 40 years of her life were gone and that she had awakened to a world of the future. Rose knew that it was 1969 but just wished that it were 1926. Each of the patients reacted in a wholly unique way, reinforcing Sacks‚Äô belief that too much of the emphasis of modern medicine has been placed on a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô therapy that is assumed to work the same way every time in every circumstance. He contends that modern medicine has dehumanized patients and reduced them to numbers and statistics on a massive medical chart. Just as each of us have unique personalities, so each of us have unique biological and psychological compositions that results in each person reacting to uniform stimuli and medication differently.Sacks structures the book in a way that illustrates his therapeutic philosophy. His introduction provides historical background on the sleeping sickness that afflicted a large number of people during the 1920‚Äôs, along with explanations of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Parkinsonism, the institutional structure of Mount Carmel and the emergence of L-DOPA‚Äôs use. The next section is a collection of case studies, narratives of the experiences of 20 of the patients that were given the drug at Mount Carmel in 1969. The third, ‚ÄòPerspectives‚Äô provides conclusions and commonality in the arc of the trajectory common to most of the patients as they improved, then reverted in response to varying dosages of L-DOPA. His epilogue follows what happened to each of the 20 patients in subsequent years after the initial book publication. In essence, he is providing the medical foundation of the story, followed by individual narratives, followed by therapeutic and philosophic conclusions. As he states:‚ÄúRunning throughout the book is a metaphysical theme‚Äîthe notion that it is insufficient to consider disease in purely mechanical or chemical terms; that it must be considered equally in biological or metaphysical terms, i.e., in terms of organization and design.‚ÄùWhat ensues is a book that has a split personality. We are reading psychological ‚Äòcase histories‚Äô, complete with medical jargon and terminology for describing symptoms (a glossary of medical terms is supplied) alternating with Sacks‚Äô very subjective rendering of the personalities of the patients along with his personal assessments. He includes quotes from poets ranging from John Donne to T.S. Eliot and allows himself to wax poetic and go on philosophic tangents with references to Leibniz and Kant. Just as he fictionalizes Beth Abraham Hospital where he worked into Mount Carmel, he presumably uses fictitious names for his 20 patients i.e. Rose R., Frances D., Aaron E., Leonard L. This personalization is at odds with his formal referral to them throughout their section as Mr. L., Miss I., etc. Although he attempts to treat each of them as unique cases, most of them begin to run together, with a few standing out as more distinct and memorable. Some of these patients are quite articulate. Rose R., for example, describes her condition:‚ÄúOnce I get going I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like being caught between mirrors, or echoes, or something. Or being caught on a merry-go-round which won‚Äôt come to a stop.‚ÄùHe concludes his case histories with Leonard L., the character so movingly portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film. Leonard is the most literate and literary patient on the ward. During the times when he had ownership of his faculties he would write brilliant book reviews. Sacks admits that he learned more from Leonard than from any other patient he ever had and that he deserves a book to himself. Leonard had intermittent times until his thirties when he was somewhat functional. He was always a compulsive reader and would continue reading even when he was otherwise unable to communicate. He experienced a particularly codependent relationship with his mother. His mother needed to be needed as much or more than he needed her. His reaction to L-DOPA was particularly erratic. He became vitalized, filled with curiosity and awe with everything at first, feeling compelled to suck the marrow out of every bit of life he encountered. This tipped over into compulsive and destructive tendencies as he became overly sexual, accosting nurses and staff to the point when he was physically rebuffed, considering himself a new messiah, expounding the gospel of L-DOPA. He would masturbate compulsively or he would write his autobiography for 12 to 15 hours a day. He was particularly tragic in that he was aware of what was happening to him and that he was teetering out of balance into a chaotic unknown. He articulated the dilemma of all the patients when he wrote at the end of his autobiography, ‚ÄúI am a living candle. I am consumed that you may learn. New things will be seen in the light of my suffering.‚Äù Leonard is the tragic Hamlet of this tale. He obviously moved Oliver Sacks and he was the most relatable character for me.I commend Oliver Sacks for his very humane, compassionate approach to these patients, which he considers extraordinarily courageous and tenacious. I applaud his approach toward treating pathologic neurological conditions, even if I consider that his execution falls a bit short of his aspirations. I have seen YouTube interviews with him and I can see that he was a very warm individual and I can understand why patients would trust him with their lives. ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô is a fitting epitaph that does justice to these noble sufferers and presents a medical approach that I wish more doctors would apply."

There was also a pandemic of a, to me, much more terrifying illness. Influenza is scary because it has the potential to kill so many of the people it infects. While encephalitis lethargica killed roughly 30% of its victims, it left the survivors with a variety of movement disorders, tics, catalepsy, and so on, that left these people with existences that many might consider worse than death. In Awakenings, Dr. Oliver Sacks shares a series of case histories of people with post-encephalitis who were treated with a new ‚Äúwonder drug‚Äù called L-DOPA in the summer of 1969. This deeply human and humane series of case studies reveals the complications of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù from years of immobility and nothingness and heart-breaking after effects of L-DOPA that were sometimes worse than the patients‚Äô original conditions. Above all, Awakenings stands as some of the best medical writing I‚Äôve ever read because of Dr. Sacks‚Äô approach to his patients‚Äîa blend of empathy, curiosity, art, and science...Read the rest of my review at A Bookish Type."

It was the first movie I cried in--a profound moment in my development. Now, over 20 years later, I've finally read the book that inspired Penny Marshall's adaptation.Oliver Sacks is a remarkable writer, especially for a physician and scientist; his prose makes his real-life characters vividly alive in my mind. His approach to this book was unique, especially in 1973 when it was first published. It is essentially a series of medical case-histories, but written for a popular audience. Sacks' approach was brilliant in that it retained a level of professionalism that entrenched his work with the medical community, yet it had a level of readability that made it reach far into the public. It thus raised overall levels of understanding about Parkinsonism and other broader medical issues.The application of broader medical topics to Sacks' discussion of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism is really the true genius of the book. After completing his case histories, Sacks engages in a discussion of the treatment of disease (using the patients at hand as a launching point) that calls for a revised approach to medicine for both doctors and patients. I won't go into it here, but I will say that he makes some very important and thought-provoking points. Give the book a read.I held back one star because in spite of the book's surprising readability, it still has the faint earmarks of the work of a doctor. At times the writing wanders into the clinical, at which point Sacks usually reins it in, but a bit too late. He also uses a LOT of unfamiliar medical and neurological terms that make certain parts--especially toward the beginning--difficult to understand. There is a glossary of terms in the appendix, but it is not comprehensive enough.Still, I highly recommend this. "
212,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,3,"I really enjoyed reading all the encephalitis lethargica cases in this book. It made me think of how awesome human brains are. Human brains are incredibly interesting and mysterious at the same time. Through Dr. Sacks meticulous and lyrical writing, one can tell that Dr. Sacks was a very compassionate physician. His humanity shone through his reflections on these cases, and his opinions on the health care system.This is the second book of Dr. Sacks' I have read. I haven't gotten tired of his narratives; however, his writing does drag on a bit from time to time. And the amount of footnotes in this book! It was rather distracting.The movie adaptation sort of amalgamated symptoms from different patients and made new patients out of the real ones. The movie had a more upbeat flavour to it and it eliminated many of the common (somewhat grotesque) side effects of L-DOPA, which I guess would be too disturbing for some viewers. I would recommend both the movie and the book. It's a 3-star book for me."
213,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274569-tanya,5,"After having read another Oliver Sacks book, I picked this up just because I enjoyed the 1990 movie with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. This turned out to be an amazing story. The book is about Dr. Sacks's actual experiences with a new drug and several dozen patients suffering from post-encephelatic lethargica, a form of Parkinsons. Unlike Dr. Sayer in the movie, Dr. Sacks encountered a wide variety of responses to the drug, L-dopa. In fact, every patient's response was unique although most of them followed a pattern of ""awakening, tribulation, and accommodation."" For the first 200 pages, I had a hard time putting the book down but I got somewhat bogged down in his wrap-up in the last 50. It was more difficult to understand and wasn't holding my attention, but I got through it, still with a tremendous appreciation for what he did, what these patients went through before and after the drug, and the intricate workings of the human brain. "
214,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93853-simon,4,"More engrossing than the fact that Dr. Oliver Sacks' 'extinct volcanoes' (post-encephalitic patients) 'awoke' after having received L-Dopa are the reports of how these patients coped with their individual ""eruptions."" Despite having their 'higher faculties' (intelligence, judgment, humor) undisturbed by their crippling illnesses, most patients emerged gloriously from years of 'Sleeping Sickness' only to relapse - forcing either a troublesome accommodation to 'side effects' or a complete pre-dopa reversion. Worse yet was the inevitable addiction patients suffered to L-Dopa, despite Sacks' efforts to 'titrate' their medications and 'balance' their hyperbolic states. Though repetitive in their lessons, the book's numerous prologues and epilogues provide sufficient background on Parkinson's Disease, the 'Sleeping Sickness', Western medicine, and the patients' fates to round out the story."
215,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,5,"This is clearly Sacks' piece de resistence, and you can tell because it's been through a half-dozen editions, all of which bear significant revisions and new footnotes. And there's a reason. I was deeply affected by the case studies in this book, and you can see Sacks' wonder show through on the pages.On the down side, it contains too many footnotes, many of which are random tangents to the subject. I ended up skipping about 1/3 of them to keep the cohesion of the narrative.It's worth reading the voluminous appendices. The basic story of the L-Dopa trial on post-encephalitic patients is a pretty depressing one, all told. But subsequent advances that Sacks describes in the later versions gives the whole thing a great note of triumph. "

After reading ""Hallucinations"" I decided to settle in and finally read this one. It took a while to get into it--up until the case studies--then it took off. Amazing, beautiful, heart-breaking, strange--some of the stories read like horror fiction. This edition of the book is also odd (I don't know if there's a newer one): there are so many footnotes added that it's like there's a separate book in fine print running along the bottom of almost every page. Some footnotes go one for several pages, almost David Foster Wallace-like. I'll try to read/re-read more of his books this year."

""One sees that beautiful and ultimate metaphysical truth, which has been stated by poets and physicians and metaphysicians in all ages- by Leibniz and Donne and Dante and Freud: that Eros is the oldest and strongest if the gods; that Love is the alpha and omega of being; and that the work of healing, of rendering whole, is, first and last, the business of Love."""

Oliver Sacks was not as easy to understand as he is in the fantastic The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.Although the epidemic that these people experienced in the early twentieth century appears to be as mysteriously gone as it was mysterious begin, I believe we need to be aware of the past and to remember the people who endured its hardships. Moreover, we do well to remember how fragile our lives and health are and live with gratitude. We, too, are not immune to future ""plagues.""

Sacks' descriptions of the people he came to know in the hospital and of how the disabling symptoms of the disease affected the course of their lives was so heartrending that I couldn't get past the first couple of patient accounts. The book, first published in 1973, is incredibly relevant today because of how thoroughly Sacks chronicles the false hope of the ""miracle drug"" L-DOPA, and in doing so highlights the very currrent headlines regarding drug companies and their practices.

In historical context (considering the pushback from the academic neuroscience community) this makes sense, but to me, it made the book a less enjoyable read than his others (like Hallucinations, or The Man who mistook his wife for a hat). I would still recommend this book for the wonderfully descriptive case studies, but I have to admit that I gave up on many of the footnotes and ended up skimming a lot of the final commentary."

That illness then gets replace with another coping mechanism, which we call a side effect. The greatest value from this book comes from the reminder that we are whole beings with experiences and unmet needs that cannot be met with the addition of a drug or drugs. Here are some notes that I jotted down while reading.One third of the way through the book, in every case so far Oliver Sacks increased the does to 3 grams/day and saw bizarre symptoms (problems were sometimes there before the dose increase). It made me wonder if a smaller dose might have been more effective. But no, getting the dosage right was a balancing act that tended to get more difficult after the patient had been on L-DOPA for a while.Lucy K was lucid for one day. Even increasing the dose to 5 grams/day did not bring her back. She died 2 years later. Several patients had a similar response: They tried the medicine that brought back some normalcy, found life still unacceptable, got discouraged and wasted away‚ÄúWe rationalize, we dissimilate, we pretend: we pretend that modern medicine is a rational science, all facts, no nonsense, and just what it seems. But we have only to tap it‚Äôs glossy veneer for it to split wide open, and revealed to us it‚Äôs roots and foundations, it‚Äôs old dark heart of metaphysics, mysticism, magic, and myth.‚Äù (Page 28-29 of 408)Miriam H at almost halfway through the book told the Dr. to resume L-DOPA and she wouldn‚Äôt have complications.

Managed to achieve some level of a normal life with or without L-Dopa.Being trapped in the Parkinsonian state was described as: ‚Äòa mixture of nagging and pushing and pressure, with being held back and constrained and stopped. ... The absence is a terrible isolation and coldness and shrinking - more than you can imagine, Dr. Sacks ... a bottomless darkness and unreality. ... a sort of total calmness a nothingness, which is by no means unpleasant.

231,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"My 4th book from Sacks and it didn't disappoint. It tells the story of Sack's patients affected with either Parkinson or most often encephalitis lethargica, also known as sleeping sickness, which resembles Parkinsonism, with perhaps somewhat more severe symptoms. While the disease is known more for its motor symptoms, like bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity of the limbs, and postural instability, it also impacts mood and cognition. People become speechless and motionless as if their ""soul"" has left. The book brilliantly captures the lives and the experiences of these patients, and how they experience the world and themselves. The disease causes the death of cells in the substantia nigra (a region of the midbrain), which makes it not being able to have sufficient dopamine, which is largely responsible for motivational salience (motivation that elicits behaviour). In the 1950s and 60s, L-Dopa appeared as a treatment for Parkinsonism. Unlikely dopamine itself, it could pass the blood-brain barrier, increasing dopamine concentrations. The book describes Sack's experience with this treatment on his patients. As Parkinsonism progresses, people become more and more ""shutdown"", losing touch with reality and increasingly self-absorbed into a reality of nothingness. With L-dopa, however, most seem to experience an ""awakening"", and hence the title of the book. That awakening being extreme enough that sometimes people were miraculously cured, having little or no symptoms of Parkinsonism. Reading the stories of these patients, re-emerging into the world, and being cured almost overnight, feels like reading a novel. However, this miracle soon becomes apparent that this is indeed the real world, and while L-Dopa has recovered the souls of many patients, it's not always the case, and it's not free of complications. While a lack of dopamine causes a trance-like state, L-Dopa often seemed to cause an excess... of everything. Both motor and neurological. Rigidity is replaced by spontaneous irregular ticks, and cognition now seems to be in a pathological and permanent overdrive. Throughout the book, Sacks gives the stories of his patients and how they reacted to L-Dopa. When everything went right, when everything went wrong, and anything in between. An exploration of Parkinsonism, the hidden biological nature of behaviour, and as with all of Sack's books, an exploration of humanity. This book is a unique experience, and there are many things one can gain from it. Perhaps one that most stuck with me is how little we understand about the brain. How far away we are from making reliable predictions and being humble about its complexity and unpredictability, which Sacks tries to connect to chaos theory in one of the last chapters, being a new field at the time. I was constantly amazed at how in most of the stories, the reactions make almost no sense at all. One hopes that we finally achieved understanding. That we have a cure, and we can predict its outcome. But we can't. The massive amount of variance in relationship to L-Dopa, not only between patients, but in the same patient, and how often logic gets thrown out of the window, is baffling. I was also perplexed at how often psychology, in a more layman's terms, seemed to infiltrate neurology. This is supposedly a field rooted in biology, in objectivity. Yet, it's clear that a more subjective, personal, and human aspect of it remains. It's a painful reminder of our ignorance, and likely our flawed division of biological and psychological approaches. Awakenings is definitely Sack's magnum opus. A classic of neurology and I'd argue of the best non-fiction books ever written."
232,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1347421-diem,5,"The first time I watched the film version of ""Awakenings"" was probably in 1991. I would have been about 20 and it would have been about 6 years since my father's mind and body had been ravaged by a catastrophic stroke. Six years is a long time and time enough to adjust to a new life with a new kind of father but it was too soon to see the movie. There is a scene in which a woman is visiting the hospital to see her father and has lunch with Leonard, the character played by the incomparable Robert De Niro. She says this: ""Sometimes I think I see something. I think I see a change. And for a moment, I see him like he was before the stroke. And then it's gone. And I'm not sure that I saw anything."" Because of this scene and the fantasy wish fulfillment of neurologically impaired patients awakening from their affliction, I was heartbroken by the movie and remained so for months after seeing it. Fast forward 25-ish years and watching the movie with my teenaged daughter. While still deeply moved by the film, my soul wasn't crushed by it and I became intensely curious about the real story. Having just listened to Dr. Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" I was prepared for how scholarly and clinical his writing can be. Many people lament his clinical vernacular but I find that part easy enough to piece together. I have a layman's familiarity with neurology. That combined with a basic understanding of prefixes and suffixes can go a long way. If you understand hyperkinesia then akinesia should present no challenge. What bewildered and amazed me were his references to the great minds of a multitude of disciplines. He either quoted or referenced: Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Hume, Schopenhauer, John Donne, Dali, Kant, Leibniz. And this is a truncated list. It is also important that no lesser minds than these informed both his writing and his work in the field of neurology. He addresses this importance in the chapter where he speaks of how fundamentally important it is to science to never neglect or abandon the ontological in pursuit of the purely empirical. This is his appeal, in my opinion, to all of the STEM obsessed students of today to enrich their education with the study of philosophy, art, music, literature and history. This need to be well acquainted with the whole world of human experience is poignantly illustrated by how critical HIS knowledge of such was to his work with post-encephalitic patients who challenged any previously understood notions of being and existence. Many of these victims of the ""Sleepy Sickness"" of the 1920s had been in a state of seeming frozen catatonia for 40 years. And yet, upon being administered the drug L-Dopa they were able to report, in clear and compelling language, that they had been conscious and aware the entire time. The clinical picture can only get you so far in your understanding of this phenomenon. If knowing that this nightmarish existence can occur outside the realm fairytales and sci-fi novels doesn't keep you awake for at least a few extra minutes, then you're doing science wrong. Some of my daymares involve memories of my father in the early years after his stroke trying to talk to us from his wheelchair. He would get started okay but then his brain would jam, almost visibly, and his mouth already contorted by right-side paralysis would contort even more grotesquely. Then garbled, ghoulish sounds would erupt from him where he clearly intended words to be. He would stop and start again several times to no avail and not infrequently this process would end with him punching the air with his left fist and screaming through angry tears, ""I know! Dammit! I know! But I can't say it!""I imagine that now, after reading Awakenings. But I imagine Leonard screaming and punching the air in only his mind. And with no one to hear him say it. And with no one even knowing he thought it. Because while he was screaming and punching in his mind, his body was frozen and his eyes glassy and vacant. It haunts me. The stories, beautifully presented case studies, from the hospital are gripping. Sacks presents each study in a, yes, deeply clinical way but also in a deeply personal way. Each 'case' is a fully fleshed out person with a backstory and a personality and a family. Not always a nice personality and not always a nice family, but this is a real story. I was deeply appreciative of how sensitive Sacks was in making each patient fully human. It was particularly important to me because my father spent several months, in a rehabilitative hospital once he left the regular hospital. He was on the head trauma floor and I remember my first visit there in flashes of great detail. The way the floor was more tightly secured than the regular hospital had been and the way my mother warned me before I went in, that it might be upsetting. What she was referring to, I quickly found out, was that unlike the regular hospital the head trauma ward could be loud. Very loud.At the time that my father was admitted, there was a patient on the floor that spent much of the day screaming. I don't recall him screaming anything in particular. Just his rage filled screaming as if he were in terrible pain. I do not remember what had happened to him but I have never forgotten his screaming. My father shared his room with a quiet young man named William who was not in the room the first time I visited. But he was there the next day when my mother dropped me off to sit with my dad for a few hours while she did some errands. I walked into the room and he sat up suddenly and said, ""Wow. You're so pretty.""No one under the age of 37 had ever told me I was pretty. I didn't have the kind of look that appealed to young people of that time. I was always popular with older men and could have dated any number of my dad's friends or my friend's dads had I been inclined that way. But I wasn't. Anyway, it wasn't lost on me that the first person within 10 years of my own age to tell me I was pretty was in the hospital for severe head trauma. William had been in a motorcycle accident and he was clearly in very bad shape. He had suffered considerable brain damage but seemed cheerfully unaware of it. Over the next few weeks I would meet his parents and his fianc√©e and they got used to me sitting in a corner, watching my dad sleep or stare blankly at the television. So used to me that I become the unwitting witness to a moment so private and awful that I recall it like it has just happened. William's fiancee was visiting. She was sitting in the chair right in front of the room's one large window. She was a young woman, early 20s, with puffy blonde hair. William sat next to her in his wheelchair. They were holding hands and she was trying to talk to him and he was being silly. But not in a cute way. In a disjointed, childish way. She suddenly stopped talking and her whole body visibly crumpled into itself. Her head sagged forward and her shoulders heaved but she remained absolutely silent. William suddenly stopped being silly. He wheeled closer and wrapped his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Please don't cry. Don't cry. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. I'm going to get better."" But, if William believed what he was saying, he was the only one. I was only 16 but I knew in that moment that she knew it wasn't going to be okay and William wasn't going to get better. I felt like I had just witnessed the moment that two lives had been violently and horribly changed forever. Two lives spectacularly but quietly exploding in front of a hospital window on a sunny afternoon.So, what I took away from that horrible episode and what I carry with me every time I visit or even pass a hospital is that every single window represents a set of lives and stories that will break your heart if you listen to them. And someone needs to listen to them. And that someone might as well be a physician. And that physician was Dr. Sacks. And he left us this book and this book is asking us to start caring about the stories. And it is especially asking doctors to start caring about the stories. I mean, it is doing a lot of other things too. It is too appalling that Sacks has written this tremendous book of a million layers and all I'm going to say about it is that I liked it and I think anyone considering going into medicine should read it. But, there are other reviews and my kids are asking to be fed. Read the book. "
233,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633038-jesse-field,4,"As Doris Lessing‚Äôs blurb on the paperback says, ‚ÄúIt makes you aware of what a knife-edge we live on.‚Äù The edge between functional cognition and severe pathology that calls into question what selfhood even means. Also the edge between fitting into society, more or less, and being rejected by it fully, as so many of us have worried over.I took in the narratives of the patients all at once, a rush of reading that leaves one harrowed, bemused, and, God help me, almost bored by the end. In the introduction and conclusion, Sacks‚Äô ability to squeeze such incredible meaning from his narrative drag me back to attention. The effective and anticipated climax was a brief questioning of the nature of scientific truth-seeking, a theme ever-present in this text:We have spoken of the Parkinsonian as ‚Äòlost in space and time,‚Äô and as harbouring a ‚Äòchaos of broken clocks and rulers.‚Äô One might say that these are Kantian formulations of his state, for they correspond with the central Kantian notion that space and time are the essential forms of experience, that space and time (or, rather, the sense of space and time) are ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô of the organism or mind. Thus, where we spoke previously of a relativistic or Einsteinian delirium, we might now, even more fundamentally, speak of a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô delirium ‚Äì and ultimate akinesia as being ‚ÄòaKantia.‚ÄôIf Kant, in his first Critique, dealt with space and time as the essential (‚Äòa priori synthetic‚Äô) forms of the experience (and thus of perception and motion), he deals in his other Critiques with agency, the will, ‚ÄòI‚Äô (and as ‚ÄòI‚Äô being defined by its will ‚Äì ‚ÄòVolo ergo sum‚Äô). Thus the considerations we have been impelled to require all of Kant‚Äôs thought.Are such considerations outside the proper domain of ‚Äòscience‚Äô? They are outside the science, for this not only denies the ideal forms of experience, but disallows any ‚Äòpersonal identity.‚Äô But they point, or so I believe, to a greater and more generous conception of ‚Äòscience,‚Äô which can embrace all the phenomena we have discussed. Such a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô science, I think, is the science of the future.Thus, in what might appear an extraordinarily small field ‚Äì the study and treatment of post-encephalitic patients ‚Äì we find unexpectedly vast vistas emerging. We see before us, in exemplary form, the thrilling shapes of the medicine of the future, a perfectly rational yet practical scientific medicine, and an utterly beautiful and elemental ‚Äòexistential‚Äô medicine.Despite the rush of epiphany feeling generated in this passage, however, turning back to re-read leaves us as unsatisfied as when we review and write down our dreams. What position, or role, does the Will have from the second and third Critiques? Was Schopenhauer on the right track? Sacks merely grazes the surface of something here, then takes on the mantle of the logical positivist, preaching of a better future, even when the conflicts of his own humanity and the troubled history of Mt. Carmel Hospital would seem to indicate something less sanguine. Oh well. The work remains a powerful crossover from ethnographic narrative to dramatic production. And in what other story collection can we learn words like ‚Äúoculogyria,‚Äù ‚Äúpalilalia,‚Äù and ‚Äúfestinating.‚Äù One worries only slightly that we‚Äôve all made a circus of the patients, for it seems okay as long as we remember, we are part of the circus, too."
234,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035284-brian-bess,4,"When the sleepers wakeWhen I saw the 1990 film ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô, with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, I knew that lurking beneath the sentimentalized story was a more powerful one that could have been accepted as science fiction if it had occurred even a couple of decades earlier. What happened in 1969, at Mount Carmel Hospital (the fictionalized hospital where Oliver Sacks was a resident neurologist) was an extraordinary sequence of events impacting dozens of victims of sleeping-sickness aka encephalitis lethargica. These patients had varying degrees of affliction occurring in the wake of the influenza epidemic that swept the country in 1918, some virtually catatonic, others alternately lucid and stable, most experiencing tics, tremors, palsy and various manifestations of the Parkinson-like illness. Following the medical hype surrounding L-DOPA, then seen as a miracle drug, many of these patients were administered the drug and virtually all of them reacted to it in powerfully dramatic ways. Some were jolted out of a decades long sleep. For example, Rose R., had been in this comatose state since 1926 and was severely traumatized to realize that over 40 years of her life were gone and that she had awakened to a world of the future. Rose knew that it was 1969 but just wished that it were 1926. Each of the patients reacted in a wholly unique way, reinforcing Sacks‚Äô belief that too much of the emphasis of modern medicine has been placed on a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô therapy that is assumed to work the same way every time in every circumstance. He contends that modern medicine has dehumanized patients and reduced them to numbers and statistics on a massive medical chart. Just as each of us have unique personalities, so each of us have unique biological and psychological compositions that results in each person reacting to uniform stimuli and medication differently.Sacks structures the book in a way that illustrates his therapeutic philosophy. His introduction provides historical background on the sleeping sickness that afflicted a large number of people during the 1920‚Äôs, along with explanations of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Parkinsonism, the institutional structure of Mount Carmel and the emergence of L-DOPA‚Äôs use. The next section is a collection of case studies, narratives of the experiences of 20 of the patients that were given the drug at Mount Carmel in 1969. The third, ‚ÄòPerspectives‚Äô provides conclusions and commonality in the arc of the trajectory common to most of the patients as they improved, then reverted in response to varying dosages of L-DOPA. His epilogue follows what happened to each of the 20 patients in subsequent years after the initial book publication. In essence, he is providing the medical foundation of the story, followed by individual narratives, followed by therapeutic and philosophic conclusions. As he states:‚ÄúRunning throughout the book is a metaphysical theme‚Äîthe notion that it is insufficient to consider disease in purely mechanical or chemical terms; that it must be considered equally in biological or metaphysical terms, i.e., in terms of organization and design.‚ÄùWhat ensues is a book that has a split personality. We are reading psychological ‚Äòcase histories‚Äô, complete with medical jargon and terminology for describing symptoms (a glossary of medical terms is supplied) alternating with Sacks‚Äô very subjective rendering of the personalities of the patients along with his personal assessments. He includes quotes from poets ranging from John Donne to T.S. Eliot and allows himself to wax poetic and go on philosophic tangents with references to Leibniz and Kant. Just as he fictionalizes Beth Abraham Hospital where he worked into Mount Carmel, he presumably uses fictitious names for his 20 patients i.e. Rose R., Frances D., Aaron E., Leonard L. This personalization is at odds with his formal referral to them throughout their section as Mr. L., Miss I., etc. Although he attempts to treat each of them as unique cases, most of them begin to run together, with a few standing out as more distinct and memorable. Some of these patients are quite articulate. Rose R., for example, describes her condition:‚ÄúOnce I get going I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like being caught between mirrors, or echoes, or something. Or being caught on a merry-go-round which won‚Äôt come to a stop.‚ÄùHe concludes his case histories with Leonard L., the character so movingly portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film. Leonard is the most literate and literary patient on the ward. During the times when he had ownership of his faculties he would write brilliant book reviews. Sacks admits that he learned more from Leonard than from any other patient he ever had and that he deserves a book to himself. Leonard had intermittent times until his thirties when he was somewhat functional. He was always a compulsive reader and would continue reading even when he was otherwise unable to communicate. He experienced a particularly codependent relationship with his mother. His mother needed to be needed as much or more than he needed her. His reaction to L-DOPA was particularly erratic. He became vitalized, filled with curiosity and awe with everything at first, feeling compelled to suck the marrow out of every bit of life he encountered. This tipped over into compulsive and destructive tendencies as he became overly sexual, accosting nurses and staff to the point when he was physically rebuffed, considering himself a new messiah, expounding the gospel of L-DOPA. He would masturbate compulsively or he would write his autobiography for 12 to 15 hours a day. He was particularly tragic in that he was aware of what was happening to him and that he was teetering out of balance into a chaotic unknown. He articulated the dilemma of all the patients when he wrote at the end of his autobiography, ‚ÄúI am a living candle. I am consumed that you may learn. New things will be seen in the light of my suffering.‚Äù Leonard is the tragic Hamlet of this tale. He obviously moved Oliver Sacks and he was the most relatable character for me.I commend Oliver Sacks for his very humane, compassionate approach to these patients, which he considers extraordinarily courageous and tenacious. I applaud his approach toward treating pathologic neurological conditions, even if I consider that his execution falls a bit short of his aspirations. I have seen YouTube interviews with him and I can see that he was a very warm individual and I can understand why patients would trust him with their lives. ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô is a fitting epitaph that does justice to these noble sufferers and presents a medical approach that I wish more doctors would apply."

There was also a pandemic of a, to me, much more terrifying illness. Influenza is scary because it has the potential to kill so many of the people it infects. While encephalitis lethargica killed roughly 30% of its victims, it left the survivors with a variety of movement disorders, tics, catalepsy, and so on, that left these people with existences that many might consider worse than death. In Awakenings, Dr. Oliver Sacks shares a series of case histories of people with post-encephalitis who were treated with a new ‚Äúwonder drug‚Äù called L-DOPA in the summer of 1969. This deeply human and humane series of case studies reveals the complications of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù from years of immobility and nothingness and heart-breaking after effects of L-DOPA that were sometimes worse than the patients‚Äô original conditions.

It was the first movie I cried in--a profound moment in my development. Now, over 20 years later, I've finally read the book that inspired Penny Marshall's adaptation.Oliver Sacks is a remarkable writer, especially for a physician and scientist; his prose makes his real-life characters vividly alive in my mind. His approach to this book was unique, especially in 1973 when it was first published. It is essentially a series of medical case-histories, but written for a popular audience. Sacks' approach was brilliant in that it retained a level of professionalism that entrenched his work with the medical community, yet it had a level of readability that made it reach far into the public. It thus raised overall levels of understanding about Parkinsonism and other broader medical issues.The application of broader medical topics to Sacks' discussion of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism is really the true genius of the book. After completing his case histories, Sacks engages in a discussion of the treatment of disease (using the patients at hand as a launching point) that calls for a revised approach to medicine for both doctors and patients. I won't go into it here, but I will say that he makes some very important and thought-provoking points. Give the book a read.I held back one star because in spite of the book's surprising readability, it still has the faint earmarks of the work of a doctor. At times the writing wanders into the clinical, at which point Sacks usually reins it in, but a bit too late. He also uses a LOT of unfamiliar medical and neurological terms that make certain parts--especially toward the beginning--difficult to understand. There is a glossary of terms in the appendix, but it is not comprehensive enough.Still, I highly recommend this. "
242,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,3,"I really enjoyed reading all the encephalitis lethargica cases in this book. It made me think of how awesome human brains are. Human brains are incredibly interesting and mysterious at the same time. Through Dr. Sacks meticulous and lyrical writing, one can tell that Dr. Sacks was a very compassionate physician. His humanity shone through his reflections on these cases, and his opinions on the health care system.This is the second book of Dr. Sacks' I have read. I haven't gotten tired of his narratives; however, his writing does drag on a bit from time to time. And the amount of footnotes in this book! It was rather distracting.The movie adaptation sort of amalgamated symptoms from different patients and made new patients out of the real ones. The movie had a more upbeat flavour to it and it eliminated many of the common (somewhat grotesque) side effects of L-DOPA, which I guess would be too disturbing for some viewers. I would recommend both the movie and the book. It's a 3-star book for me."
243,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274569-tanya,5,"After having read another Oliver Sacks book, I picked this up just because I enjoyed the 1990 movie with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. This turned out to be an amazing story. The book is about Dr. Sacks's actual experiences with a new drug and several dozen patients suffering from post-encephelatic lethargica, a form of Parkinsons. Unlike Dr. Sayer in the movie, Dr. Sacks encountered a wide variety of responses to the drug, L-dopa. In fact, every patient's response was unique although most of them followed a pattern of ""awakening, tribulation, and accommodation."" For the first 200 pages, I had a hard time putting the book down but I got somewhat bogged down in his wrap-up in the last 50. It was more difficult to understand and wasn't holding my attention, but I got through it, still with a tremendous appreciation for what he did, what these patients went through before and after the drug, and the intricate workings of the human brain. "
244,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93853-simon,4,"More engrossing than the fact that Dr. Oliver Sacks' 'extinct volcanoes' (post-encephalitic patients) 'awoke' after having received L-Dopa are the reports of how these patients coped with their individual ""eruptions."" Despite having their 'higher faculties' (intelligence, judgment, humor) undisturbed by their crippling illnesses, most patients emerged gloriously from years of 'Sleeping Sickness' only to relapse - forcing either a troublesome accommodation to 'side effects' or a complete pre-dopa reversion. Worse yet was the inevitable addiction patients suffered to L-Dopa, despite Sacks' efforts to 'titrate' their medications and 'balance' their hyperbolic states. Though repetitive in their lessons, the book's numerous prologues and epilogues provide sufficient background on Parkinson's Disease, the 'Sleeping Sickness', Western medicine, and the patients' fates to round out the story."
245,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,5,"This is clearly Sacks' piece de resistence, and you can tell because it's been through a half-dozen editions, all of which bear significant revisions and new footnotes. And there's a reason. I was deeply affected by the case studies in this book, and you can see Sacks' wonder show through on the pages.On the down side, it contains too many footnotes, many of which are random tangents to the subject. I ended up skipping about 1/3 of them to keep the cohesion of the narrative.It's worth reading the voluminous appendices. The basic story of the L-Dopa trial on post-encephalitic patients is a pretty depressing one, all told. But subsequent advances that Sacks describes in the later versions gives the whole thing a great note of triumph. "

After reading ""Hallucinations"" I decided to settle in and finally read this one. It took a while to get into it--up until the case studies--then it took off. Amazing, beautiful, heart-breaking, strange--some of the stories read like horror fiction. This edition of the book is also odd (I don't know if there's a newer one): there are so many footnotes added that it's like there's a separate book in fine print running along the bottom of almost every page. Some footnotes go one for several pages, almost David Foster Wallace-like. I'll try to read/re-read more of his books this year."

This is more than just the case studies of those post-encephalitic Parkinsonian patients Dr. Sacks treated in the 60s with the new miracle drug L-Dopa. It gives a renewed optimism to those who work with any type of patient in the potential for recovery by realizing the patient is much more than just the physiological aspect of his body. ""One sees that beautiful and ultimate metaphysical truth, which has been stated by poets and physicians and metaphysicians in all ages- by Leibniz and Donne and Dante and Freud: that Eros is the oldest and strongest if the gods; that Love is the alpha and omega of being; and that the work of healing, of rendering whole, is, first and last, the business of Love."""

Oliver Sacks was not as easy to understand as he is in the fantastic The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.Although the epidemic that these people experienced in the early twentieth century appears to be as mysteriously gone as it was mysterious begin, I believe we need to be aware of the past and to remember the people who endured its hardships. Moreover, we do well to remember how fragile our lives and health are and live with gratitude. We, too, are not immune to future ""plagues.""

Sacks' descriptions of the people he came to know in the hospital and of how the disabling symptoms of the disease affected the course of their lives was so heartrending that I couldn't get past the first couple of patient accounts. The book, first published in 1973, is incredibly relevant today because of how thoroughly Sacks chronicles the false hope of the ""miracle drug"" L-DOPA, and in doing so highlights the very currrent headlines regarding drug companies and their practices.

In historical context (considering the pushback from the academic neuroscience community) this makes sense, but to me, it made the book a less enjoyable read than his others (like Hallucinations, or The Man who mistook his wife for a hat). I would still recommend this book for the wonderfully descriptive case studies, but I have to admit that I gave up on many of the footnotes and ended up skimming a lot of the final commentary."

That illness then gets replace with another coping mechanism, which we call a side effect. The greatest value from this book comes from the reminder that we are whole beings with experiences and unmet needs that cannot be met with the addition of a drug or drugs. Here are some notes that I jotted down while reading.One third of the way through the book, in every case so far Oliver Sacks increased the does to 3 grams/day and saw bizarre symptoms (problems were sometimes there before the dose increase). It made me wonder if a smaller dose might have been more effective. But no, getting the dosage right was a balancing act that tended to get more difficult after the patient had been on L-DOPA for a while.Lucy K was lucid for one day. Even increasing the dose to 5 grams/day did not bring her back. She died 2 years later. Several patients had a similar response: They tried the medicine that brought back some normalcy, found life still unacceptable, got discouraged and wasted away‚ÄúWe rationalize, we dissimilate, we pretend: we pretend that modern medicine is a rational science, all facts, no nonsense, and just what it seems. But we have only to tap it‚Äôs glossy veneer for it to split wide open, and revealed to us it‚Äôs roots and foundations, it‚Äôs old dark heart of metaphysics, mysticism, magic, and myth.‚Äù (Page 28-29 of 408)Miriam H at almost halfway through the book told the Dr. to resume L-DOPA and she wouldn‚Äôt have complications. He did and she continued to function well on it. Some other patients also correctly told how their future health would go.‚ÄúShe goes mad in your madhouse because she is shut off from life.‚Äù (Page 160)Some of his patients develop Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms early in life, others in their 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs.Footnote 88: ‚ÄúLife changes, powerful emotions, cannot only exacerbate, but can precipitate parkinsonism. ‚Ä¶ it has been shown that dopamine levels may be reduced in the brain by 30-50% without producing any clinical symptoms; but that if it is reduced still further, to less than 20% of normal, parkinsonian symptoms promptly appear. (Pages 191-193, yes, an extended footnote)‚ÄúIn the sixteenth month on L-DOPA ...

Managed to achieve some level of a normal life with or without L-Dopa.Being trapped in the Parkinsonian state was described as: ‚Äòa mixture of nagging and pushing and pressure, with being held back and constrained and stopped. ... The absence is a terrible isolation and coldness and shrinking - more than you can imagine, Dr. Sacks ... a bottomless darkness and unreality. ... a sort of total calmness a nothingness, which is by no means unpleasant.

261,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"My 4th book from Sacks and it didn't disappoint. It tells the story of Sack's patients affected with either Parkinson or most often encephalitis lethargica, also known as sleeping sickness, which resembles Parkinsonism, with perhaps somewhat more severe symptoms. While the disease is known more for its motor symptoms, like bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity of the limbs, and postural instability, it also impacts mood and cognition. People become speechless and motionless as if their ""soul"" has left. The book brilliantly captures the lives and the experiences of these patients, and how they experience the world and themselves. The disease causes the death of cells in the substantia nigra (a region of the midbrain), which makes it not being able to have sufficient dopamine, which is largely responsible for motivational salience (motivation that elicits behaviour). In the 1950s and 60s, L-Dopa appeared as a treatment for Parkinsonism. Unlikely dopamine itself, it could pass the blood-brain barrier, increasing dopamine concentrations. The book describes Sack's experience with this treatment on his patients. As Parkinsonism progresses, people become more and more ""shutdown"", losing touch with reality and increasingly self-absorbed into a reality of nothingness. With L-dopa, however, most seem to experience an ""awakening"", and hence the title of the book. That awakening being extreme enough that sometimes people were miraculously cured, having little or no symptoms of Parkinsonism. Reading the stories of these patients, re-emerging into the world, and being cured almost overnight, feels like reading a novel. However, this miracle soon becomes apparent that this is indeed the real world, and while L-Dopa has recovered the souls of many patients, it's not always the case, and it's not free of complications. While a lack of dopamine causes a trance-like state, L-Dopa often seemed to cause an excess... of everything. Both motor and neurological. Rigidity is replaced by spontaneous irregular ticks, and cognition now seems to be in a pathological and permanent overdrive. Throughout the book, Sacks gives the stories of his patients and how they reacted to L-Dopa. When everything went right, when everything went wrong, and anything in between. An exploration of Parkinsonism, the hidden biological nature of behaviour, and as with all of Sack's books, an exploration of humanity. This book is a unique experience, and there are many things one can gain from it. Perhaps one that most stuck with me is how little we understand about the brain. How far away we are from making reliable predictions and being humble about its complexity and unpredictability, which Sacks tries to connect to chaos theory in one of the last chapters, being a new field at the time. I was constantly amazed at how in most of the stories, the reactions make almost no sense at all. One hopes that we finally achieved understanding. That we have a cure, and we can predict its outcome. But we can't. The massive amount of variance in relationship to L-Dopa, not only between patients, but in the same patient, and how often logic gets thrown out of the window, is baffling. I was also perplexed at how often psychology, in a more layman's terms, seemed to infiltrate neurology. This is supposedly a field rooted in biology, in objectivity. Yet, it's clear that a more subjective, personal, and human aspect of it remains. It's a painful reminder of our ignorance, and likely our flawed division of biological and psychological approaches. Awakenings is definitely Sack's magnum opus. A classic of neurology and I'd argue of the best non-fiction books ever written."
262,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1347421-diem,5,"The first time I watched the film version of ""Awakenings"" was probably in 1991. I would have been about 20 and it would have been about 6 years since my father's mind and body had been ravaged by a catastrophic stroke. Six years is a long time and time enough to adjust to a new life with a new kind of father but it was too soon to see the movie. There is a scene in which a woman is visiting the hospital to see her father and has lunch with Leonard, the character played by the incomparable Robert De Niro. She says this: ""Sometimes I think I see something. I think I see a change. And for a moment, I see him like he was before the stroke. And then it's gone. And I'm not sure that I saw anything."" Because of this scene and the fantasy wish fulfillment of neurologically impaired patients awakening from their affliction, I was heartbroken by the movie and remained so for months after seeing it. Fast forward 25-ish years and watching the movie with my teenaged daughter. While still deeply moved by the film, my soul wasn't crushed by it and I became intensely curious about the real story. Having just listened to Dr. Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" I was prepared for how scholarly and clinical his writing can be. Many people lament his clinical vernacular but I find that part easy enough to piece together. I have a layman's familiarity with neurology. That combined with a basic understanding of prefixes and suffixes can go a long way. If you understand hyperkinesia then akinesia should present no challenge. What bewildered and amazed me were his references to the great minds of a multitude of disciplines. He either quoted or referenced: Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Hume, Schopenhauer, John Donne, Dali, Kant, Leibniz. And this is a truncated list. It is also important that no lesser minds than these informed both his writing and his work in the field of neurology. He addresses this importance in the chapter where he speaks of how fundamentally important it is to science to never neglect or abandon the ontological in pursuit of the purely empirical. This is his appeal, in my opinion, to all of the STEM obsessed students of today to enrich their education with the study of philosophy, art, music, literature and history. This need to be well acquainted with the whole world of human experience is poignantly illustrated by how critical HIS knowledge of such was to his work with post-encephalitic patients who challenged any previously understood notions of being and existence. Many of these victims of the ""Sleepy Sickness"" of the 1920s had been in a state of seeming frozen catatonia for 40 years. And yet, upon being administered the drug L-Dopa they were able to report, in clear and compelling language, that they had been conscious and aware the entire time. The clinical picture can only get you so far in your understanding of this phenomenon. If knowing that this nightmarish existence can occur outside the realm fairytales and sci-fi novels doesn't keep you awake for at least a few extra minutes, then you're doing science wrong. Some of my daymares involve memories of my father in the early years after his stroke trying to talk to us from his wheelchair. He would get started okay but then his brain would jam, almost visibly, and his mouth already contorted by right-side paralysis would contort even more grotesquely. Then garbled, ghoulish sounds would erupt from him where he clearly intended words to be. He would stop and start again several times to no avail and not infrequently this process would end with him punching the air with his left fist and screaming through angry tears, ""I know! Dammit! I know! But I can't say it!""I imagine that now, after reading Awakenings. But I imagine Leonard screaming and punching the air in only his mind. And with no one to hear him say it. And with no one even knowing he thought it. Because while he was screaming and punching in his mind, his body was frozen and his eyes glassy and vacant. It haunts me. The stories, beautifully presented case studies, from the hospital are gripping. Sacks presents each study in a, yes, deeply clinical way but also in a deeply personal way. Each 'case' is a fully fleshed out person with a backstory and a personality and a family. Not always a nice personality and not always a nice family, but this is a real story. I was deeply appreciative of how sensitive Sacks was in making each patient fully human. It was particularly important to me because my father spent several months, in a rehabilitative hospital once he left the regular hospital. He was on the head trauma floor and I remember my first visit there in flashes of great detail. The way the floor was more tightly secured than the regular hospital had been and the way my mother warned me before I went in, that it might be upsetting. What she was referring to, I quickly found out, was that unlike the regular hospital the head trauma ward could be loud. Very loud.At the time that my father was admitted, there was a patient on the floor that spent much of the day screaming. I don't recall him screaming anything in particular. Just his rage filled screaming as if he were in terrible pain. I do not remember what had happened to him but I have never forgotten his screaming. My father shared his room with a quiet young man named William who was not in the room the first time I visited. But he was there the next day when my mother dropped me off to sit with my dad for a few hours while she did some errands. I walked into the room and he sat up suddenly and said, ""Wow. You're so pretty.""No one under the age of 37 had ever told me I was pretty. I didn't have the kind of look that appealed to young people of that time. I was always popular with older men and could have dated any number of my dad's friends or my friend's dads had I been inclined that way. But I wasn't. Anyway, it wasn't lost on me that the first person within 10 years of my own age to tell me I was pretty was in the hospital for severe head trauma. William had been in a motorcycle accident and he was clearly in very bad shape. He had suffered considerable brain damage but seemed cheerfully unaware of it. Over the next few weeks I would meet his parents and his fianc√©e and they got used to me sitting in a corner, watching my dad sleep or stare blankly at the television. So used to me that I become the unwitting witness to a moment so private and awful that I recall it like it has just happened. William's fiancee was visiting. She was sitting in the chair right in front of the room's one large window. She was a young woman, early 20s, with puffy blonde hair. William sat next to her in his wheelchair. They were holding hands and she was trying to talk to him and he was being silly. But not in a cute way. In a disjointed, childish way. She suddenly stopped talking and her whole body visibly crumpled into itself. Her head sagged forward and her shoulders heaved but she remained absolutely silent. William suddenly stopped being silly. He wheeled closer and wrapped his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Please don't cry. Don't cry. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. I'm going to get better."" But, if William believed what he was saying, he was the only one. I was only 16 but I knew in that moment that she knew it wasn't going to be okay and William wasn't going to get better. I felt like I had just witnessed the moment that two lives had been violently and horribly changed forever. Two lives spectacularly but quietly exploding in front of a hospital window on a sunny afternoon.So, what I took away from that horrible episode and what I carry with me every time I visit or even pass a hospital is that every single window represents a set of lives and stories that will break your heart if you listen to them. And someone needs to listen to them. And that someone might as well be a physician. And that physician was Dr. Sacks. And he left us this book and this book is asking us to start caring about the stories. And it is especially asking doctors to start caring about the stories. I mean, it is doing a lot of other things too. It is too appalling that Sacks has written this tremendous book of a million layers and all I'm going to say about it is that I liked it and I think anyone considering going into medicine should read it. But, there are other reviews and my kids are asking to be fed. Read the book. "
263,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633038-jesse-field,4,"As Doris Lessing‚Äôs blurb on the paperback says, ‚ÄúIt makes you aware of what a knife-edge we live on.‚Äù The edge between functional cognition and severe pathology that calls into question what selfhood even means. Also the edge between fitting into society, more or less, and being rejected by it fully, as so many of us have worried over.I took in the narratives of the patients all at once, a rush of reading that leaves one harrowed, bemused, and, God help me, almost bored by the end. In the introduction and conclusion, Sacks‚Äô ability to squeeze such incredible meaning from his narrative drag me back to attention. The effective and anticipated climax was a brief questioning of the nature of scientific truth-seeking, a theme ever-present in this text:We have spoken of the Parkinsonian as ‚Äòlost in space and time,‚Äô and as harbouring a ‚Äòchaos of broken clocks and rulers.‚Äô One might say that these are Kantian formulations of his state, for they correspond with the central Kantian notion that space and time are the essential forms of experience, that space and time (or, rather, the sense of space and time) are ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô of the organism or mind. Thus, where we spoke previously of a relativistic or Einsteinian delirium, we might now, even more fundamentally, speak of a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô delirium ‚Äì and ultimate akinesia as being ‚ÄòaKantia.‚ÄôIf Kant, in his first Critique, dealt with space and time as the essential (‚Äòa priori synthetic‚Äô) forms of the experience (and thus of perception and motion), he deals in his other Critiques with agency, the will, ‚ÄòI‚Äô (and as ‚ÄòI‚Äô being defined by its will ‚Äì ‚ÄòVolo ergo sum‚Äô). Thus the considerations we have been impelled to require all of Kant‚Äôs thought.Are such considerations outside the proper domain of ‚Äòscience‚Äô? They are outside the science, for this not only denies the ideal forms of experience, but disallows any ‚Äòpersonal identity.‚Äô But they point, or so I believe, to a greater and more generous conception of ‚Äòscience,‚Äô which can embrace all the phenomena we have discussed. Such a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô science, I think, is the science of the future.Thus, in what might appear an extraordinarily small field ‚Äì the study and treatment of post-encephalitic patients ‚Äì we find unexpectedly vast vistas emerging. We see before us, in exemplary form, the thrilling shapes of the medicine of the future, a perfectly rational yet practical scientific medicine, and an utterly beautiful and elemental ‚Äòexistential‚Äô medicine.Despite the rush of epiphany feeling generated in this passage, however, turning back to re-read leaves us as unsatisfied as when we review and write down our dreams. What position, or role, does the Will have from the second and third Critiques? Was Schopenhauer on the right track? Sacks merely grazes the surface of something here, then takes on the mantle of the logical positivist, preaching of a better future, even when the conflicts of his own humanity and the troubled history of Mt. Carmel Hospital would seem to indicate something less sanguine. Oh well. The work remains a powerful crossover from ethnographic narrative to dramatic production. And in what other story collection can we learn words like ‚Äúoculogyria,‚Äù ‚Äúpalilalia,‚Äù and ‚Äúfestinating.‚Äù One worries only slightly that we‚Äôve all made a circus of the patients, for it seems okay as long as we remember, we are part of the circus, too."
264,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035284-brian-bess,4,"When the sleepers wakeWhen I saw the 1990 film ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô, with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, I knew that lurking beneath the sentimentalized story was a more powerful one that could have been accepted as science fiction if it had occurred even a couple of decades earlier. What happened in 1969, at Mount Carmel Hospital (the fictionalized hospital where Oliver Sacks was a resident neurologist) was an extraordinary sequence of events impacting dozens of victims of sleeping-sickness aka encephalitis lethargica. These patients had varying degrees of affliction occurring in the wake of the influenza epidemic that swept the country in 1918, some virtually catatonic, others alternately lucid and stable, most experiencing tics, tremors, palsy and various manifestations of the Parkinson-like illness. Following the medical hype surrounding L-DOPA, then seen as a miracle drug, many of these patients were administered the drug and virtually all of them reacted to it in powerfully dramatic ways. Some were jolted out of a decades long sleep. For example, Rose R., had been in this comatose state since 1926 and was severely traumatized to realize that over 40 years of her life were gone and that she had awakened to a world of the future. Rose knew that it was 1969 but just wished that it were 1926. Each of the patients reacted in a wholly unique way, reinforcing Sacks‚Äô belief that too much of the emphasis of modern medicine has been placed on a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô therapy that is assumed to work the same way every time in every circumstance. He contends that modern medicine has dehumanized patients and reduced them to numbers and statistics on a massive medical chart. Just as each of us have unique personalities, so each of us have unique biological and psychological compositions that results in each person reacting to uniform stimuli and medication differently.Sacks structures the book in a way that illustrates his therapeutic philosophy. His introduction provides historical background on the sleeping sickness that afflicted a large number of people during the 1920‚Äôs, along with explanations of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Parkinsonism, the institutional structure of Mount Carmel and the emergence of L-DOPA‚Äôs use. The next section is a collection of case studies, narratives of the experiences of 20 of the patients that were given the drug at Mount Carmel in 1969. The third, ‚ÄòPerspectives‚Äô provides conclusions and commonality in the arc of the trajectory common to most of the patients as they improved, then reverted in response to varying dosages of L-DOPA. His epilogue follows what happened to each of the 20 patients in subsequent years after the initial book publication. In essence, he is providing the medical foundation of the story, followed by individual narratives, followed by therapeutic and philosophic conclusions. As he states:‚ÄúRunning throughout the book is a metaphysical theme‚Äîthe notion that it is insufficient to consider disease in purely mechanical or chemical terms; that it must be considered equally in biological or metaphysical terms, i.e., in terms of organization and design.‚ÄùWhat ensues is a book that has a split personality. We are reading psychological ‚Äòcase histories‚Äô, complete with medical jargon and terminology for describing symptoms (a glossary of medical terms is supplied) alternating with Sacks‚Äô very subjective rendering of the personalities of the patients along with his personal assessments. He includes quotes from poets ranging from John Donne to T.S. Eliot and allows himself to wax poetic and go on philosophic tangents with references to Leibniz and Kant. Just as he fictionalizes Beth Abraham Hospital where he worked into Mount Carmel, he presumably uses fictitious names for his 20 patients i.e. Rose R., Frances D., Aaron E., Leonard L. This personalization is at odds with his formal referral to them throughout their section as Mr. L., Miss I., etc. Although he attempts to treat each of them as unique cases, most of them begin to run together, with a few standing out as more distinct and memorable. Some of these patients are quite articulate. Rose R., for example, describes her condition:‚ÄúOnce I get going I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like being caught between mirrors, or echoes, or something. Or being caught on a merry-go-round which won‚Äôt come to a stop.‚ÄùHe concludes his case histories with Leonard L., the character so movingly portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film. Leonard is the most literate and literary patient on the ward. During the times when he had ownership of his faculties he would write brilliant book reviews. Sacks admits that he learned more from Leonard than from any other patient he ever had and that he deserves a book to himself. Leonard had intermittent times until his thirties when he was somewhat functional. He was always a compulsive reader and would continue reading even when he was otherwise unable to communicate. He experienced a particularly codependent relationship with his mother. His mother needed to be needed as much or more than he needed her. His reaction to L-DOPA was particularly erratic. He became vitalized, filled with curiosity and awe with everything at first, feeling compelled to suck the marrow out of every bit of life he encountered. This tipped over into compulsive and destructive tendencies as he became overly sexual, accosting nurses and staff to the point when he was physically rebuffed, considering himself a new messiah, expounding the gospel of L-DOPA. He would masturbate compulsively or he would write his autobiography for 12 to 15 hours a day. He was particularly tragic in that he was aware of what was happening to him and that he was teetering out of balance into a chaotic unknown. He articulated the dilemma of all the patients when he wrote at the end of his autobiography, ‚ÄúI am a living candle. I am consumed that you may learn. New things will be seen in the light of my suffering.‚Äù Leonard is the tragic Hamlet of this tale. He obviously moved Oliver Sacks and he was the most relatable character for me.I commend Oliver Sacks for his very humane, compassionate approach to these patients, which he considers extraordinarily courageous and tenacious. I applaud his approach toward treating pathologic neurological conditions, even if I consider that his execution falls a bit short of his aspirations. I have seen YouTube interviews with him and I can see that he was a very warm individual and I can understand why patients would trust him with their lives. ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô is a fitting epitaph that does justice to these noble sufferers and presents a medical approach that I wish more doctors would apply."

There was also a pandemic of a, to me, much more terrifying illness. Influenza is scary because it has the potential to kill so many of the people it infects. While encephalitis lethargica killed roughly 30% of its victims, it left the survivors with a variety of movement disorders, tics, catalepsy, and so on, that left these people with existences that many might consider worse than death. In Awakenings, Dr. Oliver Sacks shares a series of case histories of people with post-encephalitis who were treated with a new ‚Äúwonder drug‚Äù called L-DOPA in the summer of 1969. This deeply human and humane series of case studies reveals the complications of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù from years of immobility and nothingness and heart-breaking after effects of L-DOPA that were sometimes worse than the patients‚Äô original conditions.

It was the first movie I cried in--a profound moment in my development. Now, over 20 years later, I've finally read the book that inspired Penny Marshall's adaptation.Oliver Sacks is a remarkable writer, especially for a physician and scientist; his prose makes his real-life characters vividly alive in my mind. His approach to this book was unique, especially in 1973 when it was first published. It is essentially a series of medical case-histories, but written for a popular audience. Sacks' approach was brilliant in that it retained a level of professionalism that entrenched his work with the medical community, yet it had a level of readability that made it reach far into the public. It thus raised overall levels of understanding about Parkinsonism and other broader medical issues.The application of broader medical topics to Sacks' discussion of post-encephalitic Parkinsonism is really the true genius of the book. After completing his case histories, Sacks engages in a discussion of the treatment of disease (using the patients at hand as a launching point) that calls for a revised approach to medicine for both doctors and patients. I won't go into it here, but I will say that he makes some very important and thought-provoking points. Give the book a read.I held back one star because in spite of the book's surprising readability, it still has the faint earmarks of the work of a doctor. At times the writing wanders into the clinical, at which point Sacks usually reins it in, but a bit too late. He also uses a LOT of unfamiliar medical and neurological terms that make certain parts--especially toward the beginning--difficult to understand. There is a glossary of terms in the appendix, but it is not comprehensive enough.Still, I highly recommend this. "
272,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,3,"I really enjoyed reading all the encephalitis lethargica cases in this book. It made me think of how awesome human brains are. Human brains are incredibly interesting and mysterious at the same time. Through Dr. Sacks meticulous and lyrical writing, one can tell that Dr. Sacks was a very compassionate physician. His humanity shone through his reflections on these cases, and his opinions on the health care system.This is the second book of Dr. Sacks' I have read. I haven't gotten tired of his narratives; however, his writing does drag on a bit from time to time. And the amount of footnotes in this book! It was rather distracting.The movie adaptation sort of amalgamated symptoms from different patients and made new patients out of the real ones. The movie had a more upbeat flavour to it and it eliminated many of the common (somewhat grotesque) side effects of L-DOPA, which I guess would be too disturbing for some viewers. I would recommend both the movie and the book. It's a 3-star book for me."
273,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274569-tanya,5,"After having read another Oliver Sacks book, I picked this up just because I enjoyed the 1990 movie with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. This turned out to be an amazing story. The book is about Dr. Sacks's actual experiences with a new drug and several dozen patients suffering from post-encephelatic lethargica, a form of Parkinsons. Unlike Dr. Sayer in the movie, Dr. Sacks encountered a wide variety of responses to the drug, L-dopa. In fact, every patient's response was unique although most of them followed a pattern of ""awakening, tribulation, and accommodation."" For the first 200 pages, I had a hard time putting the book down but I got somewhat bogged down in his wrap-up in the last 50. It was more difficult to understand and wasn't holding my attention, but I got through it, still with a tremendous appreciation for what he did, what these patients went through before and after the drug, and the intricate workings of the human brain. "
274,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93853-simon,4,"More engrossing than the fact that Dr. Oliver Sacks' 'extinct volcanoes' (post-encephalitic patients) 'awoke' after having received L-Dopa are the reports of how these patients coped with their individual ""eruptions."" Despite having their 'higher faculties' (intelligence, judgment, humor) undisturbed by their crippling illnesses, most patients emerged gloriously from years of 'Sleeping Sickness' only to relapse - forcing either a troublesome accommodation to 'side effects' or a complete pre-dopa reversion. Worse yet was the inevitable addiction patients suffered to L-Dopa, despite Sacks' efforts to 'titrate' their medications and 'balance' their hyperbolic states. Though repetitive in their lessons, the book's numerous prologues and epilogues provide sufficient background on Parkinson's Disease, the 'Sleeping Sickness', Western medicine, and the patients' fates to round out the story."
275,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/394959-susan,5,"This is clearly Sacks' piece de resistence, and you can tell because it's been through a half-dozen editions, all of which bear significant revisions and new footnotes. And there's a reason. I was deeply affected by the case studies in this book, and you can see Sacks' wonder show through on the pages.On the down side, it contains too many footnotes, many of which are random tangents to the subject. I ended up skipping about 1/3 of them to keep the cohesion of the narrative.It's worth reading the voluminous appendices. The basic story of the L-Dopa trial on post-encephalitic patients is a pretty depressing one, all told. But subsequent advances that Sacks describes in the later versions gives the whole thing a great note of triumph. "

After reading ""Hallucinations"" I decided to settle in and finally read this one. It took a while to get into it--up until the case studies--then it took off. Amazing, beautiful, heart-breaking, strange--some of the stories read like horror fiction. This edition of the book is also odd (I don't know if there's a newer one): there are so many footnotes added that it's like there's a separate book in fine print running along the bottom of almost every page. Some footnotes go one for several pages, almost David Foster Wallace-like. I'll try to read/re-read more of his books this year."

Oliver Sacks was not as easy to understand as he is in the fantastic The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.Although the epidemic that these people experienced in the early twentieth century appears to be as mysteriously gone as it was mysterious begin, I believe we need to be aware of the past and to remember the people who endured its hardships. Moreover, we do well to remember how fragile our lives and health are and live with gratitude. We, too, are not immune to future ""plagues.""

Sacks' descriptions of the people he came to know in the hospital and of how the disabling symptoms of the disease affected the course of their lives was so heartrending that I couldn't get past the first couple of patient accounts. The book, first published in 1973, is incredibly relevant today because of how thoroughly Sacks chronicles the false hope of the ""miracle drug"" L-DOPA, and in doing so highlights the very currrent headlines regarding drug companies and their practices.

In historical context (considering the pushback from the academic neuroscience community) this makes sense, but to me, it made the book a less enjoyable read than his others (like Hallucinations, or The Man who mistook his wife for a hat). I would still recommend this book for the wonderfully descriptive case studies, but I have to admit that I gave up on many of the footnotes and ended up skimming a lot of the final commentary."

That illness then gets replace with another coping mechanism, which we call a side effect. The greatest value from this book comes from the reminder that we are whole beings with experiences and unmet needs that cannot be met with the addition of a drug or drugs. Here are some notes that I jotted down while reading.One third of the way through the book, in every case so far Oliver Sacks increased the does to 3 grams/day and saw bizarre symptoms (problems were sometimes there before the dose increase). It made me wonder if a smaller dose might have been more effective. But no, getting the dosage right was a balancing act that tended to get more difficult after the patient had been on L-DOPA for a while.Lucy K was lucid for one day. Even increasing the dose to 5 grams/day did not bring her back. She died 2 years later. Several patients had a similar response: They tried the medicine that brought back some normalcy, found life still unacceptable, got discouraged and wasted away‚ÄúWe rationalize, we dissimilate, we pretend: we pretend that modern medicine is a rational science, all facts, no nonsense, and just what it seems. But we have only to tap it‚Äôs glossy veneer for it to split wide open, and revealed to us it‚Äôs roots and foundations, it‚Äôs old dark heart of metaphysics, mysticism, magic, and myth.‚Äù (Page 28-29 of 408)Miriam H at almost halfway through the book told the Dr. to resume L-DOPA and she wouldn‚Äôt have complications. He did and she continued to function well on it. Some other patients also correctly told how their future health would go.‚ÄúShe goes mad in your madhouse because she is shut off from life.‚Äù (Page 160)Some of his patients develop Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms early in life, others in their 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs.Footnote 88: ‚ÄúLife changes, powerful emotions, cannot only exacerbate, but can precipitate parkinsonism. ‚Ä¶ it has been shown that dopamine levels may be reduced in the brain by 30-50% without producing any clinical symptoms; but that if it is reduced still further, to less than 20% of normal, parkinsonian symptoms promptly appear.

Managed to achieve some level of a normal life with or without L-Dopa.Being trapped in the Parkinsonian state was described as: ‚Äòa mixture of nagging and pushing and pressure, with being held back and constrained and stopped. ... The absence is a terrible isolation and coldness and shrinking - more than you can imagine, Dr. Sacks ... a bottomless darkness and unreality. ... a sort of total calmness a nothingness, which is by no means unpleasant.

291,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"My 4th book from Sacks and it didn't disappoint. It tells the story of Sack's patients affected with either Parkinson or most often encephalitis lethargica, also known as sleeping sickness, which resembles Parkinsonism, with perhaps somewhat more severe symptoms. While the disease is known more for its motor symptoms, like bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity of the limbs, and postural instability, it also impacts mood and cognition. People become speechless and motionless as if their ""soul"" has left. The book brilliantly captures the lives and the experiences of these patients, and how they experience the world and themselves. The disease causes the death of cells in the substantia nigra (a region of the midbrain), which makes it not being able to have sufficient dopamine, which is largely responsible for motivational salience (motivation that elicits behaviour). In the 1950s and 60s, L-Dopa appeared as a treatment for Parkinsonism. Unlikely dopamine itself, it could pass the blood-brain barrier, increasing dopamine concentrations. The book describes Sack's experience with this treatment on his patients. As Parkinsonism progresses, people become more and more ""shutdown"", losing touch with reality and increasingly self-absorbed into a reality of nothingness. With L-dopa, however, most seem to experience an ""awakening"", and hence the title of the book. That awakening being extreme enough that sometimes people were miraculously cured, having little or no symptoms of Parkinsonism. Reading the stories of these patients, re-emerging into the world, and being cured almost overnight, feels like reading a novel. However, this miracle soon becomes apparent that this is indeed the real world, and while L-Dopa has recovered the souls of many patients, it's not always the case, and it's not free of complications. While a lack of dopamine causes a trance-like state, L-Dopa often seemed to cause an excess... of everything. Both motor and neurological. Rigidity is replaced by spontaneous irregular ticks, and cognition now seems to be in a pathological and permanent overdrive. Throughout the book, Sacks gives the stories of his patients and how they reacted to L-Dopa. When everything went right, when everything went wrong, and anything in between. An exploration of Parkinsonism, the hidden biological nature of behaviour, and as with all of Sack's books, an exploration of humanity. This book is a unique experience, and there are many things one can gain from it. Perhaps one that most stuck with me is how little we understand about the brain. How far away we are from making reliable predictions and being humble about its complexity and unpredictability, which Sacks tries to connect to chaos theory in one of the last chapters, being a new field at the time. I was constantly amazed at how in most of the stories, the reactions make almost no sense at all. One hopes that we finally achieved understanding. That we have a cure, and we can predict its outcome. But we can't. The massive amount of variance in relationship to L-Dopa, not only between patients, but in the same patient, and how often logic gets thrown out of the window, is baffling. I was also perplexed at how often psychology, in a more layman's terms, seemed to infiltrate neurology. This is supposedly a field rooted in biology, in objectivity. Yet, it's clear that a more subjective, personal, and human aspect of it remains. It's a painful reminder of our ignorance, and likely our flawed division of biological and psychological approaches. Awakenings is definitely Sack's magnum opus. A classic of neurology and I'd argue of the best non-fiction books ever written."
292,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1347421-diem,5,"The first time I watched the film version of ""Awakenings"" was probably in 1991. I would have been about 20 and it would have been about 6 years since my father's mind and body had been ravaged by a catastrophic stroke. Six years is a long time and time enough to adjust to a new life with a new kind of father but it was too soon to see the movie. There is a scene in which a woman is visiting the hospital to see her father and has lunch with Leonard, the character played by the incomparable Robert De Niro. She says this: ""Sometimes I think I see something. I think I see a change. And for a moment, I see him like he was before the stroke. And then it's gone. And I'm not sure that I saw anything."" Because of this scene and the fantasy wish fulfillment of neurologically impaired patients awakening from their affliction, I was heartbroken by the movie and remained so for months after seeing it. Fast forward 25-ish years and watching the movie with my teenaged daughter. While still deeply moved by the film, my soul wasn't crushed by it and I became intensely curious about the real story. Having just listened to Dr. Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" I was prepared for how scholarly and clinical his writing can be. Many people lament his clinical vernacular but I find that part easy enough to piece together. I have a layman's familiarity with neurology. That combined with a basic understanding of prefixes and suffixes can go a long way. If you understand hyperkinesia then akinesia should present no challenge. What bewildered and amazed me were his references to the great minds of a multitude of disciplines. He either quoted or referenced: Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, Hume, Schopenhauer, John Donne, Dali, Kant, Leibniz. And this is a truncated list. It is also important that no lesser minds than these informed both his writing and his work in the field of neurology. He addresses this importance in the chapter where he speaks of how fundamentally important it is to science to never neglect or abandon the ontological in pursuit of the purely empirical. This is his appeal, in my opinion, to all of the STEM obsessed students of today to enrich their education with the study of philosophy, art, music, literature and history. This need to be well acquainted with the whole world of human experience is poignantly illustrated by how critical HIS knowledge of such was to his work with post-encephalitic patients who challenged any previously understood notions of being and existence. Many of these victims of the ""Sleepy Sickness"" of the 1920s had been in a state of seeming frozen catatonia for 40 years. And yet, upon being administered the drug L-Dopa they were able to report, in clear and compelling language, that they had been conscious and aware the entire time. The clinical picture can only get you so far in your understanding of this phenomenon. If knowing that this nightmarish existence can occur outside the realm fairytales and sci-fi novels doesn't keep you awake for at least a few extra minutes, then you're doing science wrong. Some of my daymares involve memories of my father in the early years after his stroke trying to talk to us from his wheelchair. He would get started okay but then his brain would jam, almost visibly, and his mouth already contorted by right-side paralysis would contort even more grotesquely. Then garbled, ghoulish sounds would erupt from him where he clearly intended words to be. He would stop and start again several times to no avail and not infrequently this process would end with him punching the air with his left fist and screaming through angry tears, ""I know! Dammit! I know! But I can't say it!""I imagine that now, after reading Awakenings. But I imagine Leonard screaming and punching the air in only his mind. And with no one to hear him say it. And with no one even knowing he thought it. Because while he was screaming and punching in his mind, his body was frozen and his eyes glassy and vacant. It haunts me. The stories, beautifully presented case studies, from the hospital are gripping. Sacks presents each study in a, yes, deeply clinical way but also in a deeply personal way. Each 'case' is a fully fleshed out person with a backstory and a personality and a family. Not always a nice personality and not always a nice family, but this is a real story. I was deeply appreciative of how sensitive Sacks was in making each patient fully human. It was particularly important to me because my father spent several months, in a rehabilitative hospital once he left the regular hospital. He was on the head trauma floor and I remember my first visit there in flashes of great detail. The way the floor was more tightly secured than the regular hospital had been and the way my mother warned me before I went in, that it might be upsetting. What she was referring to, I quickly found out, was that unlike the regular hospital the head trauma ward could be loud. Very loud.At the time that my father was admitted, there was a patient on the floor that spent much of the day screaming. I don't recall him screaming anything in particular. Just his rage filled screaming as if he were in terrible pain. I do not remember what had happened to him but I have never forgotten his screaming. My father shared his room with a quiet young man named William who was not in the room the first time I visited. But he was there the next day when my mother dropped me off to sit with my dad for a few hours while she did some errands. I walked into the room and he sat up suddenly and said, ""Wow. You're so pretty.""No one under the age of 37 had ever told me I was pretty. I didn't have the kind of look that appealed to young people of that time. I was always popular with older men and could have dated any number of my dad's friends or my friend's dads had I been inclined that way. But I wasn't. Anyway, it wasn't lost on me that the first person within 10 years of my own age to tell me I was pretty was in the hospital for severe head trauma. William had been in a motorcycle accident and he was clearly in very bad shape. He had suffered considerable brain damage but seemed cheerfully unaware of it. Over the next few weeks I would meet his parents and his fianc√©e and they got used to me sitting in a corner, watching my dad sleep or stare blankly at the television. So used to me that I become the unwitting witness to a moment so private and awful that I recall it like it has just happened. William's fiancee was visiting. She was sitting in the chair right in front of the room's one large window. She was a young woman, early 20s, with puffy blonde hair. William sat next to her in his wheelchair. They were holding hands and she was trying to talk to him and he was being silly. But not in a cute way. In a disjointed, childish way. She suddenly stopped talking and her whole body visibly crumpled into itself. Her head sagged forward and her shoulders heaved but she remained absolutely silent. William suddenly stopped being silly. He wheeled closer and wrapped his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Please don't cry. Don't cry. It's going to be okay. We're going to be okay. I'm going to get better."" But, if William believed what he was saying, he was the only one. I was only 16 but I knew in that moment that she knew it wasn't going to be okay and William wasn't going to get better. I felt like I had just witnessed the moment that two lives had been violently and horribly changed forever. Two lives spectacularly but quietly exploding in front of a hospital window on a sunny afternoon.So, what I took away from that horrible episode and what I carry with me every time I visit or even pass a hospital is that every single window represents a set of lives and stories that will break your heart if you listen to them. And someone needs to listen to them. And that someone might as well be a physician. And that physician was Dr. Sacks. And he left us this book and this book is asking us to start caring about the stories. And it is especially asking doctors to start caring about the stories. I mean, it is doing a lot of other things too. It is too appalling that Sacks has written this tremendous book of a million layers and all I'm going to say about it is that I liked it and I think anyone considering going into medicine should read it. But, there are other reviews and my kids are asking to be fed. Read the book. "
293,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633038-jesse-field,4,"As Doris Lessing‚Äôs blurb on the paperback says, ‚ÄúIt makes you aware of what a knife-edge we live on.‚Äù The edge between functional cognition and severe pathology that calls into question what selfhood even means. Also the edge between fitting into society, more or less, and being rejected by it fully, as so many of us have worried over.I took in the narratives of the patients all at once, a rush of reading that leaves one harrowed, bemused, and, God help me, almost bored by the end. In the introduction and conclusion, Sacks‚Äô ability to squeeze such incredible meaning from his narrative drag me back to attention. The effective and anticipated climax was a brief questioning of the nature of scientific truth-seeking, a theme ever-present in this text:We have spoken of the Parkinsonian as ‚Äòlost in space and time,‚Äô and as harbouring a ‚Äòchaos of broken clocks and rulers.‚Äô One might say that these are Kantian formulations of his state, for they correspond with the central Kantian notion that space and time are the essential forms of experience, that space and time (or, rather, the sense of space and time) are ‚Äòconstructs‚Äô of the organism or mind. Thus, where we spoke previously of a relativistic or Einsteinian delirium, we might now, even more fundamentally, speak of a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô delirium ‚Äì and ultimate akinesia as being ‚ÄòaKantia.‚ÄôIf Kant, in his first Critique, dealt with space and time as the essential (‚Äòa priori synthetic‚Äô) forms of the experience (and thus of perception and motion), he deals in his other Critiques with agency, the will, ‚ÄòI‚Äô (and as ‚ÄòI‚Äô being defined by its will ‚Äì ‚ÄòVolo ergo sum‚Äô). Thus the considerations we have been impelled to require all of Kant‚Äôs thought.Are such considerations outside the proper domain of ‚Äòscience‚Äô? They are outside the science, for this not only denies the ideal forms of experience, but disallows any ‚Äòpersonal identity.‚Äô But they point, or so I believe, to a greater and more generous conception of ‚Äòscience,‚Äô which can embrace all the phenomena we have discussed. Such a ‚ÄòKantian‚Äô science, I think, is the science of the future.Thus, in what might appear an extraordinarily small field ‚Äì the study and treatment of post-encephalitic patients ‚Äì we find unexpectedly vast vistas emerging. We see before us, in exemplary form, the thrilling shapes of the medicine of the future, a perfectly rational yet practical scientific medicine, and an utterly beautiful and elemental ‚Äòexistential‚Äô medicine.Despite the rush of epiphany feeling generated in this passage, however, turning back to re-read leaves us as unsatisfied as when we review and write down our dreams. What position, or role, does the Will have from the second and third Critiques? Was Schopenhauer on the right track? Sacks merely grazes the surface of something here, then takes on the mantle of the logical positivist, preaching of a better future, even when the conflicts of his own humanity and the troubled history of Mt. Carmel Hospital would seem to indicate something less sanguine. Oh well. The work remains a powerful crossover from ethnographic narrative to dramatic production. And in what other story collection can we learn words like ‚Äúoculogyria,‚Äù ‚Äúpalilalia,‚Äù and ‚Äúfestinating.‚Äù One worries only slightly that we‚Äôve all made a circus of the patients, for it seems okay as long as we remember, we are part of the circus, too."
294,0375704051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035284-brian-bess,4,"When the sleepers wakeWhen I saw the 1990 film ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô, with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, I knew that lurking beneath the sentimentalized story was a more powerful one that could have been accepted as science fiction if it had occurred even a couple of decades earlier. What happened in 1969, at Mount Carmel Hospital (the fictionalized hospital where Oliver Sacks was a resident neurologist) was an extraordinary sequence of events impacting dozens of victims of sleeping-sickness aka encephalitis lethargica. These patients had varying degrees of affliction occurring in the wake of the influenza epidemic that swept the country in 1918, some virtually catatonic, others alternately lucid and stable, most experiencing tics, tremors, palsy and various manifestations of the Parkinson-like illness. Following the medical hype surrounding L-DOPA, then seen as a miracle drug, many of these patients were administered the drug and virtually all of them reacted to it in powerfully dramatic ways. Some were jolted out of a decades long sleep. For example, Rose R., had been in this comatose state since 1926 and was severely traumatized to realize that over 40 years of her life were gone and that she had awakened to a world of the future. Rose knew that it was 1969 but just wished that it were 1926. Each of the patients reacted in a wholly unique way, reinforcing Sacks‚Äô belief that too much of the emphasis of modern medicine has been placed on a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô therapy that is assumed to work the same way every time in every circumstance. He contends that modern medicine has dehumanized patients and reduced them to numbers and statistics on a massive medical chart. Just as each of us have unique personalities, so each of us have unique biological and psychological compositions that results in each person reacting to uniform stimuli and medication differently.Sacks structures the book in a way that illustrates his therapeutic philosophy. His introduction provides historical background on the sleeping sickness that afflicted a large number of people during the 1920‚Äôs, along with explanations of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and Parkinsonism, the institutional structure of Mount Carmel and the emergence of L-DOPA‚Äôs use. The next section is a collection of case studies, narratives of the experiences of 20 of the patients that were given the drug at Mount Carmel in 1969. The third, ‚ÄòPerspectives‚Äô provides conclusions and commonality in the arc of the trajectory common to most of the patients as they improved, then reverted in response to varying dosages of L-DOPA. His epilogue follows what happened to each of the 20 patients in subsequent years after the initial book publication. In essence, he is providing the medical foundation of the story, followed by individual narratives, followed by therapeutic and philosophic conclusions. As he states:‚ÄúRunning throughout the book is a metaphysical theme‚Äîthe notion that it is insufficient to consider disease in purely mechanical or chemical terms; that it must be considered equally in biological or metaphysical terms, i.e., in terms of organization and design.‚ÄùWhat ensues is a book that has a split personality. We are reading psychological ‚Äòcase histories‚Äô, complete with medical jargon and terminology for describing symptoms (a glossary of medical terms is supplied) alternating with Sacks‚Äô very subjective rendering of the personalities of the patients along with his personal assessments. He includes quotes from poets ranging from John Donne to T.S. Eliot and allows himself to wax poetic and go on philosophic tangents with references to Leibniz and Kant. Just as he fictionalizes Beth Abraham Hospital where he worked into Mount Carmel, he presumably uses fictitious names for his 20 patients i.e. Rose R., Frances D., Aaron E., Leonard L. This personalization is at odds with his formal referral to them throughout their section as Mr. L., Miss I., etc. Although he attempts to treat each of them as unique cases, most of them begin to run together, with a few standing out as more distinct and memorable. Some of these patients are quite articulate. Rose R., for example, describes her condition:‚ÄúOnce I get going I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like being caught between mirrors, or echoes, or something. Or being caught on a merry-go-round which won‚Äôt come to a stop.‚ÄùHe concludes his case histories with Leonard L., the character so movingly portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film. Leonard is the most literate and literary patient on the ward. During the times when he had ownership of his faculties he would write brilliant book reviews. Sacks admits that he learned more from Leonard than from any other patient he ever had and that he deserves a book to himself. Leonard had intermittent times until his thirties when he was somewhat functional. He was always a compulsive reader and would continue reading even when he was otherwise unable to communicate. He experienced a particularly codependent relationship with his mother. His mother needed to be needed as much or more than he needed her. His reaction to L-DOPA was particularly erratic. He became vitalized, filled with curiosity and awe with everything at first, feeling compelled to suck the marrow out of every bit of life he encountered. This tipped over into compulsive and destructive tendencies as he became overly sexual, accosting nurses and staff to the point when he was physically rebuffed, considering himself a new messiah, expounding the gospel of L-DOPA. He would masturbate compulsively or he would write his autobiography for 12 to 15 hours a day. He was particularly tragic in that he was aware of what was happening to him and that he was teetering out of balance into a chaotic unknown. He articulated the dilemma of all the patients when he wrote at the end of his autobiography, ‚ÄúI am a living candle. I am consumed that you may learn. New things will be seen in the light of my suffering.‚Äù Leonard is the tragic Hamlet of this tale. He obviously moved Oliver Sacks and he was the most relatable character for me.I commend Oliver Sacks for his very humane, compassionate approach to these patients, which he considers extraordinarily courageous and tenacious. I applaud his approach toward treating pathologic neurological conditions, even if I consider that his execution falls a bit short of his aspirations. I have seen YouTube interviews with him and I can see that he was a very warm individual and I can understand why patients would trust him with their lives. ‚ÄòAwakenings‚Äô is a fitting epitaph that does justice to these noble sufferers and presents a medical approach that I wish more doctors would apply."

There was also a pandemic of a, to me, much more terrifying illness. Influenza is scary because it has the potential to kill so many of the people it infects. While encephalitis lethargica killed roughly 30% of its victims, it left the survivors with a variety of movement disorders, tics, catalepsy, and so on, that left these people with existences that many might consider worse than death. In Awakenings, Dr. Oliver Sacks shares a series of case histories of people with post-encephalitis who were treated with a new ‚Äúwonder drug‚Äù called L-DOPA in the summer of 1969. This deeply human and humane series of case studies reveals the complications of ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù from years of immobility and nothingness and heart-breaking after effects of L-DOPA that were sometimes worse than the patients‚Äô original conditions. Above all, Awakenings stands as some of the best medical writing I‚Äôve ever read because of Dr. Sacks‚Äô approach to his patients‚Äîa blend of empathy, curiosity, art, and science...Read the rest of my review at A Bookish Type."

For this reason, I would rather urge you to watch the 1974 documentary of the same title and/or the 1990 Oscar-nominated film ""Awakenings"" that was subsequenly made with the help of the author, starring Robert De Niro and Robin Williams.
