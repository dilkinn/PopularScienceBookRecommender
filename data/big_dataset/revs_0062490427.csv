0,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,2,"I love dinosaurs. I have an early memory of being at nursery school and always running straight for the plastic dinosaurs at playtime. I was a dinosaur hog. The Land Before Time was one of my favourite movies. I watched Jurassic Park and had a recurring nightmare about a T.Rex trying to attack our house.They are so fascinating. Unbelievably huge reptiles that roamed the entire planet. Not only that, but it's so strange that we regard them as something of a failed species. Dinosaurs were around for 150 million years. The homo genus is only about 2.5 million years old, and homo sapiens have been around for a measly 300,000 years. Perhaps less. You think we have another 150 million years in us?So, yeah, I love dinosaurs.Problem is, I just couldn't stand Brusatte's writing. He obviously knows his stuff about dinosaurs, but I thought he made the potentially fascinating information very dry. And that's just when he's sticking to the subject. It gets far worse when he goes on long tangents about himself, name-dropping the people he's met and worked with. Unless it's a female paleontologist, in which case: who? You mean whatsisname's wife?I usually like it when non-fiction writers put a little something of themselves into their writing. It adds some personality and pulls you along for the journey, such as in Skloot's  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. But it helps if the writer isn't, um, annoying. Brusatte just comes across as a self-important nerd. There's too much about him, and it isn't enjoyable to read.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"

Hope A Tyrannosaurus Rex is a thing with feathers. 							 ----- Emily Dickinson Steve Brusatte
Wait, what? You’re kidding, right? Say it ain’t so. Well, there is some disagreement about this among paleontologists, but, according to Steve Brusatte, while they may not have matched up to Marc Bolan in a boa, and the feathers in question were maybe more like porcupine quills than the fluffy sort of plumage one might find on, say, an ostrich, those things poking out of the T. rex’s body were indeed feathers. And if you think the notion of a 40-foot, seven-ton eating machine, with ginormous, dagger-like, railroad-spike-size teeth bearing down on you, is scary, consider this. They travelled in packs. Sweet dreams! I have to confess that after reading this chapter, I did indeed have at least one dream that night that included multiple representatives of the T. Rex family. Not a wonderful image to induce one back to the land of Nod, after having bolted suddenly upright from REM sleep in fight-or-FLIGHT mode.  Hello, lunch - Image from The Real T-Rex BBC special – this one from the MirrorBut I promise, not all the revelations in The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs will make you reach for some extra alcoholic or pharmaceutical sleep inducement. What we know about dinosaurs has continued to evolve, at an accelerating rate. Some revelations in the book are surprising and delightful, like the fact that new dinosaur species are being discovered at the rate of about one a week, and that this has been going on a while. There is a lot of catching up to be done since we mastered the basic few, Triceratops, T-Rex, Brontosaurus, Archaeopteryx, Stegasaurus, Dimetrodon, and the usual gang of idiots. Much bigger gang to keep track of these days. [I strongly urge you to check out Brusatte’s U of Edinburgh lecture, linked in EXTRA STUFF, for some very decisively feathered other members of the T. rex family. Fluffy indeed!] Steve Brusatte - looking for Triassic vertebrate footprints in a quarry in Poland – image from palaeocast.com (Sorry, dear. I could have sworn I dropped the engagement ring right here!)Dinosaurs had a pretty long reign as kings/queens of the hill, but they had to begin sometime. Once upon a time all the land was one, linked from north to south, called Pangea. Monster monsoons raked much of the Earth, blistering heat, deserts, jungles, except of course at the poles, which were relatively balmy. This time, from about 300 to about 250 million years ago (mya) is called The Permian Period. Then, boys and girls, the earth split a seam. All that hot material that is constantly coursing through the earth found a way out and spewed forth. Not a good time to be an earthling. It is referred to as The Permian Extinction. 90% of all life was wiped out, by lava flows, fire, global warming, airborne particles blocking the sun, and thus a dramatic, if temporary end to photosynthesis, which killed off most plant life. And the ensuing acidification of water did seriously unpleasant things to aqueous life. But, after things settled down again, which took a while, a new class of critters came to dominate, dinosaurs. Yay! From Pangea to now – image from LiveScience.comThe Permian period was followed by the Triassic, from 250 to 200 mya, fifty million years of nature gone wild (I have that videotape in the attic, I think). Over the course of the Triassic, things on the land started to look like the world we know today. But the continents would have to drift for many millions of years yet before they would resemble our current landmass configuration. The first true dinos showed up around 230 to 240 mya. But they did not have the planet to themselves. There were reptiles, fish, birds, insects, even mammals, small ones, around at the time.Metoposaurus, Kermit’s g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-grandma, was an amphibian the size of a Buick, with a coffee-table-sized head, and, unlike those little critters you had to work with in bio lab, these pups had hundreds of very sharp teeth. It hung out by water’s edge to capture anything straying too close. Mostly fish, but watch your ankles.There is interesting material in here about what came before the dinosaurs, (dinosauromorphs, yes, really) and where the line is drawn (arbitrarily) between dino and pre-dino. You, here, you, over there. Like Middle East borders. Brusatte walks us through the timeline of the dinos, from conditions being established at the end of the Permian, their arrival in the Triassic, to their sudden farewell at the end of the Cretaceous. Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous. Go ahead, repeat that a few times. It’s the sequence of periods Brusatte covers here. The first three come in at around 50 million years each, with the Cretaceous hanging on for about 80. The last three, taken together, comprise what is known as the Mesozoic Era, aka The Age of the Dinosaurs. (Which makes no sense to me. Shouldn’t it be The Era of the Dinosaurs? Or the Mesozoic Age? It’s so confusing.) He shows what changed geologically, and how the changes allowed this or that lifeform to arise. (often by wiping out the competition). He also takes us along with him to dig sites around the planet, Scotland, Portugal, Poland, The American Southwest, South America, China, and more, and introduces us to some of the foremost scientists in the field.The characters in Brusatte’s tale are not all of the ancient sort. He populates each chapter with modern specimens notable for their diversity and sometimes colorful plumage. While they may all be brilliant scientists, many could easily be classified as Anates Impar. It would not be a huge stretch to imagine them populating a nerdish Cantina scene. Here are Brusatte’s description of three of them. There are many more. You can spot Thomas Carr, now a professor at Wisconsin’s Carthage College, from a mile away. He has the fashion sense of a 1970s preacher and some of the mannerisms of Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory. Thomas always wears black velvet suits, usually with a black or dark red shirt underneath. He has long bushy sideburns and a mop of light hair. A silver skull ring adorns his hand. He’s easily consumed by things and has a long-running obsession with absinthe and the Doors. That and tyrannosaurs.Thomas Carr - image from his Twitter pageBaron Franz Nopcsa von Felso-Szilvas…was literally an aristocrat who dug up dinosaur bones. He seems like the invention of a mad novelist, a character so outlandish, so ridiculous, that he must be a trick of fiction. But he was very real—a flamboyant dandy and a tragic genius, whose exploits hunting dinosaurs in Transylvania were brief respites from the insanity of the rest of his life…[he had] expertise in espionage, linguistics, cultural anthropology, paleontology, motorbiking, [geology, and god knows what else].The Baron - image from Albanianphotograpy.comJingmai [O’Connor] calls herself a Paleontologista—fitting given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia…she’s also the world’s number-one expert on those first birds that broke the bounds of Earth to fly above their dinosaur ancestors. Jingmai O’Connor - image from her Twitter pageBrusatte also shamelessly namedrops every A-list paleontologist he has encountered. Of course, it sounds like those encounters were substantial, so I guess it’s ok, but… I was reminded a bit of Bill Clinton’s memoir, in which it seemed that every person he mentioned had either changed his life or was a close personal friend. In a way, the book constitutes a this-is-your-life look at Brusatte’s paleontology career (boy meets bone?), with appearances by many of the people he had learned from or worked with. (they are legion) In addition to the studies mentioned in the book, he is the author of a widely taught textbook, Dinosaur Paleobiology. He is the paleo expert in residence on Walking with Dinosaurs (so much better than the sequel, Fleeing from Dinosaurs) on the BBC. One of the things that has allowed modern paleontologists to make and continue to make ground-breaking discoveries about Earth’s former tenants is the major advance in technology at their disposal. It’s a lot easier, for example, to see inside a fossilized skull to measure the size and shape of internal cavities with the help of a CT scanner than it was before they were available.A new dinosaur, feathered, winged Zhenyuanlong from China - image from The ConversationYou will learn some fascinating new information about dinos, some of it startling. This includes how sauropods managed those looooooong necks, why wild diversification happened when it did, why it took dinosaurs as long as it did to get large and take over. There is a fascinating bit on how some dinosaurs can pack an extra punch by getting air while they breathe in and out, surprising intel on how some of the critters you thought were dinosaurs aren’t, and directions on where you can look to see actual living dinosaurs today. He punctures some of the notions from the Jurassic Park movies. If trapped by a T-Rex, for instance, do not remain motionless. Rex has binocular vision and can see you perfectly well, whether you are sitting down in a port-o-san or hiding in or under a vehicle. Wave buh-bye.If you do not know what this is from you need to get out moreSpeaking of un-fond farewells, Brusatte take us up to and through the biggest bang of them all, on Earth anyway, 66 mya. His description of the horror that marked the end of the dinosaurs is graphic, and disturbing. 
 It was the worst day in the history of our planet. A few hours of unimaginable violence that undid more than 150 million years of evolution and set life on a new course. T. rex was there to see it.
 Look, up in the sky. It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s…Oh, shitArtwork by Donald E. DavisBrusatte has written an eminently readable pop-science history of the dinosaurs, with accessible info on geology, biology, and the work of paleontologists, who are laboring tirelessly (and maybe obsessively) to find out the answers to questions that are as old as humanity’s awareness of the erstwhile inhabitants of our planet. This is one of those books that should be in every household. You do not need to be a scientist to get a lot out of it. The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs, bubbling with the enthusiasm of its author, will be an enjoyable and enlightening read for homo sapiens of all ages from pre-teen through fossil. Learning more about Earth’s illustrious, impressive, sometimes terrifying, and sometimes adorable former tenants never gets old.

2,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,3,"Another ambivalent three stars for a book that has two strands of highly varying success in my opinion.The good part of the book is the clear and vivid writing about dinosaurs. I particularly liked learning new things about dinosaur-like creatures that lived among them but happen to fall outside the classification, and reasons why dinosaurs could evolve to be absolutely gigantic (those big sauropods) or fly. I liked reading about the nomenclature of new and unusual finds (it's not all Latin anymore). The section on the immediate aftermath of the asteroid strike is gripping and horrifying. (""But what fell from the sky was not water. It was beads of glass and chunks of rock, each one scalding hot."")The bad part is the writing about the author's personal experiences as he grew from an annoying, precocious teen (which he freely admits he was) into a working paleontologist. Frankly he comes off as more than a little self-satisfied--a sighting of the Jerkus brillianticus, if you will. His mentors and collaborators are uniformly amazing and brilliant and are described in a way that makes nearly all of them sound dull and interchangeable, an endless parade of brilliant bearded dudes drinking beer in exotic locales that are mainly described in terms of their nattering locals and unpleasant weather. (If you think I've used the word ""brilliant"" a lot in this paragraph, you won't believe this book!) Though he names several women paleontologists in these pages, he rarely seems to work with any of them, and notes with apparent enjoyment crass jokes at bars and commentary about their physiques from a speaker at an international conference. The personal recollections strike a disagreeable note that undercuts one of the goals of the book, which is to show how cool it would be to be a paleontologist.Bottom line: Read this, while holding your nose a little bit, if you're interested in dinosaurs.Review copy received from Edelweiss.Edited to add: I am going to close the comments on this, since no one seems capable of talking about dinosaurs, but the question of examples from the book was a fair one. This review was very hard to write since the review copies specifically ask you only to quote from the finished book, which did not exist yet, so I was avoiding direct quotes. However, I have patiently waited for a library copy and spot checked a few passages that I could find by searching my Kindle copy for specific terms. Two of the most objectionable parts that I would have quoted have been changed. In the midst of a favorable description of a hedonistic conference in Argentina (steak, drinking, dancing, etc.), the review copy mentions ""an outrageous quip about the physical qualities of the foreign women in attendance."" On page 42 of the finished book, the text now reads ""an outrageous quip about some of the foreigners in attendance""--which makes the edit fairly obvious because the resulting sentence doesn't make a lot of sense. On page 346 of the final book, what had originally said ""crass inside jokes"" was edited to ""inside jokes."" (I hope the publisher will forgive the forbidden quoting here.)I'm guessing the editor jumped in here, and kudos to them for doing so, but it doesn't change my overall feeling about the book. Three stars is not one star, folks! The book had some good parts (the information about the dinosaurs) and some bad parts (where the author talks about himself). This is hardly scintillating memoir from someone who thinks that ""he never lets his students pay for beer"" (finished book pg. 289) makes someone a really cool and interesting person. If you think so too, you can read this book without even holding your nose as I originally suggested. If you don't, you can still read it."
3,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68050592-lori,3,"I loved the parts about dinosaurs. Fun facts, history, evidence and speculation on behavior, recent discoveries, distribution as the continents divided and spread out. It's a compact assessable update on dinosaurs large and small. Oh, just another coelophysis, no this is something new!I tuned out the sections of the author's personal experience. I wasn't interested. Based on other GR reviews, that's probably for the best."
4,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra,4,"Now that I am an expert on dinosaurs......lol, not even close to being an expert but I did learn a lot from this book. For instance, new species of dinosaurs are still being discovered, they weren't always big, and about the big ""bang/meteor"" which ended their reign on earth.My interest in dinosaurs occurred the same way that most people's interest was piqued. Through museum visits and television. Land of the Lost anyone? My sister and I loved watching it on Saturday mornings - we were especially excited when the T-Rex made its appearance. Then there was Jurassic Park which knocked it out of the ballpark with the sound effects and frightening scenes of dinosaurs being well…dinosaurs...because, as Jeff Goldblum so eloquently put it ""life finds a way.""Life did find a way for millions of years. Brusatte writes about them in this book. He begins at the beginning literally and gives a glimpse into what their last moments might have been like. He details changes, both environmental, geographical and physiological. These prehistoric ancestors to some of our modern-day animals have intrigued man since fossils have been discovered. Many questions have been answered, while others are still out there. Theories on their demise have been around since their fossils have been discovered. This isn't just a book about dinosaurs, it is also a book about Brusatte's career, his friends, the excavations he was on, and other scientists/paleontologists he knows. Most of this I didn't mind. I love when people are excited about what they do. I interpreted most of it as him showing how he learned and who he worked with in the field. Did I need to know who went drinking with who after a fossil discovery, not really, but I didn't mind it. It was a day and a night in the life of a paleontologist. I recall how excited I was as child finding a fossil of a shell in a rock. I can only imagine how exciting it must be to actually find a dinosaur fossil - let alone a brand new one. This is a pretty meaty book as it holds a lot of information. He knows his stuff and and showcases his chapters with pictures and drawings. This is not a book someone can speed read through. But it was enlightening and entertaining at the same time. This book is full of facts but with the facts does come some conjecture. The Author is full of knowledge and shares it in a very readable manner. I found this book to be interesting and learned a lot, more than I ever did in school."
5,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-somebunny-reads-phoenix,4,"If, like me, you were a kid during the Jurassic Park era, you know that the new generations have an interest in dinosaurs which is ten hundred times less than we had in the 1990s. At the time, dinosaurs were everywhere: on TV, on our first computers, in video games, even in cereal boxes. Sometimes I can't help but being flabbergasted by the notion that today's kindergartners don't know what a dyplodocus is, or exactly how tall and heavy a brontosaurus was.  Of course, my notions about dinosaurs also stopped growing after a couple of years, with the result that the last time I updated them, little Tim was still complaining about how crazy the theory that some of them may have learned how to fly was.Brusatte literally tells us that seagulls are dinosaurs, which is cool I mean, I was so sad when they all died in that tragic accident with the meteor and mass destruction and stuff. But that is not the only reason why I am glad I read this book. Not all scientists are writers, and even less are good writers. Just because your mind literally overflows with knowledge, doesn't mean that you are also good at sharing it with others. This book, in my opinion, shows that Brusatte is not only good at his job, but also at making other people interested in what he has to say: last time a book about dinosaurs became so famous, there were only two Jurassic park movies.This book is not as much the history of dinosaurs as it is the story of how that history has been discovered: inside it, paleontologists are nothing less than detectives who use everything in their power to reconstruct events that happened hundreds of millions of years ago. I enjoyed being engrossed in this book, but two things always prevent me from liking any ""pop science"" book at a five star level, and I found them in this one as well.First is the idealization of the character of the scientist: in these books, professors are nothing less than real life Indiana Jones, with brains as big as a star ship and looks like Captain America. Their personalities are always charming and they have more fan girls than a rockstar. I understand that part of the reason for doing so is to keep the public interested, but part of it is genuine fanboying and blind adoration from the writer. Unfortunately, having studied and then worked in a University for almost ten years and having been in close contact with some of these superstar professors, I found out that these people are, for the majority, very different from how the public perceives them. Their flamboyant style and eccentric personality are often the result of a self-absorbed, narcissistic and sometimes borderline sociopathic personality. You can spend a couple of interesting dinners with them and being completely fascinated by their discoveries, you can listen to their speeches for hours, but don't try to marry one of them... not that I have a personal experience with that of course 😂 (jk, I totally do).The second issue is that many of these scientific writers tend to present their discoveries, and in general the state of the art in a specific field as it is today, as the ultimate science Truth that finally answered all the questions we had in the past surrounding a specific topic. In reality, within ten years we will probably read a new book on these topics that will completely change everything that is said here, and that will also be presented as Truth. Let's never forget that every scientific theory, as revolutionary and clear as it can be, is exactly what it is: a theory, and every knowledge is temporary.This book was one of the best, most interesting pieces of non-fiction I read this year. I recommend it to anyone who has or had interests in this topic, and also to anyone who wants to get started on dinosaurs! But remember guys:"
6,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"Unlike many people, I've never been fascinated by dinosaurs. I don't recall learning about them as a child, though perhaps I did and my interest wasn't piqued enough to remember. I think my only exposure to them was via the cartoon The Flintstones. I didn't get much of a science education as a child but as an adult, science (all areas that I've learned about) is one of my favourite subjects and my favourite type of book to read. So it's a bit odd that I didn't feel compelled to read or learn about dinosaurs -- until now. Prior to its publication whilst preparing a book order for my library and reading about it, I knew it was one I would want to read. When it arrived and I saw its cover, I was entranced and almost bumped it ahead in my TBR list. It's better to prolong the anticipation of something good though, so I waited until it came up next in my TBR list, to read it. Wow oh wow! I can see why this won the Goodreads Choice Award 2018 for Science!The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World is an utterly fascinating and absorbing read! Stephen Brusatte is a paleontologist who specializes in the evolution of dinosaurs. In this book, he brings his vast knowledge of all things dinosaur to us. With the latest research at his fingertips, he discusses how and why dinosaurs came to rule the Earth. He details the evolution and anatomy of many of the species (in my prior ignorance, I assumed there were only around 25 or so species, most notably T. Rex and Brontosaurus. I was amazed to learn that we know of over 700 different species of dinosaurs! Incredible!!) I had no clue that most dinosaurs probably had feathers, or that they came in a rainbow of colours, sometimes iridescent, and we can tell from fossils what those colours were -- even though the fossils themselves lack pigment. We learn that wings probably first evolved as a display feature to attract mates and frighten enemies, and only gradually and accidentally evolved into something that would enable flight. We learn that a teenage T. Rex would have gained on average 5 pounds a day in order to reach its vast size. I hope they weren't as weight conscious as humans teens!Mr. Brussatte doesn't just tell us about dinosaurs, but also about the world they thrived in, so very different from the earth humans have always called home. There is so much information on Pangea, its climate and eventual breaking apart that I found extremely interesting. He paints such a vivid picture of the world the dinosaurs inhabited. He tells the story of what the dinosaurs would have experienced in the moments after the asteroid or comet struck 65 million year ago, ending the Cretaceous period.... and the reign of the dinosaurs. He tells us why and how these great and diverse creatures went extinct except for birds, and why some mammals survived when the dinosaurs could not. He tells us the story of how a scientist named Walter Alvarez figured out that an asteroid or comet had struck the earth and was responsible for the dinosaurs' extinction. It was all so very captivating!These topics and so many others are discussed in this book and I think it will be of interest to many people. It's written for the lay person and one (obviously) does not need to have prior knowledge of dinosaurs in order to understand and enjoy this book. I went from no interest in and little knowledge of these creatures to now wanting to become an amateur fossil hunter! Kudos to Stephen Brusatte for writing such a brilliant book!"
7,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,4,"Steve Brusatte takes the reader deep inside his extensive research as a palaeontologist to explore the world during the time of the dinosaurs. Offering thrilling facts and great anecdotes, this is one piece sure to be talked about for years. Choosing to discuss a topic that has likely enthralled most readers at some time or another, Brusatte seeks to help the reader better understand the world at the time of dinosaurs, including how Earth changed to facilitate dinosaur emergence, the various ecological and atmospheric happenings that helped support their existence, and some of the accepted theories about their extinction. Tackling hundreds of millions of years in this piece, Brusatte makes the journey highly informative and light-hearted, providing the reader with numerous facts about the time, as well as stories from past palaeontologists who discovered many interesting facts, based on fossils. Looking to explain some of the groupings of dinosaurs, Brusatte offers up some interesting tidbits about their connection and how they evolved over time, contrasting them with others—how and why the T-Rex differed from the brontosaurus, for example—and providing a better understanding of how they lived. With detailed discussions and an entire chapter dedicated to the most famous of all dinosaurs, Brusatte also seeks to dispel some of the myths that books and films have sought to use to their advantage. He also takes the latter part of the book to engage the reader in the evolving debate over dinosaurs as being predecessors to birds or simply distant relatives, and ends with a thrilling discussion of dinosaur extinction. The world of dinosaurs comes alive, making the journey one of constant learning and fact-based discussion, superimposed with some of his own personal experiences on the hunt for new discoveries. Those with an interest in the subject will likely find this a wonderful read, which mixes some technical discussion of the world of palaeontology and suspected means by which these creates lived millions of years ago. Recommended to those who are curious about the subject, in hopes that it will spurn discussion and further personal research.I like to think that I took an interest in dinosaurs as a child, perusing them at museums when given the opportunity. I saw some of the movies based on Michael Chritchton’s books as well, which instilled some of the fear factor as it relates to the more carnivorous reptiles. However, unlike Brusatte, I did not have the same passion he possesses, which makes my reading of this book a little more of a challenge. Those who know me and my reviews will understand that I love to learn, something that Steve Brusatte helped with repeatedly in this piece. His detailed discussion, not only of the setting but its key players of the time, brought history to life in a way I had not thought before. As the narrative progressed, layering other discoveries from an earlier era helped to add depth to this book, which spends part of its time focussed on Brusatte’s studies and personal explorations. One theme that emerges throughout is that the evolution and downfall of the dinosaurs was by no means sudden—as in, a single event, per se—or uniform, but rather part of the evolutionary process the Earth undertook over time. Biblical literalists will bemoan much of the research and discussion that denotes the millions of years this took, but Brusatte is able to support his arguments with strong facts and details from many digs throughout the world. With easy to comprehend chapters that lead the reader throughout the dinosaur process, Brusatte offers much for the reader who may be a layperson when it comes to fossils and excavation. Brilliant in its delivery, it is one piece that should not be missed by anyone with an interest in the subject.Kudos, Mr. Brusatte, for pulling me in from the opening chapters and helping me to appreciate more of the world’s early inhabitants.

Gross. Overall, read the sections about the dinosaurs and skip the parts about his personal experiences. I listened to the audiobook so I couldn’t skim the awful, masturbatory memoir stuff, which I found unfortunate. Every time he mentions a scientist, he turns it into a self-congratulating name drop. I wish the author had focused on the dinosaurs because that was the most interesting part and what I picked the book up to learn."

I watched the entire Land Before Time series, many many times, and would rewatch BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs so often that I can still quote large segments of it verbatim despite not having watched it for over a decade. I didn't know about this book until it won the Goodreads Choice Award for best non-fiction in 2018, and I knew I had to read it. Even though my obsession with Dinosaurs has faded, I still find the humongous animals that roamed the earth we stand on right now so freakin fascinating. They seem so alien and out of this world, its hard to really fully process they very much were alive and thriving 150 million years ago. The information in this book was definitely interesting - when it related to the Dinosaurs. Research indicating Dinosaurs had feathers, information on new species such as a bad winged Dinosaur, crucial to understanding how Dinosaurs evolved into todays birds, explanations of how we know what colours Dinosaurs are, and conclusive proof that it was an asteroid that wiped out the Dinosaurs for good. But that was kind of outweighed by the author - who was often incredibly annoying and injected his own story and relationships into the story way too often. He's like that guy in your class who is absolutely desperate for everyone to know he is, in fact, the smartest person in the room. The way he name dropped colleagues was not only annoying, but also confusing, as all the names got jumbled into one (and I was expected to remember them despite only being mentioned once 500 pages ago). The sexism also was a bit off-putting, especially one section that made me actually cringe - where the author gleefully recounts a palaeontologist event where the speaker spent his time talking about the bodies of female palaeontologists and talking about how many he had slept with. It reeked of the awkward nerdy boy in high school who said awful things about women to try and sound cooler but just ended up sounding like a dick everyone hated. If you want to know about Dinosaurs, including so much emerging research you definitely would not have heard about before I do recommend this - but go into it with a huge grain of salt because the author was A Lot in my opinion. I couldn't skip his personal stories on the audiobook, but I would do that if you're reading physically.Now, enjoy this picture of T-Rex drawn with the feathers they absolutely had"
10,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,0,"Fun 🦖 dinosaur 🦕 hunting tales old and new told in a light and airy style. A decent explanation of the shaky advent of dinosaurs in the early Triassic, which I didn’t know. Then around 220 million years ago, we move into the splitting up of Pangea and the long season of volcanic activity, say, 20,000,000 years, during which many non-dino species were wiped out. This was the big opportunity dinosaurs had been waiting for. What the book provides is the long chronology of dinosaurs and their appearance and development over 240 million years. A number of vexing questions are addressed, like how could the largest of the dinosaurs have managed life at such titanic size? The brontosaurus for instance? One key reason was their exceedingly long necks which permitted them to reach higher into trees; Brusatte says it permitted them to eat the “huge meals necessary to put on excessive weight.” Second, was their astonishing ability to grow from “guinea-pig size hatchlings to airplane-size adults in only about 30 or 40 years.” The third feature was the development of a special new kind of lung. This unidirectional lung, seen today only in birds, was able to inhale air, yes, but also to save a little air and pass it back across the lung again on exhalation. This extra breathing efficiency made it possible for the animals to keep their large body masses cool. As part of the lungs the dinosaurs had a system of air sacs throughout their bodies. We know this because “...many bones of the chest cavity have big openings, called pneumatic fenestrae, where the air sacs extend deep inside. They are exactly the same structures in modern birds, and they can only be made with air sacs. The air sacs also have the added benefit of lightening the skeleton “when they invade bone. In fact they hollow out the bone, so that it still has a strong outer shell but is much more light weight... The vertebra were so engulfed by air sacs that they were little more than honeycombs, featherweight but still strong. And that’s advantage four: The air sacs allowed sauropods to have a skeleton that was both sturdy and the light enough to move around.”A fascinating if brief picture of dino-era predation is also given, which shows all the mechanisms of selection working superbly hundreds of millions of years before Charles Darwin came along to articulate them. They vanished after the Cretatious extinction event 66 million years ago when a meteor impact made the 112-mile wide Chicxulub crater (see Walter Álvarez) in the Gulf of Mexico.This might be the right guy to serve us in the stead of Stephen Jay Gould. There’s no one even remotely like SJG but Mr. Brusatte might be a viable substitute. If he’s going to fill those shoes though, he’s going to have to read widely in areas of interest that have nothing to do with paleontology; this as a means of developing his own inimitable encyclopedic style—which should remain light and airy. (Why can’t all my male authors look as nice as this one?)"
11,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30268418-tina-haigler,4,"""A FEW HOURS BEFORE LIGHT broke on a cold November morning in 2014, I got out of a taxi and pushed my way into Beijing's central railway station.""I had no idea how little I actually knew about dinosaurs, until I read this. I was obsessed as a kid. I would read anything and everything dinosaur related I could get my hands on. As an adult though, I've been seriously slacking, which became all too apparent when I picked up this book.This book covers from the period of Earth's history, before the first true dinosaurs came into play, all the way up to their extinction. It's absolutely fascinating! I have truly learned so much. You learn about plant life, Pangaea, how the world changed, about animals that lived among the dinosaurs, what the weather was like, the different environments, and so much more. It also contains first person accounts from the author's life, about his adventures fossil hunting around the globe with colleagues and teachers, as well as him studying and cataloging fossils with other scientists.I've read a lot of reviews that claim the author is sexist, but I didn't find this to be the case at all. Sure, he mentions more men then women, but the women he does mention, are praised for their knowledge and skill. Where others saw a misogynist, I saw a man who highly respects his female colleagues. Also some people didn't enjoy reading about his personal adventures. I found that the stories of fossil hunting and groundbreaking discoveries broke up the monotony of the cut and dry scientific information, and that without it, the book would've been rather dull. After all, my brain can only soak up so much at once.So if you love memoirs, dinosaurs, paleontology, geology, or any of the other related sciences that go along with fossils, this is a must read. However, if memoirs, dinosaurs, or science bore you, this simply isn't the book for you. Personally, I'll probably read this book more than once.""If it could happen to the dinosaurs, could it also happen to us?"""

There I said it. As a young boy, I hated anything that could be associated with ""boys"", ""men"" or ""masculinity"". Not in a sexist way. I just had undiagnosed gender dysphoria. But that's not what I am here to talk about today.Even though I don't have much interest in dinosaurs, I still enjoyed this book. Mind you, that isn't because I understood a single word of what he was saying but because I could feel the pure joy and passion. It was almost like the author was sitting across from me, trying to explain to me the wonders of his world, smiling and stumbling over his words as one does when they are ecstatic. That said, I was disappointed that I really didn't learn much because I couldn't understand what he was saying. Maybe it was me. Maybe not. I almost felt like I was missing something. Like, I had missed a class or seminar or previous book. Even so, I loved his writing style. He was funny, light-hearted and used creative metaphors and clever wording.| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram"
13,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31691644-jaya,4,"Dinosaurs!For me that word is enough to at least flip through the pages of a book. Brusatte's work can be easily considered as a layman's guide to dinosaurs. Really enjoyed the almost casual and anecdotal narrative by the author, made me feel less dumb for not knowing anything ""scientific"" about the species. Quite remarkable how fast I finished reading this one, considering that I take lot more time reading non-fics. It was definitely a hard-to-put-down/away kind of a book. I liked how the author busted a few myths about dinosaurs as have been portrayed in popular culture by stating reasons and explanations carried out through research done in the recent past. Extra points for the numerous illustrations and images of the locations and species that were mentioned.All this mention of dinos made me reminiscent of a day I spent last year with these species :DThat's a T-rex btw :)And adding this place as a definite MUST-VISIT for my next trip...

14,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56146790-whitney,4,"Overall: A brilliant combination of paleontology, research, and evolution detailing the rise and fall of the dinosaurs told by a dinosaur expert. Enthusiastic, fact-filled, and wonderfully written, anyone will learn and be captivated by this book 7.5/10Summary: Dr. Brusatte is an American paleontologist that now is a professor and consultant in Scotland at the University of Edinburgh and one of the most world-renowned dinosaur experts. 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs were wiped from the face of the earth. In this novel, Brusatte gives a detailed and exciting account of the evolution of the dinosaurs up until the mass extinction at the beginning of the Triassic period. Additionally, the book is filled with interesting stories from around the world as he progresses through his career as a paleontologist.The Good: “Somewhere around the world,” Brusatte writes, “a new species of dinosaur is currently being found, on average, once a week. Let that sink in: a new dinosaur every … single … week.”If that doesn’t get you excited, then maybe some of these facts will:•	Tyrannosaurus rex was strong enough to bite through a car •	Morocco and New York used to be connected during pangea•	Some of the dinosaurs could reach sizes of up to 50 tons!•	10,000 species of dinosaurs still exist While we talk about the fall of the dinosaurs, tens of thousands of species of dinosaurs are  still among us. We call them birds. You may not believe it, but “birds are just a weird group of  dinosaurs that evolved wings and learned to fly. The realization that birds are dinosaurs is  probably the single most important fact ever discovered by dinosaur paleontologists.”This book is awesome and the author absolutely brilliant. I loved the detail and research seeping through every sentence of this book. I mean, it literally oozes enthusiasm and I couldn’t help but get excited. Anything about dinosaurs is difficult to not be interested in, but this book really does take it to a new level. The writing is exceptional and he does a fantastic job at presenting the entire history and evolution of dinosaurs while also weaving in his journey as a paleontologist and recent discoveries that have been made. Highly recommend!The Bad: I do not have much to say here. I wish there was a bit more time given to the theories around why early dinosaurs survived the hell of the Triassic extinction, leaving them free of competitors and thus able to multiply and dominate? There is so much literature and discussion (not in this book I am talking in general) devoted to the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago and this is the first thing I have read that highlights their over 150 million year reign. Brusatte states “Far from being failures, they were evolutionary success stories.” Their fossilized remains can be found just about everywhere on earth and I do wish a bit more was devoted to theories as well as specifics, like anatomy and physiology, that helped them become so successful."
15,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"This book not only provides an overview of the current state of dinosaur research but also a history of paleontology and the characters who have worked in the field. It is a rapidly expanding field. Right now is the golden age of dinosaur research. Somebody, somewhere around the world, is finding a new species of dinosaur now, on average, once a week. So that’s 50-some new species a year, and that’s not a new bone or a new skeleton, that’s a totally new type of dinosaur that we never knew existed before.Prior to listening to this book, my knowledge of dinosaurs was based primarily on a smattering of news reports. Thus I previously had the impression that the bird-dinosaur relationship was a debatable hypothesis. But evidence now available seems quite convincing.The Liaoning fossils sealed the deal by verifying how many features are shared uniquely by birds and other theropods, not just feathers but also wishbones, three fingered hands that can fold against the body, and hundreds of other aspects of the skeleton. There are no other groups of animals, living or extinct, that share these things with birds or theropods. This must mean that birds came from theropods. Any other conclusion requires a whole lot of special pleading.Among the unique features shared by birds and dinosaurs is a respiratory system that provides highly efficient and light weight oxygen transfer system. No other species alive today has a respiratory system like this. To me this is the definitive proof of the relationship.Its amazing what can be deduced about dinosaurs by modern science. For example, dinosaurs had color. Through the use of melanosomes it has been inferred that feathered dinosaurs had a variety of colors which leads to the possibility that the feathers were developed for display purposes—peacock like—and subsequently turned into flying equipment through the evolutionary process.The author Brusatte leads the reader through the various stages of dinosaur evolution, beginning with the Triassic Period when their presence was not dominate. However a mass extinction caused by large and continuing volcanic eruptions cleared the way for dinosaurs to dominate during the following Jurassic Period. Brusatte devotes a whole chapter to the subject of T. Rex, the perfect “killing machine.” It is pointed out that their maximum life span was thirty years, and by the age of thirty they had a physic that would not allow them to run fast. Brusatte speculates that this may indicate that they hunted in packs because the T. Rex adolescents were lean and capable of running fast. The youth in the pack could catch the prey and the giant adults could move in for the kill. Measurements of the brain cavity show that, ""Rex was roughly as smart as a chimp and more intelligent than dogs and cats.” From the skeletal structure around the brain paleontologist are able to determine that the Tyrannosaurus possessed heightened sensory abilities and relatively rapid and coordinated eye and head movements. This included an enhanced sense of smell. It also had an enhanced ability to sense low frequency sounds that would allow tyrannosaurs to track prey movements from long distances. The book provides an imagined description of what it would have been like to be alive on earth 66 million years ago at the time of the crash of the mighty meteor that ended the Jurassic Period killing off the dinosaurs except for birds. It appears that species that burrowed, had the freedom to fly, and could scavenge on dead organic material for several years after the meteor were the only ones that survived. No mammals at the time were larger than a modern badger. From this description I am convinced that if a similar sized meteor struck the earth now that it's highly questionable whether any humans could survive.The following is a link to an excerpt from this book:https://mailchi.mp/delanceyplace.com/..."
16,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Like so many people, I went through a dinosaur phase as a child. It was almost inevitable. Growing up on the Upper West Side, I could visit the Museum of Natural History nearly every week. Natural selection has overcome many engineering problems—flight, sight, growth, digestion—and it has certainly not failed in its ability to awe little boys. I picked up this book to finally learn something about these ancient beasts.Any fair evaluation of this book must conclude that it does its job: it summarizes new discoveries about dinosaurs in accessible prose. Brusatte goes through the entire chronology of the group, from their beginnings as unremarkable reptiles which emerged after the great Permian-Triassic Extinction, to their gradual rise, growth, spread, and diversification, and finally to their eventual end—wiped out by an asteroid.There are many interesting tidbits along the way. Dinosaurs had the efficient lungs we find in modern birds, which are able to extract oxygen during the inhale and exhale. They also had primitive feathers, which looked more like hairs. Indeed, modern birds are dinosaurs in the strict sense of the word. I was particularly surprised to learn that Tyrannosaurus Rex lived and hunted in groups; and that they achieved their massive size extremely quickly—growing several pounds a day for years on end. I also appreciated Brusatte’s descriptions of the methods that paleontologists use—new statistical techniques for analyzing fossils, or piecing together ancient ecosystems, or determining rates of evolutionary change. Nowadays paleontologists to not merely look for old bones, but they study living animals to make hypotheses about the speed, strength, and size of these extinct creatures. One researcher even studied fossils under a microscope to deduce the color of the feathers from the indentations. Brusatte also covers some of the history of dinosaur research, which is surprisingly colorful—especially the tragic life of the Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás.So the book undoubtedly accomplishes its goal. My only complaint is the style. When Brusatte sticks to the science, he is clear and engaging. But whenever he chooses to embellish the story—which is rather too often—the prose becomes strained and grating. Here is a description of a seagull that opens his chapter on birds:When the sun breaks through for a moment, I catch a glint reflected in its beady eyes, which start to dance back and forth. No doubt this is a creature of keen senses and high intelligence, and it’s onto something. Maybe it can tell that I’m watching. Then, without warning, it yawns open its mouth and emits a high-pitched screech—an alarm to its compatriots, perhaps, or a mating call. Or maybe it’s a threat directed my way.In fairness, I did enjoy his description of what the dinosaurs would have experienced in the first few minutes after the asteroid impact.More irksome, however, were the thumbnail sketches of his colleagues, which are interspersed throughout the book. I would have understood the necessity of these passages if Brusatte were introducing a researcher who would play an important role in the book. Yet inevitably these researchers were introduced with fanfare only to be immediately dropped. What is more, Brusatte always focuses on the quirkiest aspects of these researchers, in a superficial attempt at coolness; and he also makes sure to tell us that he is one of their best friends.In one particularly aggravating example, Brusatte describes one researcher’s fashion (“leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos”), ethnicity (“half-Irish, half-Chinese”), hobbies (“raving and even occasionally DJ-ing in the trendy clubs of China’s suddenly hip capital”), and conversation style (“delivering caustic one-liners one moment, speaking in eloquent paragraphs about politics the next”). Does this add anything of value to the book?These stylistic irritations mar what is otherwise an excellent popular book about dinosaurs. And since these offending passages do not add anything to the substance of the book, my advice is just to skip on until he gets back on the subject of dinosaurs—a topic which brings out the best in Brusatte."
17,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"This is a fun look at the development and world of the dinosaurs. Stephen Brusatte stated the interesting recent finds regarding dinosaurs and speculated, from the evidence, what their world could have been like. The section of what happened when the asteroid hit Earth was frightening. Those poor beasts. There is some name dropping and a bit of ""patting one self on the back"" at one's brilliancy but then the top Scientists of all disciplines are brilliant, so perhaps that's an understood fact. Not annoying but noticeable throughout the book. All in all, I recommend this book if interested in the world that was at the time of dinosaurs. Lots of interesting information, told in an enjoyable, understandable way. "
18,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher,1,"The actual pop science part of this book is OK - a reasonably readable account of recent developments and discoveries in the sciences bearing of the history of the dinosaurs. If it had been edited to that level, it could have been a solid 3 stars.Unfortunately, there is a peculiar injection of personalities into this book, and unpleasant personalities at that - imagine a cross of Animal House with Raiders of the Lost Arc. I finished reading this book because of my interest in the science, but I had to grit my teeth frequently."
19,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-a-rather-bookish,2,"I love learning about dinosaurs. They fascinated me when I was in attendance at school, and as an adult, I find them even more so. What definitely doesn't fascinate me, is Steve Brusatte's writing, and the terribly irritating way he injects his own personal life story into this. Granted, he certainly knows his stuff, but I wanted to know specifically about dinosaurs, not what Steve Brusatte ate for breakfast approximately seven years ago.I'm not ashamed to admit, that as a child, Jurassic Park was one of my favourite films. It is tongue in cheek, but that car scene outside of the Tyrannosaurus paddock, I'll never forget it. There was some interesting information in here, but for the majority of the time, the way in which it was presented to the reader, made for tedious reading. I will definitely be searching for more books on the dinosaurs, but preferably some where the author isn't in love with the sound of his own voice. "
20,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92899807-lizzie,5,"An absolutely fascinating story of dinosaur life beginning at the end of the Permian and carrying through to modern day. This book was a pleasure to read and introduces a range of fantastic creatures, including dinosaurs so large their vertebrae were the size of bathtubs. It was incredible to immerse myself in a world of such size and breadth and to reflect on the resilience of the earth as it moves from the Permian to the present. "
21,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie,5,"I love dinosaurs. How insane is it to think that millions ago, those creates roamed the same lands we inhabit today? It is an idea that has fascinated me as a kid watching Disney's Dinosaur and (of course) Jurassic Park as much as it does today as an adult, getting excited about books by paleontologists like Steve Brusatte. The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is an absolute joy to read and now possibly my favorite book on the subject. Brusatte specialized in the anatomy and evolution of dinosaurs and uses this book to retell the story of those ancient creatures: from their first appearance in the Triassic era to them becoming dominant during the Jurassic Era only to eventually die out when an asteroid or comet hit the Earth. It is an approachable read and Brusatte is able to form a narrative that is both engaging and informative. This book particularly focusses on their evolutionary development, which I appreciated. We all know about evolution and how it operates, but I felt like reading this gave me a completely new understanding of how crucial and all-encompassing evolution is to all life on Earth. Even a tyrannosaurus rex didn't just pop up one day and decided to take the golden place at the top of the food chain, but could only become who he was after thousands of years' worth of development. Brusatte loosens the narrative up by adding personal stories, which are delightful if you are interested in paleontology as an academic field. He talks about various encounters with peers and his own heroes, their works and discoveries and thereby manages to evoke a vivid picture of what the world of paleontologists is like - including which questions of nature are yet to be answered. He also comes clean with some misconceptions we have about dinosaurs (yes, birds are dinosaurs, so technically they are not extinct and no, that iconic scene from Jurassic Park in which a T. rex chases the escaping jeep would certainly not have played out like that). This book is exciting. It made me realize how it is not just the stories we make up that are exciting. It is our own, real and breathing world that is."
22,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,5,"I found the information presented in this book to be fascinating. This is an absorbing scientific study which presents up to date discoveries and knowledge about dinosaurs and the facts should be accessible to any interested reader.  I admired Stephen Brusatte’s writing style and his brilliant description of three eras of the earth; the Triassic, Jurassic and the Cretaceous. He describes shifting geological patterns, the landscapes, climate, and types of animal life during each stage. He writes vivid scenes of the plant life and the dinosaurs roaming the earth or small creatures hiding away in burrows. He draws a terrifying picture of a series of cataclysmic events at the close of the Cretaceous era which lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs.I still have the book The Dinosaur Heresies published in 1986. Dr.Robert Bakker presented a new way of thinking about dinosaurs. His speculations were in collaboration with some paleontologists but stirred up a lot of controversy among others. He considered dinosaurs to be not the slow, lumbering, cold-blooded beasts, but warm-blooded, quick and intelligent. Far from a failure, they dominated the earth for 150 million years and suppressed the development of mammals. The theory presented was that birds are the direct descendants of small carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs had an advanced heart/lung system like modern birds and the theory was they were warm-blooded. Previously dinosaurs had been classified as reptiles, but scientific thought removes them from that category. The writer gives us some interesting bits about being a geeky boy obsessed with dinosaurs and later as a student of paleontology. He describes his travels in pursuit of a greater understanding of dinosaurs, and to excavation sites where new types of dinosaurs were being discovered. He has been criticized for name-dropping about his encounters and works with other leading paleontologists, but I found he wrote about them with respect, praising them highly and giving them credit for their theories and discoveries. I was impressed by how much the leading scientists in the field cooperate with one another. He relates his travels to China in the 1990s when the first small raptor dinosaur fossils were discovered with feathers, and with bone and lung structures which indicate they are the direct ancestors of birds. Further study has revealed that their feathers were brightly coloured and iridescent. They had not evolved for flight as yet. I saw a coloured illustration in the Smithsonian Magazine which showed a crow-sized dinosaur with a rainbow of shiny feathers. Its fossilized remains were found in China and the artistic reconstruction is quite beautiful.Recommended for readers interested in the history of the earth and past living creatures."
23,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44212467-fred-shaw,5,"What a fascinating and enlightening book. Well written, easy to read, and well, the characters are huge stars of the show. To me everyday is real important. What I eat, what I wear gets top priority. But let’s face it. In the scheme of time we are but a blip. I am in awe of the history the author tells. To put things in perspective, dinosaurs appeared and ruled the earth for over 250 mission years and their reign ended abruptly about 60 million years ago. Man walked erect 6 million years ago and the written word is about 5000 years old. The United States is only 243 years old. The author takes the reader around the world to remote locations to find dinosaur skeletons and geological manifestations that help to tell the history of of our environment. He works with leading scientists from China, Brazil, Scotland and the US to bring us the latest theories and facts about dinosaurs. For instance, they have discovered that some dinosaurs had colored hair like feathers that may have provided camouflage and that a T. Rex weighed about 12 tons, was as big as a city bus, consumed 500 lbs. of meat a day and traveled/hunted in packs. Did you know some birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs? I gave this book 5 stars and I highly recommend it."
24,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17237503-eilonwy,5,"This book was great! It does exactly what the title promises and tells the entire history of the dinosaurs, all 200 million years of it, from the evolution of dinosauromorphs all the way through the asteroid impact that killed most of the dinosaurs off. It uses geology and taxonomy to show how dinos evolved on Pangaea, spread out, then slowly got separated and diverged as the continents split apart. It also introduces the reader to an amazing cast of people who study dinos, some from the past and some that the author works with right now. I’ve always taken a sort of cursory interest in dinosaurs, as I love geology and evolution; when I travel I make a point to go to the local natural history museum, and always come home with some rocks. And yet my mental dino narrative went, “one day there were dinosaurs all over the Earth, just like boom,” or something to that effect. This book filled in all the gaps in my mental timeline. It also vividly portrayed the dinosaurs as living, breathing animals, part of many varied ecosystems, not just seemingly mythical creatures. And that vividness made me really, really sad when I got to the end. Even though I probably wouldn’t be sitting here writing this review had that asteroid not hit, I mourned the loss of these amazing creatures. At least we still have one branch of them around as modern birds. Stephen Brusatte has a great voice and a terrific ability to describe things in nerdy yet completely accessible detail. If you have any interest in dinosaurs at all, I recommend this book. "
25,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70492479-mara,4,"The sheer enthusiasm and passion that this man has for his profession radiates off every page, and for that alone, I really enjoyed spending time with Brusatte's pet subject. He brings a lot of verve to what is a fairly specialized field of knowledge (I should say that this book assumes a certain amount of familiarity with various paleontological terminology, but I think it does a good job providing enough context for you to pick up what he's talking about as you go), and somehow makes prominent paleontologists read like celebrities. I really enjoyed my time with this book, though it does get bogged down in some areas in a way that I think the very best popular science non-fiction does not. This also works well as a bunch of case studies for those interested in evolutionary biology, and I was very engaged by his discussion of how scientists figure out the evolutionary history of very species using comparisons to modern animals and good old deductive reasoning. All in all, definitely recommend!! "
26,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6595648-bam-the-bibliomaniac,5,"This book made me wish I was still a teacher. I could have built an entire unit around the information found in these chapters for all age groups. It can be simplified or really diversified for all abilities. I was especially taken with the relationship between birds and dinosaurs. I knew this was the case, but the arguments of evolution were so sound I don’t see how it could be debated. It was also immensely enjoyable to read about both old school Dinos like T Rex as well as new discoveries that I’m not even going to try to spell. "
27,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22548315-zachary-f,3,"Like many kids, I went through a major dinosaur phase. My bedroom was dinosaur-themed, I memorized a whole slew of lengthy Latinate species names with their corresponding attributes, and I toted around a humongous book of dinosaurs (entitled 
The Humongous Book of Dinosaurs
) until it was tattered and dog-eared. I'm not so obsessed now, but I still get excited when I imagine the fantastical menagerie of creatures that used to populate our planet, and I think it's kind of weird and sad that such a rich topic is considered by most adults to be kids' stuff—as if anything which isn't directly relevant to human life today isn't worth thinking about at all. Naturally, when I saw this beautiful new book (for adults!) at the library where I work, I had to pick it up.It ended up being kind of an odd read, because, while the subject matter was consistently fascinating enough to keep me turning pages all the way through, I found the voice and personality of the author to be just as consistently grating. The result was a strange sort of cognitive dissonance which I guess is similar to what people mean when they talk about their ""guilty pleasures"": at no point did I feel like it was a waste of time or want to stop reading, but I also spent the whole thing half-annoyed and acutely aware of the stuff I didn't like.Let's cover the positives first. As an overview of 150 million years or more of dinosaur evolution, from their earliest emergence to their eventual extinction (or rather near-extinction, since, as Brusatte is at pains to point out, modern birds are the dinos' direct descendants), the book does exactly what it's supposed to. Once-hazy (for me) details about the prehistoric timeline, the evolutionary family tree, and the mechanics of extinction came into clearer focus, and there were a lot of great factoids and details I never learned (and which, for that matter, probably weren't even known yet) during my childhood dino phase.***
A few facts that stuck with me
:1) Brontosaurus is back to being a real dinosaur again (when I was a kid the consensus was that it wasn't), and there's little doubt now that a meteor/asteroid caused the Cretaceous extinction. (Back then you still heard that it was anyone's guess.)-2) In addition to the many dinosaurs which we now know had feathered appendages, there was at least one which actually had membranous wings like a bat. A feathered, lizardlike creature with bat wings? Sounds like a dragon if ever there was one. (Even if it was only the size of a pigeon.)-3) The dinosaurs first evolved when the supercontinent Pangea was more or less still in one piece, but by the time they died out tens of millions of years later the landmasses had drifted to almost their current positions. The geographically vague picture I think many of us have of the dinosaur age, with all the species living together in pretty much the same ecosystem, was basically reality in those early days, but later on when iconic dinos like T. Rex and triceratops were doing their thing there was just as much regional variation as with our modern animals. Those two species I just named actually lived exclusively in what's now western North America—in other words, even our conception of prehistoric megafauna has a serious U.S.-centric slant. (That's my own inference; Brusatte never delves into the sociopolitical implications.) In Europe, which during the Cretaceous was little more than a series of islands, there were actually miniature versions of all the bigger dinos running around instead!***So for that kind of info, this book is great. Brusatte even frames each chapter with a discussion of the major fossil discoveries and paleontological work that allow us to know such things without having been there, which I think is almost essential when writing about animals who are understood exclusively from their fossilized bones and byproducts. But it's also in these sections where Brusatte's more irritating characteristics are on full display, so with that I'll pivot to the negative.There's this trend I've noticed in pop science books where the author will try to draw the reader in and ""humanize"" the subject matter with personal anecdotes: ""Here's an interesting experience I had that was related to the science thing I'm about to talk about, so now you have a reason to care about it too."" Brusatte does this constantly, but the simple truth is that most people picking up a book called The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs probably don't need a dull story about that time you looked at some cool rocks in Poland or the total rager of a paleontology conference (his enthusiasm, not mine) you attended in Brazil a decade ago in order to be interested in the giant, flesh-eating, bird/reptile hybrids you've promised to describe to us. It just distracts from the real meat of the book.Even worse, Brusatte is a chronic name-dropper. It's not enough simply to shout out his influential colleagues, he's got to delineate exactly what professional relationship he shares with each of them, how well they get along (spoiler: he's best friends with everyone in the field), and more often than not the critical role he himself played in shaping their major discoveries. He wants very much to paint paleontologists as a cool and quirky bunch, with a word about everyone's fashion sense and personal hobbies and a frat boy fascination with their drinking habits, but the unfortunate result is that most of these apparently-brilliant scientific professionals end up coming off as the sort of try-hard ""characters"" you'd do your best to avoid at a party. And that's just the men. Women, on the rare occasion they're mentioned at all, are glossed over almost without a remark, and never receive the same hagiography as their male colleagues. Brusatte certainly isn’t solely responsible for the exclusion of women from the sciences, but for someone so eager to position himself as a major voice for his field, he sure doesn’t seem to mind the disparity much. (And that's not even getting into the cringey racial/nationalistic comments, e.g. "". . . he seemed to be a little darker than most of the Poles I knew. Tanned, almost. There was something vaguely sinister about him. . ."") Even when dealing with the dinos themselves, Brusatte's writing leaves something to be desired. He's definitely readable and competent at the sentence level, but his tone throughout the book is so breezy and so full of high-powered adjectives that at times I wondered if he wasn't sacrificing accuracy for cheap excitement. Probably the most overt example of this is when he describes a particular fossilized creature two different times as ""mule-sized,"" only to include a photo which makes it clear the thing was hardly as big as a golden retriever. Maybe an innocent mistake, but a worrying one in a book that purports to be laying down hard scientific fact. What's more, he absolutely loves all that old-timey, imperialism-tinged language about the dinos conquering and colonizing and ruling over their domain, which reaches its zenith in the eye-rollingly effusive chapter about T. Rex (""What feast befits the King?"" ""Like so many monarchs, Rex was a glutton."") I know he's trying to appeal to a popular audience here, but it's still jarring to see that kind of lens applied so earnestly and uncritically in 2018.In the end, Brusatte puts me in a weird position. Given the dearth of up-to-date dinosaur writing for the adult layperson, I'm glad someone stepped up to fill the niche. I just wish the someone in question had been, you know, anyone other than the guy who ended up doing it. My hope is that the success of this book will inspire a wave of new releases on prehistoric life. Until then I'll recommend Brusatte’s, but only with a long list of caveats."

The narrative writing style is so friendly and accessible that readers can sit back and enjoy the ride as Brusatte takes us on a captivating chronological tour of the Mesozoic—the Age of Reptiles—beginning about 250 million years ago and ending 66 million years ago with the famous asteroid (or comet) impact that wiped out all the dinosaurs except birds. I enjoyed learning about the dinosauromorphs—dinosaur-like reptiles that lived at the same time as early dinosaurs but are not considered part of the group. At one time, scientists used a half dozen anatomical traits to differentiate the two groups, but recent fossil finds suggest that the line between the two groups is extremely blurry. I was also interested in the discussion of carcharodontosaurs—ferocious carnivorous dinosaurs that had their heyday before tyrannosaurs rose to power. Not surprisingly, my favorite chapter focused on the mighty T. rex. It began with a dramatic narrative hunting scene and then highlighted how the work of scientists—men and women—from around the world has contributed to our understanding the mighty beast. The descriptions of recent cutting-edge techniques were especially vibrant and fascinating.The chapter about how the world changed following the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs (except birds) really puts the reader in the middle of the action. The carefully crafted you-are-there scene setting gave me a strong sense of what Earth was like and how horrible it would have been to experience it. I also enjoyed reading what we know about the transition from dinosaurs to modern day birds.Throughout the text, Brusatte includes engaging personal anecdotes that give readers a flavor of what life as a paleontologist is like. My favorites described some of the discoveries he and his colleagues have made in the field, such as recognizing a sauropod trackway on the Isle of Skye in Scotland and unearthing a trio of Triceratops (playfully named Homer, Bart, and Lisa after the “Simpsons” characters) at Hell Creek in Montana.Traditionally, paleontology has been a white, male world, and this book accurately represents that. But I was glad to see that Brusatte balances those sections by repeatedly drawing attention to the important work of female colleagues as well as the contributions of a diverse array of scientists from around the world. Finally, I appreciated Brusatte’s ability to poke fun at himself. One of my favorite narrative sections recounts how, as a teenager, he had the audacity to cold call Walter Alvarez—one of the world’s leading paleontologists. Amazingly, Alvarez took the call! Many years later, when Brusatte met his idol, Alvarez remembered speaking with him. Scenes like this helped me connect with the author and understand (and admire) the depth of his passion and enthusiasm for dinosaurs. "
29,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,4,"And easily accessible but deeply informative book about how the Dinosaurs rose to prominence, why they stayed there for so long, and why they vanished (well, ""vanished"", since birds are still around). along the way I learned a ton about the sort of cutting edge technology and techniques modern paleontologists use to deepen our understanding of these amazing creatures. It intersperses history nicely to give context for how this field developed and some of our earlier misunderstandings about dinosaurs. Great for a dino lover or someone just looking to learn more."

There have been amazing breakthroughs in our knowledge regarding dinosaurs; and with the advent of grandsons, it was clearly time for me to ‘up my game’!Brusatte has written a highly readable account of those new advances. He is an enthusiastic fossil hunter that takes the reader around the world from Georgia O’Keefe’s Ghost Ranch “bursting with dinosaur bones”; to Hell Creek, Montana—a Triceratops graveyard; to China and its plethora of feather-covered fossils; and to Italy where a thin layer of iridium indicates that an asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago.I admit that I enjoy reading about how paleontologists have determined that dinosaurs had feathers; that they were colored, and likely proved to be advantageous in attracting mates. And those dinosaurs that later became birds may have first used wing action to attract more attention, and just stumbled upon how wing action could result in gliding and eventually flying. It just takes a few millennia to make it happen.The number of new discoveries regarding dinosaurs over the past twenty years is mind-boggling. I look forward to learning more in the next twenty.

Gives a really vivid picture of the Mesozoic world and its creatures as moving, eating, breeding things. Some great history of the science too, if a bit laddish at points in the insistent ""hey we drink beer we definitely aren't nerds"". I don't know whether at this point in human history it's comfortable or not to reflect that the earth has seen multiple animal kingdoms wiped out when soaring carbon dioxide turned the atmosphere into an oven. There's a kind of comfort in looking at it from a cosmic level, I guess? "
32,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,5,"This was a book I HAD to read--to catch up on the subject I obsessed so much about in elementary school-Dinosaurs! When I was a kid I read every book on dinosaurs that I could find in my local library and my parents bought me even more books--and I was thrilled no end to go to the nearby Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago! but that was in the 60s and I thought we knew everything there was to know about the big guys. They were slow, brainless giants doomed to extinction so that the way could be cleared for The Rise of Man. But, as paleontologist Steve Brusatte points out, at the end of the 60s and going into the 70s, a new paradigm took shape, in which dinosaurs have been viewed as active, even energetic, animals, some being social and intelligent. Rather than doomed to failure, they were among the most successful animals for over 150 million years. If it had not been for what Brusatte calls ""the worst day in the history of our planet,"" when the asteroid (or comet) hit 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs would still dominate the Earth. The good news is that the dinos did not completely die out. I see some flitting about my bird feeder even as I type this. The birds are now classified as dinosaurs, as theropods, related to T-rex and velociraptors. For me, the most interesting part of the book (as a bird-lover) is his discussing the origin and evolution of the birds (and feathers!). I'm so glad they escaped the Cretaceous (Fifth) Extinction Event, but it's an open question whether they can escape the current or Sixth Extinction Event... I enjoyed this narrative greatly because not only does Steve share his passion with the reader (he's one guy who sure does love his job!) but he relates his experiences taking part in expeditions around the globe. This does seem to be a golden age of discovery of dinosaurs--and I missed it! BUT at least I can read about it. Thanks, Steve Brusatte! And I look forward to hearing more from this amazing young man!"
33,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"Off to a good start. I prefer to read pop-science books written by scientists, and Brusatte is a young vertebrate paleontologist at the Univ. of Edinburgh. Like all of us, he caught the dino bug when he was a kid. Unlike most, he made a career of it, and it's been an interesting one. Dino books are generally written by seniors, so it's fun to see one of the ""young guns"" take up the pen (or computer). Brusatte is an adequate writer, which is fine, since he's got some great stories to tell. And it's a great time for the field -- he says that lately, there's a new dino species described, on average, every week!The good quality continues, and I enjoyed the book, although I got dino-overload at times. He's a decent writer, but the prose gets purple, as in the Great Asteroid that (probably) killed off the dinosaurs (except for the birds!). His science is up-to-date, and I recommend the book, especially for dinosaur fans. 3.8 stars.Here's a nice sample, that is (I think) pretty much a chapter in the book:https://www.scientificamerican.com/ar..."

All those dinosaur and animal names and descriptions without pictures to refer to can get a bit confusing, especially when you're not listening in your native language... Obviously, this was completely my own fault, so I'm not critising the book here. Just a heads-up for anyone who is thinking of getting the audio book.***I am doing the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge and this is where I need to start cheating a little bit. The cue ""Continental drift: Read a book set on every continent"" could mean you read ONE book that travels through all continents or SEVERAL books, one for each continent. Since I'm almost sure I won't be able to add six more books to my already ambitious summer TBR, I decided to give this one a go. I mean, the supercontinent Pangea did incorporate most 0f Earth's landmasses at one point. And dinosaurs are just cool."
35,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"I caught the dino bug when I was probably seven years old, and have never stopped being utterly entranced by these amazing creatures. Much of what I learned as a child about the big lizards has since been refuted by new fossils, better analysis, and new research. Stephen Brusatte caught the dino bug when he was young and became a vertebrate paleontologist. His passion comes through loud and clear in this book, as he takes his readers from ancient history to the end of most dinosaurs on this planet, starting with the biggest mass extinction on this planet at the end of the Permian age; this die-off made way for some unusual reptiles with a different body plan than many of their peers that proved to be amazingly successful for these reptiles and their countless descendants for millennia afterwards through the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. Though I was already familiar with much that Brusatte covered, his writing style made the material approachable and easy to understand. There were not as many images as I would have liked; despite my familiarity with many of the creatures, it’s still hard to remember the little differences between similar individuals in a group, and more drawings would have been helpful.I particularly liked Brusatte's chapters on the Permian-Triassic transition, tyrannosaurs, birds, and the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous especially. I am a fan of theropods, and Brusatte is clearly a huge fan of the tyrannosaurids. He tended to wax a little melodramatic about these carnivorous dinosaurs, but then it's a little hard not to be in awe of such terrifying beings. (Especially the huge carnivorous members of this group.)This book was a good refresher on many points about dinosaurs, and the author's writing style and obvious enthusiasm for the subject made this an enjoyable read."

It's like wondering what might have happened if the archduke was never shot.The whole these-were-the-coolest-beings-that-ever-roamed-the-earth moniker has always made me a dino fan. The amazing variations of these huge oddballs have always been intriguing and this book does its best to piece everything together. Which is a very good thing, because there have been so many new discoveries and new theories since I was a child that I lost track of which was the coolest dino (welcome back, Brontosaurus).Steve Brusatte is one of the world's eminent paleontologists whose other books, especially Field Guide to Dinosaurs, have made me a fan of his writing and his obvious enthusiasm for his work. Here, he charts the very beginnings of the dinosaur, even before they evolved. He starts with the Permian Extinction, which eliminated 95% of life on earth. Somehow, some little things survived and that eventually led the way for the bigger things to arrive later on. Right off, his description of the Great Dying kept me glued to the pages as the volcanoes spewed forth lava mud and carbon dioxide. How anything managed to live through all of that is simply amazing.As the dinosaurs grew, the earth was also changing, with the continents moving toward their current locations and the environment becoming a bit nicer. Well, nicer like walking outside at noon during an Alabama summer. The dinosaurs became larger and larger and ruled the world until the day that nasty asteroid slammed into Earth. Then, Brusatte relates what it must have felt like to wake up that day as a dino, thinking you were just going about your business as usual. Nope. Any dinosaur too close to the impact was vaporised while the ones further away endured boiling hot hail, mammoth earthquakes, renewed lava flows, loss of sun, loss of trees, and ergo, loss of life. The dinosaurs didn't all die at once, he states, but probably over a few hundred or few thousand years. Given the fact that they had been around for millions of years, the dinosaur extinction was relatively quick.The book doesn't just end with the catastrophic impact but instead continues with the rise of the birds, our current dinosaurs. All very fascinating. While there are some b&w illustrations at the beginning of each chapter, the book is mostly text with various photos of fossils and the paleontologists who discovered the dino fossils. That's because this book is as much a tribute to the men and women who found those dragon bones as it is to the dinosaur. I deducted a star for the continuous focus on the author (we get it, Steve, you like dinosaurs and you go on lots of expeditions). So pretty good book, but it forced me to check out another library book (The Great Dinosaur Discoveries) so I could see the actual illustrations of what these big brutes would have looked like.That darn asteroid.Book Season = Year Round (looking at the finches with suspicion)"

It puts perspective on “our” life and “our” Earth and how we really don’t know it all. All we have are the few pieces of evidence of a life completely different from our own. I really appreciate all the researchers and paleontologists who put their time and energy, (and sometimes their life) into helping us better understand these eras and species long gone. The end really made me sad. Seeing these beautiful creatures end so abruptly (and in the way that it did) is such a shame. However, few of these creatures did leave their footprint to give future species, like us, proof and imagination of an insanely different time here on Earth. Just imagine all the things we don’t know because we don’t have proof, haven’t found it yet, or might have wrong. It’s surreal to think about. That said, I do wish the author talked less about the people who studied the fossils and more about the dinosaurs. I also wish he threw in more pictures of what he was explaining so I could get a picture of what he was discussing. I found myself with my phone in one hand and the book in the other, constantly looking up pictures of the dinosaurs he mentioned, the eras, and anything he named and just assumed the reader knew. "

I got to go through the same thing when my kids went through the phase as well and I got all caught up with things like Walking With Dinosaurs and its ilk. Which is all a round-about way of saying that I thought of myself as being fairly well-informed about paleontology, at least from a pop-science perspective.This book did an excellent job of bringing that pop-science overview of the field much more up-to-date. For instance, I was aware that paleontology in China had been going off with some really exciting discoveries, but I had no idea how key that has been to the overall understanding of dinosaur lineage. There also appears to be some fairly exciting new thinking about the origin of dinosaurs and the early period of the Triassic that I was entirely unaware of.In short, this is a great book for establishing an up-to-date popular science-level overview of the dinosaur element of paleontology, all made that much more engaging by a series of personal anecdotes from the author and his own career and interaction with his peers."

The rise and fall of the dinosaurs is an incredible story, of a time when giant beasts and other fantastic creatures made the world their own. They walked on the very ground below us, their fossils now entombed in rock – the clues that tell this story. To me, it's one of the greatest narratives in the history of our planet.
The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is thoroughly enjoyable pop science: author (and celebrated young paleontologist) Steve Brusatte uses his own learning journey to outline the exciting advances occurring today in his field (he calls this the “golden age” of paleontology, noting that new species of dinosaurs are discovered/described at the astounding rate of about one per week), and not only did I learn new and fascinating information from the deep history of our remarkable planet, but I found Brusatte's enthusiasm to be contagious. Who doesn't love dinosaurs? Totally accessible (but fact-filled) and balanced with personal stories (which I acknowledge might strain the patience of those of a more academic bent), it all worked for me.Early on, Brusatte – who is a Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Edinburgh – refers to his “ebullient, wildly animated lecturing style”, and for the purposes of this review, I'd rather demonstrate this ebullience than attempt to list everything that Brusatte taught me. On the sauropods whose tracks he studied on the Scottish Isle of Skye:
There's really no better way to say it: the sauropods that made their marks in that ancient Scottish lagoon were awesome creatures. Awesome in the literal sense of the word – impressive, daunting, inspiring awe. If I was handed a blank sheet of paper and pen and told to create a mythical beast, my imagination could never match what evolution created in sauropods.
Brusatte devotes plenty of breathless space to the Tyrannosaurus rex – including debunking what Jurassic Park got wrong about the apex predators (turns out that their eyesight was perfectly sharp, but they couldn't have outrun a jeep) – and writes, “The seat of Rex's power was its head. It was a killing machine, torture chamber for its prey, and an evil mask all in one.” And after having repeatedly referred to T. Rex arms as “sad” and “pathetic”, Brusatte shares new research that has determined, based on strong shoulder extensors and elbow flexors, the Rex used these “short but strong arms to hold down struggling prey while the jaws did their bone-crunching thing. The arms were accessories to murder.” Murder! The writing gets amped up when T. Rex meets its favourite meal:Triceratops, like its archnemesis T. rex, is a dinosaur icon. In films and documentaries, it usually plays the gentle, sympathetic plant-eater, the perfect dramatic foil to the Tyrant King. Sherlock versus Moriarty, Batman versus the Joker, Trike versus Rex. But it's not all movie magic; no, these two dinosaurs truly would have been rivals 66 million years ago...The King needed immense amounts of flesh to fuel its metabolism; its three-horned comrade was fourteen tons of slow-moving prime steak. You can figure out what happened next.So, you either enjoy a professor writing like a teenaged dino-fanboy, or you don't. Interspersed with the timeline of dinosaur evolution, Brusatte outlines the history of fossil hunting from the “Bone Wars” (which saw 19th-century rivals Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh sending out teams of mercenaries to hunt for bones for their individual glory; in the pursuit of which they weren't above stealing, lying, and sabotaging each other's sites) to the academics of today. In addition to referring to individuals as the “hot shots” or “rock stars” or the “Rat Pack” of paleontology, Brusatte proves that paleontologists just might be a special breed unto themselves. Barnum Brown, the first celebrity paleontologist at the turn of the twentieth century, prospected for dino bones in high summer “decked out in his fur coat with his pickaxe slung over his shoulder”. Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás – an adventurer, WWI spy, and the first paleobiologist – was a “flamboyant dandy and a tragic genius, whose exploits hunting dinosaurs in Transylvania were brief respites from the insanity of the rest of his life. Dracula, in all seriousness, has nothing on the Dinosaur Baron.” And as for Brusatte's modern day colleagues:Thomas Carr – my absinthe-drinking, Goth-dressing friend who studies T. rex – was with us on the expedition and was part of this team. Clad in khaki (it was far too hot for his usual all-black getup) and sucking down Gatorade by the gallon (absinthe was more of an indoor pursuit), he attacked the mudstones with his rock hammer (which he nicknamed Warrior) and his pickaxe (Warlord), exposing a number of new Triceratops bones.And working on the other side of the world in China, Brusatte describes another rising star:
Jingmai (O'Connor) calls herself a paleontologista – fitting given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia. A native of Southern California – half Irish, half-Chinese by blood – Jingmai is a Roman Candle of energy – delivering caustic one-liners one moment, speaking in eloquent paragraphs about politics the next, and then it's on to music or art or her own unique brand of Buddhist philosophy. Oh yes, and she’s also the world’s number-one expert on those first birds that broke the bounds of Earth to fly above their dinosaur ancestors.
And speaking of the first birds: as uncomfortable as I find this book's cover art – depicting a wispily feathered T. rex confronting wispily feathered prey dinos – that's a mental-shift I'll need to force myself to make: Brusatte makes the incontrovertible case that all true dinosaurs (not crocs or other proto-reptiles) were in a direct line to modern day birds and shared many of the same body features (flow-through lungs, wishbones, and yes, feathers; there's a paleontologist working today who can even determine the colours of their plumage). But, if I can mentally shift the T. rex from the upright Barney-the-dinosaur stance depicted in my youth to the balanced-forward pose accepted today, I suppose I can eventually re-imagine it covered in feathers. After all of the enthusiasm Brusatte displays for the rise and evolutionary success of the dinosaurs, the final chapter on their sudden demise is urgently and tragically related:It was the worst day in the history of our planet. A few hours of unimaginable violence that undid more than 150 million years of evolution and set life on a new course. T. rex was there to see it.An impact from a meteorite (or possibly comet), hitting with the force of “a billion nuclear bombs' worth of energy”, caused the near total extinction of the earth's most successful and widespread species (excepting, of course, for those dinosaurs who survived to evolve into what we think of as birds). The good news is that this catastrophic event paved the wave for the rise of the mammals, and us; the bad news is that we're no more special than the dinosaurs, and catastrophes – including those of our own making – can strike at any time. If you like your pop science poppy, this is an entertaining and informative read."

In this book, Brusatte notes that his generation (which I'm a part of ~ thirtysomethings) were indelibly drawn to dinosaurs because of Jurassic Park. Of course, the interest preceded that film (umm, what about 1988's Land Before Time?), but it did solidify it!I've had this book since it came out in 2018 and knew I'd be reading it for this round of Science September. It's a great primer, a deep dive into modern #paleontology and evolutionary biology, with all the new fossils and species identifications.You come for the dinosaurs, and Brusatte's engaging storytelling and infectious enthusiasm for the subject keep you reading. He has what I can only describe as a ""folksy"" writing style, describing nearly every person in the book as 'the greatest paleontogist' or 'the nicest person you'll ever meet' (it's endearing, but it makes you wonder if it's all exactly true... Are they all this nice?) My favorite sections of the book were about dinosaur anatomy and biomechanics - the descriptions of their lungs and breathing patterns, and how this resembles modern birds' lungs, their bones' hollow structure, and their locomotion and moving speeds. How does a creature that weighs TONS pump blood? New and more complete #fossils have shown us how they moved, breathed, circulated blood, digested food, and how they looked (feathers! Even Tyrannosaurus Rex had feathers - not the plumage, but more likely quills and downy fuzz feathers). It's completely fascinating.This was a great companion piece with Peter Brannen's The Ends of the World that I read last week. There is overlap in topic of mass extinction after the asteroid hit, but Brusatte's book goes into more depth in the paleontology (and some anecdotes about cold calling Walter Alvarez for travel advice!) and the #evolution that led to the bird-dinosaurs we know today."
43,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Overall, a really interesting book & well laid out, but I floundered with all the odd names. A lot of that is my own ignorance & I think I would have enjoyed this more if I knew the names better. It's obvious that Brusatte lives & breathes this stuff & loves it. The narrator was excellent & conveyed Brusatte's enthusiasm well, but I glazed over from the terminology occasionally.It was a great trip, though. I learned not just about the evolution of dinosaurs, but about the other critters of the times, ones I'd often confused with them. He describes their rise very well & dispels many of the older ideas that I learned in school. For instance, he made sense of their feathers far better than anything else I've read on the subject which is admittedly little. In doing so, he shows why we didn't realize they had them for so long.Reconstructing the story of the dinosaurs is tough due to the time involved. Their reign ended 66 million years ago, but it was only about 50 years ago that we nailed down why. Fossils aren't common & many of the best sites were plundered by ignorant, greedy men. He shows how this was both good & bad. The interest in them led to money for expeditions that are expensive, hard, & time consuming, but we have many fossils that aren't properly cataloged or investigated as he shows through several discoveries made by students, including himself. New methods & tools have brought some amazing clarity.Definitely recommended in any format."
44,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070393-natch,2,"I'm not sure that I've ever been more disappointed in a book. I went into it thinking that it would be a basic-level summary of the evolution of dinosaurs and the world events that shaped them. Instead, the majority of the book (or so it seemed) was about the author's (and others) meetings and, occasionally, trips to find dinosaur bones. What made the book particularly insufferable (as others have mentioned previously) was that the author has to be in his thirties, at most (I didn't look it up), and, frankly, he doesn't possess any real critical insight of himself or others. As a consequence, the book does not start as you would expect - here's what the world looked like pre-dinosaur and here's what inhabited; it starts as an autobiography with the occasional dinosaur story thrown in. For example, his first story centers on going to Poland (if I remember correctly), getting off the train, and meeting a rather unfriendly looking guy...but, turns out, that guy was really friendly! And they found footprints! And wrote an article about it!...Oh, and the proto-dinosaurs were less like salamanders in their movements and more directional and we figured out what they probably looked like...but instead of a good description, here's a little photo and that's all. But it continues in this vein. Okay, next, the author went to Portugal. There, he met a dude who was the best at finding the fossils in the places he explored since childhood. Isn't that great? Isn't that guy brilliant? Just like the other paleontologists the author knows? Well, no. I grew up on a beach known to have plenty of fossilized shark teeth. I'm pretty good at finding shark teeth. So is every other person who grew up there or has lived there for a while and looks (cue certain little, old ladies). A visitor who shows up once for two weeks is going to be terrible compared to all us natives. The other thing that really bugged me was how everyone the author has ever met in the world of paleontology is ""brilliant"" or some equivalent...and there are several pages which are just lists of people and their specialties. I'm not sure how many paleontologists there are in the world, but I would guess that a fair number were listed in this book as ""brilliant."" I just don't think that's the case, unless paleontology is only populated by MENSA members. It really seemed like this book was more the autobiography of a dude in his thirties who happens to study dinosaurs and who thought to throw in some statements about dinosaurs. Disappointingly, those statements aren't always well thought out or explained. For example, the author talks about Pangea pretty early on, describing it as a single landmass stretching from the artic to antartic and centered on the equator with a desert spanning the equator so hostile to dinosaur-life that it was, essentially, a dinosaur-less. Yet, in the same breath says that on either side of that desert were dinosaurs in the early Triassic period. What he never seems to tell us is how those dinosaurs bypassed the desert to become distributed on both sides or whether dinosaurs evolved twice (one on each side) or what might have happened. I had to go on Wikipedia to look it up. Seriously. A history book should not require readers to resort to Wikipedia to explain what happened. (Dinosaurs appear to have been able to migrate past the desert areas, fyi).I ended up giving this book two stars because it does actually talk about dinosaurs a fair bit, albeit in a kinda rushed manner. And, I guess, I felt the talk of dinosaurs was colored by my perceptions of the protagonist of the story, the author himself. I'm a bit concerned by how much beer he drinks. There was more than one description of events being described as the best (the best conference, etc.) which seem to have been wholly related to the availability of alcohol and, in the case of Argentina, beef. Further, I'm a bit concerned about the author's relationship to women. He seems to revel in ribald jokes, as, I think, other commentators have mentioned, and seems to have a bit of a negative view of them. That might be okay for the character in a novel, but it's something that should be addressed in the world of real people. Those things really did color my feelings on this book and definitely contributed to the loss of a star. The other two were lost because of how much space seemed to be devoted to personal antedotes and urgings to read his other works rather than the story of dinosaurs. "

46,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Highway to Hell Creek; the discovery of the remnants of Jurassic park In this dazzling rehash, author Steve Brusatte tells the mesmerizing story of dinosaurs; their origins, evolution, diversity, habitats and their cataclysmic extinction. This is a captivating narrative that engages the reader till the end of the book. Highly readable and well researched that interest readers focused in ancient history this planet, dinosaurs, and life in late cretaceous era (100 – 66 million Years). The book describes immediate events after planet was hit by 6.5-mile-long asteroid (Chicxulub meteorite), at the speed of 67,000 miles per hour, 65.5 million years ago. The fossils from this event are preserved all over the planet, which gives a grim picture. It simply demonstrates that life on earth is susceptible to the wrath of nature. This was the sixth extinction of life in 4.5 billion history of the planet, and it was colossal, cosmic and catastrophic. How did life witness this? The author describes in detail as what may have happened immediately before and after the greatest hit in the recent history of our planet. Although this has been discussed on several TV shows on Nat Geo, Discovery, PBS and Science channels by geophysicists, astronomers and paleontologists, it is interesting to read from the point of a paleontologist who studies dinosaurs with passion. In fact, it is common in recent days to read about the discovery of new species of dinosaurs, birds and mammals from this event. One of the goldmines for finding the lost species is Hell Creek, Montana where treasure trove of fossils is preserved. It is a mixing of fossil carcasses and a layer of glass tektites from meteorite hit with impact impressions deposited minutes to hours after the apocalypse.The Hell Creek Formation in the Upper Great Plains of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were laid down by ancient rivers and streams as they traveled from the Rocky Mountains in the west toward the east before emptying into a large interior seaway that bisected North America during the latest Cretaceous period. Due to rise in sea-level in the Late Cretaceous, North America was bisected by a seaway stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. The states of NM, AZ, CO, SD, ND and MT were buried under water in a shallow sea that ran from Mexico to NW Canada. At that time the states of CA, OR, WA and ID were on the West and the rest of United States were on the east. The Hell Creek rocks preserve the remains of dinosaurs after Chicxulub meteorite struck into the ocean in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The death and destruction of the most iconic dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus Rex, the three horned dinosaur, Triceratops, the duckbilled dinosaur, Edmontosaurus, and the tank-like armored dinosaur, Ankylosaurus. The fossils also include; crocodiles, lizards, snakes, turtles, frogs, salamanders, fishes, plants and mammals. At this time, the planet was largely one supercontinent called Pangea, but it had started to split into several fragments. Europe and Asia were still globed together, and they were linked to North America by a series of islands. But what made these animals to become big? They had to eat and digest vast quantities of food, they had to grow fast, must be able to breathe very efficiently, and shed excess body heat. This process was enabled by their unique body plan that included a highly efficient lung more related to a birdlike lung because many bones of the chest cavity had big openings. There were many air sacs that extended throughout their body that helped lungs to take in enough oxygen to stoke their metabolism.During the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous, tyrannosaurs flourished, ruling the river valleys, lakeshores, flood­ plains, forests, and deserts of North America and China. Colossal tyrannosaurs never seemed to gain a foothold in Europe or the southern continents, where other groups of large predators prospered, but in North America and China, species of tyrannosaurs were unrivaled. They had become the transcendent terrors that fire our imaginations. The species of Tyrannosaurus Rex was not a global but existed only in North West of United States. On that fateful morning 66 million years ago, when a pack of T. Rexes woke up on what would go down as the final day of the Cretaceous Period, all seemed normal in their Hell Creek kingdom, the same as it had for two millions of years. Forests of conifers and ginkgoes stretched to the horizon, interspersed with palms and magnolias. The distant churn of a river, rushing eastward to empty into the great seaway that lapped against western North America. For the last several weeks, the more perceptive of the T. Rexes may have noticed a glowing orb in the sky, far off in the distance and a hazy ball also had a fiery rim. The orb would appear and disappear for hours. As it appeared again, it was bigger, its shine illuminating much of the sky to the southeast in a cloudy psychedelic mist. Then a flash. No noise, only a split-second flare of yellow that lit up the whole sky, disorienting the animals for a moment. As they blinked their eyes back to focus, they noticed that the orb was now gone. Moments later, and then they were blindsided. Another flash, but this one far more vengeful. The rays lit the morning air in a fireworks display and burned into their retinas. In fact, no noise at all. By now, the birds and flying raptors had stopped chirping, and silence hung over Hell Creek. The calm lasted for only a few seconds. Next, the ground beneath their feet started to rumble and shake, and then flew like waves; pulses of energy were shooting through the rocks and soil, the ground rising and falling as if a giant snake were slithering underneath. Everything not rooted into the dirt was thrown upward; then it crashed down, and then up and down again, the Earth's surface was acting like a trampoline. Everything within a radius of about six hundred miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of modern-day Mexico was annihilated, and vaporized. For several years, the Earth turned cold and dark because of soot, sulfur, sulfuric acid and rock dust in the atmosphere that blocked out the sun. The darkness brought severe winter for years that only the hardiest of animals could survive. The rains were highly acidic that wiped out much of marine species. Here and there, species of lizards, crocodiles, turtles, birds and rat-size mammals made it but with lots of duress under the fury of nature. Hell-Creek was turned to Hell that reverberated in rest of the world."

48,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,5,"Phew! A pop history on Dinosaurs written by a Paleantologist is enough to trigger your curiosity and awaken the science geek in you. However, you do worry about a Ross Geller level book you will be stuck with for ages. Stephen Brusatte is more Douglas Adams than Ross Geller and he tells a story that is at once engaging and enlightening. Imagine a huge jigsaw puzzle that has to pieced together. The challenge is that the pieces are found years apart and you have dedicated science heroes who try to make the best image possible with the pieces they have. And the frustration that lasts for decades when you realise there are missing pieces. That has been the story of piecing together the history of one of the most fascinating creatures that inhabited the earth.What Brusatte has done is not just laying out the facts (and theories) but also a tribute to all the paleontologists who have played a part in building the current understanding. Starting from the Permian period fossils through the Triassic age till the Jurassic and Cretaceous - the author paints a picture that is hard to ignore of complex foodchains, rise of apex predators and the entire evolution journey on fast forward. The journey is mapped through the work of paleontologists, geologists and collectors whose stories, quirks and anecdotes too are part of this book. The history of Dinosaurs cannot be narrated without the history of the planet and hence we get a lot of information on movement of continent, rise of oceans and rise of life in general.There is a chapter dedicated to Tyranosorus Rex (Tyrant King) which almost worships the larger than life (most lives, at least) predators. The author does not miss an opportunity to compare notes and point errata to the Jurassic Park movie, which is the introduction to most of us who are googling images today. The linkage to birds apart, the single mass extinction theory that brought an end to cretareous is more like the dominant theory that most paleantologists subscribe to. He actually describes a meeting of paleantologists in 2012 to discuss the validity of the theory where everyone agreed. This is only what we know.. so far.. A good book that presents facts actually allows you to understand the origin of popular theories without judging them - like the science of Phrenology which took off in the same period classifying human beings from different continents as different species. Today we grow uncomfortable knowing that gave grounds to Eugenics and later persecution of races in terms of superiority. Scientists are impervious to the implications of truth. The book makes you ask a lot more questions and for that reason alone, I loved it. A joyride!"

It was quite informative, especially for those, like me, who haven't been able to keep up with all of the findings in this subject for the last couple of decades. I think I liked this book because it was part memoir as well as science. The author has a sense of humor, and is only three years older than me, so his pop culture and generation comments were right on par. He does mention the film Jurassic Park several times, though usually to disprove some of their science. I only had one complaint: No color pictures! I was surprised how much this bugged me, but as the author described such beautiful landscapes of where he was digging, and then only provided a black and white photograph, the beauty was lost on me. I realize it's cheaper to publish without color photos, and paleontologists most likely don't make bank, but the author is the ""resident paleontologist for BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs"" so I think color photographs isn't too much to ask. The illustrations were lovely though, even if they portrayed the dinos with feathers...I guess I can't deny a lot of dinosaurs had feathers anymore since I've now read this. Dinosaurs just don't seem as cool with them.I will just mention that I have my own personal opinion on evolution. This book talks a lot about the evolution of dinosaurs. I am religious, which probably has a lot to do with it, but I never quite agreed fully with the author on this subject.Overall, I recommend it!2018 challenge: A book with an animal in the title"

Very well done. "
51,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike,1,"D’ya see that subtitle? “A New History of a Lost World”? It’s one of two things: 1) utter bullshit or 2) marketing spin (which amounts to the same thing as #1). There’s no new information in this book. However, it IS a new book, so... yeah. Bullshit marketing.There are some other reasons why I’m giving this a 1-star review. One of the biggest is Brusatte’s continued insistence on ascribing INTENT to evolution. What the actual fuck, dude? No, triceratops didn’t decide to grow horns. T. rex didn’t want to grow teeth. Mammals weren’t “craving” the opportunity to supplant the dinosaurs for 100 million years. If you’re going to imbue intelligent design to evolution then you are one bad week from assuming that an almighty god did it and that the Bible is literally correct.You are doing a disservice to everyone who reads this book, especially to every kid who does so, because you are saying chance doesn’t exist in natural selection and that every species decides what it wants to become. That’s woo-woo bullshit and utterly unscientific. Stop invoking intelligent design. Stop it.In my lifetime there have been a few things which have completely upended our understanding of dinosaurs. Bakker’s insistence that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. (The Dinosaur Heresies) Which now has a mountain of evidence supporting it. Alvarez’s discovery that an asteroid impact in the Yucatán killed off the dinosaurs. (T. Rex and the Crater of Doom) And most recently, Horner’s complete and utter decimation of the plethora of dinosaur species. (https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner...)Paleontologists at the time pushed back on all of these theories, but the first two are now widely accepted by pretty much everyone, because the ones who objected have died off. The latter has pissed off paleontologists because some of them have named these “new” species and Horner has effectively wiped away their claims to fame by asking a simple question: “Where are all the baby dinosaurs?” Brusatte doesn’t even address Horner’s theory, probably because he doesn’t agree with it. Except the evidence is compelling.Everyone knows Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law (“indistinguishable from magic”) but not as many are familiar with his First: “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.” Brusatte is in his early 30s, so he doesn’t have that excuse.There are other things in this book which are irksome but don’t rise to the level of anger, such as his constant descriptions of travel. I could not care less which trains he had to catch or the type of trucks he rode in. I guess that stuff was added for flavor, but it’s entirely beside the point 90% of the time. His descriptions of fellow fossil fiends is more on point because it shows the diversity of the (mostly male) dinosaur hunters, but there are quite a few women who play tertiary roles. That’s the one valuable aspect of this book. Minor, but it’s there.He does have a weird way of describing dinosaurs. Herbivores are “plant gobblers” while carnivores are “meat gobblers”. He did mix it up once by saying “plant munchers”, so yay for linguistic diversity. Hashtag sarcasm.You don’t need to read this book. Try those others I linked above. Watch that video."

This is very much for dino fans, very readable, but not super-strict on phrasing for best presentation of the science, not enough pictures of models of dinos.So, yeah, the bad: writes of evolutionary development as if it were intentional. Speaks of T.Rex and Triceratops as 'rivals.'* Too many scientific names of species I've never heard of for me to able to keep track w/out those missing pictures. Some awkward stretches for humor.The good: Once I got the hang of reading it w/out fretting that I wasn't keeping track of every species named, I found it very engaging. And, yes, enlightening. And Brusatte does teach something about science. For example he does admit that new finds may overturn current assumptions, and he does explain *how* a lot of stuff that is understood came to be figured out:""We can tell that Rex had some of the largest and most powerful jaw muscles of any dinosaur, based on the very broad and deep gullies on the skull bones where the muscles attached.""One species mentioned early I am going to google image search: Effigia okeeffeae....... and ""human-sized ominvorous theropods called oviraptororsaurs.""... and *The Age of Reptiles* mural.... balaur bondoc""Proper grasslands would not develop until... many tens of millions of years after the dinosaurs cleared out."" (I have to pick the nit of the word choice 'cleared.' Did dinosaurs prevent grass from evolving to become grasslands? I doubt it....)""The Gobi fossils tell us that the ancestors of birds got smart before they took to the skies."" Also got feathers, wings, and efficient lungs 'flow-through' lungs before that, too. ""The feathers of nonflying, winged dinosaurs were a rainbow of different colors..."" discovered from Jakob Vinther's studies of melanosomes, and probably used for display.Walter Alvarez is Luis Alvarez' son.Anyway, you can see that the good outweighs the bad.

The absurd amount of times this guy hits you with first-person pronouns is outrageous. Let's just stick with the dinosaurs, you know, like the title suggested.

So much has happened in the decades since my youth, and getting caught up was more than worthwhile. There are over 50 dinosaur species discovered each year (!!) and more, science agrees that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs (!!!). I didn't realize that the Burpee, which is just down the road from me, has such a wide dinosaur history, despite the fact no significant fossils have been ever discovered in Illinois. I wish there'd been less about Brusatte through. The moments where it drifted into him nerding out about dinosaurs were weakened a bit when he name dropped. Certainly, those who've done work deserve credit, but doing so in context to how you know that person or have worked with them leans a bit too hard on the ""look at how I've rubbed elbows with famous people"" side. Barring that, readers who are curious about dinosaurs or haven't thought about them since elementary days will find this a worthwhile read.The audiobook worked well, too. "

I was very surprised at this shocking twist ending. I thought T-Rexs lived among us.Exhibit A:And yes, this is a brief history. This covers hundreds of millions (okay, billions but eh, semantics) and compresses a really varied and complex history into an overview so easy a caveman can read it.Aaaaaaaaand with that I'll retire all ancient puns for forever. Anywho, this was a fascinating glimpse into the quickly changing and fast-paced world of paleontology and geology, which were not the dead-end jobs that I grew up being told (""You'll never get a job studying dinosaurs"" they said, so I...never did—also I was never super duper fascinated by dinosaurs and the past because that kitchen scene scared the living shit out of me, so), but are vibrant and growing and uncovering more and more history-altering discoveries each month. It's fascinating and incredible what new discoveries, technology and modern analytics can do—and the brilliant minds that are dedicated to understanding the mysteries of the past.This entire book was amazing, particularly when understanding the billions of years of life that came before humans—and the chain of events that led to humans being able to become the apex predators instead of the vicious T-Rex, who was cut down at the height of its reign (and who had great eyesight and could not outrun a Jeep and could totally crush a car in half with its jaws, so thank you for giving me a false sense of security, Jurassic Park). Additionally, earlier periods of dinosaurs and non-dinosaurs were covered, particularly the evolution of crocodiles (who were scary AF) and also birds.Spoiler alert: birds are dinosaurs.Double spoiler alert: that meteorite did end the dinosaur's reign.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was clearly written, and while repetitive at times it clearly illustrated the vast biodiversity of Earth's history and how various climate changes and environments influence what flourishes were and how simple changes can have dramatic effects in various ecosystems.Definitely a must-read if you want to learn more about dinosaurs and the prehistoric Earth but don't know where to start.But, since dinosaurs are (mostly) extinct, all we can do is attempt to recreate the past:"

As y'all may be aware, I love me some nonfiction these days, and when it's well-written and accessible and brings the information being conveyed to the reader (or listener) in an entertaining way, so much the better. History, science, technology, sociology, whatever, I'm into it. This book ticked some of the boxes, but not as many as I'd have wanted. I enjoyed the information being presented, but not the method of presentation, if that makes sense. Lemme elaborate. Stephen Brusatte is definitely a dino-nerd. And I say this with the utmost respect. You can tell that he's excited and passionate about learning about dinosaurs, how they came to exist, and how they came to no longer exist. His writing is well-informed, interesting, and he knows his stuff, and presents his facts and supporting arguments well, whether it's the cause of the extinction event that cause the dinosaurs to become ""extinct"", or the argument that modern day birds ARE dinosaurs and therefore not all dinosaurs are extinct after all. They've just evolved. But, a bit of that gets lost in the overwhelming amount of hard to follow scientific species names and tidbit detail, and there was a lot of it. Discovery of new fossils, the qualities and criteria for distinguishing it as a Bellusaurus vs a Barosaurus vs a Barapasaurus vs a Brachiosaurus... etc. I think, even had I read this in print, this amount of quick-fire detail wouldn't work well, but in audio, it was just overwhelming. I ended up listening to this book MUCH MUCH slower than I usually listen to audiobooks, just to try to follow along and track the myriad dinos and their traits. But then, we come to the Spotlight Sections. Where we spend a lot of time focusing on one dinosaur (or idea) and examining it in detail. Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course, was the dinosaur, because it's everyone's favorite. I did learn quite a bit about them, and it was good information and fascinating stuff, but I wish that there were more sections of detail rather than a few of them interspersed within the general overview jam packed with rapid-fire facts. Then we have the humans. I actually feel a little bit bad about the annoyance I felt about this, but I did feel it, so there it is. Whenever Brusatte would introduce a new human into the story, whether they found one dinosaur bone in their backyard or have found millions of them around the globe, we got as much of their life story as possible in their intro. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in their expertise and why I should trust them and their conclusions, but do I really need to know that they enjoy kayaking? Not really. Let's keep it relevant. Finally, there was the reader. Holy moly, dude, take a BREATH. I feel like this guy was on a deadline to spit this book out. I had SUCH a hard time finding places to pause, because he literally never did. Even between chapters, a pause that might usually go for 2-3 seconds was MAYBE a 1 second pause here. I was NEVER quick enough to pause at the end of a section or chapter without cutting it off mid-word as he started the next section. It was crazy. And this while listening to this at a SLOWER speed than I normally do. O_OBut those complaints aside, this really was a fascinating, informative, and entertaining look at dinosaurs and their history. And their modernity. I loved the science and methodology of the discovery and determination of fossils and how they went about piecing together the lives that these animals would have lived. It really was very well researched, and I love reading books by people who are truly passionate and excited about their work. It does show. I do just wish that it was maybe presented in a little bit more measured of a way so that the reader can really absorb the massive amount of information here. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in dinosaurs, or earth's or life's history at all. There are lessons here about so much more than just dinosaurs, but about time and change and impermanence, but also about resilience and tenacity. The section about the extinction event that wiped out most of the species of life on the planet was harrowing and nerve-wracking, and I'm experiencing it from millions and millions of years removed from the actual event. Such was Brusatte's skill at delving into the detail and bringing the story to life. I was heartbroken for these animals that have been dead for millennia. It was a stark reminder that nothing at all guarantees our time on this rock, but that maybe something new and interesting can be given an opportunity to spring up in our place. "
58,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,2,"This could have been good. Maybe. If the author had stuck to dinosaurs which he didn't when he basically had to mention every person he has ever met in paleontology or has touched paleontology in some way. The first few chapters were definitely full of name dropping, mostly of male paleontologists. Female paleontologists were mentioned only if they were married to another paleontologist or just had their work mentioned while the men got full page biographies and accolades (and the overuse of certain adjectives). I do have to point out one female paleontologist did get a bit more of an introduction but she gets mentioned and then ignored. I know science , in certain fields, can still be male dominated but this felt more like blatant sexism by the author. I mean, the men get full page biographies, their work is highlighted, their connections to others in the field are highlighted, they get treated with respect and admiration. The women are pointed out in relation to their husbands (if married) and might get a sentence about their work. Or just a sentence about their work if they're not married. If these women's work hadn't impacted his own, I don't think the author would have mentioned them at all.The writing and organization are all over the place. This was supposed to be a history of the dinosaurs but this was more a biography of the author's work. And a lot of the material just didn't feel like it was really new and I'm not big into dinosaurs but I knew a lot already. And I haven't read anything on dinosaurs since elementary school, I think. There were times when there should have been less detail and times when there should have been more detail. The few middle chapters did seem to improve (more dinosaurs, less author self-promotion) but it never really got good. I also felt the author didn't seem to know who he was writing for, who his audience was supposed to be. Things were all over the place. This has potential but never seemed to get off the ground. Not worth reading."
59,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"Steve Brusatte really likes dinosaurs and prospecting for fossils and analyzing dinosaur history. And he is able to communicate that love really well. I enjoyed this book a lot. Brusatte presents the current state of dinosaur knowledge (Note: Spielberg had a lot of it wrong.) and brings it to life. Not just the dinosaurs themselves, but the many dedicated researchers who have made all these discoveries. The writing is lucid and accessible to the non-scientist. Okay, occasionally all the Latin names for different species cause a little eye-glazing, but it's not necessary to remember them to absorb the sense of the text. The description of the day the asteroid hit is especially vivid. And the explanations of evolution as reflected in the dinosaurs were very clear and helpful. I think Brusatte must be an excellent teacher. "

There have been amazing breakthroughs in our knowledge regarding dinosaurs; and with the advent of grandsons, it was clearly time for me to ‘up my game’!Brusatte has written a highly readable account of those new advances. He is an enthusiastic fossil hunter that takes the reader around the world from Georgia O’Keefe’s Ghost Ranch “bursting with dinosaur bones”; to Hell Creek, Montana—a Triceratops graveyard; to China and its plethora of feather-covered fossils; and to Italy where a thin layer of iridium indicates that an asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago.I admit that I enjoy reading about how paleontologists have determined that dinosaurs had feathers; that they were colored, and likely proved to be advantageous in attracting mates. And those dinosaurs that later became birds may have first used wing action to attract more attention, and just stumbled upon how wing action could result in gliding and eventually flying. It just takes a few millennia to make it happen.The number of new discoveries regarding dinosaurs over the past twenty years is mind-boggling. I look forward to learning more in the next twenty.

Gives a really vivid picture of the Mesozoic world and its creatures as moving, eating, breeding things. Some great history of the science too, if a bit laddish at points in the insistent ""hey we drink beer we definitely aren't nerds"". I don't know whether at this point in human history it's comfortable or not to reflect that the earth has seen multiple animal kingdoms wiped out when soaring carbon dioxide turned the atmosphere into an oven. There's a kind of comfort in looking at it from a cosmic level, I guess? "
62,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,5,"This was a book I HAD to read--to catch up on the subject I obsessed so much about in elementary school-Dinosaurs! When I was a kid I read every book on dinosaurs that I could find in my local library and my parents bought me even more books--and I was thrilled no end to go to the nearby Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago! but that was in the 60s and I thought we knew everything there was to know about the big guys. They were slow, brainless giants doomed to extinction so that the way could be cleared for The Rise of Man. But, as paleontologist Steve Brusatte points out, at the end of the 60s and going into the 70s, a new paradigm took shape, in which dinosaurs have been viewed as active, even energetic, animals, some being social and intelligent. Rather than doomed to failure, they were among the most successful animals for over 150 million years. If it had not been for what Brusatte calls ""the worst day in the history of our planet,"" when the asteroid (or comet) hit 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs would still dominate the Earth. The good news is that the dinos did not completely die out. I see some flitting about my bird feeder even as I type this. The birds are now classified as dinosaurs, as theropods, related to T-rex and velociraptors. For me, the most interesting part of the book (as a bird-lover) is his discussing the origin and evolution of the birds (and feathers!). I'm so glad they escaped the Cretaceous (Fifth) Extinction Event, but it's an open question whether they can escape the current or Sixth Extinction Event... I enjoyed this narrative greatly because not only does Steve share his passion with the reader (he's one guy who sure does love his job!) but he relates his experiences taking part in expeditions around the globe. This does seem to be a golden age of discovery of dinosaurs--and I missed it! BUT at least I can read about it. Thanks, Steve Brusatte! And I look forward to hearing more from this amazing young man!"
63,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"Off to a good start. I prefer to read pop-science books written by scientists, and Brusatte is a young vertebrate paleontologist at the Univ. of Edinburgh. Like all of us, he caught the dino bug when he was a kid. Unlike most, he made a career of it, and it's been an interesting one. Dino books are generally written by seniors, so it's fun to see one of the ""young guns"" take up the pen (or computer). Brusatte is an adequate writer, which is fine, since he's got some great stories to tell. And it's a great time for the field -- he says that lately, there's a new dino species described, on average, every week!The good quality continues, and I enjoyed the book, although I got dino-overload at times. He's a decent writer, but the prose gets purple, as in the Great Asteroid that (probably) killed off the dinosaurs (except for the birds!). His science is up-to-date, and I recommend the book, especially for dinosaur fans. 3.8 stars.Here's a nice sample, that is (I think) pretty much a chapter in the book:https://www.scientificamerican.com/ar..."

All those dinosaur and animal names and descriptions without pictures to refer to can get a bit confusing, especially when you're not listening in your native language... Obviously, this was completely my own fault, so I'm not critising the book here. Just a heads-up for anyone who is thinking of getting the audio book.***I am doing the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge and this is where I need to start cheating a little bit. The cue ""Continental drift: Read a book set on every continent"" could mean you read ONE book that travels through all continents or SEVERAL books, one for each continent. Since I'm almost sure I won't be able to add six more books to my already ambitious summer TBR, I decided to give this one a go. I mean, the supercontinent Pangea did incorporate most 0f Earth's landmasses at one point. And dinosaurs are just cool."
65,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"I caught the dino bug when I was probably seven years old, and have never stopped being utterly entranced by these amazing creatures. Much of what I learned as a child about the big lizards has since been refuted by new fossils, better analysis, and new research. Stephen Brusatte caught the dino bug when he was young and became a vertebrate paleontologist. His passion comes through loud and clear in this book, as he takes his readers from ancient history to the end of most dinosaurs on this planet, starting with the biggest mass extinction on this planet at the end of the Permian age; this die-off made way for some unusual reptiles with a different body plan than many of their peers that proved to be amazingly successful for these reptiles and their countless descendants for millennia afterwards through the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. Though I was already familiar with much that Brusatte covered, his writing style made the material approachable and easy to understand. There were not as many images as I would have liked; despite my familiarity with many of the creatures, it’s still hard to remember the little differences between similar individuals in a group, and more drawings would have been helpful.I particularly liked Brusatte's chapters on the Permian-Triassic transition, tyrannosaurs, birds, and the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous especially. I am a fan of theropods, and Brusatte is clearly a huge fan of the tyrannosaurids. He tended to wax a little melodramatic about these carnivorous dinosaurs, but then it's a little hard not to be in awe of such terrifying beings. (Especially the huge carnivorous members of this group.)This book was a good refresher on many points about dinosaurs, and the author's writing style and obvious enthusiasm for the subject made this an enjoyable read."

It's like wondering what might have happened if the archduke was never shot.The whole these-were-the-coolest-beings-that-ever-roamed-the-earth moniker has always made me a dino fan. The amazing variations of these huge oddballs have always been intriguing and this book does its best to piece everything together. Which is a very good thing, because there have been so many new discoveries and new theories since I was a child that I lost track of which was the coolest dino (welcome back, Brontosaurus).Steve Brusatte is one of the world's eminent paleontologists whose other books, especially Field Guide to Dinosaurs, have made me a fan of his writing and his obvious enthusiasm for his work. Here, he charts the very beginnings of the dinosaur, even before they evolved. He starts with the Permian Extinction, which eliminated 95% of life on earth. Somehow, some little things survived and that eventually led the way for the bigger things to arrive later on. Right off, his description of the Great Dying kept me glued to the pages as the volcanoes spewed forth lava mud and carbon dioxide. How anything managed to live through all of that is simply amazing.As the dinosaurs grew, the earth was also changing, with the continents moving toward their current locations and the environment becoming a bit nicer. Well, nicer like walking outside at noon during an Alabama summer. The dinosaurs became larger and larger and ruled the world until the day that nasty asteroid slammed into Earth. Then, Brusatte relates what it must have felt like to wake up that day as a dino, thinking you were just going about your business as usual. Nope. Any dinosaur too close to the impact was vaporised while the ones further away endured boiling hot hail, mammoth earthquakes, renewed lava flows, loss of sun, loss of trees, and ergo, loss of life. The dinosaurs didn't all die at once, he states, but probably over a few hundred or few thousand years. Given the fact that they had been around for millions of years, the dinosaur extinction was relatively quick.The book doesn't just end with the catastrophic impact but instead continues with the rise of the birds, our current dinosaurs. All very fascinating. While there are some b&w illustrations at the beginning of each chapter, the book is mostly text with various photos of fossils and the paleontologists who discovered the dino fossils. That's because this book is as much a tribute to the men and women who found those dragon bones as it is to the dinosaur. I deducted a star for the continuous focus on the author (we get it, Steve, you like dinosaurs and you go on lots of expeditions). So pretty good book, but it forced me to check out another library book (The Great Dinosaur Discoveries) so I could see the actual illustrations of what these big brutes would have looked like.That darn asteroid.Book Season = Year Round (looking at the finches with suspicion)"
68,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73449257-renee-amberg,3,"Nothing lasts forever. This book does a fantastic job at showing how elaborately complex and diverse our planet truly is. It puts perspective on “our” life and “our” Earth and how we really don’t know it all. All we have are the few pieces of evidence of a life completely different from our own. I really appreciate all the researchers and paleontologists who put their time and energy, (and sometimes their life) into helping us better understand these eras and species long gone. The end really made me sad. Seeing these beautiful creatures end so abruptly (and in the way that it did) is such a shame. However, few of these creatures did leave their footprint to give future species, like us, proof and imagination of an insanely different time here on Earth. Just imagine all the things we don’t know because we don’t have proof, haven’t found it yet, or might have wrong. It’s surreal to think about. That said, I do wish the author talked less about the people who studied the fossils and more about the dinosaurs. I also wish he threw in more pictures of what he was explaining so I could get a picture of what he was discussing. I found myself with my phone in one hand and the book in the other, constantly looking up pictures of the dinosaurs he mentioned, the eras, and anything he named and just assumed the reader knew. "

I got to go through the same thing when my kids went through the phase as well and I got all caught up with things like Walking With Dinosaurs and its ilk. Which is all a round-about way of saying that I thought of myself as being fairly well-informed about paleontology, at least from a pop-science perspective.This book did an excellent job of bringing that pop-science overview of the field much more up-to-date. For instance, I was aware that paleontology in China had been going off with some really exciting discoveries, but I had no idea how key that has been to the overall understanding of dinosaur lineage. There also appears to be some fairly exciting new thinking about the origin of dinosaurs and the early period of the Triassic that I was entirely unaware of.In short, this is a great book for establishing an up-to-date popular science-level overview of the dinosaur element of paleontology, all made that much more engaging by a series of personal anecdotes from the author and his own career and interaction with his peers."

The rise and fall of the dinosaurs is an incredible story, of a time when giant beasts and other fantastic creatures made the world their own. They walked on the very ground below us, their fossils now entombed in rock – the clues that tell this story. To me, it's one of the greatest narratives in the history of our planet.
The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is thoroughly enjoyable pop science: author (and celebrated young paleontologist) Steve Brusatte uses his own learning journey to outline the exciting advances occurring today in his field (he calls this the “golden age” of paleontology, noting that new species of dinosaurs are discovered/described at the astounding rate of about one per week), and not only did I learn new and fascinating information from the deep history of our remarkable planet, but I found Brusatte's enthusiasm to be contagious. Who doesn't love dinosaurs? Totally accessible (but fact-filled) and balanced with personal stories (which I acknowledge might strain the patience of those of a more academic bent), it all worked for me.Early on, Brusatte – who is a Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Edinburgh – refers to his “ebullient, wildly animated lecturing style”, and for the purposes of this review, I'd rather demonstrate this ebullience than attempt to list everything that Brusatte taught me. On the sauropods whose tracks he studied on the Scottish Isle of Skye:
There's really no better way to say it: the sauropods that made their marks in that ancient Scottish lagoon were awesome creatures. Awesome in the literal sense of the word – impressive, daunting, inspiring awe. If I was handed a blank sheet of paper and pen and told to create a mythical beast, my imagination could never match what evolution created in sauropods.
Brusatte devotes plenty of breathless space to the Tyrannosaurus rex – including debunking what Jurassic Park got wrong about the apex predators (turns out that their eyesight was perfectly sharp, but they couldn't have outrun a jeep) – and writes, “The seat of Rex's power was its head. It was a killing machine, torture chamber for its prey, and an evil mask all in one.” And after having repeatedly referred to T. Rex arms as “sad” and “pathetic”, Brusatte shares new research that has determined, based on strong shoulder extensors and elbow flexors, the Rex used these “short but strong arms to hold down struggling prey while the jaws did their bone-crunching thing. The arms were accessories to murder.” Murder! The writing gets amped up when T. Rex meets its favourite meal:Triceratops, like its archnemesis T. rex, is a dinosaur icon. In films and documentaries, it usually plays the gentle, sympathetic plant-eater, the perfect dramatic foil to the Tyrant King. Sherlock versus Moriarty, Batman versus the Joker, Trike versus Rex. But it's not all movie magic; no, these two dinosaurs truly would have been rivals 66 million years ago...The King needed immense amounts of flesh to fuel its metabolism; its three-horned comrade was fourteen tons of slow-moving prime steak. You can figure out what happened next.So, you either enjoy a professor writing like a teenaged dino-fanboy, or you don't. Interspersed with the timeline of dinosaur evolution, Brusatte outlines the history of fossil hunting from the “Bone Wars” (which saw 19th-century rivals Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh sending out teams of mercenaries to hunt for bones for their individual glory; in the pursuit of which they weren't above stealing, lying, and sabotaging each other's sites) to the academics of today. In addition to referring to individuals as the “hot shots” or “rock stars” or the “Rat Pack” of paleontology, Brusatte proves that paleontologists just might be a special breed unto themselves. Barnum Brown, the first celebrity paleontologist at the turn of the twentieth century, prospected for dino bones in high summer “decked out in his fur coat with his pickaxe slung over his shoulder”. Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás – an adventurer, WWI spy, and the first paleobiologist – was a “flamboyant dandy and a tragic genius, whose exploits hunting dinosaurs in Transylvania were brief respites from the insanity of the rest of his life. Dracula, in all seriousness, has nothing on the Dinosaur Baron.” And as for Brusatte's modern day colleagues:Thomas Carr – my absinthe-drinking, Goth-dressing friend who studies T. rex – was with us on the expedition and was part of this team. Clad in khaki (it was far too hot for his usual all-black getup) and sucking down Gatorade by the gallon (absinthe was more of an indoor pursuit), he attacked the mudstones with his rock hammer (which he nicknamed Warrior) and his pickaxe (Warlord), exposing a number of new Triceratops bones.And working on the other side of the world in China, Brusatte describes another rising star:
Jingmai (O'Connor) calls herself a paleontologista – fitting given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia. A native of Southern California – half Irish, half-Chinese by blood – Jingmai is a Roman Candle of energy – delivering caustic one-liners one moment, speaking in eloquent paragraphs about politics the next, and then it's on to music or art or her own unique brand of Buddhist philosophy. Oh yes, and she’s also the world’s number-one expert on those first birds that broke the bounds of Earth to fly above their dinosaur ancestors.
And speaking of the first birds: as uncomfortable as I find this book's cover art – depicting a wispily feathered T. rex confronting wispily feathered prey dinos – that's a mental-shift I'll need to force myself to make: Brusatte makes the incontrovertible case that all true dinosaurs (not crocs or other proto-reptiles) were in a direct line to modern day birds and shared many of the same body features (flow-through lungs, wishbones, and yes, feathers; there's a paleontologist working today who can even determine the colours of their plumage). But, if I can mentally shift the T. rex from the upright Barney-the-dinosaur stance depicted in my youth to the balanced-forward pose accepted today, I suppose I can eventually re-imagine it covered in feathers. After all of the enthusiasm Brusatte displays for the rise and evolutionary success of the dinosaurs, the final chapter on their sudden demise is urgently and tragically related:It was the worst day in the history of our planet. A few hours of unimaginable violence that undid more than 150 million years of evolution and set life on a new course. T. rex was there to see it.An impact from a meteorite (or possibly comet), hitting with the force of “a billion nuclear bombs' worth of energy”, caused the near total extinction of the earth's most successful and widespread species (excepting, of course, for those dinosaurs who survived to evolve into what we think of as birds). The good news is that this catastrophic event paved the wave for the rise of the mammals, and us; the bad news is that we're no more special than the dinosaurs, and catastrophes – including those of our own making – can strike at any time. If you like your pop science poppy, this is an entertaining and informative read."
72,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Dinosaurs aren't a hard sell. People are just into them. I'm one of those people. In this book, Brusatte notes that his generation (which I'm a part of ~ thirtysomethings) were indelibly drawn to dinosaurs because of Jurassic Park. Of course, the interest preceded that film (umm, what about 1988's Land Before Time?), but it did solidify it!I've had this book since it came out in 2018 and knew I'd be reading it for this round of Science September. It's a great primer, a deep dive into modern #paleontology and evolutionary biology, with all the new fossils and species identifications.You come for the dinosaurs, and Brusatte's engaging storytelling and infectious enthusiasm for the subject keep you reading. He has what I can only describe as a ""folksy"" writing style, describing nearly every person in the book as 'the greatest paleontogist' or 'the nicest person you'll ever meet' (it's endearing, but it makes you wonder if it's all exactly true... Are they all this nice?) My favorite sections of the book were about dinosaur anatomy and biomechanics - the descriptions of their lungs and breathing patterns, and how this resembles modern birds' lungs, their bones' hollow structure, and their locomotion and moving speeds. How does a creature that weighs TONS pump blood? New and more complete #fossils have shown us how they moved, breathed, circulated blood, digested food, and how they looked (feathers! Even Tyrannosaurus Rex had feathers - not the plumage, but more likely quills and downy fuzz feathers). It's completely fascinating.This was a great companion piece with Peter Brannen's The Ends of the World that I read last week. There is overlap in topic of mass extinction after the asteroid hit, but Brusatte's book goes into more depth in the paleontology (and some anecdotes about cold calling Walter Alvarez for travel advice!) and the #evolution that led to the bird-dinosaurs we know today."
73,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Overall, a really interesting book & well laid out, but I floundered with all the odd names. A lot of that is my own ignorance & I think I would have enjoyed this more if I knew the names better. It's obvious that Brusatte lives & breathes this stuff & loves it. The narrator was excellent & conveyed Brusatte's enthusiasm well, but I glazed over from the terminology occasionally.It was a great trip, though. I learned not just about the evolution of dinosaurs, but about the other critters of the times, ones I'd often confused with them. He describes their rise very well & dispels many of the older ideas that I learned in school. For instance, he made sense of their feathers far better than anything else I've read on the subject which is admittedly little. In doing so, he shows why we didn't realize they had them for so long.Reconstructing the story of the dinosaurs is tough due to the time involved. Their reign ended 66 million years ago, but it was only about 50 years ago that we nailed down why. Fossils aren't common & many of the best sites were plundered by ignorant, greedy men. He shows how this was both good & bad. The interest in them led to money for expeditions that are expensive, hard, & time consuming, but we have many fossils that aren't properly cataloged or investigated as he shows through several discoveries made by students, including himself. New methods & tools have brought some amazing clarity.Definitely recommended in any format."
74,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070393-natch,2,"I'm not sure that I've ever been more disappointed in a book. I went into it thinking that it would be a basic-level summary of the evolution of dinosaurs and the world events that shaped them. Instead, the majority of the book (or so it seemed) was about the author's (and others) meetings and, occasionally, trips to find dinosaur bones. What made the book particularly insufferable (as others have mentioned previously) was that the author has to be in his thirties, at most (I didn't look it up), and, frankly, he doesn't possess any real critical insight of himself or others. As a consequence, the book does not start as you would expect - here's what the world looked like pre-dinosaur and here's what inhabited; it starts as an autobiography with the occasional dinosaur story thrown in. For example, his first story centers on going to Poland (if I remember correctly), getting off the train, and meeting a rather unfriendly looking guy...but, turns out, that guy was really friendly! And they found footprints! And wrote an article about it!...Oh, and the proto-dinosaurs were less like salamanders in their movements and more directional and we figured out what they probably looked like...but instead of a good description, here's a little photo and that's all. But it continues in this vein. Okay, next, the author went to Portugal. There, he met a dude who was the best at finding the fossils in the places he explored since childhood. Isn't that great? Isn't that guy brilliant? Just like the other paleontologists the author knows? Well, no. I grew up on a beach known to have plenty of fossilized shark teeth. I'm pretty good at finding shark teeth. So is every other person who grew up there or has lived there for a while and looks (cue certain little, old ladies). A visitor who shows up once for two weeks is going to be terrible compared to all us natives. The other thing that really bugged me was how everyone the author has ever met in the world of paleontology is ""brilliant"" or some equivalent...and there are several pages which are just lists of people and their specialties. I'm not sure how many paleontologists there are in the world, but I would guess that a fair number were listed in this book as ""brilliant."" I just don't think that's the case, unless paleontology is only populated by MENSA members. It really seemed like this book was more the autobiography of a dude in his thirties who happens to study dinosaurs and who thought to throw in some statements about dinosaurs. Disappointingly, those statements aren't always well thought out or explained. For example, the author talks about Pangea pretty early on, describing it as a single landmass stretching from the artic to antartic and centered on the equator with a desert spanning the equator so hostile to dinosaur-life that it was, essentially, a dinosaur-less. Yet, in the same breath says that on either side of that desert were dinosaurs in the early Triassic period. What he never seems to tell us is how those dinosaurs bypassed the desert to become distributed on both sides or whether dinosaurs evolved twice (one on each side) or what might have happened. I had to go on Wikipedia to look it up. Seriously. A history book should not require readers to resort to Wikipedia to explain what happened. (Dinosaurs appear to have been able to migrate past the desert areas, fyi).I ended up giving this book two stars because it does actually talk about dinosaurs a fair bit, albeit in a kinda rushed manner. And, I guess, I felt the talk of dinosaurs was colored by my perceptions of the protagonist of the story, the author himself. I'm a bit concerned by how much beer he drinks. There was more than one description of events being described as the best (the best conference, etc.) which seem to have been wholly related to the availability of alcohol and, in the case of Argentina, beef. Further, I'm a bit concerned about the author's relationship to women. He seems to revel in ribald jokes, as, I think, other commentators have mentioned, and seems to have a bit of a negative view of them. That might be okay for the character in a novel, but it's something that should be addressed in the world of real people. Those things really did color my feelings on this book and definitely contributed to the loss of a star. The other two were lost because of how much space seemed to be devoted to personal antedotes and urgings to read his other works rather than the story of dinosaurs. "

76,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Highway to Hell Creek; the discovery of the remnants of Jurassic park In this dazzling rehash, author Steve Brusatte tells the mesmerizing story of dinosaurs; their origins, evolution, diversity, habitats and their cataclysmic extinction. This is a captivating narrative that engages the reader till the end of the book. Highly readable and well researched that interest readers focused in ancient history this planet, dinosaurs, and life in late cretaceous era (100 – 66 million Years). The book describes immediate events after planet was hit by 6.5-mile-long asteroid (Chicxulub meteorite), at the speed of 67,000 miles per hour, 65.5 million years ago. The fossils from this event are preserved all over the planet, which gives a grim picture. It simply demonstrates that life on earth is susceptible to the wrath of nature. This was the sixth extinction of life in 4.5 billion history of the planet, and it was colossal, cosmic and catastrophic. How did life witness this? The author describes in detail as what may have happened immediately before and after the greatest hit in the recent history of our planet. Although this has been discussed on several TV shows on Nat Geo, Discovery, PBS and Science channels by geophysicists, astronomers and paleontologists, it is interesting to read from the point of a paleontologist who studies dinosaurs with passion. In fact, it is common in recent days to read about the discovery of new species of dinosaurs, birds and mammals from this event. One of the goldmines for finding the lost species is Hell Creek, Montana where treasure trove of fossils is preserved. It is a mixing of fossil carcasses and a layer of glass tektites from meteorite hit with impact impressions deposited minutes to hours after the apocalypse.The Hell Creek Formation in the Upper Great Plains of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were laid down by ancient rivers and streams as they traveled from the Rocky Mountains in the west toward the east before emptying into a large interior seaway that bisected North America during the latest Cretaceous period. Due to rise in sea-level in the Late Cretaceous, North America was bisected by a seaway stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. The states of NM, AZ, CO, SD, ND and MT were buried under water in a shallow sea that ran from Mexico to NW Canada. At that time the states of CA, OR, WA and ID were on the West and the rest of United States were on the east. The Hell Creek rocks preserve the remains of dinosaurs after Chicxulub meteorite struck into the ocean in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The death and destruction of the most iconic dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus Rex, the three horned dinosaur, Triceratops, the duckbilled dinosaur, Edmontosaurus, and the tank-like armored dinosaur, Ankylosaurus. The fossils also include; crocodiles, lizards, snakes, turtles, frogs, salamanders, fishes, plants and mammals. At this time, the planet was largely one supercontinent called Pangea, but it had started to split into several fragments. Europe and Asia were still globed together, and they were linked to North America by a series of islands. But what made these animals to become big? They had to eat and digest vast quantities of food, they had to grow fast, must be able to breathe very efficiently, and shed excess body heat. This process was enabled by their unique body plan that included a highly efficient lung more related to a birdlike lung because many bones of the chest cavity had big openings. There were many air sacs that extended throughout their body that helped lungs to take in enough oxygen to stoke their metabolism.During the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous, tyrannosaurs flourished, ruling the river valleys, lakeshores, flood­ plains, forests, and deserts of North America and China. Colossal tyrannosaurs never seemed to gain a foothold in Europe or the southern continents, where other groups of large predators prospered, but in North America and China, species of tyrannosaurs were unrivaled. They had become the transcendent terrors that fire our imaginations. The species of Tyrannosaurus Rex was not a global but existed only in North West of United States. On that fateful morning 66 million years ago, when a pack of T. Rexes woke up on what would go down as the final day of the Cretaceous Period, all seemed normal in their Hell Creek kingdom, the same as it had for two millions of years. Forests of conifers and ginkgoes stretched to the horizon, interspersed with palms and magnolias. The distant churn of a river, rushing eastward to empty into the great seaway that lapped against western North America. For the last several weeks, the more perceptive of the T. Rexes may have noticed a glowing orb in the sky, far off in the distance and a hazy ball also had a fiery rim. The orb would appear and disappear for hours. As it appeared again, it was bigger, its shine illuminating much of the sky to the southeast in a cloudy psychedelic mist. Then a flash. No noise, only a split-second flare of yellow that lit up the whole sky, disorienting the animals for a moment. As they blinked their eyes back to focus, they noticed that the orb was now gone. Moments later, and then they were blindsided. Another flash, but this one far more vengeful. The rays lit the morning air in a fireworks display and burned into their retinas. In fact, no noise at all. By now, the birds and flying raptors had stopped chirping, and silence hung over Hell Creek. The calm lasted for only a few seconds. Next, the ground beneath their feet started to rumble and shake, and then flew like waves; pulses of energy were shooting through the rocks and soil, the ground rising and falling as if a giant snake were slithering underneath. Everything not rooted into the dirt was thrown upward; then it crashed down, and then up and down again, the Earth's surface was acting like a trampoline. Everything within a radius of about six hundred miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of modern-day Mexico was annihilated, and vaporized. For several years, the Earth turned cold and dark because of soot, sulfur, sulfuric acid and rock dust in the atmosphere that blocked out the sun. The darkness brought severe winter for years that only the hardiest of animals could survive. The rains were highly acidic that wiped out much of marine species. Here and there, species of lizards, crocodiles, turtles, birds and rat-size mammals made it but with lots of duress under the fury of nature. Hell-Creek was turned to Hell that reverberated in rest of the world."

78,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,5,"Phew! A pop history on Dinosaurs written by a Paleantologist is enough to trigger your curiosity and awaken the science geek in you. However, you do worry about a Ross Geller level book you will be stuck with for ages. Stephen Brusatte is more Douglas Adams than Ross Geller and he tells a story that is at once engaging and enlightening. Imagine a huge jigsaw puzzle that has to pieced together. The challenge is that the pieces are found years apart and you have dedicated science heroes who try to make the best image possible with the pieces they have. And the frustration that lasts for decades when you realise there are missing pieces. That has been the story of piecing together the history of one of the most fascinating creatures that inhabited the earth.What Brusatte has done is not just laying out the facts (and theories) but also a tribute to all the paleontologists who have played a part in building the current understanding. Starting from the Permian period fossils through the Triassic age till the Jurassic and Cretaceous - the author paints a picture that is hard to ignore of complex foodchains, rise of apex predators and the entire evolution journey on fast forward. The journey is mapped through the work of paleontologists, geologists and collectors whose stories, quirks and anecdotes too are part of this book. The history of Dinosaurs cannot be narrated without the history of the planet and hence we get a lot of information on movement of continent, rise of oceans and rise of life in general.There is a chapter dedicated to Tyranosorus Rex (Tyrant King) which almost worships the larger than life (most lives, at least) predators. The author does not miss an opportunity to compare notes and point errata to the Jurassic Park movie, which is the introduction to most of us who are googling images today. The linkage to birds apart, the single mass extinction theory that brought an end to cretareous is more like the dominant theory that most paleantologists subscribe to. He actually describes a meeting of paleantologists in 2012 to discuss the validity of the theory where everyone agreed. This is only what we know.. so far.. A good book that presents facts actually allows you to understand the origin of popular theories without judging them - like the science of Phrenology which took off in the same period classifying human beings from different continents as different species. Today we grow uncomfortable knowing that gave grounds to Eugenics and later persecution of races in terms of superiority. Scientists are impervious to the implications of truth. The book makes you ask a lot more questions and for that reason alone, I loved it. A joyride!"
79,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7039679-ellen,4,"Even though I love dinosaurs, I don't really read science books...ever. So, I was surprised I liked this book, let alone finished it. It was quite informative, especially for those, like me, who haven't been able to keep up with all of the findings in this subject for the last couple of decades. I think I liked this book because it was part memoir as well as science. The author has a sense of humor, and is only three years older than me, so his pop culture and generation comments were right on par. He does mention the film Jurassic Park several times, though usually to disprove some of their science. I only had one complaint: No color pictures! I was surprised how much this bugged me, but as the author described such beautiful landscapes of where he was digging, and then only provided a black and white photograph, the beauty was lost on me. I realize it's cheaper to publish without color photos, and paleontologists most likely don't make bank, but the author is the ""resident paleontologist for BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs"" so I think color photographs isn't too much to ask. The illustrations were lovely though, even if they portrayed the dinos with feathers...I guess I can't deny a lot of dinosaurs had feathers anymore since I've now read this. Dinosaurs just don't seem as cool with them.I will just mention that I have my own personal opinion on evolution. This book talks a lot about the evolution of dinosaurs. I am religious, which probably has a lot to do with it, but I never quite agreed fully with the author on this subject.Overall, I recommend it!2018 challenge: A book with an animal in the title"

They had endured hardships, evolved superpowers like fast metabolisms and enormous size, and vanquished their rivals so that they ruled an entire planet…Then, literally, in a split second, it ended.”Riveting crash course on dino history. Very well done. "
81,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike,1,"D’ya see that subtitle? “A New History of a Lost World”? It’s one of two things: 1) utter bullshit or 2) marketing spin (which amounts to the same thing as #1). There’s no new information in this book. However, it IS a new book, so... yeah. Bullshit marketing.There are some other reasons why I’m giving this a 1-star review. One of the biggest is Brusatte’s continued insistence on ascribing INTENT to evolution. What the actual fuck, dude? No, triceratops didn’t decide to grow horns. T. rex didn’t want to grow teeth. Mammals weren’t “craving” the opportunity to supplant the dinosaurs for 100 million years. If you’re going to imbue intelligent design to evolution then you are one bad week from assuming that an almighty god did it and that the Bible is literally correct.You are doing a disservice to everyone who reads this book, especially to every kid who does so, because you are saying chance doesn’t exist in natural selection and that every species decides what it wants to become. That’s woo-woo bullshit and utterly unscientific. Stop invoking intelligent design. Stop it.In my lifetime there have been a few things which have completely upended our understanding of dinosaurs. Bakker’s insistence that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. (The Dinosaur Heresies) Which now has a mountain of evidence supporting it. Alvarez’s discovery that an asteroid impact in the Yucatán killed off the dinosaurs. (T. Rex and the Crater of Doom) And most recently, Horner’s complete and utter decimation of the plethora of dinosaur species. (https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner...)Paleontologists at the time pushed back on all of these theories, but the first two are now widely accepted by pretty much everyone, because the ones who objected have died off. The latter has pissed off paleontologists because some of them have named these “new” species and Horner has effectively wiped away their claims to fame by asking a simple question: “Where are all the baby dinosaurs?” Brusatte doesn’t even address Horner’s theory, probably because he doesn’t agree with it. Except the evidence is compelling.Everyone knows Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law (“indistinguishable from magic”) but not as many are familiar with his First: “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.” Brusatte is in his early 30s, so he doesn’t have that excuse.There are other things in this book which are irksome but don’t rise to the level of anger, such as his constant descriptions of travel. I could not care less which trains he had to catch or the type of trucks he rode in. I guess that stuff was added for flavor, but it’s entirely beside the point 90% of the time. His descriptions of fellow fossil fiends is more on point because it shows the diversity of the (mostly male) dinosaur hunters, but there are quite a few women who play tertiary roles. That’s the one valuable aspect of this book. Minor, but it’s there.He does have a weird way of describing dinosaurs. Herbivores are “plant gobblers” while carnivores are “meat gobblers”. He did mix it up once by saying “plant munchers”, so yay for linguistic diversity. Hashtag sarcasm.You don’t need to read this book. Try those others I linked above. Watch that video."
82,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Was anything that I learned half a century ago accurate, or anything in the Jurassic Park movie? Seems not.... This is very much for dino fans, very readable, but not super-strict on phrasing for best presentation of the science, not enough pictures of models of dinos.So, yeah, the bad: writes of evolutionary development as if it were intentional. Speaks of T.Rex and Triceratops as 'rivals.'* Too many scientific names of species I've never heard of for me to able to keep track w/out those missing pictures. Some awkward stretches for humor.The good: Once I got the hang of reading it w/out fretting that I wasn't keeping track of every species named, I found it very engaging. And, yes, enlightening. And Brusatte does teach something about science. For example he does admit that new finds may overturn current assumptions, and he does explain *how* a lot of stuff that is understood came to be figured out:""We can tell that Rex had some of the largest and most powerful jaw muscles of any dinosaur, based on the very broad and deep gullies on the skull bones where the muscles attached.""One species mentioned early I am going to google image search: Effigia okeeffeae....... and ""human-sized ominvorous theropods called oviraptororsaurs.""... and *The Age of Reptiles* mural.... balaur bondoc""Proper grasslands would not develop until... many tens of millions of years after the dinosaurs cleared out."" (I have to pick the nit of the word choice 'cleared.' Did dinosaurs prevent grass from evolving to become grasslands? I doubt it....)""The Gobi fossils tell us that the ancestors of birds got smart before they took to the skies."" Also got feathers, wings, and efficient lungs 'flow-through' lungs before that, too. ""The feathers of nonflying, winged dinosaurs were a rainbow of different colors..."" discovered from Jakob Vinther's studies of melanosomes, and probably used for display.Walter Alvarez is Luis Alvarez' son.Anyway, you can see that the good outweighs the bad. And no, despite all my notes, you can't skip this book if you're interested in the subject...

The absurd amount of times this guy hits you with first-person pronouns is outrageous. Let's just stick with the dinosaurs, you know, like the title suggested. Here's a snippet of where I grew most annoyed (talking about one of his expert female colleagues): ""...she can easily work from home, which is deep among the last remaining Beijing hutongs-traditional narrow-alleyed neighborhoods of single-story stone buildings pasted together. Good thing too, because she spends a lot of her non-science time hanging about in the hutongs, raving and occasionally DJ-ing in the trendy clubs of China's suddenly hip capital. Jingmai calls herself a paleontologista-fitting, given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia.""

So much has happened in the decades since my youth, and getting caught up was more than worthwhile. There are over 50 dinosaur species discovered each year (!!) and more, science agrees that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs (!!!). I didn't realize that the Burpee, which is just down the road from me, has such a wide dinosaur history, despite the fact no significant fossils have been ever discovered in Illinois. I wish there'd been less about Brusatte through. The moments where it drifted into him nerding out about dinosaurs were weakened a bit when he name dropped. Certainly, those who've done work deserve credit, but doing so in context to how you know that person or have worked with them leans a bit too hard on the ""look at how I've rubbed elbows with famous people"" side. Barring that, readers who are curious about dinosaurs or haven't thought about them since elementary days will find this a worthwhile read.The audiobook worked well, too. "

I was very surprised at this shocking twist ending. I thought T-Rexs lived among us.Exhibit A:And yes, this is a brief history. This covers hundreds of millions (okay, billions but eh, semantics) and compresses a really varied and complex history into an overview so easy a caveman can read it.Aaaaaaaaand with that I'll retire all ancient puns for forever. Anywho, this was a fascinating glimpse into the quickly changing and fast-paced world of paleontology and geology, which were not the dead-end jobs that I grew up being told (""You'll never get a job studying dinosaurs"" they said, so I...never did—also I was never super duper fascinated by dinosaurs and the past because that kitchen scene scared the living shit out of me, so), but are vibrant and growing and uncovering more and more history-altering discoveries each month. It's fascinating and incredible what new discoveries, technology and modern analytics can do—and the brilliant minds that are dedicated to understanding the mysteries of the past.This entire book was amazing, particularly when understanding the billions of years of life that came before humans—and the chain of events that led to humans being able to become the apex predators instead of the vicious T-Rex, who was cut down at the height of its reign (and who had great eyesight and could not outrun a Jeep and could totally crush a car in half with its jaws, so thank you for giving me a false sense of security, Jurassic Park). Additionally, earlier periods of dinosaurs and non-dinosaurs were covered, particularly the evolution of crocodiles (who were scary AF) and also birds.Spoiler alert: birds are dinosaurs.Double spoiler alert: that meteorite did end the dinosaur's reign.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was clearly written, and while repetitive at times it clearly illustrated the vast biodiversity of Earth's history and how various climate changes and environments influence what flourishes were and how simple changes can have dramatic effects in various ecosystems.Definitely a must-read if you want to learn more about dinosaurs and the prehistoric Earth but don't know where to start.But, since dinosaurs are (mostly) extinct, all we can do is attempt to recreate the past:"
87,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I listened to this audiobook during one of my many long drives this last week, and I really enjoyed it, despite some annoying flaws. As y'all may be aware, I love me some nonfiction these days, and when it's well-written and accessible and brings the information being conveyed to the reader (or listener) in an entertaining way, so much the better. History, science, technology, sociology, whatever, I'm into it. This book ticked some of the boxes, but not as many as I'd have wanted. I enjoyed the information being presented, but not the method of presentation, if that makes sense. Lemme elaborate. Stephen Brusatte is definitely a dino-nerd. And I say this with the utmost respect. You can tell that he's excited and passionate about learning about dinosaurs, how they came to exist, and how they came to no longer exist. His writing is well-informed, interesting, and he knows his stuff, and presents his facts and supporting arguments well, whether it's the cause of the extinction event that cause the dinosaurs to become ""extinct"", or the argument that modern day birds ARE dinosaurs and therefore not all dinosaurs are extinct after all. They've just evolved. But, a bit of that gets lost in the overwhelming amount of hard to follow scientific species names and tidbit detail, and there was a lot of it. Discovery of new fossils, the qualities and criteria for distinguishing it as a Bellusaurus vs a Barosaurus vs a Barapasaurus vs a Brachiosaurus... etc. I think, even had I read this in print, this amount of quick-fire detail wouldn't work well, but in audio, it was just overwhelming. I ended up listening to this book MUCH MUCH slower than I usually listen to audiobooks, just to try to follow along and track the myriad dinos and their traits. But then, we come to the Spotlight Sections. Where we spend a lot of time focusing on one dinosaur (or idea) and examining it in detail. Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course, was the dinosaur, because it's everyone's favorite. I did learn quite a bit about them, and it was good information and fascinating stuff, but I wish that there were more sections of detail rather than a few of them interspersed within the general overview jam packed with rapid-fire facts. Then we have the humans. I actually feel a little bit bad about the annoyance I felt about this, but I did feel it, so there it is. Whenever Brusatte would introduce a new human into the story, whether they found one dinosaur bone in their backyard or have found millions of them around the globe, we got as much of their life story as possible in their intro. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in their expertise and why I should trust them and their conclusions, but do I really need to know that they enjoy kayaking? Not really. Let's keep it relevant. Finally, there was the reader. Holy moly, dude, take a BREATH. I feel like this guy was on a deadline to spit this book out. I had SUCH a hard time finding places to pause, because he literally never did. Even between chapters, a pause that might usually go for 2-3 seconds was MAYBE a 1 second pause here. I was NEVER quick enough to pause at the end of a section or chapter without cutting it off mid-word as he started the next section. It was crazy. And this while listening to this at a SLOWER speed than I normally do. O_OBut those complaints aside, this really was a fascinating, informative, and entertaining look at dinosaurs and their history. And their modernity. I loved the science and methodology of the discovery and determination of fossils and how they went about piecing together the lives that these animals would have lived. It really was very well researched, and I love reading books by people who are truly passionate and excited about their work. It does show. I do just wish that it was maybe presented in a little bit more measured of a way so that the reader can really absorb the massive amount of information here. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in dinosaurs, or earth's or life's history at all. There are lessons here about so much more than just dinosaurs, but about time and change and impermanence, but also about resilience and tenacity. The section about the extinction event that wiped out most of the species of life on the planet was harrowing and nerve-wracking, and I'm experiencing it from millions and millions of years removed from the actual event. Such was Brusatte's skill at delving into the detail and bringing the story to life. I was heartbroken for these animals that have been dead for millennia. It was a stark reminder that nothing at all guarantees our time on this rock, but that maybe something new and interesting can be given an opportunity to spring up in our place. "
88,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,2,"This could have been good. Maybe. If the author had stuck to dinosaurs which he didn't when he basically had to mention every person he has ever met in paleontology or has touched paleontology in some way. The first few chapters were definitely full of name dropping, mostly of male paleontologists. Female paleontologists were mentioned only if they were married to another paleontologist or just had their work mentioned while the men got full page biographies and accolades (and the overuse of certain adjectives). I do have to point out one female paleontologist did get a bit more of an introduction but she gets mentioned and then ignored. I know science , in certain fields, can still be male dominated but this felt more like blatant sexism by the author. I mean, the men get full page biographies, their work is highlighted, their connections to others in the field are highlighted, they get treated with respect and admiration. The women are pointed out in relation to their husbands (if married) and might get a sentence about their work. Or just a sentence about their work if they're not married. If these women's work hadn't impacted his own, I don't think the author would have mentioned them at all.The writing and organization are all over the place. This was supposed to be a history of the dinosaurs but this was more a biography of the author's work. And a lot of the material just didn't feel like it was really new and I'm not big into dinosaurs but I knew a lot already. And I haven't read anything on dinosaurs since elementary school, I think. There were times when there should have been less detail and times when there should have been more detail. The few middle chapters did seem to improve (more dinosaurs, less author self-promotion) but it never really got good. I also felt the author didn't seem to know who he was writing for, who his audience was supposed to be. Things were all over the place. This has potential but never seemed to get off the ground. Not worth reading."
89,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"Steve Brusatte really likes dinosaurs and prospecting for fossils and analyzing dinosaur history. And he is able to communicate that love really well. I enjoyed this book a lot. Brusatte presents the current state of dinosaur knowledge (Note: Spielberg had a lot of it wrong.) and brings it to life. Not just the dinosaurs themselves, but the many dedicated researchers who have made all these discoveries. The writing is lucid and accessible to the non-scientist. Okay, occasionally all the Latin names for different species cause a little eye-glazing, but it's not necessary to remember them to absorb the sense of the text. The description of the day the asteroid hit is especially vivid. And the explanations of evolution as reflected in the dinosaurs were very clear and helpful. I think Brusatte must be an excellent teacher. "

There have been amazing breakthroughs in our knowledge regarding dinosaurs; and with the advent of grandsons, it was clearly time for me to ‘up my game’!Brusatte has written a highly readable account of those new advances. He is an enthusiastic fossil hunter that takes the reader around the world from Georgia O’Keefe’s Ghost Ranch “bursting with dinosaur bones”; to Hell Creek, Montana—a Triceratops graveyard; to China and its plethora of feather-covered fossils; and to Italy where a thin layer of iridium indicates that an asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago.I admit that I enjoy reading about how paleontologists have determined that dinosaurs had feathers; that they were colored, and likely proved to be advantageous in attracting mates. And those dinosaurs that later became birds may have first used wing action to attract more attention, and just stumbled upon how wing action could result in gliding and eventually flying. It just takes a few millennia to make it happen.The number of new discoveries regarding dinosaurs over the past twenty years is mind-boggling. I look forward to learning more in the next twenty.

Some great history of the science too, if a bit laddish at points in the insistent ""hey we drink beer we definitely aren't nerds"". I don't know whether at this point in human history it's comfortable or not to reflect that the earth has seen multiple animal kingdoms wiped out when soaring carbon dioxide turned the atmosphere into an oven. There's a kind of comfort in looking at it from a cosmic level, I guess? "
92,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,5,"This was a book I HAD to read--to catch up on the subject I obsessed so much about in elementary school-Dinosaurs! When I was a kid I read every book on dinosaurs that I could find in my local library and my parents bought me even more books--and I was thrilled no end to go to the nearby Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago! but that was in the 60s and I thought we knew everything there was to know about the big guys. They were slow, brainless giants doomed to extinction so that the way could be cleared for The Rise of Man. But, as paleontologist Steve Brusatte points out, at the end of the 60s and going into the 70s, a new paradigm took shape, in which dinosaurs have been viewed as active, even energetic, animals, some being social and intelligent. Rather than doomed to failure, they were among the most successful animals for over 150 million years. If it had not been for what Brusatte calls ""the worst day in the history of our planet,"" when the asteroid (or comet) hit 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs would still dominate the Earth. The good news is that the dinos did not completely die out. I see some flitting about my bird feeder even as I type this. The birds are now classified as dinosaurs, as theropods, related to T-rex and velociraptors. For me, the most interesting part of the book (as a bird-lover) is his discussing the origin and evolution of the birds (and feathers!). I'm so glad they escaped the Cretaceous (Fifth) Extinction Event, but it's an open question whether they can escape the current or Sixth Extinction Event... I enjoyed this narrative greatly because not only does Steve share his passion with the reader (he's one guy who sure does love his job!) but he relates his experiences taking part in expeditions around the globe. This does seem to be a golden age of discovery of dinosaurs--and I missed it! BUT at least I can read about it. Thanks, Steve Brusatte! And I look forward to hearing more from this amazing young man!"
93,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"Off to a good start. I prefer to read pop-science books written by scientists, and Brusatte is a young vertebrate paleontologist at the Univ. of Edinburgh. Like all of us, he caught the dino bug when he was a kid. Unlike most, he made a career of it, and it's been an interesting one. Dino books are generally written by seniors, so it's fun to see one of the ""young guns"" take up the pen (or computer). Brusatte is an adequate writer, which is fine, since he's got some great stories to tell. And it's a great time for the field -- he says that lately, there's a new dino species described, on average, every week!The good quality continues, and I enjoyed the book, although I got dino-overload at times. He's a decent writer, but the prose gets purple, as in the Great Asteroid that (probably) killed off the dinosaurs (except for the birds!). His science is up-to-date, and I recommend the book, especially for dinosaur fans. 3.8 stars.Here's a nice sample, that is (I think) pretty much a chapter in the book:https://www.scientificamerican.com/ar..."

All those dinosaur and animal names and descriptions without pictures to refer to can get a bit confusing, especially when you're not listening in your native language... Obviously, this was completely my own fault, so I'm not critising the book here. Just a heads-up for anyone who is thinking of getting the audio book.***I am doing the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge and this is where I need to start cheating a little bit. The cue ""Continental drift: Read a book set on every continent"" could mean you read ONE book that travels through all continents or SEVERAL books, one for each continent. Since I'm almost sure I won't be able to add six more books to my already ambitious summer TBR, I decided to give this one a go.

Much of what I learned as a child about the big lizards has since been refuted by new fossils, better analysis, and new research. Stephen Brusatte caught the dino bug when he was young and became a vertebrate paleontologist. His passion comes through loud and clear in this book, as he takes his readers from ancient history to the end of most dinosaurs on this planet, starting with the biggest mass extinction on this planet at the end of the Permian age; this die-off made way for some unusual reptiles with a different body plan than many of their peers that proved to be amazingly successful for these reptiles and their countless descendants for millennia afterwards through the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. Though I was already familiar with much that Brusatte covered, his writing style made the material approachable and easy to understand. There were not as many images as I would have liked; despite my familiarity with many of the creatures, it’s still hard to remember the little differences between similar individuals in a group, and more drawings would have been helpful.I particularly liked Brusatte's chapters on the Permian-Triassic transition, tyrannosaurs, birds, and the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous especially. I am a fan of theropods, and Brusatte is clearly a huge fan of the tyrannosaurids. He tended to wax a little melodramatic about these carnivorous dinosaurs, but then it's a little hard not to be in awe of such terrifying beings. (Especially the huge carnivorous members of this group.)This book was a good refresher on many points about dinosaurs, and the author's writing style and obvious enthusiasm for the subject made this an enjoyable read."

It's like wondering what might have happened if the archduke was never shot.The whole these-were-the-coolest-beings-that-ever-roamed-the-earth moniker has always made me a dino fan. The amazing variations of these huge oddballs have always been intriguing and this book does its best to piece everything together. Which is a very good thing, because there have been so many new discoveries and new theories since I was a child that I lost track of which was the coolest dino (welcome back, Brontosaurus).Steve Brusatte is one of the world's eminent paleontologists whose other books, especially Field Guide to Dinosaurs, have made me a fan of his writing and his obvious enthusiasm for his work. Here, he charts the very beginnings of the dinosaur, even before they evolved. He starts with the Permian Extinction, which eliminated 95% of life on earth. Somehow, some little things survived and that eventually led the way for the bigger things to arrive later on. Right off, his description of the Great Dying kept me glued to the pages as the volcanoes spewed forth lava mud and carbon dioxide. How anything managed to live through all of that is simply amazing.As the dinosaurs grew, the earth was also changing, with the continents moving toward their current locations and the environment becoming a bit nicer. Well, nicer like walking outside at noon during an Alabama summer. The dinosaurs became larger and larger and ruled the world until the day that nasty asteroid slammed into Earth. Then, Brusatte relates what it must have felt like to wake up that day as a dino, thinking you were just going about your business as usual. Nope. Any dinosaur too close to the impact was vaporised while the ones further away endured boiling hot hail, mammoth earthquakes, renewed lava flows, loss of sun, loss of trees, and ergo, loss of life. The dinosaurs didn't all die at once, he states, but probably over a few hundred or few thousand years. Given the fact that they had been around for millions of years, the dinosaur extinction was relatively quick.The book doesn't just end with the catastrophic impact but instead continues with the rise of the birds, our current dinosaurs. All very fascinating. While there are some b&w illustrations at the beginning of each chapter, the book is mostly text with various photos of fossils and the paleontologists who discovered the dino fossils. That's because this book is as much a tribute to the men and women who found those dragon bones as it is to the dinosaur. I deducted a star for the continuous focus on the author (we get it, Steve, you like dinosaurs and you go on lots of expeditions).

It puts perspective on “our” life and “our” Earth and how we really don’t know it all. All we have are the few pieces of evidence of a life completely different from our own. I really appreciate all the researchers and paleontologists who put their time and energy, (and sometimes their life) into helping us better understand these eras and species long gone. The end really made me sad. Seeing these beautiful creatures end so abruptly (and in the way that it did) is such a shame. However, few of these creatures did leave their footprint to give future species, like us, proof and imagination of an insanely different time here on Earth. Just imagine all the things we don’t know because we don’t have proof, haven’t found it yet, or might have wrong. It’s surreal to think about. That said, I do wish the author talked less about the people who studied the fossils and more about the dinosaurs. I also wish he threw in more pictures of what he was explaining so I could get a picture of what he was discussing. I found myself with my phone in one hand and the book in the other, constantly looking up pictures of the dinosaurs he mentioned, the eras, and anything he named and just assumed the reader knew. "

I got to go through the same thing when my kids went through the phase as well and I got all caught up with things like Walking With Dinosaurs and its ilk. Which is all a round-about way of saying that I thought of myself as being fairly well-informed about paleontology, at least from a pop-science perspective.This book did an excellent job of bringing that pop-science overview of the field much more up-to-date. For instance, I was aware that paleontology in China had been going off with some really exciting discoveries, but I had no idea how key that has been to the overall understanding of dinosaur lineage. There also appears to be some fairly exciting new thinking about the origin of dinosaurs and the early period of the Triassic that I was entirely unaware of.In short, this is a great book for establishing an up-to-date popular science-level overview of the dinosaur element of paleontology, all made that much more engaging by a series of personal anecdotes from the author and his own career and interaction with his peers."

The rise and fall of the dinosaurs is an incredible story, of a time when giant beasts and other fantastic creatures made the world their own. They walked on the very ground below us, their fossils now entombed in rock – the clues that tell this story. To me, it's one of the greatest narratives in the history of our planet.
The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is thoroughly enjoyable pop science: author (and celebrated young paleontologist) Steve Brusatte uses his own learning journey to outline the exciting advances occurring today in his field (he calls this the “golden age” of paleontology, noting that new species of dinosaurs are discovered/described at the astounding rate of about one per week), and not only did I learn new and fascinating information from the deep history of our remarkable planet, but I found Brusatte's enthusiasm to be contagious. Who doesn't love dinosaurs? Totally accessible (but fact-filled) and balanced with personal stories (which I acknowledge might strain the patience of those of a more academic bent), it all worked for me.Early on, Brusatte – who is a Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Edinburgh – refers to his “ebullient, wildly animated lecturing style”, and for the purposes of this review, I'd rather demonstrate this ebullience than attempt to list everything that Brusatte taught me. On the sauropods whose tracks he studied on the Scottish Isle of Skye:
There's really no better way to say it: the sauropods that made their marks in that ancient Scottish lagoon were awesome creatures. Awesome in the literal sense of the word – impressive, daunting, inspiring awe. If I was handed a blank sheet of paper and pen and told to create a mythical beast, my imagination could never match what evolution created in sauropods.
Brusatte devotes plenty of breathless space to the Tyrannosaurus rex – including debunking what Jurassic Park got wrong about the apex predators (turns out that their eyesight was perfectly sharp, but they couldn't have outrun a jeep) – and writes, “The seat of Rex's power was its head. It was a killing machine, torture chamber for its prey, and an evil mask all in one.” And after having repeatedly referred to T. Rex arms as “sad” and “pathetic”, Brusatte shares new research that has determined, based on strong shoulder extensors and elbow flexors, the Rex used these “short but strong arms to hold down struggling prey while the jaws did their bone-crunching thing. The arms were accessories to murder.” Murder! The writing gets amped up when T. Rex meets its favourite meal:Triceratops, like its archnemesis T. rex, is a dinosaur icon. In films and documentaries, it usually plays the gentle, sympathetic plant-eater, the perfect dramatic foil to the Tyrant King. Sherlock versus Moriarty, Batman versus the Joker, Trike versus Rex. But it's not all movie magic; no, these two dinosaurs truly would have been rivals 66 million years ago...The King needed immense amounts of flesh to fuel its metabolism; its three-horned comrade was fourteen tons of slow-moving prime steak. You can figure out what happened next.So, you either enjoy a professor writing like a teenaged dino-fanboy, or you don't. Interspersed with the timeline of dinosaur evolution, Brusatte outlines the history of fossil hunting from the “Bone Wars” (which saw 19th-century rivals Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh sending out teams of mercenaries to hunt for bones for their individual glory; in the pursuit of which they weren't above stealing, lying, and sabotaging each other's sites) to the academics of today. In addition to referring to individuals as the “hot shots” or “rock stars” or the “Rat Pack” of paleontology, Brusatte proves that paleontologists just might be a special breed unto themselves. Barnum Brown, the first celebrity paleontologist at the turn of the twentieth century, prospected for dino bones in high summer “decked out in his fur coat with his pickaxe slung over his shoulder”. Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás – an adventurer, WWI spy, and the first paleobiologist – was a “flamboyant dandy and a tragic genius, whose exploits hunting dinosaurs in Transylvania were brief respites from the insanity of the rest of his life. Dracula, in all seriousness, has nothing on the Dinosaur Baron.” And as for Brusatte's modern day colleagues:Thomas Carr – my absinthe-drinking, Goth-dressing friend who studies T. rex – was with us on the expedition and was part of this team. Clad in khaki (it was far too hot for his usual all-black getup) and sucking down Gatorade by the gallon (absinthe was more of an indoor pursuit), he attacked the mudstones with his rock hammer (which he nicknamed Warrior) and his pickaxe (Warlord), exposing a number of new Triceratops bones.And working on the other side of the world in China, Brusatte describes another rising star:
Jingmai (O'Connor) calls herself a paleontologista – fitting given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia. A native of Southern California – half Irish, half-Chinese by blood – Jingmai is a Roman Candle of energy – delivering caustic one-liners one moment, speaking in eloquent paragraphs about politics the next, and then it's on to music or art or her own unique brand of Buddhist philosophy. Oh yes, and she’s also the world’s number-one expert on those first birds that broke the bounds of Earth to fly above their dinosaur ancestors.
And speaking of the first birds: as uncomfortable as I find this book's cover art – depicting a wispily feathered T. rex confronting wispily feathered prey dinos – that's a mental-shift I'll need to force myself to make: Brusatte makes the incontrovertible case that all true dinosaurs (not crocs or other proto-reptiles) were in a direct line to modern day birds and shared many of the same body features (flow-through lungs, wishbones, and yes, feathers; there's a paleontologist working today who can even determine the colours of their plumage). But, if I can mentally shift the T. rex from the upright Barney-the-dinosaur stance depicted in my youth to the balanced-forward pose accepted today, I suppose I can eventually re-imagine it covered in feathers. After all of the enthusiasm Brusatte displays for the rise and evolutionary success of the dinosaurs, the final chapter on their sudden demise is urgently and tragically related:It was the worst day in the history of our planet. A few hours of unimaginable violence that undid more than 150 million years of evolution and set life on a new course. T. rex was there to see it.An impact from a meteorite (or possibly comet), hitting with the force of “a billion nuclear bombs' worth of energy”, caused the near total extinction of the earth's most successful and widespread species (excepting, of course, for those dinosaurs who survived to evolve into what we think of as birds). The good news is that this catastrophic event paved the wave for the rise of the mammals, and us; the bad news is that we're no more special than the dinosaurs, and catastrophes – including those of our own making – can strike at any time. If you like your pop science poppy, this is an entertaining and informative read."
102,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Dinosaurs aren't a hard sell. People are just into them. I'm one of those people. In this book, Brusatte notes that his generation (which I'm a part of ~ thirtysomethings) were indelibly drawn to dinosaurs because of Jurassic Park. Of course, the interest preceded that film (umm, what about 1988's Land Before Time?), but it did solidify it!I've had this book since it came out in 2018 and knew I'd be reading it for this round of Science September. It's a great primer, a deep dive into modern #paleontology and evolutionary biology, with all the new fossils and species identifications.You come for the dinosaurs, and Brusatte's engaging storytelling and infectious enthusiasm for the subject keep you reading. He has what I can only describe as a ""folksy"" writing style, describing nearly every person in the book as 'the greatest paleontogist' or 'the nicest person you'll ever meet' (it's endearing, but it makes you wonder if it's all exactly true... Are they all this nice?) My favorite sections of the book were about dinosaur anatomy and biomechanics - the descriptions of their lungs and breathing patterns, and how this resembles modern birds' lungs, their bones' hollow structure, and their locomotion and moving speeds. How does a creature that weighs TONS pump blood? New and more complete #fossils have shown us how they moved, breathed, circulated blood, digested food, and how they looked (feathers! Even Tyrannosaurus Rex had feathers - not the plumage, but more likely quills and downy fuzz feathers). It's completely fascinating.This was a great companion piece with Peter Brannen's The Ends of the World that I read last week. There is overlap in topic of mass extinction after the asteroid hit, but Brusatte's book goes into more depth in the paleontology (and some anecdotes about cold calling Walter Alvarez for travel advice!) and the #evolution that led to the bird-dinosaurs we know today."
103,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Overall, a really interesting book & well laid out, but I floundered with all the odd names. A lot of that is my own ignorance & I think I would have enjoyed this more if I knew the names better. It's obvious that Brusatte lives & breathes this stuff & loves it. The narrator was excellent & conveyed Brusatte's enthusiasm well, but I glazed over from the terminology occasionally.It was a great trip, though. I learned not just about the evolution of dinosaurs, but about the other critters of the times, ones I'd often confused with them. He describes their rise very well & dispels many of the older ideas that I learned in school. For instance, he made sense of their feathers far better than anything else I've read on the subject which is admittedly little. In doing so, he shows why we didn't realize they had them for so long.Reconstructing the story of the dinosaurs is tough due to the time involved. Their reign ended 66 million years ago, but it was only about 50 years ago that we nailed down why. Fossils aren't common & many of the best sites were plundered by ignorant, greedy men. He shows how this was both good & bad. The interest in them led to money for expeditions that are expensive, hard, & time consuming, but we have many fossils that aren't properly cataloged or investigated as he shows through several discoveries made by students, including himself. New methods & tools have brought some amazing clarity.Definitely recommended in any format."
104,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070393-natch,2,"I'm not sure that I've ever been more disappointed in a book. I went into it thinking that it would be a basic-level summary of the evolution of dinosaurs and the world events that shaped them. Instead, the majority of the book (or so it seemed) was about the author's (and others) meetings and, occasionally, trips to find dinosaur bones. What made the book particularly insufferable (as others have mentioned previously) was that the author has to be in his thirties, at most (I didn't look it up), and, frankly, he doesn't possess any real critical insight of himself or others. As a consequence, the book does not start as you would expect - here's what the world looked like pre-dinosaur and here's what inhabited; it starts as an autobiography with the occasional dinosaur story thrown in. For example, his first story centers on going to Poland (if I remember correctly), getting off the train, and meeting a rather unfriendly looking guy...but, turns out, that guy was really friendly! And they found footprints! And wrote an article about it!...Oh, and the proto-dinosaurs were less like salamanders in their movements and more directional and we figured out what they probably looked like...but instead of a good description, here's a little photo and that's all. But it continues in this vein. Okay, next, the author went to Portugal. There, he met a dude who was the best at finding the fossils in the places he explored since childhood. Isn't that great? Isn't that guy brilliant? Just like the other paleontologists the author knows? Well, no. I grew up on a beach known to have plenty of fossilized shark teeth. I'm pretty good at finding shark teeth. So is every other person who grew up there or has lived there for a while and looks (cue certain little, old ladies). A visitor who shows up once for two weeks is going to be terrible compared to all us natives. The other thing that really bugged me was how everyone the author has ever met in the world of paleontology is ""brilliant"" or some equivalent...and there are several pages which are just lists of people and their specialties. I'm not sure how many paleontologists there are in the world, but I would guess that a fair number were listed in this book as ""brilliant."" I just don't think that's the case, unless paleontology is only populated by MENSA members. It really seemed like this book was more the autobiography of a dude in his thirties who happens to study dinosaurs and who thought to throw in some statements about dinosaurs. Disappointingly, those statements aren't always well thought out or explained. For example, the author talks about Pangea pretty early on, describing it as a single landmass stretching from the artic to antartic and centered on the equator with a desert spanning the equator so hostile to dinosaur-life that it was, essentially, a dinosaur-less. Yet, in the same breath says that on either side of that desert were dinosaurs in the early Triassic period. What he never seems to tell us is how those dinosaurs bypassed the desert to become distributed on both sides or whether dinosaurs evolved twice (one on each side) or what might have happened. I had to go on Wikipedia to look it up. Seriously. A history book should not require readers to resort to Wikipedia to explain what happened. (Dinosaurs appear to have been able to migrate past the desert areas, fyi).I ended up giving this book two stars because it does actually talk about dinosaurs a fair bit, albeit in a kinda rushed manner. And, I guess, I felt the talk of dinosaurs was colored by my perceptions of the protagonist of the story, the author himself. I'm a bit concerned by how much beer he drinks. There was more than one description of events being described as the best (the best conference, etc.) which seem to have been wholly related to the availability of alcohol and, in the case of Argentina, beef. Further, I'm a bit concerned about the author's relationship to women. He seems to revel in ribald jokes, as, I think, other commentators have mentioned, and seems to have a bit of a negative view of them. That might be okay for the character in a novel, but it's something that should be addressed in the world of real people. Those things really did color my feelings on this book and definitely contributed to the loss of a star. The other two were lost because of how much space seemed to be devoted to personal antedotes and urgings to read his other works rather than the story of dinosaurs. "

This is a captivating narrative that engages the reader till the end of the book. Highly readable and well researched that interest readers focused in ancient history this planet, dinosaurs, and life in late cretaceous era (100 – 66 million Years). The book describes immediate events after planet was hit by 6.5-mile-long asteroid (Chicxulub meteorite), at the speed of 67,000 miles per hour, 65.5 million years ago. The fossils from this event are preserved all over the planet, which gives a grim picture. It simply demonstrates that life on earth is susceptible to the wrath of nature. This was the sixth extinction of life in 4.5 billion history of the planet, and it was colossal, cosmic and catastrophic. How did life witness this? The author describes in detail as what may have happened immediately before and after the greatest hit in the recent history of our planet. Although this has been discussed on several TV shows on Nat Geo, Discovery, PBS and Science channels by geophysicists, astronomers and paleontologists, it is interesting to read from the point of a paleontologist who studies dinosaurs with passion. In fact, it is common in recent days to read about the discovery of new species of dinosaurs, birds and mammals from this event. One of the goldmines for finding the lost species is Hell Creek, Montana where treasure trove of fossils is preserved. It is a mixing of fossil carcasses and a layer of glass tektites from meteorite hit with impact impressions deposited minutes to hours after the apocalypse.The Hell Creek Formation in the Upper Great Plains of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were laid down by ancient rivers and streams as they traveled from the Rocky Mountains in the west toward the east before emptying into a large interior seaway that bisected North America during the latest Cretaceous period. Due to rise in sea-level in the Late Cretaceous, North America was bisected by a seaway stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. The states of NM, AZ, CO, SD, ND and MT were buried under water in a shallow sea that ran from Mexico to NW Canada. At that time the states of CA, OR, WA and ID were on the West and the rest of United States were on the east. The Hell Creek rocks preserve the remains of dinosaurs after Chicxulub meteorite struck into the ocean in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The death and destruction of the most iconic dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus Rex, the three horned dinosaur, Triceratops, the duckbilled dinosaur, Edmontosaurus, and the tank-like armored dinosaur, Ankylosaurus. The fossils also include; crocodiles, lizards, snakes, turtles, frogs, salamanders, fishes, plants and mammals. At this time, the planet was largely one supercontinent called Pangea, but it had started to split into several fragments. Europe and Asia were still globed together, and they were linked to North America by a series of islands. But what made these animals to become big? They had to eat and digest vast quantities of food, they had to grow fast, must be able to breathe very efficiently, and shed excess body heat. This process was enabled by their unique body plan that included a highly efficient lung more related to a birdlike lung because many bones of the chest cavity had big openings. There were many air sacs that extended throughout their body that helped lungs to take in enough oxygen to stoke their metabolism.During the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous, tyrannosaurs flourished, ruling the river valleys, lakeshores, flood­ plains, forests, and deserts of North America and China. Colossal tyrannosaurs never seemed to gain a foothold in Europe or the southern continents, where other groups of large predators prospered, but in North America and China, species of tyrannosaurs were unrivaled. They had become the transcendent terrors that fire our imaginations. The species of Tyrannosaurus Rex was not a global but existed only in North West of United States. On that fateful morning 66 million years ago, when a pack of T. Rexes woke up on what would go down as the final day of the Cretaceous Period, all seemed normal in their Hell Creek kingdom, the same as it had for two millions of years. Forests of conifers and ginkgoes stretched to the horizon, interspersed with palms and magnolias. The distant churn of a river, rushing eastward to empty into the great seaway that lapped against western North America. For the last several weeks, the more perceptive of the T. Rexes may have noticed a glowing orb in the sky, far off in the distance and a hazy ball also had a fiery rim. The orb would appear and disappear for hours. As it appeared again, it was bigger, its shine illuminating much of the sky to the southeast in a cloudy psychedelic mist. Then a flash. No noise, only a split-second flare of yellow that lit up the whole sky, disorienting the animals for a moment. As they blinked their eyes back to focus, they noticed that the orb was now gone. Moments later, and then they were blindsided. Another flash, but this one far more vengeful. The rays lit the morning air in a fireworks display and burned into their retinas. In fact, no noise at all. By now, the birds and flying raptors had stopped chirping, and silence hung over Hell Creek. The calm lasted for only a few seconds. Next, the ground beneath their feet started to rumble and shake, and then flew like waves; pulses of energy were shooting through the rocks and soil, the ground rising and falling as if a giant snake were slithering underneath. Everything not rooted into the dirt was thrown upward; then it crashed down, and then up and down again, the Earth's surface was acting like a trampoline. Everything within a radius of about six hundred miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of modern-day Mexico was annihilated, and vaporized. For several years, the Earth turned cold and dark because of soot, sulfur, sulfuric acid and rock dust in the atmosphere that blocked out the sun. The darkness brought severe winter for years that only the hardiest of animals could survive. The rains were highly acidic that wiped out much of marine species. Here and there, species of lizards, crocodiles, turtles, birds and rat-size mammals made it but with lots of duress under the fury of nature. Hell-Creek was turned to Hell that reverberated in rest of the world."

108,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,5,"Phew! A pop history on Dinosaurs written by a Paleantologist is enough to trigger your curiosity and awaken the science geek in you. However, you do worry about a Ross Geller level book you will be stuck with for ages. Stephen Brusatte is more Douglas Adams than Ross Geller and he tells a story that is at once engaging and enlightening. Imagine a huge jigsaw puzzle that has to pieced together. The challenge is that the pieces are found years apart and you have dedicated science heroes who try to make the best image possible with the pieces they have. And the frustration that lasts for decades when you realise there are missing pieces. That has been the story of piecing together the history of one of the most fascinating creatures that inhabited the earth.What Brusatte has done is not just laying out the facts (and theories) but also a tribute to all the paleontologists who have played a part in building the current understanding. Starting from the Permian period fossils through the Triassic age till the Jurassic and Cretaceous - the author paints a picture that is hard to ignore of complex foodchains, rise of apex predators and the entire evolution journey on fast forward. The journey is mapped through the work of paleontologists, geologists and collectors whose stories, quirks and anecdotes too are part of this book. The history of Dinosaurs cannot be narrated without the history of the planet and hence we get a lot of information on movement of continent, rise of oceans and rise of life in general.There is a chapter dedicated to Tyranosorus Rex (Tyrant King) which almost worships the larger than life (most lives, at least) predators. The author does not miss an opportunity to compare notes and point errata to the Jurassic Park movie, which is the introduction to most of us who are googling images today. The linkage to birds apart, the single mass extinction theory that brought an end to cretareous is more like the dominant theory that most paleantologists subscribe to. He actually describes a meeting of paleantologists in 2012 to discuss the validity of the theory where everyone agreed. This is only what we know.. so far.. A good book that presents facts actually allows you to understand the origin of popular theories without judging them - like the science of Phrenology which took off in the same period classifying human beings from different continents as different species. Today we grow uncomfortable knowing that gave grounds to Eugenics and later persecution of races in terms of superiority. Scientists are impervious to the implications of truth. The book makes you ask a lot more questions and for that reason alone, I loved it. A joyride!"
109,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7039679-ellen,4,"Even though I love dinosaurs, I don't really read science books...ever. So, I was surprised I liked this book, let alone finished it. It was quite informative, especially for those, like me, who haven't been able to keep up with all of the findings in this subject for the last couple of decades. I think I liked this book because it was part memoir as well as science. The author has a sense of humor, and is only three years older than me, so his pop culture and generation comments were right on par. He does mention the film Jurassic Park several times, though usually to disprove some of their science. I only had one complaint: No color pictures! I was surprised how much this bugged me, but as the author described such beautiful landscapes of where he was digging, and then only provided a black and white photograph, the beauty was lost on me. I realize it's cheaper to publish without color photos, and paleontologists most likely don't make bank, but the author is the ""resident paleontologist for BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs"" so I think color photographs isn't too much to ask. The illustrations were lovely though, even if they portrayed the dinos with feathers...I guess I can't deny a lot of dinosaurs had feathers anymore since I've now read this. Dinosaurs just don't seem as cool with them.I will just mention that I have my own personal opinion on evolution. This book talks a lot about the evolution of dinosaurs. I am religious, which probably has a lot to do with it, but I never quite agreed fully with the author on this subject.Overall, I recommend it!2018 challenge: A book with an animal in the title"

They had endured hardships, evolved superpowers like fast metabolisms and enormous size, and vanquished their rivals so that they ruled an entire planet…Then, literally, in a split second, it ended.”Riveting crash course on dino history. Very well done. "
111,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike,1,"D’ya see that subtitle? “A New History of a Lost World”? It’s one of two things: 1) utter bullshit or 2) marketing spin (which amounts to the same thing as #1). There’s no new information in this book. However, it IS a new book, so... yeah. Bullshit marketing.There are some other reasons why I’m giving this a 1-star review. One of the biggest is Brusatte’s continued insistence on ascribing INTENT to evolution. What the actual fuck, dude? No, triceratops didn’t decide to grow horns. T. rex didn’t want to grow teeth. Mammals weren’t “craving” the opportunity to supplant the dinosaurs for 100 million years. If you’re going to imbue intelligent design to evolution then you are one bad week from assuming that an almighty god did it and that the Bible is literally correct.You are doing a disservice to everyone who reads this book, especially to every kid who does so, because you are saying chance doesn’t exist in natural selection and that every species decides what it wants to become. That’s woo-woo bullshit and utterly unscientific. Stop invoking intelligent design. Stop it.In my lifetime there have been a few things which have completely upended our understanding of dinosaurs. Bakker’s insistence that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. (The Dinosaur Heresies) Which now has a mountain of evidence supporting it. Alvarez’s discovery that an asteroid impact in the Yucatán killed off the dinosaurs. (T. Rex and the Crater of Doom) And most recently, Horner’s complete and utter decimation of the plethora of dinosaur species. (https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner...)Paleontologists at the time pushed back on all of these theories, but the first two are now widely accepted by pretty much everyone, because the ones who objected have died off. The latter has pissed off paleontologists because some of them have named these “new” species and Horner has effectively wiped away their claims to fame by asking a simple question: “Where are all the baby dinosaurs?” Brusatte doesn’t even address Horner’s theory, probably because he doesn’t agree with it. Except the evidence is compelling.Everyone knows Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law (“indistinguishable from magic”) but not as many are familiar with his First: “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.” Brusatte is in his early 30s, so he doesn’t have that excuse.There are other things in this book which are irksome but don’t rise to the level of anger, such as his constant descriptions of travel. I could not care less which trains he had to catch or the type of trucks he rode in. I guess that stuff was added for flavor, but it’s entirely beside the point 90% of the time. His descriptions of fellow fossil fiends is more on point because it shows the diversity of the (mostly male) dinosaur hunters, but there are quite a few women who play tertiary roles. That’s the one valuable aspect of this book. Minor, but it’s there.He does have a weird way of describing dinosaurs. Herbivores are “plant gobblers” while carnivores are “meat gobblers”. He did mix it up once by saying “plant munchers”, so yay for linguistic diversity. Hashtag sarcasm.You don’t need to read this book. Try those others I linked above. Watch that video."
112,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Was anything that I learned half a century ago accurate, or anything in the Jurassic Park movie? Seems not.... This is very much for dino fans, very readable, but not super-strict on phrasing for best presentation of the science, not enough pictures of models of dinos.So, yeah, the bad: writes of evolutionary development as if it were intentional. Speaks of T.Rex and Triceratops as 'rivals.'* Too many scientific names of species I've never heard of for me to able to keep track w/out those missing pictures. Some awkward stretches for humor.The good: Once I got the hang of reading it w/out fretting that I wasn't keeping track of every species named, I found it very engaging. And, yes, enlightening. And Brusatte does teach something about science. For example he does admit that new finds may overturn current assumptions, and he does explain *how* a lot of stuff that is understood came to be figured out:""We can tell that Rex had some of the largest and most powerful jaw muscles of any dinosaur, based on the very broad and deep gullies on the skull bones where the muscles attached.""One species mentioned early I am going to google image search: Effigia okeeffeae....... and ""human-sized ominvorous theropods called oviraptororsaurs.""... and *The Age of Reptiles* mural.... balaur bondoc""Proper grasslands would not develop until... many tens of millions of years after the dinosaurs cleared out."" (I have to pick the nit of the word choice 'cleared.' Did dinosaurs prevent grass from evolving to become grasslands? I doubt it....)""The Gobi fossils tell us that the ancestors of birds got smart before they took to the skies."" Also got feathers, wings, and efficient lungs 'flow-through' lungs before that, too. ""The feathers of nonflying, winged dinosaurs were a rainbow of different colors..."" discovered from Jakob Vinther's studies of melanosomes, and probably used for display.Walter Alvarez is Luis Alvarez' son.Anyway, you can see that the good outweighs the bad. And no, despite all my notes, you can't skip this book if you're interested in the subject... I only mentioned a few of the my favorite bits; there are many more that you'll find interesting, too.*""a person or thing competing with another for the same objective or for superiority in the same field of activity"" ... not competing against each other for life..."

It is titled so inaccurately as to give off an impression that it no way lives up to. ""The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs"" should have been called ""My journey into paleontology and hanging out with paleontologists and some history about dinosaurs"", or ""I was an annoying teenager obsessed with dinosaurs, and now I'm an annoying 30-something obsessed with dinosaurs with some nice degrees, here let me show you"". The absurd amount of times this guy hits you with first-person pronouns is outrageous. Let's just stick with the dinosaurs, you know, like the title suggested. Here's a snippet of where I grew most annoyed (talking about one of his expert female colleagues): ""...she can easily work from home, which is deep among the last remaining Beijing hutongs-traditional narrow-alleyed neighborhoods of single-story stone buildings pasted together. Good thing too, because she spends a lot of her non-science time hanging about in the hutongs, raving and occasionally DJ-ing in the trendy clubs of China's suddenly hip capital. Jingmai calls herself a paleontologista-fitting, given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia.""

114,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"I haven't thought much about dinosaurs since I was in elementary school, so this was an absorbing and engaging look at what we do -- and don't -- know about dinosaurs at this point. So much has happened in the decades since my youth, and getting caught up was more than worthwhile. There are over 50 dinosaur species discovered each year (!!) and more, science agrees that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs (!!!). I didn't realize that the Burpee, which is just down the road from me, has such a wide dinosaur history, despite the fact no significant fossils have been ever discovered in Illinois. I wish there'd been less about Brusatte through. The moments where it drifted into him nerding out about dinosaurs were weakened a bit when he name dropped. Certainly, those who've done work deserve credit, but doing so in context to how you know that person or have worked with them leans a bit too hard on the ""look at how I've rubbed elbows with famous people"" side. Barring that, readers who are curious about dinosaurs or haven't thought about them since elementary days will find this a worthwhile read.The audiobook worked well, too. "

I was very surprised at this shocking twist ending. I thought T-Rexs lived among us.Exhibit A:And yes, this is a brief history. This covers hundreds of millions (okay, billions but eh, semantics) and compresses a really varied and complex history into an overview so easy a caveman can read it.Aaaaaaaaand with that I'll retire all ancient puns for forever. Anywho, this was a fascinating glimpse into the quickly changing and fast-paced world of paleontology and geology, which were not the dead-end jobs that I grew up being told (""You'll never get a job studying dinosaurs"" they said, so I...never did—also I was never super duper fascinated by dinosaurs and the past because that kitchen scene scared the living shit out of me, so), but are vibrant and growing and uncovering more and more history-altering discoveries each month. It's fascinating and incredible what new discoveries, technology and modern analytics can do—and the brilliant minds that are dedicated to understanding the mysteries of the past.This entire book was amazing, particularly when understanding the billions of years of life that came before humans—and the chain of events that led to humans being able to become the apex predators instead of the vicious T-Rex, who was cut down at the height of its reign (and who had great eyesight and could not outrun a Jeep and could totally crush a car in half with its jaws, so thank you for giving me a false sense of security, Jurassic Park). Additionally, earlier periods of dinosaurs and non-dinosaurs were covered, particularly the evolution of crocodiles (who were scary AF) and also birds.Spoiler alert: birds are dinosaurs.Double spoiler alert: that meteorite did end the dinosaur's reign.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was clearly written, and while repetitive at times it clearly illustrated the vast biodiversity of Earth's history and how various climate changes and environments influence what flourishes were and how simple changes can have dramatic effects in various ecosystems.Definitely a must-read if you want to learn more about dinosaurs and the prehistoric Earth but don't know where to start.But, since dinosaurs are (mostly) extinct, all we can do is attempt to recreate the past:"
117,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I listened to this audiobook during one of my many long drives this last week, and I really enjoyed it, despite some annoying flaws. As y'all may be aware, I love me some nonfiction these days, and when it's well-written and accessible and brings the information being conveyed to the reader (or listener) in an entertaining way, so much the better. History, science, technology, sociology, whatever, I'm into it. This book ticked some of the boxes, but not as many as I'd have wanted. I enjoyed the information being presented, but not the method of presentation, if that makes sense. Lemme elaborate. Stephen Brusatte is definitely a dino-nerd. And I say this with the utmost respect. You can tell that he's excited and passionate about learning about dinosaurs, how they came to exist, and how they came to no longer exist. His writing is well-informed, interesting, and he knows his stuff, and presents his facts and supporting arguments well, whether it's the cause of the extinction event that cause the dinosaurs to become ""extinct"", or the argument that modern day birds ARE dinosaurs and therefore not all dinosaurs are extinct after all. They've just evolved. But, a bit of that gets lost in the overwhelming amount of hard to follow scientific species names and tidbit detail, and there was a lot of it. Discovery of new fossils, the qualities and criteria for distinguishing it as a Bellusaurus vs a Barosaurus vs a Barapasaurus vs a Brachiosaurus... etc. I think, even had I read this in print, this amount of quick-fire detail wouldn't work well, but in audio, it was just overwhelming. I ended up listening to this book MUCH MUCH slower than I usually listen to audiobooks, just to try to follow along and track the myriad dinos and their traits. But then, we come to the Spotlight Sections. Where we spend a lot of time focusing on one dinosaur (or idea) and examining it in detail. Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course, was the dinosaur, because it's everyone's favorite. I did learn quite a bit about them, and it was good information and fascinating stuff, but I wish that there were more sections of detail rather than a few of them interspersed within the general overview jam packed with rapid-fire facts. Then we have the humans. I actually feel a little bit bad about the annoyance I felt about this, but I did feel it, so there it is. Whenever Brusatte would introduce a new human into the story, whether they found one dinosaur bone in their backyard or have found millions of them around the globe, we got as much of their life story as possible in their intro. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in their expertise and why I should trust them and their conclusions, but do I really need to know that they enjoy kayaking? Not really. Let's keep it relevant. Finally, there was the reader. Holy moly, dude, take a BREATH. I feel like this guy was on a deadline to spit this book out. I had SUCH a hard time finding places to pause, because he literally never did. Even between chapters, a pause that might usually go for 2-3 seconds was MAYBE a 1 second pause here. I was NEVER quick enough to pause at the end of a section or chapter without cutting it off mid-word as he started the next section. It was crazy. And this while listening to this at a SLOWER speed than I normally do. O_OBut those complaints aside, this really was a fascinating, informative, and entertaining look at dinosaurs and their history. And their modernity. I loved the science and methodology of the discovery and determination of fossils and how they went about piecing together the lives that these animals would have lived. It really was very well researched, and I love reading books by people who are truly passionate and excited about their work. It does show. I do just wish that it was maybe presented in a little bit more measured of a way so that the reader can really absorb the massive amount of information here. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in dinosaurs, or earth's or life's history at all. There are lessons here about so much more than just dinosaurs, but about time and change and impermanence, but also about resilience and tenacity. The section about the extinction event that wiped out most of the species of life on the planet was harrowing and nerve-wracking, and I'm experiencing it from millions and millions of years removed from the actual event. Such was Brusatte's skill at delving into the detail and bringing the story to life. I was heartbroken for these animals that have been dead for millennia. It was a stark reminder that nothing at all guarantees our time on this rock, but that maybe something new and interesting can be given an opportunity to spring up in our place. "
118,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,2,"This could have been good. Maybe. If the author had stuck to dinosaurs which he didn't when he basically had to mention every person he has ever met in paleontology or has touched paleontology in some way. The first few chapters were definitely full of name dropping, mostly of male paleontologists. Female paleontologists were mentioned only if they were married to another paleontologist or just had their work mentioned while the men got full page biographies and accolades (and the overuse of certain adjectives). I do have to point out one female paleontologist did get a bit more of an introduction but she gets mentioned and then ignored. I know science , in certain fields, can still be male dominated but this felt more like blatant sexism by the author. I mean, the men get full page biographies, their work is highlighted, their connections to others in the field are highlighted, they get treated with respect and admiration. The women are pointed out in relation to their husbands (if married) and might get a sentence about their work. Or just a sentence about their work if they're not married. If these women's work hadn't impacted his own, I don't think the author would have mentioned them at all.The writing and organization are all over the place. This was supposed to be a history of the dinosaurs but this was more a biography of the author's work. And a lot of the material just didn't feel like it was really new and I'm not big into dinosaurs but I knew a lot already. And I haven't read anything on dinosaurs since elementary school, I think. There were times when there should have been less detail and times when there should have been more detail. The few middle chapters did seem to improve (more dinosaurs, less author self-promotion) but it never really got good. I also felt the author didn't seem to know who he was writing for, who his audience was supposed to be. Things were all over the place. This has potential but never seemed to get off the ground. Not worth reading."
119,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"Steve Brusatte really likes dinosaurs and prospecting for fossils and analyzing dinosaur history. And he is able to communicate that love really well. I enjoyed this book a lot. Brusatte presents the current state of dinosaur knowledge (Note: Spielberg had a lot of it wrong.) and brings it to life. Not just the dinosaurs themselves, but the many dedicated researchers who have made all these discoveries. The writing is lucid and accessible to the non-scientist. Okay, occasionally all the Latin names for different species cause a little eye-glazing, but it's not necessary to remember them to absorb the sense of the text. The description of the day the asteroid hit is especially vivid. And the explanations of evolution as reflected in the dinosaurs were very clear and helpful. I think Brusatte must be an excellent teacher. "

There have been amazing breakthroughs in our knowledge regarding dinosaurs; and with the advent of grandsons, it was clearly time for me to ‘up my game’!Brusatte has written a highly readable account of those new advances. He is an enthusiastic fossil hunter that takes the reader around the world from Georgia O’Keefe’s Ghost Ranch “bursting with dinosaur bones”; to Hell Creek, Montana—a Triceratops graveyard; to China and its plethora of feather-covered fossils; and to Italy where a thin layer of iridium indicates that an asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago.I admit that I enjoy reading about how paleontologists have determined that dinosaurs had feathers; that they were colored, and likely proved to be advantageous in attracting mates. And those dinosaurs that later became birds may have first used wing action to attract more attention, and just stumbled upon how wing action could result in gliding and eventually flying. It just takes a few millennia to make it happen.The number of new discoveries regarding dinosaurs over the past twenty years is mind-boggling. I look forward to learning more in the next twenty. Recommend."

Gives a really vivid picture of the Mesozoic world and its creatures as moving, eating, breeding things. Some great history of the science too, if a bit laddish at points in the insistent ""hey we drink beer we definitely aren't nerds"". I don't know whether at this point in human history it's comfortable or not to reflect that the earth has seen multiple animal kingdoms wiped out when soaring carbon dioxide turned the atmosphere into an oven. There's a kind of comfort in looking at it from a cosmic level, I guess? "
122,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,5,"This was a book I HAD to read--to catch up on the subject I obsessed so much about in elementary school-Dinosaurs! When I was a kid I read every book on dinosaurs that I could find in my local library and my parents bought me even more books--and I was thrilled no end to go to the nearby Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago! but that was in the 60s and I thought we knew everything there was to know about the big guys. They were slow, brainless giants doomed to extinction so that the way could be cleared for The Rise of Man. But, as paleontologist Steve Brusatte points out, at the end of the 60s and going into the 70s, a new paradigm took shape, in which dinosaurs have been viewed as active, even energetic, animals, some being social and intelligent. Rather than doomed to failure, they were among the most successful animals for over 150 million years. If it had not been for what Brusatte calls ""the worst day in the history of our planet,"" when the asteroid (or comet) hit 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs would still dominate the Earth. The good news is that the dinos did not completely die out. I see some flitting about my bird feeder even as I type this. The birds are now classified as dinosaurs, as theropods, related to T-rex and velociraptors. For me, the most interesting part of the book (as a bird-lover) is his discussing the origin and evolution of the birds (and feathers!). I'm so glad they escaped the Cretaceous (Fifth) Extinction Event, but it's an open question whether they can escape the current or Sixth Extinction Event... I enjoyed this narrative greatly because not only does Steve share his passion with the reader (he's one guy who sure does love his job!) but he relates his experiences taking part in expeditions around the globe. This does seem to be a golden age of discovery of dinosaurs--and I missed it! BUT at least I can read about it. Thanks, Steve Brusatte! And I look forward to hearing more from this amazing young man!"
123,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"Off to a good start. I prefer to read pop-science books written by scientists, and Brusatte is a young vertebrate paleontologist at the Univ. of Edinburgh. Like all of us, he caught the dino bug when he was a kid. Unlike most, he made a career of it, and it's been an interesting one. Dino books are generally written by seniors, so it's fun to see one of the ""young guns"" take up the pen (or computer). Brusatte is an adequate writer, which is fine, since he's got some great stories to tell. And it's a great time for the field -- he says that lately, there's a new dino species described, on average, every week!The good quality continues, and I enjoyed the book, although I got dino-overload at times. He's a decent writer, but the prose gets purple, as in the Great Asteroid that (probably) killed off the dinosaurs (except for the birds!). His science is up-to-date, and I recommend the book, especially for dinosaur fans. 3.8 stars.Here's a nice sample, that is (I think) pretty much a chapter in the book:https://www.scientificamerican.com/ar..."

All those dinosaur and animal names and descriptions without pictures to refer to can get a bit confusing, especially when you're not listening in your native language... Obviously, this was completely my own fault, so I'm not critising the book here. Just a heads-up for anyone who is thinking of getting the audio book.***I am doing the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge and this is where I need to start cheating a little bit. The cue ""Continental drift: Read a book set on every continent"" could mean you read ONE book that travels through all continents or SEVERAL books, one for each continent. Since I'm almost sure I won't be able to add six more books to my already ambitious summer TBR, I decided to give this one a go. I mean, the supercontinent Pangea did incorporate most 0f Earth's landmasses at one point. And dinosaurs are just cool."

Much of what I learned as a child about the big lizards has since been refuted by new fossils, better analysis, and new research. Stephen Brusatte caught the dino bug when he was young and became a vertebrate paleontologist. His passion comes through loud and clear in this book, as he takes his readers from ancient history to the end of most dinosaurs on this planet, starting with the biggest mass extinction on this planet at the end of the Permian age; this die-off made way for some unusual reptiles with a different body plan than many of their peers that proved to be amazingly successful for these reptiles and their countless descendants for millennia afterwards through the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. Though I was already familiar with much that Brusatte covered, his writing style made the material approachable and easy to understand. There were not as many images as I would have liked; despite my familiarity with many of the creatures, it’s still hard to remember the little differences between similar individuals in a group, and more drawings would have been helpful.I particularly liked Brusatte's chapters on the Permian-Triassic transition, tyrannosaurs, birds, and the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous especially. I am a fan of theropods, and Brusatte is clearly a huge fan of the tyrannosaurids. He tended to wax a little melodramatic about these carnivorous dinosaurs, but then it's a little hard not to be in awe of such terrifying beings. (Especially the huge carnivorous members of this group.)This book was a good refresher on many points about dinosaurs, and the author's writing style and obvious enthusiasm for the subject made this an enjoyable read."

It's like wondering what might have happened if the archduke was never shot.The whole these-were-the-coolest-beings-that-ever-roamed-the-earth moniker has always made me a dino fan. The amazing variations of these huge oddballs have always been intriguing and this book does its best to piece everything together. Which is a very good thing, because there have been so many new discoveries and new theories since I was a child that I lost track of which was the coolest dino (welcome back, Brontosaurus).Steve Brusatte is one of the world's eminent paleontologists whose other books, especially Field Guide to Dinosaurs, have made me a fan of his writing and his obvious enthusiasm for his work. Here, he charts the very beginnings of the dinosaur, even before they evolved. He starts with the Permian Extinction, which eliminated 95% of life on earth. Somehow, some little things survived and that eventually led the way for the bigger things to arrive later on. Right off, his description of the Great Dying kept me glued to the pages as the volcanoes spewed forth lava mud and carbon dioxide. How anything managed to live through all of that is simply amazing.As the dinosaurs grew, the earth was also changing, with the continents moving toward their current locations and the environment becoming a bit nicer. Well, nicer like walking outside at noon during an Alabama summer. The dinosaurs became larger and larger and ruled the world until the day that nasty asteroid slammed into Earth. Then, Brusatte relates what it must have felt like to wake up that day as a dino, thinking you were just going about your business as usual. Nope. Any dinosaur too close to the impact was vaporised while the ones further away endured boiling hot hail, mammoth earthquakes, renewed lava flows, loss of sun, loss of trees, and ergo, loss of life. The dinosaurs didn't all die at once, he states, but probably over a few hundred or few thousand years. Given the fact that they had been around for millions of years, the dinosaur extinction was relatively quick.The book doesn't just end with the catastrophic impact but instead continues with the rise of the birds, our current dinosaurs. All very fascinating. While there are some b&w illustrations at the beginning of each chapter, the book is mostly text with various photos of fossils and the paleontologists who discovered the dino fossils. That's because this book is as much a tribute to the men and women who found those dragon bones as it is to the dinosaur. I deducted a star for the continuous focus on the author (we get it, Steve, you like dinosaurs and you go on lots of expeditions). So pretty good book, but it forced me to check out another library book (The Great Dinosaur Discoveries) so I could see the actual illustrations of what these big brutes would have looked like.That darn asteroid.Book Season = Year Round (looking at the finches with suspicion)"

It puts perspective on “our” life and “our” Earth and how we really don’t know it all. All we have are the few pieces of evidence of a life completely different from our own. I really appreciate all the researchers and paleontologists who put their time and energy, (and sometimes their life) into helping us better understand these eras and species long gone. The end really made me sad. Seeing these beautiful creatures end so abruptly (and in the way that it did) is such a shame. However, few of these creatures did leave their footprint to give future species, like us, proof and imagination of an insanely different time here on Earth. Just imagine all the things we don’t know because we don’t have proof, haven’t found it yet, or might have wrong. It’s surreal to think about. That said, I do wish the author talked less about the people who studied the fossils and more about the dinosaurs. I also wish he threw in more pictures of what he was explaining so I could get a picture of what he was discussing. I found myself with my phone in one hand and the book in the other, constantly looking up pictures of the dinosaurs he mentioned, the eras, and anything he named and just assumed the reader knew. "

I got to go through the same thing when my kids went through the phase as well and I got all caught up with things like Walking With Dinosaurs and its ilk. Which is all a round-about way of saying that I thought of myself as being fairly well-informed about paleontology, at least from a pop-science perspective.This book did an excellent job of bringing that pop-science overview of the field much more up-to-date. For instance, I was aware that paleontology in China had been going off with some really exciting discoveries, but I had no idea how key that has been to the overall understanding of dinosaur lineage. There also appears to be some fairly exciting new thinking about the origin of dinosaurs and the early period of the Triassic that I was entirely unaware of.In short, this is a great book for establishing an up-to-date popular science-level overview of the dinosaur element of paleontology, all made that much more engaging by a series of personal anecdotes from the author and his own career and interaction with his peers."

The rise and fall of the dinosaurs is an incredible story, of a time when giant beasts and other fantastic creatures made the world their own. They walked on the very ground below us, their fossils now entombed in rock – the clues that tell this story. To me, it's one of the greatest narratives in the history of our planet.
The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is thoroughly enjoyable pop science: author (and celebrated young paleontologist) Steve Brusatte uses his own learning journey to outline the exciting advances occurring today in his field (he calls this the “golden age” of paleontology, noting that new species of dinosaurs are discovered/described at the astounding rate of about one per week), and not only did I learn new and fascinating information from the deep history of our remarkable planet, but I found Brusatte's enthusiasm to be contagious. Who doesn't love dinosaurs? Totally accessible (but fact-filled) and balanced with personal stories (which I acknowledge might strain the patience of those of a more academic bent), it all worked for me.Early on, Brusatte – who is a Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Edinburgh – refers to his “ebullient, wildly animated lecturing style”, and for the purposes of this review, I'd rather demonstrate this ebullience than attempt to list everything that Brusatte taught me. On the sauropods whose tracks he studied on the Scottish Isle of Skye:
There's really no better way to say it: the sauropods that made their marks in that ancient Scottish lagoon were awesome creatures. Awesome in the literal sense of the word – impressive, daunting, inspiring awe. If I was handed a blank sheet of paper and pen and told to create a mythical beast, my imagination could never match what evolution created in sauropods.
Brusatte devotes plenty of breathless space to the Tyrannosaurus rex – including debunking what Jurassic Park got wrong about the apex predators (turns out that their eyesight was perfectly sharp, but they couldn't have outrun a jeep) – and writes, “The seat of Rex's power was its head. It was a killing machine, torture chamber for its prey, and an evil mask all in one.” And after having repeatedly referred to T. Rex arms as “sad” and “pathetic”, Brusatte shares new research that has determined, based on strong shoulder extensors and elbow flexors, the Rex used these “short but strong arms to hold down struggling prey while the jaws did their bone-crunching thing. The arms were accessories to murder.” Murder! The writing gets amped up when T. Rex meets its favourite meal:Triceratops, like its archnemesis T. rex, is a dinosaur icon. In films and documentaries, it usually plays the gentle, sympathetic plant-eater, the perfect dramatic foil to the Tyrant King. Sherlock versus Moriarty, Batman versus the Joker, Trike versus Rex. But it's not all movie magic; no, these two dinosaurs truly would have been rivals 66 million years ago...The King needed immense amounts of flesh to fuel its metabolism; its three-horned comrade was fourteen tons of slow-moving prime steak. You can figure out what happened next.So, you either enjoy a professor writing like a teenaged dino-fanboy, or you don't. Interspersed with the timeline of dinosaur evolution, Brusatte outlines the history of fossil hunting from the “Bone Wars” (which saw 19th-century rivals Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh sending out teams of mercenaries to hunt for bones for their individual glory; in the pursuit of which they weren't above stealing, lying, and sabotaging each other's sites) to the academics of today. In addition to referring to individuals as the “hot shots” or “rock stars” or the “Rat Pack” of paleontology, Brusatte proves that paleontologists just might be a special breed unto themselves. Barnum Brown, the first celebrity paleontologist at the turn of the twentieth century, prospected for dino bones in high summer “decked out in his fur coat with his pickaxe slung over his shoulder”. Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás – an adventurer, WWI spy, and the first paleobiologist – was a “flamboyant dandy and a tragic genius, whose exploits hunting dinosaurs in Transylvania were brief respites from the insanity of the rest of his life. Dracula, in all seriousness, has nothing on the Dinosaur Baron.” And as for Brusatte's modern day colleagues:Thomas Carr – my absinthe-drinking, Goth-dressing friend who studies T. rex – was with us on the expedition and was part of this team. Clad in khaki (it was far too hot for his usual all-black getup) and sucking down Gatorade by the gallon (absinthe was more of an indoor pursuit), he attacked the mudstones with his rock hammer (which he nicknamed Warrior) and his pickaxe (Warlord), exposing a number of new Triceratops bones.And working on the other side of the world in China, Brusatte describes another rising star:
Jingmai (O'Connor) calls herself a paleontologista – fitting given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia. A native of Southern California – half Irish, half-Chinese by blood – Jingmai is a Roman Candle of energy – delivering caustic one-liners one moment, speaking in eloquent paragraphs about politics the next, and then it's on to music or art or her own unique brand of Buddhist philosophy. Oh yes, and she’s also the world’s number-one expert on those first birds that broke the bounds of Earth to fly above their dinosaur ancestors.
And speaking of the first birds: as uncomfortable as I find this book's cover art – depicting a wispily feathered T. rex confronting wispily feathered prey dinos – that's a mental-shift I'll need to force myself to make: Brusatte makes the incontrovertible case that all true dinosaurs (not crocs or other proto-reptiles) were in a direct line to modern day birds and shared many of the same body features (flow-through lungs, wishbones, and yes, feathers; there's a paleontologist working today who can even determine the colours of their plumage). But, if I can mentally shift the T. rex from the upright Barney-the-dinosaur stance depicted in my youth to the balanced-forward pose accepted today, I suppose I can eventually re-imagine it covered in feathers. After all of the enthusiasm Brusatte displays for the rise and evolutionary success of the dinosaurs, the final chapter on their sudden demise is urgently and tragically related:It was the worst day in the history of our planet. A few hours of unimaginable violence that undid more than 150 million years of evolution and set life on a new course. T. rex was there to see it.An impact from a meteorite (or possibly comet), hitting with the force of “a billion nuclear bombs' worth of energy”, caused the near total extinction of the earth's most successful and widespread species (excepting, of course, for those dinosaurs who survived to evolve into what we think of as birds). The good news is that this catastrophic event paved the wave for the rise of the mammals, and us; the bad news is that we're no more special than the dinosaurs, and catastrophes – including those of our own making – can strike at any time. If you like your pop science poppy, this is an entertaining and informative read."
132,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Dinosaurs aren't a hard sell. People are just into them. I'm one of those people. In this book, Brusatte notes that his generation (which I'm a part of ~ thirtysomethings) were indelibly drawn to dinosaurs because of Jurassic Park. Of course, the interest preceded that film (umm, what about 1988's Land Before Time?), but it did solidify it!I've had this book since it came out in 2018 and knew I'd be reading it for this round of Science September. It's a great primer, a deep dive into modern #paleontology and evolutionary biology, with all the new fossils and species identifications.You come for the dinosaurs, and Brusatte's engaging storytelling and infectious enthusiasm for the subject keep you reading. He has what I can only describe as a ""folksy"" writing style, describing nearly every person in the book as 'the greatest paleontogist' or 'the nicest person you'll ever meet' (it's endearing, but it makes you wonder if it's all exactly true... Are they all this nice?) My favorite sections of the book were about dinosaur anatomy and biomechanics - the descriptions of their lungs and breathing patterns, and how this resembles modern birds' lungs, their bones' hollow structure, and their locomotion and moving speeds. How does a creature that weighs TONS pump blood? New and more complete #fossils have shown us how they moved, breathed, circulated blood, digested food, and how they looked (feathers! Even Tyrannosaurus Rex had feathers - not the plumage, but more likely quills and downy fuzz feathers). It's completely fascinating.This was a great companion piece with Peter Brannen's The Ends of the World that I read last week. There is overlap in topic of mass extinction after the asteroid hit, but Brusatte's book goes into more depth in the paleontology (and some anecdotes about cold calling Walter Alvarez for travel advice!) and the #evolution that led to the bird-dinosaurs we know today."
133,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Overall, a really interesting book & well laid out, but I floundered with all the odd names. A lot of that is my own ignorance & I think I would have enjoyed this more if I knew the names better. It's obvious that Brusatte lives & breathes this stuff & loves it. The narrator was excellent & conveyed Brusatte's enthusiasm well, but I glazed over from the terminology occasionally.It was a great trip, though. I learned not just about the evolution of dinosaurs, but about the other critters of the times, ones I'd often confused with them. He describes their rise very well & dispels many of the older ideas that I learned in school. For instance, he made sense of their feathers far better than anything else I've read on the subject which is admittedly little. In doing so, he shows why we didn't realize they had them for so long.Reconstructing the story of the dinosaurs is tough due to the time involved. Their reign ended 66 million years ago, but it was only about 50 years ago that we nailed down why. Fossils aren't common & many of the best sites were plundered by ignorant, greedy men. He shows how this was both good & bad. The interest in them led to money for expeditions that are expensive, hard, & time consuming, but we have many fossils that aren't properly cataloged or investigated as he shows through several discoveries made by students, including himself. New methods & tools have brought some amazing clarity.Definitely recommended in any format."
134,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070393-natch,2,"I'm not sure that I've ever been more disappointed in a book. I went into it thinking that it would be a basic-level summary of the evolution of dinosaurs and the world events that shaped them. Instead, the majority of the book (or so it seemed) was about the author's (and others) meetings and, occasionally, trips to find dinosaur bones. What made the book particularly insufferable (as others have mentioned previously) was that the author has to be in his thirties, at most (I didn't look it up), and, frankly, he doesn't possess any real critical insight of himself or others. As a consequence, the book does not start as you would expect - here's what the world looked like pre-dinosaur and here's what inhabited; it starts as an autobiography with the occasional dinosaur story thrown in. For example, his first story centers on going to Poland (if I remember correctly), getting off the train, and meeting a rather unfriendly looking guy...but, turns out, that guy was really friendly! And they found footprints! And wrote an article about it!...Oh, and the proto-dinosaurs were less like salamanders in their movements and more directional and we figured out what they probably looked like...but instead of a good description, here's a little photo and that's all. But it continues in this vein. Okay, next, the author went to Portugal. There, he met a dude who was the best at finding the fossils in the places he explored since childhood. Isn't that great? Isn't that guy brilliant? Just like the other paleontologists the author knows? Well, no. I grew up on a beach known to have plenty of fossilized shark teeth. I'm pretty good at finding shark teeth. So is every other person who grew up there or has lived there for a while and looks (cue certain little, old ladies). A visitor who shows up once for two weeks is going to be terrible compared to all us natives. The other thing that really bugged me was how everyone the author has ever met in the world of paleontology is ""brilliant"" or some equivalent...and there are several pages which are just lists of people and their specialties. I'm not sure how many paleontologists there are in the world, but I would guess that a fair number were listed in this book as ""brilliant."" I just don't think that's the case, unless paleontology is only populated by MENSA members. It really seemed like this book was more the autobiography of a dude in his thirties who happens to study dinosaurs and who thought to throw in some statements about dinosaurs. Disappointingly, those statements aren't always well thought out or explained. For example, the author talks about Pangea pretty early on, describing it as a single landmass stretching from the artic to antartic and centered on the equator with a desert spanning the equator so hostile to dinosaur-life that it was, essentially, a dinosaur-less. Yet, in the same breath says that on either side of that desert were dinosaurs in the early Triassic period. What he never seems to tell us is how those dinosaurs bypassed the desert to become distributed on both sides or whether dinosaurs evolved twice (one on each side) or what might have happened. I had to go on Wikipedia to look it up. Seriously. A history book should not require readers to resort to Wikipedia to explain what happened. (Dinosaurs appear to have been able to migrate past the desert areas, fyi).I ended up giving this book two stars because it does actually talk about dinosaurs a fair bit, albeit in a kinda rushed manner. And, I guess, I felt the talk of dinosaurs was colored by my perceptions of the protagonist of the story, the author himself. I'm a bit concerned by how much beer he drinks. There was more than one description of events being described as the best (the best conference, etc.) which seem to have been wholly related to the availability of alcohol and, in the case of Argentina, beef. Further, I'm a bit concerned about the author's relationship to women. He seems to revel in ribald jokes, as, I think, other commentators have mentioned, and seems to have a bit of a negative view of them. That might be okay for the character in a novel, but it's something that should be addressed in the world of real people. Those things really did color my feelings on this book and definitely contributed to the loss of a star. The other two were lost because of how much space seemed to be devoted to personal antedotes and urgings to read his other works rather than the story of dinosaurs. "

136,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Highway to Hell Creek; the discovery of the remnants of Jurassic park In this dazzling rehash, author Steve Brusatte tells the mesmerizing story of dinosaurs; their origins, evolution, diversity, habitats and their cataclysmic extinction. This is a captivating narrative that engages the reader till the end of the book. Highly readable and well researched that interest readers focused in ancient history this planet, dinosaurs, and life in late cretaceous era (100 – 66 million Years). The book describes immediate events after planet was hit by 6.5-mile-long asteroid (Chicxulub meteorite), at the speed of 67,000 miles per hour, 65.5 million years ago. The fossils from this event are preserved all over the planet, which gives a grim picture. It simply demonstrates that life on earth is susceptible to the wrath of nature. This was the sixth extinction of life in 4.5 billion history of the planet, and it was colossal, cosmic and catastrophic. How did life witness this? The author describes in detail as what may have happened immediately before and after the greatest hit in the recent history of our planet. Although this has been discussed on several TV shows on Nat Geo, Discovery, PBS and Science channels by geophysicists, astronomers and paleontologists, it is interesting to read from the point of a paleontologist who studies dinosaurs with passion. In fact, it is common in recent days to read about the discovery of new species of dinosaurs, birds and mammals from this event. One of the goldmines for finding the lost species is Hell Creek, Montana where treasure trove of fossils is preserved. It is a mixing of fossil carcasses and a layer of glass tektites from meteorite hit with impact impressions deposited minutes to hours after the apocalypse.The Hell Creek Formation in the Upper Great Plains of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were laid down by ancient rivers and streams as they traveled from the Rocky Mountains in the west toward the east before emptying into a large interior seaway that bisected North America during the latest Cretaceous period. Due to rise in sea-level in the Late Cretaceous, North America was bisected by a seaway stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. The states of NM, AZ, CO, SD, ND and MT were buried under water in a shallow sea that ran from Mexico to NW Canada. At that time the states of CA, OR, WA and ID were on the West and the rest of United States were on the east. The Hell Creek rocks preserve the remains of dinosaurs after Chicxulub meteorite struck into the ocean in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The death and destruction of the most iconic dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus Rex, the three horned dinosaur, Triceratops, the duckbilled dinosaur, Edmontosaurus, and the tank-like armored dinosaur, Ankylosaurus. The fossils also include; crocodiles, lizards, snakes, turtles, frogs, salamanders, fishes, plants and mammals. At this time, the planet was largely one supercontinent called Pangea, but it had started to split into several fragments. Europe and Asia were still globed together, and they were linked to North America by a series of islands. But what made these animals to become big? They had to eat and digest vast quantities of food, they had to grow fast, must be able to breathe very efficiently, and shed excess body heat. This process was enabled by their unique body plan that included a highly efficient lung more related to a birdlike lung because many bones of the chest cavity had big openings. There were many air sacs that extended throughout their body that helped lungs to take in enough oxygen to stoke their metabolism.During the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous, tyrannosaurs flourished, ruling the river valleys, lakeshores, flood­ plains, forests, and deserts of North America and China. Colossal tyrannosaurs never seemed to gain a foothold in Europe or the southern continents, where other groups of large predators prospered, but in North America and China, species of tyrannosaurs were unrivaled. They had become the transcendent terrors that fire our imaginations. The species of Tyrannosaurus Rex was not a global but existed only in North West of United States. On that fateful morning 66 million years ago, when a pack of T. Rexes woke up on what would go down as the final day of the Cretaceous Period, all seemed normal in their Hell Creek kingdom, the same as it had for two millions of years. Forests of conifers and ginkgoes stretched to the horizon, interspersed with palms and magnolias. The distant churn of a river, rushing eastward to empty into the great seaway that lapped against western North America. For the last several weeks, the more perceptive of the T. Rexes may have noticed a glowing orb in the sky, far off in the distance and a hazy ball also had a fiery rim. The orb would appear and disappear for hours. As it appeared again, it was bigger, its shine illuminating much of the sky to the southeast in a cloudy psychedelic mist. Then a flash. No noise, only a split-second flare of yellow that lit up the whole sky, disorienting the animals for a moment. As they blinked their eyes back to focus, they noticed that the orb was now gone. Moments later, and then they were blindsided. Another flash, but this one far more vengeful. The rays lit the morning air in a fireworks display and burned into their retinas. In fact, no noise at all. By now, the birds and flying raptors had stopped chirping, and silence hung over Hell Creek. The calm lasted for only a few seconds. Next, the ground beneath their feet started to rumble and shake, and then flew like waves; pulses of energy were shooting through the rocks and soil, the ground rising and falling as if a giant snake were slithering underneath. Everything not rooted into the dirt was thrown upward; then it crashed down, and then up and down again, the Earth's surface was acting like a trampoline. Everything within a radius of about six hundred miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of modern-day Mexico was annihilated, and vaporized. For several years, the Earth turned cold and dark because of soot, sulfur, sulfuric acid and rock dust in the atmosphere that blocked out the sun. The darkness brought severe winter for years that only the hardiest of animals could survive. The rains were highly acidic that wiped out much of marine species. Here and there, species of lizards, crocodiles, turtles, birds and rat-size mammals made it but with lots of duress under the fury of nature. Hell-Creek was turned to Hell that reverberated in rest of the world."

Stephen Brusatte is more Douglas Adams than Ross Geller and he tells a story that is at once engaging and enlightening. Imagine a huge jigsaw puzzle that has to pieced together. The challenge is that the pieces are found years apart and you have dedicated science heroes who try to make the best image possible with the pieces they have. And the frustration that lasts for decades when you realise there are missing pieces. That has been the story of piecing together the history of one of the most fascinating creatures that inhabited the earth.What Brusatte has done is not just laying out the facts (and theories) but also a tribute to all the paleontologists who have played a part in building the current understanding. Starting from the Permian period fossils through the Triassic age till the Jurassic and Cretaceous - the author paints a picture that is hard to ignore of complex foodchains, rise of apex predators and the entire evolution journey on fast forward. The journey is mapped through the work of paleontologists, geologists and collectors whose stories, quirks and anecdotes too are part of this book. The history of Dinosaurs cannot be narrated without the history of the planet and hence we get a lot of information on movement of continent, rise of oceans and rise of life in general.There is a chapter dedicated to Tyranosorus Rex (Tyrant King) which almost worships the larger than life (most lives, at least) predators. The author does not miss an opportunity to compare notes and point errata to the Jurassic Park movie, which is the introduction to most of us who are googling images today. The linkage to birds apart, the single mass extinction theory that brought an end to cretareous is more like the dominant theory that most paleantologists subscribe to. He actually describes a meeting of paleantologists in 2012 to discuss the validity of the theory where everyone agreed. This is only what we know.. so far.. A good book that presents facts actually allows you to understand the origin of popular theories without judging them - like the science of Phrenology which took off in the same period classifying human beings from different continents as different species. Today we grow uncomfortable knowing that gave grounds to Eugenics and later persecution of races in terms of superiority. Scientists are impervious to the implications of truth. The book makes you ask a lot more questions and for that reason alone, I loved it. A joyride!"

It was quite informative, especially for those, like me, who haven't been able to keep up with all of the findings in this subject for the last couple of decades. I think I liked this book because it was part memoir as well as science. The author has a sense of humor, and is only three years older than me, so his pop culture and generation comments were right on par. He does mention the film Jurassic Park several times, though usually to disprove some of their science. I only had one complaint: No color pictures! I was surprised how much this bugged me, but as the author described such beautiful landscapes of where he was digging, and then only provided a black and white photograph, the beauty was lost on me. I realize it's cheaper to publish without color photos, and paleontologists most likely don't make bank, but the author is the ""resident paleontologist for BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs"" so I think color photographs isn't too much to ask. The illustrations were lovely though, even if they portrayed the dinos with feathers...I guess I can't deny a lot of dinosaurs had feathers anymore since I've now read this. Dinosaurs just don't seem as cool with them.I will just mention that I have my own personal opinion on evolution. This book talks a lot about the evolution of dinosaurs. I am religious, which probably has a lot to do with it, but I never quite agreed fully with the author on this subject.Overall, I recommend it!2018 challenge: A book with an animal in the title"

They had endured hardships, evolved superpowers like fast metabolisms and enormous size, and vanquished their rivals so that they ruled an entire planet…Then, literally, in a split second, it ended.”Riveting crash course on dino history. Very well done. "
141,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike,1,"D’ya see that subtitle? “A New History of a Lost World”? It’s one of two things: 1) utter bullshit or 2) marketing spin (which amounts to the same thing as #1). There’s no new information in this book. However, it IS a new book, so... yeah. Bullshit marketing.There are some other reasons why I’m giving this a 1-star review. One of the biggest is Brusatte’s continued insistence on ascribing INTENT to evolution. What the actual fuck, dude? No, triceratops didn’t decide to grow horns. T. rex didn’t want to grow teeth. Mammals weren’t “craving” the opportunity to supplant the dinosaurs for 100 million years. If you’re going to imbue intelligent design to evolution then you are one bad week from assuming that an almighty god did it and that the Bible is literally correct.You are doing a disservice to everyone who reads this book, especially to every kid who does so, because you are saying chance doesn’t exist in natural selection and that every species decides what it wants to become. That’s woo-woo bullshit and utterly unscientific. Stop invoking intelligent design. Stop it.In my lifetime there have been a few things which have completely upended our understanding of dinosaurs. Bakker’s insistence that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. (The Dinosaur Heresies) Which now has a mountain of evidence supporting it. Alvarez’s discovery that an asteroid impact in the Yucatán killed off the dinosaurs. (T. Rex and the Crater of Doom) And most recently, Horner’s complete and utter decimation of the plethora of dinosaur species. (https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner...)Paleontologists at the time pushed back on all of these theories, but the first two are now widely accepted by pretty much everyone, because the ones who objected have died off. The latter has pissed off paleontologists because some of them have named these “new” species and Horner has effectively wiped away their claims to fame by asking a simple question: “Where are all the baby dinosaurs?” Brusatte doesn’t even address Horner’s theory, probably because he doesn’t agree with it. Except the evidence is compelling.Everyone knows Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law (“indistinguishable from magic”) but not as many are familiar with his First: “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.” Brusatte is in his early 30s, so he doesn’t have that excuse.There are other things in this book which are irksome but don’t rise to the level of anger, such as his constant descriptions of travel. I could not care less which trains he had to catch or the type of trucks he rode in. I guess that stuff was added for flavor, but it’s entirely beside the point 90% of the time. His descriptions of fellow fossil fiends is more on point because it shows the diversity of the (mostly male) dinosaur hunters, but there are quite a few women who play tertiary roles. That’s the one valuable aspect of this book. Minor, but it’s there.He does have a weird way of describing dinosaurs. Herbivores are “plant gobblers” while carnivores are “meat gobblers”. He did mix it up once by saying “plant munchers”, so yay for linguistic diversity. Hashtag sarcasm.You don’t need to read this book. Try those others I linked above. Watch that video."
142,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Was anything that I learned half a century ago accurate, or anything in the Jurassic Park movie? Seems not.... This is very much for dino fans, very readable, but not super-strict on phrasing for best presentation of the science, not enough pictures of models of dinos.So, yeah, the bad: writes of evolutionary development as if it were intentional. Speaks of T.Rex and Triceratops as 'rivals.'* Too many scientific names of species I've never heard of for me to able to keep track w/out those missing pictures. Some awkward stretches for humor.The good: Once I got the hang of reading it w/out fretting that I wasn't keeping track of every species named, I found it very engaging. And, yes, enlightening. And Brusatte does teach something about science. For example he does admit that new finds may overturn current assumptions, and he does explain *how* a lot of stuff that is understood came to be figured out:""We can tell that Rex had some of the largest and most powerful jaw muscles of any dinosaur, based on the very broad and deep gullies on the skull bones where the muscles attached.""One species mentioned early I am going to google image search: Effigia okeeffeae....... and ""human-sized ominvorous theropods called oviraptororsaurs.""... and *The Age of Reptiles* mural.... balaur bondoc""Proper grasslands would not develop until... many tens of millions of years after the dinosaurs cleared out."" (I have to pick the nit of the word choice 'cleared.' Did dinosaurs prevent grass from evolving to become grasslands? I doubt it....)""The Gobi fossils tell us that the ancestors of birds got smart before they took to the skies."" Also got feathers, wings, and efficient lungs 'flow-through' lungs before that, too. ""The feathers of nonflying, winged dinosaurs were a rainbow of different colors..."" discovered from Jakob Vinther's studies of melanosomes, and probably used for display.Walter Alvarez is Luis Alvarez' son.Anyway, you can see that the good outweighs the bad. And no, despite all my notes, you can't skip this book if you're interested in the subject... I only mentioned a few of the my favorite bits; there are many more that you'll find interesting, too.*""a person or thing competing with another for the same objective or for superiority in the same field of activity"" ... not competing against each other for life..."

It is titled so inaccurately as to give off an impression that it no way lives up to. ""The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs"" should have been called ""My journey into paleontology and hanging out with paleontologists and some history about dinosaurs"", or ""I was an annoying teenager obsessed with dinosaurs, and now I'm an annoying 30-something obsessed with dinosaurs with some nice degrees, here let me show you"". The absurd amount of times this guy hits you with first-person pronouns is outrageous. Let's just stick with the dinosaurs, you know, like the title suggested. Here's a snippet of where I grew most annoyed (talking about one of his expert female colleagues): ""...she can easily work from home, which is deep among the last remaining Beijing hutongs-traditional narrow-alleyed neighborhoods of single-story stone buildings pasted together. Good thing too, because she spends a lot of her non-science time hanging about in the hutongs, raving and occasionally DJ-ing in the trendy clubs of China's suddenly hip capital. Jingmai calls herself a paleontologista-fitting, given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia.""

144,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"I haven't thought much about dinosaurs since I was in elementary school, so this was an absorbing and engaging look at what we do -- and don't -- know about dinosaurs at this point. So much has happened in the decades since my youth, and getting caught up was more than worthwhile. There are over 50 dinosaur species discovered each year (!!) and more, science agrees that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs (!!!). I didn't realize that the Burpee, which is just down the road from me, has such a wide dinosaur history, despite the fact no significant fossils have been ever discovered in Illinois. I wish there'd been less about Brusatte through. The moments where it drifted into him nerding out about dinosaurs were weakened a bit when he name dropped. Certainly, those who've done work deserve credit, but doing so in context to how you know that person or have worked with them leans a bit too hard on the ""look at how I've rubbed elbows with famous people"" side. Barring that, readers who are curious about dinosaurs or haven't thought about them since elementary days will find this a worthwhile read.The audiobook worked well, too. "

I was very surprised at this shocking twist ending. I thought T-Rexs lived among us.Exhibit A:And yes, this is a brief history. This covers hundreds of millions (okay, billions but eh, semantics) and compresses a really varied and complex history into an overview so easy a caveman can read it.Aaaaaaaaand with that I'll retire all ancient puns for forever. Anywho, this was a fascinating glimpse into the quickly changing and fast-paced world of paleontology and geology, which were not the dead-end jobs that I grew up being told (""You'll never get a job studying dinosaurs"" they said, so I...never did—also I was never super duper fascinated by dinosaurs and the past because that kitchen scene scared the living shit out of me, so), but are vibrant and growing and uncovering more and more history-altering discoveries each month. It's fascinating and incredible what new discoveries, technology and modern analytics can do—and the brilliant minds that are dedicated to understanding the mysteries of the past.This entire book was amazing, particularly when understanding the billions of years of life that came before humans—and the chain of events that led to humans being able to become the apex predators instead of the vicious T-Rex, who was cut down at the height of its reign (and who had great eyesight and could not outrun a Jeep and could totally crush a car in half with its jaws, so thank you for giving me a false sense of security, Jurassic Park). Additionally, earlier periods of dinosaurs and non-dinosaurs were covered, particularly the evolution of crocodiles (who were scary AF) and also birds.Spoiler alert: birds are dinosaurs.Double spoiler alert: that meteorite did end the dinosaur's reign.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was clearly written, and while repetitive at times it clearly illustrated the vast biodiversity of Earth's history and how various climate changes and environments influence what flourishes were and how simple changes can have dramatic effects in various ecosystems.Definitely a must-read if you want to learn more about dinosaurs and the prehistoric Earth but don't know where to start.But, since dinosaurs are (mostly) extinct, all we can do is attempt to recreate the past:"
147,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I listened to this audiobook during one of my many long drives this last week, and I really enjoyed it, despite some annoying flaws. As y'all may be aware, I love me some nonfiction these days, and when it's well-written and accessible and brings the information being conveyed to the reader (or listener) in an entertaining way, so much the better. History, science, technology, sociology, whatever, I'm into it. This book ticked some of the boxes, but not as many as I'd have wanted. I enjoyed the information being presented, but not the method of presentation, if that makes sense. Lemme elaborate. Stephen Brusatte is definitely a dino-nerd. And I say this with the utmost respect. You can tell that he's excited and passionate about learning about dinosaurs, how they came to exist, and how they came to no longer exist. His writing is well-informed, interesting, and he knows his stuff, and presents his facts and supporting arguments well, whether it's the cause of the extinction event that cause the dinosaurs to become ""extinct"", or the argument that modern day birds ARE dinosaurs and therefore not all dinosaurs are extinct after all. They've just evolved. But, a bit of that gets lost in the overwhelming amount of hard to follow scientific species names and tidbit detail, and there was a lot of it. Discovery of new fossils, the qualities and criteria for distinguishing it as a Bellusaurus vs a Barosaurus vs a Barapasaurus vs a Brachiosaurus... etc. I think, even had I read this in print, this amount of quick-fire detail wouldn't work well, but in audio, it was just overwhelming. I ended up listening to this book MUCH MUCH slower than I usually listen to audiobooks, just to try to follow along and track the myriad dinos and their traits. But then, we come to the Spotlight Sections. Where we spend a lot of time focusing on one dinosaur (or idea) and examining it in detail. Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course, was the dinosaur, because it's everyone's favorite. I did learn quite a bit about them, and it was good information and fascinating stuff, but I wish that there were more sections of detail rather than a few of them interspersed within the general overview jam packed with rapid-fire facts. Then we have the humans. I actually feel a little bit bad about the annoyance I felt about this, but I did feel it, so there it is. Whenever Brusatte would introduce a new human into the story, whether they found one dinosaur bone in their backyard or have found millions of them around the globe, we got as much of their life story as possible in their intro. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in their expertise and why I should trust them and their conclusions, but do I really need to know that they enjoy kayaking? Not really. Let's keep it relevant. Finally, there was the reader. Holy moly, dude, take a BREATH. I feel like this guy was on a deadline to spit this book out. I had SUCH a hard time finding places to pause, because he literally never did. Even between chapters, a pause that might usually go for 2-3 seconds was MAYBE a 1 second pause here. I was NEVER quick enough to pause at the end of a section or chapter without cutting it off mid-word as he started the next section. It was crazy. And this while listening to this at a SLOWER speed than I normally do. O_OBut those complaints aside, this really was a fascinating, informative, and entertaining look at dinosaurs and their history. And their modernity. I loved the science and methodology of the discovery and determination of fossils and how they went about piecing together the lives that these animals would have lived. It really was very well researched, and I love reading books by people who are truly passionate and excited about their work. It does show. I do just wish that it was maybe presented in a little bit more measured of a way so that the reader can really absorb the massive amount of information here. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in dinosaurs, or earth's or life's history at all. There are lessons here about so much more than just dinosaurs, but about time and change and impermanence, but also about resilience and tenacity. The section about the extinction event that wiped out most of the species of life on the planet was harrowing and nerve-wracking, and I'm experiencing it from millions and millions of years removed from the actual event. Such was Brusatte's skill at delving into the detail and bringing the story to life. I was heartbroken for these animals that have been dead for millennia. It was a stark reminder that nothing at all guarantees our time on this rock, but that maybe something new and interesting can be given an opportunity to spring up in our place. "
148,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,2,"This could have been good. Maybe. If the author had stuck to dinosaurs which he didn't when he basically had to mention every person he has ever met in paleontology or has touched paleontology in some way. The first few chapters were definitely full of name dropping, mostly of male paleontologists. Female paleontologists were mentioned only if they were married to another paleontologist or just had their work mentioned while the men got full page biographies and accolades (and the overuse of certain adjectives). I do have to point out one female paleontologist did get a bit more of an introduction but she gets mentioned and then ignored. I know science , in certain fields, can still be male dominated but this felt more like blatant sexism by the author. I mean, the men get full page biographies, their work is highlighted, their connections to others in the field are highlighted, they get treated with respect and admiration. The women are pointed out in relation to their husbands (if married) and might get a sentence about their work. Or just a sentence about their work if they're not married. If these women's work hadn't impacted his own, I don't think the author would have mentioned them at all.The writing and organization are all over the place. This was supposed to be a history of the dinosaurs but this was more a biography of the author's work. And a lot of the material just didn't feel like it was really new and I'm not big into dinosaurs but I knew a lot already. And I haven't read anything on dinosaurs since elementary school, I think. There were times when there should have been less detail and times when there should have been more detail. The few middle chapters did seem to improve (more dinosaurs, less author self-promotion) but it never really got good. I also felt the author didn't seem to know who he was writing for, who his audience was supposed to be. Things were all over the place. This has potential but never seemed to get off the ground. Not worth reading."
149,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"Steve Brusatte really likes dinosaurs and prospecting for fossils and analyzing dinosaur history. And he is able to communicate that love really well. I enjoyed this book a lot. Brusatte presents the current state of dinosaur knowledge (Note: Spielberg had a lot of it wrong.) and brings it to life. Not just the dinosaurs themselves, but the many dedicated researchers who have made all these discoveries. The writing is lucid and accessible to the non-scientist. Okay, occasionally all the Latin names for different species cause a little eye-glazing, but it's not necessary to remember them to absorb the sense of the text. The description of the day the asteroid hit is especially vivid. And the explanations of evolution as reflected in the dinosaurs were very clear and helpful. I think Brusatte must be an excellent teacher. "

There have been amazing breakthroughs in our knowledge regarding dinosaurs; and with the advent of grandsons, it was clearly time for me to ‘up my game’!Brusatte has written a highly readable account of those new advances. He is an enthusiastic fossil hunter that takes the reader around the world from Georgia O’Keefe’s Ghost Ranch “bursting with dinosaur bones”; to Hell Creek, Montana—a Triceratops graveyard; to China and its plethora of feather-covered fossils; and to Italy where a thin layer of iridium indicates that an asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago.I admit that I enjoy reading about how paleontologists have determined that dinosaurs had feathers; that they were colored, and likely proved to be advantageous in attracting mates. And those dinosaurs that later became birds may have first used wing action to attract more attention, and just stumbled upon how wing action could result in gliding and eventually flying. It just takes a few millennia to make it happen.The number of new discoveries regarding dinosaurs over the past twenty years is mind-boggling. I look forward to learning more in the next twenty.

I don't know whether at this point in human history it's comfortable or not to reflect that the earth has seen multiple animal kingdoms wiped out when soaring carbon dioxide turned the atmosphere into an oven. There's a kind of comfort in looking at it from a cosmic level, I guess? "
152,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,5,"This was a book I HAD to read--to catch up on the subject I obsessed so much about in elementary school-Dinosaurs! When I was a kid I read every book on dinosaurs that I could find in my local library and my parents bought me even more books--and I was thrilled no end to go to the nearby Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago! but that was in the 60s and I thought we knew everything there was to know about the big guys. They were slow, brainless giants doomed to extinction so that the way could be cleared for The Rise of Man. But, as paleontologist Steve Brusatte points out, at the end of the 60s and going into the 70s, a new paradigm took shape, in which dinosaurs have been viewed as active, even energetic, animals, some being social and intelligent. Rather than doomed to failure, they were among the most successful animals for over 150 million years. If it had not been for what Brusatte calls ""the worst day in the history of our planet,"" when the asteroid (or comet) hit 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs would still dominate the Earth. The good news is that the dinos did not completely die out. I see some flitting about my bird feeder even as I type this. The birds are now classified as dinosaurs, as theropods, related to T-rex and velociraptors. For me, the most interesting part of the book (as a bird-lover) is his discussing the origin and evolution of the birds (and feathers!). I'm so glad they escaped the Cretaceous (Fifth) Extinction Event, but it's an open question whether they can escape the current or Sixth Extinction Event... I enjoyed this narrative greatly because not only does Steve share his passion with the reader (he's one guy who sure does love his job!) but he relates his experiences taking part in expeditions around the globe. This does seem to be a golden age of discovery of dinosaurs--and I missed it! BUT at least I can read about it. Thanks, Steve Brusatte! And I look forward to hearing more from this amazing young man!"

I prefer to read pop-science books written by scientists, and Brusatte is a young vertebrate paleontologist at the Univ. of Edinburgh. Like all of us, he caught the dino bug when he was a kid. Unlike most, he made a career of it, and it's been an interesting one. Dino books are generally written by seniors, so it's fun to see one of the ""young guns"" take up the pen (or computer). Brusatte is an adequate writer, which is fine, since he's got some great stories to tell. And it's a great time for the field -- he says that lately, there's a new dino species described, on average, every week!The good quality continues, and I enjoyed the book, although I got dino-overload at times.

Just a heads-up for anyone who is thinking of getting the audio book.***I am doing the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge and this is where I need to start cheating a little bit.

Much of what I learned as a child about the big lizards has since been refuted by new fossils, better analysis, and new research. Stephen Brusatte caught the dino bug when he was young and became a vertebrate paleontologist. His passion comes through loud and clear in this book, as he takes his readers from ancient history to the end of most dinosaurs on this planet, starting with the biggest mass extinction on this planet at the end of the Permian age; this die-off made way for some unusual reptiles with a different body plan than many of their peers that proved to be amazingly successful for these reptiles and their countless descendants for millennia afterwards through the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. Though I was already familiar with much that Brusatte covered, his writing style made the material approachable and easy to understand. There were not as many images as I would have liked; despite my familiarity with many of the creatures, it’s still hard to remember the little differences between similar individuals in a group, and more drawings would have been helpful.I particularly liked Brusatte's chapters on the Permian-Triassic transition, tyrannosaurs, birds, and the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous especially. I am a fan of theropods, and Brusatte is clearly a huge fan of the tyrannosaurids. He tended to wax a little melodramatic about these carnivorous dinosaurs, but then it's a little hard not to be in awe of such terrifying beings. (Especially the huge carnivorous members of this group.)This book was a good refresher on many points about dinosaurs, and the author's writing style and obvious enthusiasm for the subject made this an enjoyable read."

It's like wondering what might have happened if the archduke was never shot.The whole these-were-the-coolest-beings-that-ever-roamed-the-earth moniker has always made me a dino fan. The amazing variations of these huge oddballs have always been intriguing and this book does its best to piece everything together. Which is a very good thing, because there have been so many new discoveries and new theories since I was a child that I lost track of which was the coolest dino (welcome back, Brontosaurus).Steve Brusatte is one of the world's eminent paleontologists whose other books, especially Field Guide to Dinosaurs, have made me a fan of his writing and his obvious enthusiasm for his work. Here, he charts the very beginnings of the dinosaur, even before they evolved. He starts with the Permian Extinction, which eliminated 95% of life on earth. Somehow, some little things survived and that eventually led the way for the bigger things to arrive later on. Right off, his description of the Great Dying kept me glued to the pages as the volcanoes spewed forth lava mud and carbon dioxide. How anything managed to live through all of that is simply amazing.As the dinosaurs grew, the earth was also changing, with the continents moving toward their current locations and the environment becoming a bit nicer. Well, nicer like walking outside at noon during an Alabama summer. The dinosaurs became larger and larger and ruled the world until the day that nasty asteroid slammed into Earth. Then, Brusatte relates what it must have felt like to wake up that day as a dino, thinking you were just going about your business as usual. Nope. Any dinosaur too close to the impact was vaporised while the ones further away endured boiling hot hail, mammoth earthquakes, renewed lava flows, loss of sun, loss of trees, and ergo, loss of life. The dinosaurs didn't all die at once, he states, but probably over a few hundred or few thousand years. Given the fact that they had been around for millions of years, the dinosaur extinction was relatively quick.The book doesn't just end with the catastrophic impact but instead continues with the rise of the birds, our current dinosaurs. All very fascinating. While there are some b&w illustrations at the beginning of each chapter, the book is mostly text with various photos of fossils and the paleontologists who discovered the dino fossils. That's because this book is as much a tribute to the men and women who found those dragon bones as it is to the dinosaur. I deducted a star for the continuous focus on the author (we get it, Steve, you like dinosaurs and you go on lots of expeditions). So pretty good book, but it forced me to check out another library book (The Great Dinosaur Discoveries) so I could see the actual illustrations of what these big brutes would have looked like.That darn asteroid.Book Season = Year Round (looking at the finches with suspicion)"
158,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73449257-renee-amberg,3,"Nothing lasts forever. This book does a fantastic job at showing how elaborately complex and diverse our planet truly is. It puts perspective on “our” life and “our” Earth and how we really don’t know it all. All we have are the few pieces of evidence of a life completely different from our own. I really appreciate all the researchers and paleontologists who put their time and energy, (and sometimes their life) into helping us better understand these eras and species long gone. The end really made me sad. Seeing these beautiful creatures end so abruptly (and in the way that it did) is such a shame. However, few of these creatures did leave their footprint to give future species, like us, proof and imagination of an insanely different time here on Earth. Just imagine all the things we don’t know because we don’t have proof, haven’t found it yet, or might have wrong. It’s surreal to think about. That said, I do wish the author talked less about the people who studied the fossils and more about the dinosaurs. I also wish he threw in more pictures of what he was explaining so I could get a picture of what he was discussing. I found myself with my phone in one hand and the book in the other, constantly looking up pictures of the dinosaurs he mentioned, the eras, and anything he named and just assumed the reader knew. "

I got to go through the same thing when my kids went through the phase as well and I got all caught up with things like Walking With Dinosaurs and its ilk. Which is all a round-about way of saying that I thought of myself as being fairly well-informed about paleontology, at least from a pop-science perspective.This book did an excellent job of bringing that pop-science overview of the field much more up-to-date. For instance, I was aware that paleontology in China had been going off with some really exciting discoveries, but I had no idea how key that has been to the overall understanding of dinosaur lineage. There also appears to be some fairly exciting new thinking about the origin of dinosaurs and the early period of the Triassic that I was entirely unaware of.In short, this is a great book for establishing an up-to-date popular science-level overview of the dinosaur element of paleontology, all made that much more engaging by a series of personal anecdotes from the author and his own career and interaction with his peers."

The rise and fall of the dinosaurs is an incredible story, of a time when giant beasts and other fantastic creatures made the world their own. They walked on the very ground below us, their fossils now entombed in rock – the clues that tell this story. To me, it's one of the greatest narratives in the history of our planet.
The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is thoroughly enjoyable pop science: author (and celebrated young paleontologist) Steve Brusatte uses his own learning journey to outline the exciting advances occurring today in his field (he calls this the “golden age” of paleontology, noting that new species of dinosaurs are discovered/described at the astounding rate of about one per week), and not only did I learn new and fascinating information from the deep history of our remarkable planet, but I found Brusatte's enthusiasm to be contagious. Who doesn't love dinosaurs? Totally accessible (but fact-filled) and balanced with personal stories (which I acknowledge might strain the patience of those of a more academic bent), it all worked for me.Early on, Brusatte – who is a Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Edinburgh – refers to his “ebullient, wildly animated lecturing style”, and for the purposes of this review, I'd rather demonstrate this ebullience than attempt to list everything that Brusatte taught me. On the sauropods whose tracks he studied on the Scottish Isle of Skye:
There's really no better way to say it: the sauropods that made their marks in that ancient Scottish lagoon were awesome creatures. Awesome in the literal sense of the word – impressive, daunting, inspiring awe. If I was handed a blank sheet of paper and pen and told to create a mythical beast, my imagination could never match what evolution created in sauropods.
Brusatte devotes plenty of breathless space to the Tyrannosaurus rex – including debunking what Jurassic Park got wrong about the apex predators (turns out that their eyesight was perfectly sharp, but they couldn't have outrun a jeep) – and writes, “The seat of Rex's power was its head. It was a killing machine, torture chamber for its prey, and an evil mask all in one.” And after having repeatedly referred to T. Rex arms as “sad” and “pathetic”, Brusatte shares new research that has determined, based on strong shoulder extensors and elbow flexors, the Rex used these “short but strong arms to hold down struggling prey while the jaws did their bone-crunching thing. The arms were accessories to murder.” Murder! The writing gets amped up when T. Rex meets its favourite meal:Triceratops, like its archnemesis T. rex, is a dinosaur icon. In films and documentaries, it usually plays the gentle, sympathetic plant-eater, the perfect dramatic foil to the Tyrant King. Sherlock versus Moriarty, Batman versus the Joker, Trike versus Rex. But it's not all movie magic; no, these two dinosaurs truly would have been rivals 66 million years ago...The King needed immense amounts of flesh to fuel its metabolism; its three-horned comrade was fourteen tons of slow-moving prime steak. You can figure out what happened next.So, you either enjoy a professor writing like a teenaged dino-fanboy, or you don't. Interspersed with the timeline of dinosaur evolution, Brusatte outlines the history of fossil hunting from the “Bone Wars” (which saw 19th-century rivals Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh sending out teams of mercenaries to hunt for bones for their individual glory; in the pursuit of which they weren't above stealing, lying, and sabotaging each other's sites) to the academics of today. In addition to referring to individuals as the “hot shots” or “rock stars” or the “Rat Pack” of paleontology, Brusatte proves that paleontologists just might be a special breed unto themselves. Barnum Brown, the first celebrity paleontologist at the turn of the twentieth century, prospected for dino bones in high summer “decked out in his fur coat with his pickaxe slung over his shoulder”. Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás – an adventurer, WWI spy, and the first paleobiologist – was a “flamboyant dandy and a tragic genius, whose exploits hunting dinosaurs in Transylvania were brief respites from the insanity of the rest of his life. Dracula, in all seriousness, has nothing on the Dinosaur Baron.” And as for Brusatte's modern day colleagues:Thomas Carr – my absinthe-drinking, Goth-dressing friend who studies T. rex – was with us on the expedition and was part of this team. Clad in khaki (it was far too hot for his usual all-black getup) and sucking down Gatorade by the gallon (absinthe was more of an indoor pursuit), he attacked the mudstones with his rock hammer (which he nicknamed Warrior) and his pickaxe (Warlord), exposing a number of new Triceratops bones.And working on the other side of the world in China, Brusatte describes another rising star:
Jingmai (O'Connor) calls herself a paleontologista – fitting given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia. A native of Southern California – half Irish, half-Chinese by blood – Jingmai is a Roman Candle of energy – delivering caustic one-liners one moment, speaking in eloquent paragraphs about politics the next, and then it's on to music or art or her own unique brand of Buddhist philosophy. Oh yes, and she’s also the world’s number-one expert on those first birds that broke the bounds of Earth to fly above their dinosaur ancestors.
And speaking of the first birds: as uncomfortable as I find this book's cover art – depicting a wispily feathered T. rex confronting wispily feathered prey dinos – that's a mental-shift I'll need to force myself to make: Brusatte makes the incontrovertible case that all true dinosaurs (not crocs or other proto-reptiles) were in a direct line to modern day birds and shared many of the same body features (flow-through lungs, wishbones, and yes, feathers; there's a paleontologist working today who can even determine the colours of their plumage). But, if I can mentally shift the T. rex from the upright Barney-the-dinosaur stance depicted in my youth to the balanced-forward pose accepted today, I suppose I can eventually re-imagine it covered in feathers. After all of the enthusiasm Brusatte displays for the rise and evolutionary success of the dinosaurs, the final chapter on their sudden demise is urgently and tragically related:It was the worst day in the history of our planet. A few hours of unimaginable violence that undid more than 150 million years of evolution and set life on a new course. T. rex was there to see it.An impact from a meteorite (or possibly comet), hitting with the force of “a billion nuclear bombs' worth of energy”, caused the near total extinction of the earth's most successful and widespread species (excepting, of course, for those dinosaurs who survived to evolve into what we think of as birds). The good news is that this catastrophic event paved the wave for the rise of the mammals, and us; the bad news is that we're no more special than the dinosaurs, and catastrophes – including those of our own making – can strike at any time. If you like your pop science poppy, this is an entertaining and informative read."
162,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Dinosaurs aren't a hard sell. People are just into them. I'm one of those people. In this book, Brusatte notes that his generation (which I'm a part of ~ thirtysomethings) were indelibly drawn to dinosaurs because of Jurassic Park. Of course, the interest preceded that film (umm, what about 1988's Land Before Time?), but it did solidify it!I've had this book since it came out in 2018 and knew I'd be reading it for this round of Science September. It's a great primer, a deep dive into modern #paleontology and evolutionary biology, with all the new fossils and species identifications.You come for the dinosaurs, and Brusatte's engaging storytelling and infectious enthusiasm for the subject keep you reading. He has what I can only describe as a ""folksy"" writing style, describing nearly every person in the book as 'the greatest paleontogist' or 'the nicest person you'll ever meet' (it's endearing, but it makes you wonder if it's all exactly true... Are they all this nice?) My favorite sections of the book were about dinosaur anatomy and biomechanics - the descriptions of their lungs and breathing patterns, and how this resembles modern birds' lungs, their bones' hollow structure, and their locomotion and moving speeds. How does a creature that weighs TONS pump blood? New and more complete #fossils have shown us how they moved, breathed, circulated blood, digested food, and how they looked (feathers! Even Tyrannosaurus Rex had feathers - not the plumage, but more likely quills and downy fuzz feathers). It's completely fascinating.This was a great companion piece with Peter Brannen's The Ends of the World that I read last week. There is overlap in topic of mass extinction after the asteroid hit, but Brusatte's book goes into more depth in the paleontology (and some anecdotes about cold calling Walter Alvarez for travel advice!) and the #evolution that led to the bird-dinosaurs we know today."
163,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Overall, a really interesting book & well laid out, but I floundered with all the odd names. A lot of that is my own ignorance & I think I would have enjoyed this more if I knew the names better. It's obvious that Brusatte lives & breathes this stuff & loves it. The narrator was excellent & conveyed Brusatte's enthusiasm well, but I glazed over from the terminology occasionally.It was a great trip, though. I learned not just about the evolution of dinosaurs, but about the other critters of the times, ones I'd often confused with them. He describes their rise very well & dispels many of the older ideas that I learned in school. For instance, he made sense of their feathers far better than anything else I've read on the subject which is admittedly little. In doing so, he shows why we didn't realize they had them for so long.Reconstructing the story of the dinosaurs is tough due to the time involved. Their reign ended 66 million years ago, but it was only about 50 years ago that we nailed down why. Fossils aren't common & many of the best sites were plundered by ignorant, greedy men. He shows how this was both good & bad. The interest in them led to money for expeditions that are expensive, hard, & time consuming, but we have many fossils that aren't properly cataloged or investigated as he shows through several discoveries made by students, including himself. New methods & tools have brought some amazing clarity.Definitely recommended in any format."
164,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070393-natch,2,"I'm not sure that I've ever been more disappointed in a book. I went into it thinking that it would be a basic-level summary of the evolution of dinosaurs and the world events that shaped them. Instead, the majority of the book (or so it seemed) was about the author's (and others) meetings and, occasionally, trips to find dinosaur bones. What made the book particularly insufferable (as others have mentioned previously) was that the author has to be in his thirties, at most (I didn't look it up), and, frankly, he doesn't possess any real critical insight of himself or others. As a consequence, the book does not start as you would expect - here's what the world looked like pre-dinosaur and here's what inhabited; it starts as an autobiography with the occasional dinosaur story thrown in. For example, his first story centers on going to Poland (if I remember correctly), getting off the train, and meeting a rather unfriendly looking guy...but, turns out, that guy was really friendly! And they found footprints! And wrote an article about it!...Oh, and the proto-dinosaurs were less like salamanders in their movements and more directional and we figured out what they probably looked like...but instead of a good description, here's a little photo and that's all. But it continues in this vein. Okay, next, the author went to Portugal. There, he met a dude who was the best at finding the fossils in the places he explored since childhood. Isn't that great? Isn't that guy brilliant? Just like the other paleontologists the author knows? Well, no. I grew up on a beach known to have plenty of fossilized shark teeth. I'm pretty good at finding shark teeth. So is every other person who grew up there or has lived there for a while and looks (cue certain little, old ladies). A visitor who shows up once for two weeks is going to be terrible compared to all us natives. The other thing that really bugged me was how everyone the author has ever met in the world of paleontology is ""brilliant"" or some equivalent...and there are several pages which are just lists of people and their specialties. I'm not sure how many paleontologists there are in the world, but I would guess that a fair number were listed in this book as ""brilliant."" I just don't think that's the case, unless paleontology is only populated by MENSA members. It really seemed like this book was more the autobiography of a dude in his thirties who happens to study dinosaurs and who thought to throw in some statements about dinosaurs. Disappointingly, those statements aren't always well thought out or explained. For example, the author talks about Pangea pretty early on, describing it as a single landmass stretching from the artic to antartic and centered on the equator with a desert spanning the equator so hostile to dinosaur-life that it was, essentially, a dinosaur-less. Yet, in the same breath says that on either side of that desert were dinosaurs in the early Triassic period. What he never seems to tell us is how those dinosaurs bypassed the desert to become distributed on both sides or whether dinosaurs evolved twice (one on each side) or what might have happened. I had to go on Wikipedia to look it up. Seriously. A history book should not require readers to resort to Wikipedia to explain what happened. (Dinosaurs appear to have been able to migrate past the desert areas, fyi).I ended up giving this book two stars because it does actually talk about dinosaurs a fair bit, albeit in a kinda rushed manner. And, I guess, I felt the talk of dinosaurs was colored by my perceptions of the protagonist of the story, the author himself. I'm a bit concerned by how much beer he drinks. There was more than one description of events being described as the best (the best conference, etc.) which seem to have been wholly related to the availability of alcohol and, in the case of Argentina, beef. Further, I'm a bit concerned about the author's relationship to women. He seems to revel in ribald jokes, as, I think, other commentators have mentioned, and seems to have a bit of a negative view of them. That might be okay for the character in a novel, but it's something that should be addressed in the world of real people. Those things really did color my feelings on this book and definitely contributed to the loss of a star. The other two were lost because of how much space seemed to be devoted to personal antedotes and urgings to read his other works rather than the story of dinosaurs. "

166,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Highway to Hell Creek; the discovery of the remnants of Jurassic park In this dazzling rehash, author Steve Brusatte tells the mesmerizing story of dinosaurs; their origins, evolution, diversity, habitats and their cataclysmic extinction. This is a captivating narrative that engages the reader till the end of the book. Highly readable and well researched that interest readers focused in ancient history this planet, dinosaurs, and life in late cretaceous era (100 – 66 million Years). The book describes immediate events after planet was hit by 6.5-mile-long asteroid (Chicxulub meteorite), at the speed of 67,000 miles per hour, 65.5 million years ago. The fossils from this event are preserved all over the planet, which gives a grim picture. It simply demonstrates that life on earth is susceptible to the wrath of nature. This was the sixth extinction of life in 4.5 billion history of the planet, and it was colossal, cosmic and catastrophic. How did life witness this? The author describes in detail as what may have happened immediately before and after the greatest hit in the recent history of our planet. Although this has been discussed on several TV shows on Nat Geo, Discovery, PBS and Science channels by geophysicists, astronomers and paleontologists, it is interesting to read from the point of a paleontologist who studies dinosaurs with passion. In fact, it is common in recent days to read about the discovery of new species of dinosaurs, birds and mammals from this event. One of the goldmines for finding the lost species is Hell Creek, Montana where treasure trove of fossils is preserved. It is a mixing of fossil carcasses and a layer of glass tektites from meteorite hit with impact impressions deposited minutes to hours after the apocalypse.The Hell Creek Formation in the Upper Great Plains of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were laid down by ancient rivers and streams as they traveled from the Rocky Mountains in the west toward the east before emptying into a large interior seaway that bisected North America during the latest Cretaceous period. Due to rise in sea-level in the Late Cretaceous, North America was bisected by a seaway stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. The states of NM, AZ, CO, SD, ND and MT were buried under water in a shallow sea that ran from Mexico to NW Canada. At that time the states of CA, OR, WA and ID were on the West and the rest of United States were on the east. The Hell Creek rocks preserve the remains of dinosaurs after Chicxulub meteorite struck into the ocean in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The death and destruction of the most iconic dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus Rex, the three horned dinosaur, Triceratops, the duckbilled dinosaur, Edmontosaurus, and the tank-like armored dinosaur, Ankylosaurus. The fossils also include; crocodiles, lizards, snakes, turtles, frogs, salamanders, fishes, plants and mammals. At this time, the planet was largely one supercontinent called Pangea, but it had started to split into several fragments. Europe and Asia were still globed together, and they were linked to North America by a series of islands. But what made these animals to become big? They had to eat and digest vast quantities of food, they had to grow fast, must be able to breathe very efficiently, and shed excess body heat. This process was enabled by their unique body plan that included a highly efficient lung more related to a birdlike lung because many bones of the chest cavity had big openings. There were many air sacs that extended throughout their body that helped lungs to take in enough oxygen to stoke their metabolism.During the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous, tyrannosaurs flourished, ruling the river valleys, lakeshores, flood­ plains, forests, and deserts of North America and China. Colossal tyrannosaurs never seemed to gain a foothold in Europe or the southern continents, where other groups of large predators prospered, but in North America and China, species of tyrannosaurs were unrivaled. They had become the transcendent terrors that fire our imaginations. The species of Tyrannosaurus Rex was not a global but existed only in North West of United States. On that fateful morning 66 million years ago, when a pack of T. Rexes woke up on what would go down as the final day of the Cretaceous Period, all seemed normal in their Hell Creek kingdom, the same as it had for two millions of years. Forests of conifers and ginkgoes stretched to the horizon, interspersed with palms and magnolias. The distant churn of a river, rushing eastward to empty into the great seaway that lapped against western North America. For the last several weeks, the more perceptive of the T. Rexes may have noticed a glowing orb in the sky, far off in the distance and a hazy ball also had a fiery rim. The orb would appear and disappear for hours. As it appeared again, it was bigger, its shine illuminating much of the sky to the southeast in a cloudy psychedelic mist. Then a flash. No noise, only a split-second flare of yellow that lit up the whole sky, disorienting the animals for a moment. As they blinked their eyes back to focus, they noticed that the orb was now gone. Moments later, and then they were blindsided. Another flash, but this one far more vengeful. The rays lit the morning air in a fireworks display and burned into their retinas. In fact, no noise at all. By now, the birds and flying raptors had stopped chirping, and silence hung over Hell Creek. The calm lasted for only a few seconds. Next, the ground beneath their feet started to rumble and shake, and then flew like waves; pulses of energy were shooting through the rocks and soil, the ground rising and falling as if a giant snake were slithering underneath. Everything not rooted into the dirt was thrown upward; then it crashed down, and then up and down again, the Earth's surface was acting like a trampoline. Everything within a radius of about six hundred miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of modern-day Mexico was annihilated, and vaporized. For several years, the Earth turned cold and dark because of soot, sulfur, sulfuric acid and rock dust in the atmosphere that blocked out the sun. The darkness brought severe winter for years that only the hardiest of animals could survive. The rains were highly acidic that wiped out much of marine species. Here and there, species of lizards, crocodiles, turtles, birds and rat-size mammals made it but with lots of duress under the fury of nature. Hell-Creek was turned to Hell that reverberated in rest of the world."

168,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,5,"Phew! A pop history on Dinosaurs written by a Paleantologist is enough to trigger your curiosity and awaken the science geek in you. However, you do worry about a Ross Geller level book you will be stuck with for ages. Stephen Brusatte is more Douglas Adams than Ross Geller and he tells a story that is at once engaging and enlightening. Imagine a huge jigsaw puzzle that has to pieced together. The challenge is that the pieces are found years apart and you have dedicated science heroes who try to make the best image possible with the pieces they have. And the frustration that lasts for decades when you realise there are missing pieces. That has been the story of piecing together the history of one of the most fascinating creatures that inhabited the earth.What Brusatte has done is not just laying out the facts (and theories) but also a tribute to all the paleontologists who have played a part in building the current understanding. Starting from the Permian period fossils through the Triassic age till the Jurassic and Cretaceous - the author paints a picture that is hard to ignore of complex foodchains, rise of apex predators and the entire evolution journey on fast forward. The journey is mapped through the work of paleontologists, geologists and collectors whose stories, quirks and anecdotes too are part of this book. The history of Dinosaurs cannot be narrated without the history of the planet and hence we get a lot of information on movement of continent, rise of oceans and rise of life in general.There is a chapter dedicated to Tyranosorus Rex (Tyrant King) which almost worships the larger than life (most lives, at least) predators. The author does not miss an opportunity to compare notes and point errata to the Jurassic Park movie, which is the introduction to most of us who are googling images today. The linkage to birds apart, the single mass extinction theory that brought an end to cretareous is more like the dominant theory that most paleantologists subscribe to. He actually describes a meeting of paleantologists in 2012 to discuss the validity of the theory where everyone agreed. This is only what we know.. so far.. A good book that presents facts actually allows you to understand the origin of popular theories without judging them - like the science of Phrenology which took off in the same period classifying human beings from different continents as different species. Today we grow uncomfortable knowing that gave grounds to Eugenics and later persecution of races in terms of superiority. Scientists are impervious to the implications of truth. The book makes you ask a lot more questions and for that reason alone, I loved it. A joyride!"

It was quite informative, especially for those, like me, who haven't been able to keep up with all of the findings in this subject for the last couple of decades. I think I liked this book because it was part memoir as well as science. The author has a sense of humor, and is only three years older than me, so his pop culture and generation comments were right on par. He does mention the film Jurassic Park several times, though usually to disprove some of their science. I only had one complaint: No color pictures! I was surprised how much this bugged me, but as the author described such beautiful landscapes of where he was digging, and then only provided a black and white photograph, the beauty was lost on me. I realize it's cheaper to publish without color photos, and paleontologists most likely don't make bank, but the author is the ""resident paleontologist for BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs"" so I think color photographs isn't too much to ask. The illustrations were lovely though, even if they portrayed the dinos with feathers...I guess I can't deny a lot of dinosaurs had feathers anymore since I've now read this. Dinosaurs just don't seem as cool with them.I will just mention that I have my own personal opinion on evolution. This book talks a lot about the evolution of dinosaurs. I am religious, which probably has a lot to do with it, but I never quite agreed fully with the author on this subject.Overall, I recommend it!2018 challenge: A book with an animal in the title"

Bullshit marketing.There are some other reasons why I’m giving this a 1-star review. One of the biggest is Brusatte’s continued insistence on ascribing INTENT to evolution. What the actual fuck, dude? No, triceratops didn’t decide to grow horns. T. rex didn’t want to grow teeth. Mammals weren’t “craving” the opportunity to supplant the dinosaurs for 100 million years. If you’re going to imbue intelligent design to evolution then you are one bad week from assuming that an almighty god did it and that the Bible is literally correct.You are doing a disservice to everyone who reads this book, especially to every kid who does so, because you are saying chance doesn’t exist in natural selection and that every species decides what it wants to become. That’s woo-woo bullshit and utterly unscientific. Stop invoking intelligent design. Stop it.In my lifetime there have been a few things which have completely upended our understanding of dinosaurs. Bakker’s insistence that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. (The Dinosaur Heresies) Which now has a mountain of evidence supporting it. Alvarez’s discovery that an asteroid impact in the Yucatán killed off the dinosaurs. (T. Rex and the Crater of Doom) And most recently, Horner’s complete and utter decimation of the plethora of dinosaur species. (https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner...)Paleontologists at the time pushed back on all of these theories, but the first two are now widely accepted by pretty much everyone, because the ones who objected have died off. The latter has pissed off paleontologists because some of them have named these “new” species and Horner has effectively wiped away their claims to fame by asking a simple question: “Where are all the baby dinosaurs?” Brusatte doesn’t even address Horner’s theory, probably because he doesn’t agree with it. Except the evidence is compelling.Everyone knows Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law (“indistinguishable from magic”) but not as many are familiar with his First: “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.” Brusatte is in his early 30s, so he doesn’t have that excuse.There are other things in this book which are irksome but don’t rise to the level of anger, such as his constant descriptions of travel. I could not care less which trains he had to catch or the type of trucks he rode in. I guess that stuff was added for flavor, but it’s entirely beside the point 90% of the time. His descriptions of fellow fossil fiends is more on point because it shows the diversity of the (mostly male) dinosaur hunters, but there are quite a few women who play tertiary roles. That’s the one valuable aspect of this book. Minor, but it’s there.He does have a weird way of describing dinosaurs. Herbivores are “plant gobblers” while carnivores are “meat gobblers”. He did mix it up once by saying “plant munchers”, so yay for linguistic diversity. Hashtag sarcasm.You don’t need to read this book. Try those others I linked above. Watch that video."

This is very much for dino fans, very readable, but not super-strict on phrasing for best presentation of the science, not enough pictures of models of dinos.So, yeah, the bad: writes of evolutionary development as if it were intentional. Speaks of T.Rex and Triceratops as 'rivals.'* Too many scientific names of species I've never heard of for me to able to keep track w/out those missing pictures. Some awkward stretches for humor.The good: Once I got the hang of reading it w/out fretting that I wasn't keeping track of every species named, I found it very engaging. And, yes, enlightening. And Brusatte does teach something about science. For example he does admit that new finds may overturn current assumptions, and he does explain *how* a lot of stuff that is understood came to be figured out:""We can tell that Rex had some of the largest and most powerful jaw muscles of any dinosaur, based on the very broad and deep gullies on the skull bones where the muscles attached.""One species mentioned early I am going to google image search: Effigia okeeffeae....... and ""human-sized ominvorous theropods called oviraptororsaurs.""... and *The Age of Reptiles* mural.... balaur bondoc""Proper grasslands would not develop until... many tens of millions of years after the dinosaurs cleared out."" (I have to pick the nit of the word choice 'cleared.' Did dinosaurs prevent grass from evolving to become grasslands? I doubt it....)""The Gobi fossils tell us that the ancestors of birds got smart before they took to the skies."" Also got feathers, wings, and efficient lungs 'flow-through' lungs before that, too. ""The feathers of nonflying, winged dinosaurs were a rainbow of different colors..."" discovered from Jakob Vinther's studies of melanosomes, and probably used for display.Walter Alvarez is Luis Alvarez' son.Anyway, you can see that the good outweighs the bad. And no, despite all my notes, you can't skip this book if you're interested in the subject... I only mentioned a few of the my favorite bits; there are many more that you'll find interesting, too.*""a person or thing competing with another for the same objective or for superiority in the same field of activity"" ... not competing against each other for life..."

It is titled so inaccurately as to give off an impression that it no way lives up to. ""The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs"" should have been called ""My journey into paleontology and hanging out with paleontologists and some history about dinosaurs"", or ""I was an annoying teenager obsessed with dinosaurs, and now I'm an annoying 30-something obsessed with dinosaurs with some nice degrees, here let me show you"". The absurd amount of times this guy hits you with first-person pronouns is outrageous. Let's just stick with the dinosaurs, you know, like the title suggested. Here's a snippet of where I grew most annoyed (talking about one of his expert female colleagues): ""...she can easily work from home, which is deep among the last remaining Beijing hutongs-traditional narrow-alleyed neighborhoods of single-story stone buildings pasted together. Good thing too, because she spends a lot of her non-science time hanging about in the hutongs, raving and occasionally DJ-ing in the trendy clubs of China's suddenly hip capital. Jingmai calls herself a paleontologista-fitting, given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia.""

174,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"I haven't thought much about dinosaurs since I was in elementary school, so this was an absorbing and engaging look at what we do -- and don't -- know about dinosaurs at this point. So much has happened in the decades since my youth, and getting caught up was more than worthwhile. There are over 50 dinosaur species discovered each year (!!) and more, science agrees that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs (!!!). I didn't realize that the Burpee, which is just down the road from me, has such a wide dinosaur history, despite the fact no significant fossils have been ever discovered in Illinois. I wish there'd been less about Brusatte through. The moments where it drifted into him nerding out about dinosaurs were weakened a bit when he name dropped. Certainly, those who've done work deserve credit, but doing so in context to how you know that person or have worked with them leans a bit too hard on the ""look at how I've rubbed elbows with famous people"" side. Barring that, readers who are curious about dinosaurs or haven't thought about them since elementary days will find this a worthwhile read.The audiobook worked well, too. "

I was very surprised at this shocking twist ending. I thought T-Rexs lived among us.Exhibit A:And yes, this is a brief history. This covers hundreds of millions (okay, billions but eh, semantics) and compresses a really varied and complex history into an overview so easy a caveman can read it.Aaaaaaaaand with that I'll retire all ancient puns for forever. Anywho, this was a fascinating glimpse into the quickly changing and fast-paced world of paleontology and geology, which were not the dead-end jobs that I grew up being told (""You'll never get a job studying dinosaurs"" they said, so I...never did—also I was never super duper fascinated by dinosaurs and the past because that kitchen scene scared the living shit out of me, so), but are vibrant and growing and uncovering more and more history-altering discoveries each month. It's fascinating and incredible what new discoveries, technology and modern analytics can do—and the brilliant minds that are dedicated to understanding the mysteries of the past.This entire book was amazing, particularly when understanding the billions of years of life that came before humans—and the chain of events that led to humans being able to become the apex predators instead of the vicious T-Rex, who was cut down at the height of its reign (and who had great eyesight and could not outrun a Jeep and could totally crush a car in half with its jaws, so thank you for giving me a false sense of security, Jurassic Park). Additionally, earlier periods of dinosaurs and non-dinosaurs were covered, particularly the evolution of crocodiles (who were scary AF) and also birds.Spoiler alert: birds are dinosaurs.Double spoiler alert: that meteorite did end the dinosaur's reign.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was clearly written, and while repetitive at times it clearly illustrated the vast biodiversity of Earth's history and how various climate changes and environments influence what flourishes were and how simple changes can have dramatic effects in various ecosystems.Definitely a must-read if you want to learn more about dinosaurs and the prehistoric Earth but don't know where to start.But, since dinosaurs are (mostly) extinct, all we can do is attempt to recreate the past:"
177,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I listened to this audiobook during one of my many long drives this last week, and I really enjoyed it, despite some annoying flaws. As y'all may be aware, I love me some nonfiction these days, and when it's well-written and accessible and brings the information being conveyed to the reader (or listener) in an entertaining way, so much the better. History, science, technology, sociology, whatever, I'm into it. This book ticked some of the boxes, but not as many as I'd have wanted. I enjoyed the information being presented, but not the method of presentation, if that makes sense. Lemme elaborate. Stephen Brusatte is definitely a dino-nerd. And I say this with the utmost respect. You can tell that he's excited and passionate about learning about dinosaurs, how they came to exist, and how they came to no longer exist. His writing is well-informed, interesting, and he knows his stuff, and presents his facts and supporting arguments well, whether it's the cause of the extinction event that cause the dinosaurs to become ""extinct"", or the argument that modern day birds ARE dinosaurs and therefore not all dinosaurs are extinct after all. They've just evolved. But, a bit of that gets lost in the overwhelming amount of hard to follow scientific species names and tidbit detail, and there was a lot of it. Discovery of new fossils, the qualities and criteria for distinguishing it as a Bellusaurus vs a Barosaurus vs a Barapasaurus vs a Brachiosaurus... etc. I think, even had I read this in print, this amount of quick-fire detail wouldn't work well, but in audio, it was just overwhelming. I ended up listening to this book MUCH MUCH slower than I usually listen to audiobooks, just to try to follow along and track the myriad dinos and their traits. But then, we come to the Spotlight Sections. Where we spend a lot of time focusing on one dinosaur (or idea) and examining it in detail. Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course, was the dinosaur, because it's everyone's favorite. I did learn quite a bit about them, and it was good information and fascinating stuff, but I wish that there were more sections of detail rather than a few of them interspersed within the general overview jam packed with rapid-fire facts. Then we have the humans. I actually feel a little bit bad about the annoyance I felt about this, but I did feel it, so there it is. Whenever Brusatte would introduce a new human into the story, whether they found one dinosaur bone in their backyard or have found millions of them around the globe, we got as much of their life story as possible in their intro. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in their expertise and why I should trust them and their conclusions, but do I really need to know that they enjoy kayaking? Not really. Let's keep it relevant. Finally, there was the reader. Holy moly, dude, take a BREATH. I feel like this guy was on a deadline to spit this book out. I had SUCH a hard time finding places to pause, because he literally never did. Even between chapters, a pause that might usually go for 2-3 seconds was MAYBE a 1 second pause here. I was NEVER quick enough to pause at the end of a section or chapter without cutting it off mid-word as he started the next section. It was crazy. And this while listening to this at a SLOWER speed than I normally do. O_OBut those complaints aside, this really was a fascinating, informative, and entertaining look at dinosaurs and their history. And their modernity. I loved the science and methodology of the discovery and determination of fossils and how they went about piecing together the lives that these animals would have lived. It really was very well researched, and I love reading books by people who are truly passionate and excited about their work. It does show. I do just wish that it was maybe presented in a little bit more measured of a way so that the reader can really absorb the massive amount of information here. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in dinosaurs, or earth's or life's history at all. There are lessons here about so much more than just dinosaurs, but about time and change and impermanence, but also about resilience and tenacity. The section about the extinction event that wiped out most of the species of life on the planet was harrowing and nerve-wracking, and I'm experiencing it from millions and millions of years removed from the actual event. Such was Brusatte's skill at delving into the detail and bringing the story to life. I was heartbroken for these animals that have been dead for millennia. It was a stark reminder that nothing at all guarantees our time on this rock, but that maybe something new and interesting can be given an opportunity to spring up in our place. "
178,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,2,"This could have been good. Maybe. If the author had stuck to dinosaurs which he didn't when he basically had to mention every person he has ever met in paleontology or has touched paleontology in some way. The first few chapters were definitely full of name dropping, mostly of male paleontologists. Female paleontologists were mentioned only if they were married to another paleontologist or just had their work mentioned while the men got full page biographies and accolades (and the overuse of certain adjectives). I do have to point out one female paleontologist did get a bit more of an introduction but she gets mentioned and then ignored. I know science , in certain fields, can still be male dominated but this felt more like blatant sexism by the author. I mean, the men get full page biographies, their work is highlighted, their connections to others in the field are highlighted, they get treated with respect and admiration. The women are pointed out in relation to their husbands (if married) and might get a sentence about their work. Or just a sentence about their work if they're not married. If these women's work hadn't impacted his own, I don't think the author would have mentioned them at all.The writing and organization are all over the place. This was supposed to be a history of the dinosaurs but this was more a biography of the author's work. And a lot of the material just didn't feel like it was really new and I'm not big into dinosaurs but I knew a lot already. And I haven't read anything on dinosaurs since elementary school, I think. There were times when there should have been less detail and times when there should have been more detail. The few middle chapters did seem to improve (more dinosaurs, less author self-promotion) but it never really got good. I also felt the author didn't seem to know who he was writing for, who his audience was supposed to be. Things were all over the place. This has potential but never seemed to get off the ground. Not worth reading."
179,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"Steve Brusatte really likes dinosaurs and prospecting for fossils and analyzing dinosaur history. And he is able to communicate that love really well. I enjoyed this book a lot. Brusatte presents the current state of dinosaur knowledge (Note: Spielberg had a lot of it wrong.) and brings it to life. Not just the dinosaurs themselves, but the many dedicated researchers who have made all these discoveries. The writing is lucid and accessible to the non-scientist. Okay, occasionally all the Latin names for different species cause a little eye-glazing, but it's not necessary to remember them to absorb the sense of the text. The description of the day the asteroid hit is especially vivid. And the explanations of evolution as reflected in the dinosaurs were very clear and helpful. I think Brusatte must be an excellent teacher. "

There have been amazing breakthroughs in our knowledge regarding dinosaurs; and with the advent of grandsons, it was clearly time for me to ‘up my game’!Brusatte has written a highly readable account of those new advances. He is an enthusiastic fossil hunter that takes the reader around the world from Georgia O’Keefe’s Ghost Ranch “bursting with dinosaur bones”; to Hell Creek, Montana—a Triceratops graveyard; to China and its plethora of feather-covered fossils; and to Italy where a thin layer of iridium indicates that an asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago.I admit that I enjoy reading about how paleontologists have determined that dinosaurs had feathers; that they were colored, and likely proved to be advantageous in attracting mates. And those dinosaurs that later became birds may have first used wing action to attract more attention, and just stumbled upon how wing action could result in gliding and eventually flying. It just takes a few millennia to make it happen.The number of new discoveries regarding dinosaurs over the past twenty years is mind-boggling. I look forward to learning more in the next twenty.

I don't know whether at this point in human history it's comfortable or not to reflect that the earth has seen multiple animal kingdoms wiped out when soaring carbon dioxide turned the atmosphere into an oven. There's a kind of comfort in looking at it from a cosmic level, I guess? "
182,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,5,"This was a book I HAD to read--to catch up on the subject I obsessed so much about in elementary school-Dinosaurs! When I was a kid I read every book on dinosaurs that I could find in my local library and my parents bought me even more books--and I was thrilled no end to go to the nearby Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago! but that was in the 60s and I thought we knew everything there was to know about the big guys. They were slow, brainless giants doomed to extinction so that the way could be cleared for The Rise of Man. But, as paleontologist Steve Brusatte points out, at the end of the 60s and going into the 70s, a new paradigm took shape, in which dinosaurs have been viewed as active, even energetic, animals, some being social and intelligent. Rather than doomed to failure, they were among the most successful animals for over 150 million years. If it had not been for what Brusatte calls ""the worst day in the history of our planet,"" when the asteroid (or comet) hit 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs would still dominate the Earth. The good news is that the dinos did not completely die out. I see some flitting about my bird feeder even as I type this. The birds are now classified as dinosaurs, as theropods, related to T-rex and velociraptors. For me, the most interesting part of the book (as a bird-lover) is his discussing the origin and evolution of the birds (and feathers!). I'm so glad they escaped the Cretaceous (Fifth) Extinction Event, but it's an open question whether they can escape the current or Sixth Extinction Event... I enjoyed this narrative greatly because not only does Steve share his passion with the reader (he's one guy who sure does love his job!) but he relates his experiences taking part in expeditions around the globe. This does seem to be a golden age of discovery of dinosaurs--and I missed it! BUT at least I can read about it. Thanks, Steve Brusatte! And I look forward to hearing more from this amazing young man!"

I prefer to read pop-science books written by scientists, and Brusatte is a young vertebrate paleontologist at the Univ. of Edinburgh. Like all of us, he caught the dino bug when he was a kid. Unlike most, he made a career of it, and it's been an interesting one. Dino books are generally written by seniors, so it's fun to see one of the ""young guns"" take up the pen (or computer). Brusatte is an adequate writer, which is fine, since he's got some great stories to tell. And it's a great time for the field -- he says that lately, there's a new dino species described, on average, every week!The good quality continues, and I enjoyed the book, although I got dino-overload at times. He's a decent writer, but the prose gets purple, as in the Great Asteroid that (probably) killed off the dinosaurs (except for the birds!).

Just a heads-up for anyone who is thinking of getting the audio book.***I am doing the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge and this is where I need to start cheating a little bit.

Much of what I learned as a child about the big lizards has since been refuted by new fossils, better analysis, and new research. Stephen Brusatte caught the dino bug when he was young and became a vertebrate paleontologist. His passion comes through loud and clear in this book, as he takes his readers from ancient history to the end of most dinosaurs on this planet, starting with the biggest mass extinction on this planet at the end of the Permian age; this die-off made way for some unusual reptiles with a different body plan than many of their peers that proved to be amazingly successful for these reptiles and their countless descendants for millennia afterwards through the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. Though I was already familiar with much that Brusatte covered, his writing style made the material approachable and easy to understand. There were not as many images as I would have liked; despite my familiarity with many of the creatures, it’s still hard to remember the little differences between similar individuals in a group, and more drawings would have been helpful.I particularly liked Brusatte's chapters on the Permian-Triassic transition, tyrannosaurs, birds, and the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous especially. I am a fan of theropods, and Brusatte is clearly a huge fan of the tyrannosaurids. He tended to wax a little melodramatic about these carnivorous dinosaurs, but then it's a little hard not to be in awe of such terrifying beings. (Especially the huge carnivorous members of this group.)This book was a good refresher on many points about dinosaurs, and the author's writing style and obvious enthusiasm for the subject made this an enjoyable read."

It's like wondering what might have happened if the archduke was never shot.The whole these-were-the-coolest-beings-that-ever-roamed-the-earth moniker has always made me a dino fan. The amazing variations of these huge oddballs have always been intriguing and this book does its best to piece everything together. Which is a very good thing, because there have been so many new discoveries and new theories since I was a child that I lost track of which was the coolest dino (welcome back, Brontosaurus).Steve Brusatte is one of the world's eminent paleontologists whose other books, especially Field Guide to Dinosaurs, have made me a fan of his writing and his obvious enthusiasm for his work. Here, he charts the very beginnings of the dinosaur, even before they evolved. He starts with the Permian Extinction, which eliminated 95% of life on earth. Somehow, some little things survived and that eventually led the way for the bigger things to arrive later on. Right off, his description of the Great Dying kept me glued to the pages as the volcanoes spewed forth lava mud and carbon dioxide. How anything managed to live through all of that is simply amazing.As the dinosaurs grew, the earth was also changing, with the continents moving toward their current locations and the environment becoming a bit nicer. Well, nicer like walking outside at noon during an Alabama summer. The dinosaurs became larger and larger and ruled the world until the day that nasty asteroid slammed into Earth. Then, Brusatte relates what it must have felt like to wake up that day as a dino, thinking you were just going about your business as usual. Nope. Any dinosaur too close to the impact was vaporised while the ones further away endured boiling hot hail, mammoth earthquakes, renewed lava flows, loss of sun, loss of trees, and ergo, loss of life. The dinosaurs didn't all die at once, he states, but probably over a few hundred or few thousand years. Given the fact that they had been around for millions of years, the dinosaur extinction was relatively quick.The book doesn't just end with the catastrophic impact but instead continues with the rise of the birds, our current dinosaurs. All very fascinating. While there are some b&w illustrations at the beginning of each chapter, the book is mostly text with various photos of fossils and the paleontologists who discovered the dino fossils. That's because this book is as much a tribute to the men and women who found those dragon bones as it is to the dinosaur. I deducted a star for the continuous focus on the author (we get it, Steve, you like dinosaurs and you go on lots of expeditions). So pretty good book, but it forced me to check out another library book (The Great Dinosaur Discoveries) so I could see the actual illustrations of what these big brutes would have looked like.That darn asteroid.Book Season = Year Round (looking at the finches with suspicion)"

It puts perspective on “our” life and “our” Earth and how we really don’t know it all. All we have are the few pieces of evidence of a life completely different from our own. I really appreciate all the researchers and paleontologists who put their time and energy, (and sometimes their life) into helping us better understand these eras and species long gone. The end really made me sad. Seeing these beautiful creatures end so abruptly (and in the way that it did) is such a shame. However, few of these creatures did leave their footprint to give future species, like us, proof and imagination of an insanely different time here on Earth. Just imagine all the things we don’t know because we don’t have proof, haven’t found it yet, or might have wrong. It’s surreal to think about. That said, I do wish the author talked less about the people who studied the fossils and more about the dinosaurs. I also wish he threw in more pictures of what he was explaining so I could get a picture of what he was discussing. I found myself with my phone in one hand and the book in the other, constantly looking up pictures of the dinosaurs he mentioned, the eras, and anything he named and just assumed the reader knew. "

I got to go through the same thing when my kids went through the phase as well and I got all caught up with things like Walking With Dinosaurs and its ilk. Which is all a round-about way of saying that I thought of myself as being fairly well-informed about paleontology, at least from a pop-science perspective.This book did an excellent job of bringing that pop-science overview of the field much more up-to-date. For instance, I was aware that paleontology in China had been going off with some really exciting discoveries, but I had no idea how key that has been to the overall understanding of dinosaur lineage. There also appears to be some fairly exciting new thinking about the origin of dinosaurs and the early period of the Triassic that I was entirely unaware of.In short, this is a great book for establishing an up-to-date popular science-level overview of the dinosaur element of paleontology, all made that much more engaging by a series of personal anecdotes from the author and his own career and interaction with his peers."

The rise and fall of the dinosaurs is an incredible story, of a time when giant beasts and other fantastic creatures made the world their own. They walked on the very ground below us, their fossils now entombed in rock – the clues that tell this story. To me, it's one of the greatest narratives in the history of our planet.
The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is thoroughly enjoyable pop science: author (and celebrated young paleontologist) Steve Brusatte uses his own learning journey to outline the exciting advances occurring today in his field (he calls this the “golden age” of paleontology, noting that new species of dinosaurs are discovered/described at the astounding rate of about one per week), and not only did I learn new and fascinating information from the deep history of our remarkable planet, but I found Brusatte's enthusiasm to be contagious. Who doesn't love dinosaurs? Totally accessible (but fact-filled) and balanced with personal stories (which I acknowledge might strain the patience of those of a more academic bent), it all worked for me.Early on, Brusatte – who is a Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Edinburgh – refers to his “ebullient, wildly animated lecturing style”, and for the purposes of this review, I'd rather demonstrate this ebullience than attempt to list everything that Brusatte taught me. On the sauropods whose tracks he studied on the Scottish Isle of Skye:
There's really no better way to say it: the sauropods that made their marks in that ancient Scottish lagoon were awesome creatures. Awesome in the literal sense of the word – impressive, daunting, inspiring awe. If I was handed a blank sheet of paper and pen and told to create a mythical beast, my imagination could never match what evolution created in sauropods.
Brusatte devotes plenty of breathless space to the Tyrannosaurus rex – including debunking what Jurassic Park got wrong about the apex predators (turns out that their eyesight was perfectly sharp, but they couldn't have outrun a jeep) – and writes, “The seat of Rex's power was its head. It was a killing machine, torture chamber for its prey, and an evil mask all in one.” And after having repeatedly referred to T. Rex arms as “sad” and “pathetic”, Brusatte shares new research that has determined, based on strong shoulder extensors and elbow flexors, the Rex used these “short but strong arms to hold down struggling prey while the jaws did their bone-crunching thing. The arms were accessories to murder.” Murder! The writing gets amped up when T. Rex meets its favourite meal:Triceratops, like its archnemesis T. rex, is a dinosaur icon. In films and documentaries, it usually plays the gentle, sympathetic plant-eater, the perfect dramatic foil to the Tyrant King. Sherlock versus Moriarty, Batman versus the Joker, Trike versus Rex. But it's not all movie magic; no, these two dinosaurs truly would have been rivals 66 million years ago...The King needed immense amounts of flesh to fuel its metabolism; its three-horned comrade was fourteen tons of slow-moving prime steak. You can figure out what happened next.So, you either enjoy a professor writing like a teenaged dino-fanboy, or you don't. Interspersed with the timeline of dinosaur evolution, Brusatte outlines the history of fossil hunting from the “Bone Wars” (which saw 19th-century rivals Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh sending out teams of mercenaries to hunt for bones for their individual glory; in the pursuit of which they weren't above stealing, lying, and sabotaging each other's sites) to the academics of today. In addition to referring to individuals as the “hot shots” or “rock stars” or the “Rat Pack” of paleontology, Brusatte proves that paleontologists just might be a special breed unto themselves. Barnum Brown, the first celebrity paleontologist at the turn of the twentieth century, prospected for dino bones in high summer “decked out in his fur coat with his pickaxe slung over his shoulder”. Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás – an adventurer, WWI spy, and the first paleobiologist – was a “flamboyant dandy and a tragic genius, whose exploits hunting dinosaurs in Transylvania were brief respites from the insanity of the rest of his life. Dracula, in all seriousness, has nothing on the Dinosaur Baron.” And as for Brusatte's modern day colleagues:Thomas Carr – my absinthe-drinking, Goth-dressing friend who studies T. rex – was with us on the expedition and was part of this team. Clad in khaki (it was far too hot for his usual all-black getup) and sucking down Gatorade by the gallon (absinthe was more of an indoor pursuit), he attacked the mudstones with his rock hammer (which he nicknamed Warrior) and his pickaxe (Warlord), exposing a number of new Triceratops bones.And working on the other side of the world in China, Brusatte describes another rising star:
Jingmai (O'Connor) calls herself a paleontologista – fitting given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia. A native of Southern California – half Irish, half-Chinese by blood – Jingmai is a Roman Candle of energy – delivering caustic one-liners one moment, speaking in eloquent paragraphs about politics the next, and then it's on to music or art or her own unique brand of Buddhist philosophy. Oh yes, and she’s also the world’s number-one expert on those first birds that broke the bounds of Earth to fly above their dinosaur ancestors.
And speaking of the first birds: as uncomfortable as I find this book's cover art – depicting a wispily feathered T. rex confronting wispily feathered prey dinos – that's a mental-shift I'll need to force myself to make: Brusatte makes the incontrovertible case that all true dinosaurs (not crocs or other proto-reptiles) were in a direct line to modern day birds and shared many of the same body features (flow-through lungs, wishbones, and yes, feathers; there's a paleontologist working today who can even determine the colours of their plumage). But, if I can mentally shift the T. rex from the upright Barney-the-dinosaur stance depicted in my youth to the balanced-forward pose accepted today, I suppose I can eventually re-imagine it covered in feathers. After all of the enthusiasm Brusatte displays for the rise and evolutionary success of the dinosaurs, the final chapter on their sudden demise is urgently and tragically related:It was the worst day in the history of our planet. A few hours of unimaginable violence that undid more than 150 million years of evolution and set life on a new course. T. rex was there to see it.An impact from a meteorite (or possibly comet), hitting with the force of “a billion nuclear bombs' worth of energy”, caused the near total extinction of the earth's most successful and widespread species (excepting, of course, for those dinosaurs who survived to evolve into what we think of as birds). The good news is that this catastrophic event paved the wave for the rise of the mammals, and us; the bad news is that we're no more special than the dinosaurs, and catastrophes – including those of our own making – can strike at any time. If you like your pop science poppy, this is an entertaining and informative read."
192,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Dinosaurs aren't a hard sell. People are just into them. I'm one of those people. In this book, Brusatte notes that his generation (which I'm a part of ~ thirtysomethings) were indelibly drawn to dinosaurs because of Jurassic Park. Of course, the interest preceded that film (umm, what about 1988's Land Before Time?), but it did solidify it!I've had this book since it came out in 2018 and knew I'd be reading it for this round of Science September. It's a great primer, a deep dive into modern #paleontology and evolutionary biology, with all the new fossils and species identifications.You come for the dinosaurs, and Brusatte's engaging storytelling and infectious enthusiasm for the subject keep you reading. He has what I can only describe as a ""folksy"" writing style, describing nearly every person in the book as 'the greatest paleontogist' or 'the nicest person you'll ever meet' (it's endearing, but it makes you wonder if it's all exactly true... Are they all this nice?) My favorite sections of the book were about dinosaur anatomy and biomechanics - the descriptions of their lungs and breathing patterns, and how this resembles modern birds' lungs, their bones' hollow structure, and their locomotion and moving speeds. How does a creature that weighs TONS pump blood? New and more complete #fossils have shown us how they moved, breathed, circulated blood, digested food, and how they looked (feathers! Even Tyrannosaurus Rex had feathers - not the plumage, but more likely quills and downy fuzz feathers). It's completely fascinating.This was a great companion piece with Peter Brannen's The Ends of the World that I read last week. There is overlap in topic of mass extinction after the asteroid hit, but Brusatte's book goes into more depth in the paleontology (and some anecdotes about cold calling Walter Alvarez for travel advice!) and the #evolution that led to the bird-dinosaurs we know today."
193,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Overall, a really interesting book & well laid out, but I floundered with all the odd names. A lot of that is my own ignorance & I think I would have enjoyed this more if I knew the names better. It's obvious that Brusatte lives & breathes this stuff & loves it. The narrator was excellent & conveyed Brusatte's enthusiasm well, but I glazed over from the terminology occasionally.It was a great trip, though. I learned not just about the evolution of dinosaurs, but about the other critters of the times, ones I'd often confused with them. He describes their rise very well & dispels many of the older ideas that I learned in school. For instance, he made sense of their feathers far better than anything else I've read on the subject which is admittedly little. In doing so, he shows why we didn't realize they had them for so long.Reconstructing the story of the dinosaurs is tough due to the time involved. Their reign ended 66 million years ago, but it was only about 50 years ago that we nailed down why. Fossils aren't common & many of the best sites were plundered by ignorant, greedy men. He shows how this was both good & bad. The interest in them led to money for expeditions that are expensive, hard, & time consuming, but we have many fossils that aren't properly cataloged or investigated as he shows through several discoveries made by students, including himself. New methods & tools have brought some amazing clarity.Definitely recommended in any format."
194,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070393-natch,2,"I'm not sure that I've ever been more disappointed in a book. I went into it thinking that it would be a basic-level summary of the evolution of dinosaurs and the world events that shaped them. Instead, the majority of the book (or so it seemed) was about the author's (and others) meetings and, occasionally, trips to find dinosaur bones. What made the book particularly insufferable (as others have mentioned previously) was that the author has to be in his thirties, at most (I didn't look it up), and, frankly, he doesn't possess any real critical insight of himself or others. As a consequence, the book does not start as you would expect - here's what the world looked like pre-dinosaur and here's what inhabited; it starts as an autobiography with the occasional dinosaur story thrown in. For example, his first story centers on going to Poland (if I remember correctly), getting off the train, and meeting a rather unfriendly looking guy...but, turns out, that guy was really friendly! And they found footprints! And wrote an article about it!...Oh, and the proto-dinosaurs were less like salamanders in their movements and more directional and we figured out what they probably looked like...but instead of a good description, here's a little photo and that's all. But it continues in this vein. Okay, next, the author went to Portugal. There, he met a dude who was the best at finding the fossils in the places he explored since childhood. Isn't that great? Isn't that guy brilliant? Just like the other paleontologists the author knows? Well, no. I grew up on a beach known to have plenty of fossilized shark teeth. I'm pretty good at finding shark teeth. So is every other person who grew up there or has lived there for a while and looks (cue certain little, old ladies). A visitor who shows up once for two weeks is going to be terrible compared to all us natives. The other thing that really bugged me was how everyone the author has ever met in the world of paleontology is ""brilliant"" or some equivalent...and there are several pages which are just lists of people and their specialties. I'm not sure how many paleontologists there are in the world, but I would guess that a fair number were listed in this book as ""brilliant."" I just don't think that's the case, unless paleontology is only populated by MENSA members. It really seemed like this book was more the autobiography of a dude in his thirties who happens to study dinosaurs and who thought to throw in some statements about dinosaurs. Disappointingly, those statements aren't always well thought out or explained. For example, the author talks about Pangea pretty early on, describing it as a single landmass stretching from the artic to antartic and centered on the equator with a desert spanning the equator so hostile to dinosaur-life that it was, essentially, a dinosaur-less. Yet, in the same breath says that on either side of that desert were dinosaurs in the early Triassic period. What he never seems to tell us is how those dinosaurs bypassed the desert to become distributed on both sides or whether dinosaurs evolved twice (one on each side) or what might have happened. I had to go on Wikipedia to look it up. Seriously. A history book should not require readers to resort to Wikipedia to explain what happened. (Dinosaurs appear to have been able to migrate past the desert areas, fyi).I ended up giving this book two stars because it does actually talk about dinosaurs a fair bit, albeit in a kinda rushed manner. And, I guess, I felt the talk of dinosaurs was colored by my perceptions of the protagonist of the story, the author himself. I'm a bit concerned by how much beer he drinks. There was more than one description of events being described as the best (the best conference, etc.) which seem to have been wholly related to the availability of alcohol and, in the case of Argentina, beef. Further, I'm a bit concerned about the author's relationship to women. He seems to revel in ribald jokes, as, I think, other commentators have mentioned, and seems to have a bit of a negative view of them. That might be okay for the character in a novel, but it's something that should be addressed in the world of real people. Those things really did color my feelings on this book and definitely contributed to the loss of a star. The other two were lost because of how much space seemed to be devoted to personal antedotes and urgings to read his other works rather than the story of dinosaurs. "

196,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Highway to Hell Creek; the discovery of the remnants of Jurassic park In this dazzling rehash, author Steve Brusatte tells the mesmerizing story of dinosaurs; their origins, evolution, diversity, habitats and their cataclysmic extinction. This is a captivating narrative that engages the reader till the end of the book. Highly readable and well researched that interest readers focused in ancient history this planet, dinosaurs, and life in late cretaceous era (100 – 66 million Years). The book describes immediate events after planet was hit by 6.5-mile-long asteroid (Chicxulub meteorite), at the speed of 67,000 miles per hour, 65.5 million years ago. The fossils from this event are preserved all over the planet, which gives a grim picture. It simply demonstrates that life on earth is susceptible to the wrath of nature. This was the sixth extinction of life in 4.5 billion history of the planet, and it was colossal, cosmic and catastrophic. How did life witness this? The author describes in detail as what may have happened immediately before and after the greatest hit in the recent history of our planet. Although this has been discussed on several TV shows on Nat Geo, Discovery, PBS and Science channels by geophysicists, astronomers and paleontologists, it is interesting to read from the point of a paleontologist who studies dinosaurs with passion. In fact, it is common in recent days to read about the discovery of new species of dinosaurs, birds and mammals from this event. One of the goldmines for finding the lost species is Hell Creek, Montana where treasure trove of fossils is preserved. It is a mixing of fossil carcasses and a layer of glass tektites from meteorite hit with impact impressions deposited minutes to hours after the apocalypse.The Hell Creek Formation in the Upper Great Plains of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were laid down by ancient rivers and streams as they traveled from the Rocky Mountains in the west toward the east before emptying into a large interior seaway that bisected North America during the latest Cretaceous period. Due to rise in sea-level in the Late Cretaceous, North America was bisected by a seaway stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. The states of NM, AZ, CO, SD, ND and MT were buried under water in a shallow sea that ran from Mexico to NW Canada. At that time the states of CA, OR, WA and ID were on the West and the rest of United States were on the east. The Hell Creek rocks preserve the remains of dinosaurs after Chicxulub meteorite struck into the ocean in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The death and destruction of the most iconic dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus Rex, the three horned dinosaur, Triceratops, the duckbilled dinosaur, Edmontosaurus, and the tank-like armored dinosaur, Ankylosaurus. The fossils also include; crocodiles, lizards, snakes, turtles, frogs, salamanders, fishes, plants and mammals. At this time, the planet was largely one supercontinent called Pangea, but it had started to split into several fragments. Europe and Asia were still globed together, and they were linked to North America by a series of islands. But what made these animals to become big? They had to eat and digest vast quantities of food, they had to grow fast, must be able to breathe very efficiently, and shed excess body heat. This process was enabled by their unique body plan that included a highly efficient lung more related to a birdlike lung because many bones of the chest cavity had big openings. There were many air sacs that extended throughout their body that helped lungs to take in enough oxygen to stoke their metabolism.During the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous, tyrannosaurs flourished, ruling the river valleys, lakeshores, flood­ plains, forests, and deserts of North America and China. Colossal tyrannosaurs never seemed to gain a foothold in Europe or the southern continents, where other groups of large predators prospered, but in North America and China, species of tyrannosaurs were unrivaled. They had become the transcendent terrors that fire our imaginations. The species of Tyrannosaurus Rex was not a global but existed only in North West of United States. On that fateful morning 66 million years ago, when a pack of T. Rexes woke up on what would go down as the final day of the Cretaceous Period, all seemed normal in their Hell Creek kingdom, the same as it had for two millions of years. Forests of conifers and ginkgoes stretched to the horizon, interspersed with palms and magnolias. The distant churn of a river, rushing eastward to empty into the great seaway that lapped against western North America. For the last several weeks, the more perceptive of the T. Rexes may have noticed a glowing orb in the sky, far off in the distance and a hazy ball also had a fiery rim. The orb would appear and disappear for hours. As it appeared again, it was bigger, its shine illuminating much of the sky to the southeast in a cloudy psychedelic mist. Then a flash. No noise, only a split-second flare of yellow that lit up the whole sky, disorienting the animals for a moment. As they blinked their eyes back to focus, they noticed that the orb was now gone. Moments later, and then they were blindsided. Another flash, but this one far more vengeful. The rays lit the morning air in a fireworks display and burned into their retinas. In fact, no noise at all. By now, the birds and flying raptors had stopped chirping, and silence hung over Hell Creek. The calm lasted for only a few seconds. Next, the ground beneath their feet started to rumble and shake, and then flew like waves; pulses of energy were shooting through the rocks and soil, the ground rising and falling as if a giant snake were slithering underneath. Everything not rooted into the dirt was thrown upward; then it crashed down, and then up and down again, the Earth's surface was acting like a trampoline. Everything within a radius of about six hundred miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of modern-day Mexico was annihilated, and vaporized. For several years, the Earth turned cold and dark because of soot, sulfur, sulfuric acid and rock dust in the atmosphere that blocked out the sun. The darkness brought severe winter for years that only the hardiest of animals could survive. The rains were highly acidic that wiped out much of marine species. Here and there, species of lizards, crocodiles, turtles, birds and rat-size mammals made it but with lots of duress under the fury of nature. Hell-Creek was turned to Hell that reverberated in rest of the world."

198,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,5,"Phew! A pop history on Dinosaurs written by a Paleantologist is enough to trigger your curiosity and awaken the science geek in you. However, you do worry about a Ross Geller level book you will be stuck with for ages. Stephen Brusatte is more Douglas Adams than Ross Geller and he tells a story that is at once engaging and enlightening. Imagine a huge jigsaw puzzle that has to pieced together. The challenge is that the pieces are found years apart and you have dedicated science heroes who try to make the best image possible with the pieces they have. And the frustration that lasts for decades when you realise there are missing pieces. That has been the story of piecing together the history of one of the most fascinating creatures that inhabited the earth.What Brusatte has done is not just laying out the facts (and theories) but also a tribute to all the paleontologists who have played a part in building the current understanding. Starting from the Permian period fossils through the Triassic age till the Jurassic and Cretaceous - the author paints a picture that is hard to ignore of complex foodchains, rise of apex predators and the entire evolution journey on fast forward. The journey is mapped through the work of paleontologists, geologists and collectors whose stories, quirks and anecdotes too are part of this book. The history of Dinosaurs cannot be narrated without the history of the planet and hence we get a lot of information on movement of continent, rise of oceans and rise of life in general.There is a chapter dedicated to Tyranosorus Rex (Tyrant King) which almost worships the larger than life (most lives, at least) predators. The author does not miss an opportunity to compare notes and point errata to the Jurassic Park movie, which is the introduction to most of us who are googling images today. The linkage to birds apart, the single mass extinction theory that brought an end to cretareous is more like the dominant theory that most paleantologists subscribe to. He actually describes a meeting of paleantologists in 2012 to discuss the validity of the theory where everyone agreed. This is only what we know.. so far.. A good book that presents facts actually allows you to understand the origin of popular theories without judging them - like the science of Phrenology which took off in the same period classifying human beings from different continents as different species. Today we grow uncomfortable knowing that gave grounds to Eugenics and later persecution of races in terms of superiority. Scientists are impervious to the implications of truth. The book makes you ask a lot more questions and for that reason alone, I loved it. A joyride!"

It was quite informative, especially for those, like me, who haven't been able to keep up with all of the findings in this subject for the last couple of decades. I think I liked this book because it was part memoir as well as science. The author has a sense of humor, and is only three years older than me, so his pop culture and generation comments were right on par. He does mention the film Jurassic Park several times, though usually to disprove some of their science. I only had one complaint: No color pictures! I was surprised how much this bugged me, but as the author described such beautiful landscapes of where he was digging, and then only provided a black and white photograph, the beauty was lost on me. I realize it's cheaper to publish without color photos, and paleontologists most likely don't make bank, but the author is the ""resident paleontologist for BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs"" so I think color photographs isn't too much to ask. The illustrations were lovely though, even if they portrayed the dinos with feathers...I guess I can't deny a lot of dinosaurs had feathers anymore since I've now read this. Dinosaurs just don't seem as cool with them.I will just mention that I have my own personal opinion on evolution. This book talks a lot about the evolution of dinosaurs. I am religious, which probably has a lot to do with it, but I never quite agreed fully with the author on this subject.Overall, I recommend it!2018 challenge: A book with an animal in the title"

Very well done. "
201,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike,1,"D’ya see that subtitle? “A New History of a Lost World”? It’s one of two things: 1) utter bullshit or 2) marketing spin (which amounts to the same thing as #1). There’s no new information in this book. However, it IS a new book, so... yeah. Bullshit marketing.There are some other reasons why I’m giving this a 1-star review. One of the biggest is Brusatte’s continued insistence on ascribing INTENT to evolution. What the actual fuck, dude? No, triceratops didn’t decide to grow horns. T. rex didn’t want to grow teeth. Mammals weren’t “craving” the opportunity to supplant the dinosaurs for 100 million years. If you’re going to imbue intelligent design to evolution then you are one bad week from assuming that an almighty god did it and that the Bible is literally correct.You are doing a disservice to everyone who reads this book, especially to every kid who does so, because you are saying chance doesn’t exist in natural selection and that every species decides what it wants to become. That’s woo-woo bullshit and utterly unscientific. Stop invoking intelligent design. Stop it.In my lifetime there have been a few things which have completely upended our understanding of dinosaurs. Bakker’s insistence that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. (The Dinosaur Heresies) Which now has a mountain of evidence supporting it. Alvarez’s discovery that an asteroid impact in the Yucatán killed off the dinosaurs. (T. Rex and the Crater of Doom) And most recently, Horner’s complete and utter decimation of the plethora of dinosaur species. (https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner...)Paleontologists at the time pushed back on all of these theories, but the first two are now widely accepted by pretty much everyone, because the ones who objected have died off. The latter has pissed off paleontologists because some of them have named these “new” species and Horner has effectively wiped away their claims to fame by asking a simple question: “Where are all the baby dinosaurs?” Brusatte doesn’t even address Horner’s theory, probably because he doesn’t agree with it. Except the evidence is compelling.Everyone knows Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law (“indistinguishable from magic”) but not as many are familiar with his First: “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.” Brusatte is in his early 30s, so he doesn’t have that excuse.There are other things in this book which are irksome but don’t rise to the level of anger, such as his constant descriptions of travel. I could not care less which trains he had to catch or the type of trucks he rode in. I guess that stuff was added for flavor, but it’s entirely beside the point 90% of the time. His descriptions of fellow fossil fiends is more on point because it shows the diversity of the (mostly male) dinosaur hunters, but there are quite a few women who play tertiary roles. That’s the one valuable aspect of this book. Minor, but it’s there.He does have a weird way of describing dinosaurs. Herbivores are “plant gobblers” while carnivores are “meat gobblers”. He did mix it up once by saying “plant munchers”, so yay for linguistic diversity. Hashtag sarcasm.You don’t need to read this book. Try those others I linked above. Watch that video."

This is very much for dino fans, very readable, but not super-strict on phrasing for best presentation of the science, not enough pictures of models of dinos.So, yeah, the bad: writes of evolutionary development as if it were intentional. Speaks of T.Rex and Triceratops as 'rivals.'* Too many scientific names of species I've never heard of for me to able to keep track w/out those missing pictures. Some awkward stretches for humor.The good: Once I got the hang of reading it w/out fretting that I wasn't keeping track of every species named, I found it very engaging. And, yes, enlightening. And Brusatte does teach something about science. For example he does admit that new finds may overturn current assumptions, and he does explain *how* a lot of stuff that is understood came to be figured out:""We can tell that Rex had some of the largest and most powerful jaw muscles of any dinosaur, based on the very broad and deep gullies on the skull bones where the muscles attached.""One species mentioned early I am going to google image search: Effigia okeeffeae....... and ""human-sized ominvorous theropods called oviraptororsaurs.""... and *The Age of Reptiles* mural.... balaur bondoc""Proper grasslands would not develop until... many tens of millions of years after the dinosaurs cleared out."" (I have to pick the nit of the word choice 'cleared.' Did dinosaurs prevent grass from evolving to become grasslands? I doubt it....)""The Gobi fossils tell us that the ancestors of birds got smart before they took to the skies."" Also got feathers, wings, and efficient lungs 'flow-through' lungs before that, too. ""The feathers of nonflying, winged dinosaurs were a rainbow of different colors..."" discovered from Jakob Vinther's studies of melanosomes, and probably used for display.Walter Alvarez is Luis Alvarez' son.Anyway, you can see that the good outweighs the bad.

It is titled so inaccurately as to give off an impression that it no way lives up to. ""The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs"" should have been called ""My journey into paleontology and hanging out with paleontologists and some history about dinosaurs"", or ""I was an annoying teenager obsessed with dinosaurs, and now I'm an annoying 30-something obsessed with dinosaurs with some nice degrees, here let me show you"". The absurd amount of times this guy hits you with first-person pronouns is outrageous. Let's just stick with the dinosaurs, you know, like the title suggested. Here's a snippet of where I grew most annoyed (talking about one of his expert female colleagues): ""...she can easily work from home, which is deep among the last remaining Beijing hutongs-traditional narrow-alleyed neighborhoods of single-story stone buildings pasted together. Good thing too, because she spends a lot of her non-science time hanging about in the hutongs, raving and occasionally DJ-ing in the trendy clubs of China's suddenly hip capital. Jingmai calls herself a paleontologista-fitting, given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia."" Stop that. Get back to the damn dinosaurs, which is interesting and why I'm here. "
204,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"I haven't thought much about dinosaurs since I was in elementary school, so this was an absorbing and engaging look at what we do -- and don't -- know about dinosaurs at this point. So much has happened in the decades since my youth, and getting caught up was more than worthwhile. There are over 50 dinosaur species discovered each year (!!) and more, science agrees that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs (!!!). I didn't realize that the Burpee, which is just down the road from me, has such a wide dinosaur history, despite the fact no significant fossils have been ever discovered in Illinois. I wish there'd been less about Brusatte through. The moments where it drifted into him nerding out about dinosaurs were weakened a bit when he name dropped. Certainly, those who've done work deserve credit, but doing so in context to how you know that person or have worked with them leans a bit too hard on the ""look at how I've rubbed elbows with famous people"" side. Barring that, readers who are curious about dinosaurs or haven't thought about them since elementary days will find this a worthwhile read.The audiobook worked well, too. "

I was very surprised at this shocking twist ending. I thought T-Rexs lived among us.Exhibit A:And yes, this is a brief history. This covers hundreds of millions (okay, billions but eh, semantics) and compresses a really varied and complex history into an overview so easy a caveman can read it.Aaaaaaaaand with that I'll retire all ancient puns for forever. Anywho, this was a fascinating glimpse into the quickly changing and fast-paced world of paleontology and geology, which were not the dead-end jobs that I grew up being told (""You'll never get a job studying dinosaurs"" they said, so I...never did—also I was never super duper fascinated by dinosaurs and the past because that kitchen scene scared the living shit out of me, so), but are vibrant and growing and uncovering more and more history-altering discoveries each month. It's fascinating and incredible what new discoveries, technology and modern analytics can do—and the brilliant minds that are dedicated to understanding the mysteries of the past.This entire book was amazing, particularly when understanding the billions of years of life that came before humans—and the chain of events that led to humans being able to become the apex predators instead of the vicious T-Rex, who was cut down at the height of its reign (and who had great eyesight and could not outrun a Jeep and could totally crush a car in half with its jaws, so thank you for giving me a false sense of security, Jurassic Park). Additionally, earlier periods of dinosaurs and non-dinosaurs were covered, particularly the evolution of crocodiles (who were scary AF) and also birds.Spoiler alert: birds are dinosaurs.Double spoiler alert: that meteorite did end the dinosaur's reign.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was clearly written, and while repetitive at times it clearly illustrated the vast biodiversity of Earth's history and how various climate changes and environments influence what flourishes were and how simple changes can have dramatic effects in various ecosystems.Definitely a must-read if you want to learn more about dinosaurs and the prehistoric Earth but don't know where to start.But, since dinosaurs are (mostly) extinct, all we can do is attempt to recreate the past:"
207,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I listened to this audiobook during one of my many long drives this last week, and I really enjoyed it, despite some annoying flaws. As y'all may be aware, I love me some nonfiction these days, and when it's well-written and accessible and brings the information being conveyed to the reader (or listener) in an entertaining way, so much the better. History, science, technology, sociology, whatever, I'm into it. This book ticked some of the boxes, but not as many as I'd have wanted. I enjoyed the information being presented, but not the method of presentation, if that makes sense. Lemme elaborate. Stephen Brusatte is definitely a dino-nerd. And I say this with the utmost respect. You can tell that he's excited and passionate about learning about dinosaurs, how they came to exist, and how they came to no longer exist. His writing is well-informed, interesting, and he knows his stuff, and presents his facts and supporting arguments well, whether it's the cause of the extinction event that cause the dinosaurs to become ""extinct"", or the argument that modern day birds ARE dinosaurs and therefore not all dinosaurs are extinct after all. They've just evolved. But, a bit of that gets lost in the overwhelming amount of hard to follow scientific species names and tidbit detail, and there was a lot of it. Discovery of new fossils, the qualities and criteria for distinguishing it as a Bellusaurus vs a Barosaurus vs a Barapasaurus vs a Brachiosaurus... etc. I think, even had I read this in print, this amount of quick-fire detail wouldn't work well, but in audio, it was just overwhelming. I ended up listening to this book MUCH MUCH slower than I usually listen to audiobooks, just to try to follow along and track the myriad dinos and their traits. But then, we come to the Spotlight Sections. Where we spend a lot of time focusing on one dinosaur (or idea) and examining it in detail. Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course, was the dinosaur, because it's everyone's favorite. I did learn quite a bit about them, and it was good information and fascinating stuff, but I wish that there were more sections of detail rather than a few of them interspersed within the general overview jam packed with rapid-fire facts. Then we have the humans. I actually feel a little bit bad about the annoyance I felt about this, but I did feel it, so there it is. Whenever Brusatte would introduce a new human into the story, whether they found one dinosaur bone in their backyard or have found millions of them around the globe, we got as much of their life story as possible in their intro. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in their expertise and why I should trust them and their conclusions, but do I really need to know that they enjoy kayaking? Not really. Let's keep it relevant. Finally, there was the reader. Holy moly, dude, take a BREATH. I feel like this guy was on a deadline to spit this book out. I had SUCH a hard time finding places to pause, because he literally never did. Even between chapters, a pause that might usually go for 2-3 seconds was MAYBE a 1 second pause here. I was NEVER quick enough to pause at the end of a section or chapter without cutting it off mid-word as he started the next section. It was crazy. And this while listening to this at a SLOWER speed than I normally do. O_OBut those complaints aside, this really was a fascinating, informative, and entertaining look at dinosaurs and their history. And their modernity. I loved the science and methodology of the discovery and determination of fossils and how they went about piecing together the lives that these animals would have lived. It really was very well researched, and I love reading books by people who are truly passionate and excited about their work. It does show. I do just wish that it was maybe presented in a little bit more measured of a way so that the reader can really absorb the massive amount of information here. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in dinosaurs, or earth's or life's history at all. There are lessons here about so much more than just dinosaurs, but about time and change and impermanence, but also about resilience and tenacity. The section about the extinction event that wiped out most of the species of life on the planet was harrowing and nerve-wracking, and I'm experiencing it from millions and millions of years removed from the actual event. Such was Brusatte's skill at delving into the detail and bringing the story to life. I was heartbroken for these animals that have been dead for millennia. It was a stark reminder that nothing at all guarantees our time on this rock, but that maybe something new and interesting can be given an opportunity to spring up in our place. "
208,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,2,"This could have been good. Maybe. If the author had stuck to dinosaurs which he didn't when he basically had to mention every person he has ever met in paleontology or has touched paleontology in some way. The first few chapters were definitely full of name dropping, mostly of male paleontologists. Female paleontologists were mentioned only if they were married to another paleontologist or just had their work mentioned while the men got full page biographies and accolades (and the overuse of certain adjectives). I do have to point out one female paleontologist did get a bit more of an introduction but she gets mentioned and then ignored. I know science , in certain fields, can still be male dominated but this felt more like blatant sexism by the author. I mean, the men get full page biographies, their work is highlighted, their connections to others in the field are highlighted, they get treated with respect and admiration. The women are pointed out in relation to their husbands (if married) and might get a sentence about their work. Or just a sentence about their work if they're not married. If these women's work hadn't impacted his own, I don't think the author would have mentioned them at all.The writing and organization are all over the place. This was supposed to be a history of the dinosaurs but this was more a biography of the author's work. And a lot of the material just didn't feel like it was really new and I'm not big into dinosaurs but I knew a lot already. And I haven't read anything on dinosaurs since elementary school, I think. There were times when there should have been less detail and times when there should have been more detail. The few middle chapters did seem to improve (more dinosaurs, less author self-promotion) but it never really got good. I also felt the author didn't seem to know who he was writing for, who his audience was supposed to be. Things were all over the place. This has potential but never seemed to get off the ground. Not worth reading."
209,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"Steve Brusatte really likes dinosaurs and prospecting for fossils and analyzing dinosaur history. And he is able to communicate that love really well. I enjoyed this book a lot. Brusatte presents the current state of dinosaur knowledge (Note: Spielberg had a lot of it wrong.) and brings it to life. Not just the dinosaurs themselves, but the many dedicated researchers who have made all these discoveries. The writing is lucid and accessible to the non-scientist. Okay, occasionally all the Latin names for different species cause a little eye-glazing, but it's not necessary to remember them to absorb the sense of the text. The description of the day the asteroid hit is especially vivid. And the explanations of evolution as reflected in the dinosaurs were very clear and helpful. I think Brusatte must be an excellent teacher. "

There have been amazing breakthroughs in our knowledge regarding dinosaurs; and with the advent of grandsons, it was clearly time for me to ‘up my game’!Brusatte has written a highly readable account of those new advances. He is an enthusiastic fossil hunter that takes the reader around the world from Georgia O’Keefe’s Ghost Ranch “bursting with dinosaur bones”; to Hell Creek, Montana—a Triceratops graveyard; to China and its plethora of feather-covered fossils; and to Italy where a thin layer of iridium indicates that an asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago.I admit that I enjoy reading about how paleontologists have determined that dinosaurs had feathers; that they were colored, and likely proved to be advantageous in attracting mates. And those dinosaurs that later became birds may have first used wing action to attract more attention, and just stumbled upon how wing action could result in gliding and eventually flying. It just takes a few millennia to make it happen.The number of new discoveries regarding dinosaurs over the past twenty years is mind-boggling. I look forward to learning more in the next twenty.

I don't know whether at this point in human history it's comfortable or not to reflect that the earth has seen multiple animal kingdoms wiped out when soaring carbon dioxide turned the atmosphere into an oven. There's a kind of comfort in looking at it from a cosmic level, I guess? "
212,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,5,"This was a book I HAD to read--to catch up on the subject I obsessed so much about in elementary school-Dinosaurs! When I was a kid I read every book on dinosaurs that I could find in my local library and my parents bought me even more books--and I was thrilled no end to go to the nearby Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago! but that was in the 60s and I thought we knew everything there was to know about the big guys. They were slow, brainless giants doomed to extinction so that the way could be cleared for The Rise of Man. But, as paleontologist Steve Brusatte points out, at the end of the 60s and going into the 70s, a new paradigm took shape, in which dinosaurs have been viewed as active, even energetic, animals, some being social and intelligent. Rather than doomed to failure, they were among the most successful animals for over 150 million years. If it had not been for what Brusatte calls ""the worst day in the history of our planet,"" when the asteroid (or comet) hit 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs would still dominate the Earth. The good news is that the dinos did not completely die out. I see some flitting about my bird feeder even as I type this. The birds are now classified as dinosaurs, as theropods, related to T-rex and velociraptors. For me, the most interesting part of the book (as a bird-lover) is his discussing the origin and evolution of the birds (and feathers!). I'm so glad they escaped the Cretaceous (Fifth) Extinction Event, but it's an open question whether they can escape the current or Sixth Extinction Event... I enjoyed this narrative greatly because not only does Steve share his passion with the reader (he's one guy who sure does love his job!) but he relates his experiences taking part in expeditions around the globe. This does seem to be a golden age of discovery of dinosaurs--and I missed it! BUT at least I can read about it. Thanks, Steve Brusatte! And I look forward to hearing more from this amazing young man!"
213,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"Off to a good start. I prefer to read pop-science books written by scientists, and Brusatte is a young vertebrate paleontologist at the Univ. of Edinburgh. Like all of us, he caught the dino bug when he was a kid. Unlike most, he made a career of it, and it's been an interesting one. Dino books are generally written by seniors, so it's fun to see one of the ""young guns"" take up the pen (or computer). Brusatte is an adequate writer, which is fine, since he's got some great stories to tell. And it's a great time for the field -- he says that lately, there's a new dino species described, on average, every week!The good quality continues, and I enjoyed the book, although I got dino-overload at times. He's a decent writer, but the prose gets purple, as in the Great Asteroid that (probably) killed off the dinosaurs (except for the birds!).

Just a heads-up for anyone who is thinking of getting the audio book.***I am doing the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge and this is where I need to start cheating a little bit. The cue ""Continental drift: Read a book set on every continent"" could mean you read ONE book that travels through all continents or SEVERAL books, one for each continent. Since I'm almost sure I won't be able to add six more books to my already ambitious summer TBR, I decided to give this one a go.

Much of what I learned as a child about the big lizards has since been refuted by new fossils, better analysis, and new research. Stephen Brusatte caught the dino bug when he was young and became a vertebrate paleontologist. His passion comes through loud and clear in this book, as he takes his readers from ancient history to the end of most dinosaurs on this planet, starting with the biggest mass extinction on this planet at the end of the Permian age; this die-off made way for some unusual reptiles with a different body plan than many of their peers that proved to be amazingly successful for these reptiles and their countless descendants for millennia afterwards through the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. Though I was already familiar with much that Brusatte covered, his writing style made the material approachable and easy to understand. There were not as many images as I would have liked; despite my familiarity with many of the creatures, it’s still hard to remember the little differences between similar individuals in a group, and more drawings would have been helpful.I particularly liked Brusatte's chapters on the Permian-Triassic transition, tyrannosaurs, birds, and the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous especially. I am a fan of theropods, and Brusatte is clearly a huge fan of the tyrannosaurids. He tended to wax a little melodramatic about these carnivorous dinosaurs, but then it's a little hard not to be in awe of such terrifying beings. (Especially the huge carnivorous members of this group.)This book was a good refresher on many points about dinosaurs, and the author's writing style and obvious enthusiasm for the subject made this an enjoyable read."

It's like wondering what might have happened if the archduke was never shot.The whole these-were-the-coolest-beings-that-ever-roamed-the-earth moniker has always made me a dino fan. The amazing variations of these huge oddballs have always been intriguing and this book does its best to piece everything together. Which is a very good thing, because there have been so many new discoveries and new theories since I was a child that I lost track of which was the coolest dino (welcome back, Brontosaurus).Steve Brusatte is one of the world's eminent paleontologists whose other books, especially Field Guide to Dinosaurs, have made me a fan of his writing and his obvious enthusiasm for his work. Here, he charts the very beginnings of the dinosaur, even before they evolved. He starts with the Permian Extinction, which eliminated 95% of life on earth. Somehow, some little things survived and that eventually led the way for the bigger things to arrive later on. Right off, his description of the Great Dying kept me glued to the pages as the volcanoes spewed forth lava mud and carbon dioxide. How anything managed to live through all of that is simply amazing.As the dinosaurs grew, the earth was also changing, with the continents moving toward their current locations and the environment becoming a bit nicer. Well, nicer like walking outside at noon during an Alabama summer. The dinosaurs became larger and larger and ruled the world until the day that nasty asteroid slammed into Earth. Then, Brusatte relates what it must have felt like to wake up that day as a dino, thinking you were just going about your business as usual. Nope. Any dinosaur too close to the impact was vaporised while the ones further away endured boiling hot hail, mammoth earthquakes, renewed lava flows, loss of sun, loss of trees, and ergo, loss of life. The dinosaurs didn't all die at once, he states, but probably over a few hundred or few thousand years. Given the fact that they had been around for millions of years, the dinosaur extinction was relatively quick.The book doesn't just end with the catastrophic impact but instead continues with the rise of the birds, our current dinosaurs. All very fascinating. While there are some b&w illustrations at the beginning of each chapter, the book is mostly text with various photos of fossils and the paleontologists who discovered the dino fossils. That's because this book is as much a tribute to the men and women who found those dragon bones as it is to the dinosaur. I deducted a star for the continuous focus on the author (we get it, Steve, you like dinosaurs and you go on lots of expeditions). So pretty good book, but it forced me to check out another library book (The Great Dinosaur Discoveries) so I could see the actual illustrations of what these big brutes would have looked like.That darn asteroid.Book Season = Year Round (looking at the finches with suspicion)"

It puts perspective on “our” life and “our” Earth and how we really don’t know it all. All we have are the few pieces of evidence of a life completely different from our own. I really appreciate all the researchers and paleontologists who put their time and energy, (and sometimes their life) into helping us better understand these eras and species long gone. The end really made me sad. Seeing these beautiful creatures end so abruptly (and in the way that it did) is such a shame. However, few of these creatures did leave their footprint to give future species, like us, proof and imagination of an insanely different time here on Earth. Just imagine all the things we don’t know because we don’t have proof, haven’t found it yet, or might have wrong. It’s surreal to think about. That said, I do wish the author talked less about the people who studied the fossils and more about the dinosaurs. I also wish he threw in more pictures of what he was explaining so I could get a picture of what he was discussing. I found myself with my phone in one hand and the book in the other, constantly looking up pictures of the dinosaurs he mentioned, the eras, and anything he named and just assumed the reader knew. "

I got to go through the same thing when my kids went through the phase as well and I got all caught up with things like Walking With Dinosaurs and its ilk. Which is all a round-about way of saying that I thought of myself as being fairly well-informed about paleontology, at least from a pop-science perspective.This book did an excellent job of bringing that pop-science overview of the field much more up-to-date. For instance, I was aware that paleontology in China had been going off with some really exciting discoveries, but I had no idea how key that has been to the overall understanding of dinosaur lineage. There also appears to be some fairly exciting new thinking about the origin of dinosaurs and the early period of the Triassic that I was entirely unaware of.In short, this is a great book for establishing an up-to-date popular science-level overview of the dinosaur element of paleontology, all made that much more engaging by a series of personal anecdotes from the author and his own career and interaction with his peers."

The rise and fall of the dinosaurs is an incredible story, of a time when giant beasts and other fantastic creatures made the world their own. They walked on the very ground below us, their fossils now entombed in rock – the clues that tell this story. To me, it's one of the greatest narratives in the history of our planet.
The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is thoroughly enjoyable pop science: author (and celebrated young paleontologist) Steve Brusatte uses his own learning journey to outline the exciting advances occurring today in his field (he calls this the “golden age” of paleontology, noting that new species of dinosaurs are discovered/described at the astounding rate of about one per week), and not only did I learn new and fascinating information from the deep history of our remarkable planet, but I found Brusatte's enthusiasm to be contagious. Who doesn't love dinosaurs? Totally accessible (but fact-filled) and balanced with personal stories (which I acknowledge might strain the patience of those of a more academic bent), it all worked for me.Early on, Brusatte – who is a Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Edinburgh – refers to his “ebullient, wildly animated lecturing style”, and for the purposes of this review, I'd rather demonstrate this ebullience than attempt to list everything that Brusatte taught me. On the sauropods whose tracks he studied on the Scottish Isle of Skye:
There's really no better way to say it: the sauropods that made their marks in that ancient Scottish lagoon were awesome creatures. Awesome in the literal sense of the word – impressive, daunting, inspiring awe. If I was handed a blank sheet of paper and pen and told to create a mythical beast, my imagination could never match what evolution created in sauropods.
Brusatte devotes plenty of breathless space to the Tyrannosaurus rex – including debunking what Jurassic Park got wrong about the apex predators (turns out that their eyesight was perfectly sharp, but they couldn't have outrun a jeep) – and writes, “The seat of Rex's power was its head. It was a killing machine, torture chamber for its prey, and an evil mask all in one.” And after having repeatedly referred to T. Rex arms as “sad” and “pathetic”, Brusatte shares new research that has determined, based on strong shoulder extensors and elbow flexors, the Rex used these “short but strong arms to hold down struggling prey while the jaws did their bone-crunching thing. The arms were accessories to murder.” Murder! The writing gets amped up when T. Rex meets its favourite meal:Triceratops, like its archnemesis T. rex, is a dinosaur icon. In films and documentaries, it usually plays the gentle, sympathetic plant-eater, the perfect dramatic foil to the Tyrant King. Sherlock versus Moriarty, Batman versus the Joker, Trike versus Rex. But it's not all movie magic; no, these two dinosaurs truly would have been rivals 66 million years ago...The King needed immense amounts of flesh to fuel its metabolism; its three-horned comrade was fourteen tons of slow-moving prime steak. You can figure out what happened next.So, you either enjoy a professor writing like a teenaged dino-fanboy, or you don't. Interspersed with the timeline of dinosaur evolution, Brusatte outlines the history of fossil hunting from the “Bone Wars” (which saw 19th-century rivals Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh sending out teams of mercenaries to hunt for bones for their individual glory; in the pursuit of which they weren't above stealing, lying, and sabotaging each other's sites) to the academics of today. In addition to referring to individuals as the “hot shots” or “rock stars” or the “Rat Pack” of paleontology, Brusatte proves that paleontologists just might be a special breed unto themselves. Barnum Brown, the first celebrity paleontologist at the turn of the twentieth century, prospected for dino bones in high summer “decked out in his fur coat with his pickaxe slung over his shoulder”. Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás – an adventurer, WWI spy, and the first paleobiologist – was a “flamboyant dandy and a tragic genius, whose exploits hunting dinosaurs in Transylvania were brief respites from the insanity of the rest of his life. Dracula, in all seriousness, has nothing on the Dinosaur Baron.” And as for Brusatte's modern day colleagues:Thomas Carr – my absinthe-drinking, Goth-dressing friend who studies T. rex – was with us on the expedition and was part of this team. Clad in khaki (it was far too hot for his usual all-black getup) and sucking down Gatorade by the gallon (absinthe was more of an indoor pursuit), he attacked the mudstones with his rock hammer (which he nicknamed Warrior) and his pickaxe (Warlord), exposing a number of new Triceratops bones.And working on the other side of the world in China, Brusatte describes another rising star:
Jingmai (O'Connor) calls herself a paleontologista – fitting given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia. A native of Southern California – half Irish, half-Chinese by blood – Jingmai is a Roman Candle of energy – delivering caustic one-liners one moment, speaking in eloquent paragraphs about politics the next, and then it's on to music or art or her own unique brand of Buddhist philosophy. Oh yes, and she’s also the world’s number-one expert on those first birds that broke the bounds of Earth to fly above their dinosaur ancestors.
And speaking of the first birds: as uncomfortable as I find this book's cover art – depicting a wispily feathered T. rex confronting wispily feathered prey dinos – that's a mental-shift I'll need to force myself to make: Brusatte makes the incontrovertible case that all true dinosaurs (not crocs or other proto-reptiles) were in a direct line to modern day birds and shared many of the same body features (flow-through lungs, wishbones, and yes, feathers; there's a paleontologist working today who can even determine the colours of their plumage). But, if I can mentally shift the T. rex from the upright Barney-the-dinosaur stance depicted in my youth to the balanced-forward pose accepted today, I suppose I can eventually re-imagine it covered in feathers. After all of the enthusiasm Brusatte displays for the rise and evolutionary success of the dinosaurs, the final chapter on their sudden demise is urgently and tragically related:It was the worst day in the history of our planet. A few hours of unimaginable violence that undid more than 150 million years of evolution and set life on a new course. T. rex was there to see it.An impact from a meteorite (or possibly comet), hitting with the force of “a billion nuclear bombs' worth of energy”, caused the near total extinction of the earth's most successful and widespread species (excepting, of course, for those dinosaurs who survived to evolve into what we think of as birds). The good news is that this catastrophic event paved the wave for the rise of the mammals, and us; the bad news is that we're no more special than the dinosaurs, and catastrophes – including those of our own making – can strike at any time. If you like your pop science poppy, this is an entertaining and informative read."
222,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Dinosaurs aren't a hard sell. People are just into them. I'm one of those people. In this book, Brusatte notes that his generation (which I'm a part of ~ thirtysomethings) were indelibly drawn to dinosaurs because of Jurassic Park. Of course, the interest preceded that film (umm, what about 1988's Land Before Time?), but it did solidify it!I've had this book since it came out in 2018 and knew I'd be reading it for this round of Science September. It's a great primer, a deep dive into modern #paleontology and evolutionary biology, with all the new fossils and species identifications.You come for the dinosaurs, and Brusatte's engaging storytelling and infectious enthusiasm for the subject keep you reading. He has what I can only describe as a ""folksy"" writing style, describing nearly every person in the book as 'the greatest paleontogist' or 'the nicest person you'll ever meet' (it's endearing, but it makes you wonder if it's all exactly true... Are they all this nice?) My favorite sections of the book were about dinosaur anatomy and biomechanics - the descriptions of their lungs and breathing patterns, and how this resembles modern birds' lungs, their bones' hollow structure, and their locomotion and moving speeds. How does a creature that weighs TONS pump blood? New and more complete #fossils have shown us how they moved, breathed, circulated blood, digested food, and how they looked (feathers! Even Tyrannosaurus Rex had feathers - not the plumage, but more likely quills and downy fuzz feathers). It's completely fascinating.This was a great companion piece with Peter Brannen's The Ends of the World that I read last week. There is overlap in topic of mass extinction after the asteroid hit, but Brusatte's book goes into more depth in the paleontology (and some anecdotes about cold calling Walter Alvarez for travel advice!) and the #evolution that led to the bird-dinosaurs we know today."
223,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Overall, a really interesting book & well laid out, but I floundered with all the odd names. A lot of that is my own ignorance & I think I would have enjoyed this more if I knew the names better. It's obvious that Brusatte lives & breathes this stuff & loves it. The narrator was excellent & conveyed Brusatte's enthusiasm well, but I glazed over from the terminology occasionally.It was a great trip, though. I learned not just about the evolution of dinosaurs, but about the other critters of the times, ones I'd often confused with them. He describes their rise very well & dispels many of the older ideas that I learned in school. For instance, he made sense of their feathers far better than anything else I've read on the subject which is admittedly little. In doing so, he shows why we didn't realize they had them for so long.Reconstructing the story of the dinosaurs is tough due to the time involved. Their reign ended 66 million years ago, but it was only about 50 years ago that we nailed down why. Fossils aren't common & many of the best sites were plundered by ignorant, greedy men. He shows how this was both good & bad. The interest in them led to money for expeditions that are expensive, hard, & time consuming, but we have many fossils that aren't properly cataloged or investigated as he shows through several discoveries made by students, including himself. New methods & tools have brought some amazing clarity.Definitely recommended in any format."
224,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070393-natch,2,"I'm not sure that I've ever been more disappointed in a book. I went into it thinking that it would be a basic-level summary of the evolution of dinosaurs and the world events that shaped them. Instead, the majority of the book (or so it seemed) was about the author's (and others) meetings and, occasionally, trips to find dinosaur bones. What made the book particularly insufferable (as others have mentioned previously) was that the author has to be in his thirties, at most (I didn't look it up), and, frankly, he doesn't possess any real critical insight of himself or others. As a consequence, the book does not start as you would expect - here's what the world looked like pre-dinosaur and here's what inhabited; it starts as an autobiography with the occasional dinosaur story thrown in. For example, his first story centers on going to Poland (if I remember correctly), getting off the train, and meeting a rather unfriendly looking guy...but, turns out, that guy was really friendly! And they found footprints! And wrote an article about it!...Oh, and the proto-dinosaurs were less like salamanders in their movements and more directional and we figured out what they probably looked like...but instead of a good description, here's a little photo and that's all. But it continues in this vein. Okay, next, the author went to Portugal. There, he met a dude who was the best at finding the fossils in the places he explored since childhood. Isn't that great? Isn't that guy brilliant? Just like the other paleontologists the author knows? Well, no. I grew up on a beach known to have plenty of fossilized shark teeth. I'm pretty good at finding shark teeth. So is every other person who grew up there or has lived there for a while and looks (cue certain little, old ladies). A visitor who shows up once for two weeks is going to be terrible compared to all us natives. The other thing that really bugged me was how everyone the author has ever met in the world of paleontology is ""brilliant"" or some equivalent...and there are several pages which are just lists of people and their specialties. I'm not sure how many paleontologists there are in the world, but I would guess that a fair number were listed in this book as ""brilliant."" I just don't think that's the case, unless paleontology is only populated by MENSA members. It really seemed like this book was more the autobiography of a dude in his thirties who happens to study dinosaurs and who thought to throw in some statements about dinosaurs. Disappointingly, those statements aren't always well thought out or explained. For example, the author talks about Pangea pretty early on, describing it as a single landmass stretching from the artic to antartic and centered on the equator with a desert spanning the equator so hostile to dinosaur-life that it was, essentially, a dinosaur-less. Yet, in the same breath says that on either side of that desert were dinosaurs in the early Triassic period. What he never seems to tell us is how those dinosaurs bypassed the desert to become distributed on both sides or whether dinosaurs evolved twice (one on each side) or what might have happened. I had to go on Wikipedia to look it up. Seriously. A history book should not require readers to resort to Wikipedia to explain what happened. (Dinosaurs appear to have been able to migrate past the desert areas, fyi).I ended up giving this book two stars because it does actually talk about dinosaurs a fair bit, albeit in a kinda rushed manner. And, I guess, I felt the talk of dinosaurs was colored by my perceptions of the protagonist of the story, the author himself. I'm a bit concerned by how much beer he drinks. There was more than one description of events being described as the best (the best conference, etc.) which seem to have been wholly related to the availability of alcohol and, in the case of Argentina, beef. Further, I'm a bit concerned about the author's relationship to women. He seems to revel in ribald jokes, as, I think, other commentators have mentioned, and seems to have a bit of a negative view of them. That might be okay for the character in a novel, but it's something that should be addressed in the world of real people. Those things really did color my feelings on this book and definitely contributed to the loss of a star. The other two were lost because of how much space seemed to be devoted to personal antedotes and urgings to read his other works rather than the story of dinosaurs. "

226,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Highway to Hell Creek; the discovery of the remnants of Jurassic park In this dazzling rehash, author Steve Brusatte tells the mesmerizing story of dinosaurs; their origins, evolution, diversity, habitats and their cataclysmic extinction. This is a captivating narrative that engages the reader till the end of the book. Highly readable and well researched that interest readers focused in ancient history this planet, dinosaurs, and life in late cretaceous era (100 – 66 million Years). The book describes immediate events after planet was hit by 6.5-mile-long asteroid (Chicxulub meteorite), at the speed of 67,000 miles per hour, 65.5 million years ago. The fossils from this event are preserved all over the planet, which gives a grim picture. It simply demonstrates that life on earth is susceptible to the wrath of nature. This was the sixth extinction of life in 4.5 billion history of the planet, and it was colossal, cosmic and catastrophic. How did life witness this? The author describes in detail as what may have happened immediately before and after the greatest hit in the recent history of our planet. Although this has been discussed on several TV shows on Nat Geo, Discovery, PBS and Science channels by geophysicists, astronomers and paleontologists, it is interesting to read from the point of a paleontologist who studies dinosaurs with passion. In fact, it is common in recent days to read about the discovery of new species of dinosaurs, birds and mammals from this event. One of the goldmines for finding the lost species is Hell Creek, Montana where treasure trove of fossils is preserved. It is a mixing of fossil carcasses and a layer of glass tektites from meteorite hit with impact impressions deposited minutes to hours after the apocalypse.The Hell Creek Formation in the Upper Great Plains of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were laid down by ancient rivers and streams as they traveled from the Rocky Mountains in the west toward the east before emptying into a large interior seaway that bisected North America during the latest Cretaceous period. Due to rise in sea-level in the Late Cretaceous, North America was bisected by a seaway stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. The states of NM, AZ, CO, SD, ND and MT were buried under water in a shallow sea that ran from Mexico to NW Canada. At that time the states of CA, OR, WA and ID were on the West and the rest of United States were on the east. The Hell Creek rocks preserve the remains of dinosaurs after Chicxulub meteorite struck into the ocean in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The death and destruction of the most iconic dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus Rex, the three horned dinosaur, Triceratops, the duckbilled dinosaur, Edmontosaurus, and the tank-like armored dinosaur, Ankylosaurus. The fossils also include; crocodiles, lizards, snakes, turtles, frogs, salamanders, fishes, plants and mammals. At this time, the planet was largely one supercontinent called Pangea, but it had started to split into several fragments. Europe and Asia were still globed together, and they were linked to North America by a series of islands. But what made these animals to become big? They had to eat and digest vast quantities of food, they had to grow fast, must be able to breathe very efficiently, and shed excess body heat. This process was enabled by their unique body plan that included a highly efficient lung more related to a birdlike lung because many bones of the chest cavity had big openings. There were many air sacs that extended throughout their body that helped lungs to take in enough oxygen to stoke their metabolism.During the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous, tyrannosaurs flourished, ruling the river valleys, lakeshores, flood­ plains, forests, and deserts of North America and China. Colossal tyrannosaurs never seemed to gain a foothold in Europe or the southern continents, where other groups of large predators prospered, but in North America and China, species of tyrannosaurs were unrivaled. They had become the transcendent terrors that fire our imaginations. The species of Tyrannosaurus Rex was not a global but existed only in North West of United States. On that fateful morning 66 million years ago, when a pack of T. Rexes woke up on what would go down as the final day of the Cretaceous Period, all seemed normal in their Hell Creek kingdom, the same as it had for two millions of years. Forests of conifers and ginkgoes stretched to the horizon, interspersed with palms and magnolias. The distant churn of a river, rushing eastward to empty into the great seaway that lapped against western North America. For the last several weeks, the more perceptive of the T. Rexes may have noticed a glowing orb in the sky, far off in the distance and a hazy ball also had a fiery rim. The orb would appear and disappear for hours. As it appeared again, it was bigger, its shine illuminating much of the sky to the southeast in a cloudy psychedelic mist. Then a flash. No noise, only a split-second flare of yellow that lit up the whole sky, disorienting the animals for a moment. As they blinked their eyes back to focus, they noticed that the orb was now gone. Moments later, and then they were blindsided. Another flash, but this one far more vengeful. The rays lit the morning air in a fireworks display and burned into their retinas. In fact, no noise at all. By now, the birds and flying raptors had stopped chirping, and silence hung over Hell Creek. The calm lasted for only a few seconds. Next, the ground beneath their feet started to rumble and shake, and then flew like waves; pulses of energy were shooting through the rocks and soil, the ground rising and falling as if a giant snake were slithering underneath. Everything not rooted into the dirt was thrown upward; then it crashed down, and then up and down again, the Earth's surface was acting like a trampoline. Everything within a radius of about six hundred miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of modern-day Mexico was annihilated, and vaporized. For several years, the Earth turned cold and dark because of soot, sulfur, sulfuric acid and rock dust in the atmosphere that blocked out the sun. The darkness brought severe winter for years that only the hardiest of animals could survive. The rains were highly acidic that wiped out much of marine species. Here and there, species of lizards, crocodiles, turtles, birds and rat-size mammals made it but with lots of duress under the fury of nature. Hell-Creek was turned to Hell that reverberated in rest of the world."

228,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,5,"Phew! A pop history on Dinosaurs written by a Paleantologist is enough to trigger your curiosity and awaken the science geek in you. However, you do worry about a Ross Geller level book you will be stuck with for ages. Stephen Brusatte is more Douglas Adams than Ross Geller and he tells a story that is at once engaging and enlightening. Imagine a huge jigsaw puzzle that has to pieced together. The challenge is that the pieces are found years apart and you have dedicated science heroes who try to make the best image possible with the pieces they have. And the frustration that lasts for decades when you realise there are missing pieces. That has been the story of piecing together the history of one of the most fascinating creatures that inhabited the earth.What Brusatte has done is not just laying out the facts (and theories) but also a tribute to all the paleontologists who have played a part in building the current understanding. Starting from the Permian period fossils through the Triassic age till the Jurassic and Cretaceous - the author paints a picture that is hard to ignore of complex foodchains, rise of apex predators and the entire evolution journey on fast forward. The journey is mapped through the work of paleontologists, geologists and collectors whose stories, quirks and anecdotes too are part of this book. The history of Dinosaurs cannot be narrated without the history of the planet and hence we get a lot of information on movement of continent, rise of oceans and rise of life in general.There is a chapter dedicated to Tyranosorus Rex (Tyrant King) which almost worships the larger than life (most lives, at least) predators. The author does not miss an opportunity to compare notes and point errata to the Jurassic Park movie, which is the introduction to most of us who are googling images today. The linkage to birds apart, the single mass extinction theory that brought an end to cretareous is more like the dominant theory that most paleantologists subscribe to. He actually describes a meeting of paleantologists in 2012 to discuss the validity of the theory where everyone agreed. This is only what we know.. so far.. A good book that presents facts actually allows you to understand the origin of popular theories without judging them - like the science of Phrenology which took off in the same period classifying human beings from different continents as different species. Today we grow uncomfortable knowing that gave grounds to Eugenics and later persecution of races in terms of superiority. Scientists are impervious to the implications of truth. The book makes you ask a lot more questions and for that reason alone, I loved it. A joyride!"

It was quite informative, especially for those, like me, who haven't been able to keep up with all of the findings in this subject for the last couple of decades. I think I liked this book because it was part memoir as well as science. The author has a sense of humor, and is only three years older than me, so his pop culture and generation comments were right on par. He does mention the film Jurassic Park several times, though usually to disprove some of their science. I only had one complaint: No color pictures! I was surprised how much this bugged me, but as the author described such beautiful landscapes of where he was digging, and then only provided a black and white photograph, the beauty was lost on me. I realize it's cheaper to publish without color photos, and paleontologists most likely don't make bank, but the author is the ""resident paleontologist for BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs"" so I think color photographs isn't too much to ask. The illustrations were lovely though, even if they portrayed the dinos with feathers...I guess I can't deny a lot of dinosaurs had feathers anymore since I've now read this. Dinosaurs just don't seem as cool with them.I will just mention that I have my own personal opinion on evolution. This book talks a lot about the evolution of dinosaurs. I am religious, which probably has a lot to do with it, but I never quite agreed fully with the author on this subject.Overall, I recommend it!2018 challenge: A book with an animal in the title"

Very well done. "
231,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike,1,"D’ya see that subtitle? “A New History of a Lost World”? It’s one of two things: 1) utter bullshit or 2) marketing spin (which amounts to the same thing as #1). There’s no new information in this book. However, it IS a new book, so... yeah. Bullshit marketing.There are some other reasons why I’m giving this a 1-star review. One of the biggest is Brusatte’s continued insistence on ascribing INTENT to evolution. What the actual fuck, dude? No, triceratops didn’t decide to grow horns. T. rex didn’t want to grow teeth. Mammals weren’t “craving” the opportunity to supplant the dinosaurs for 100 million years. If you’re going to imbue intelligent design to evolution then you are one bad week from assuming that an almighty god did it and that the Bible is literally correct.You are doing a disservice to everyone who reads this book, especially to every kid who does so, because you are saying chance doesn’t exist in natural selection and that every species decides what it wants to become. That’s woo-woo bullshit and utterly unscientific. Stop invoking intelligent design. Stop it.In my lifetime there have been a few things which have completely upended our understanding of dinosaurs. Bakker’s insistence that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. (The Dinosaur Heresies) Which now has a mountain of evidence supporting it. Alvarez’s discovery that an asteroid impact in the Yucatán killed off the dinosaurs. (T. Rex and the Crater of Doom) And most recently, Horner’s complete and utter decimation of the plethora of dinosaur species. (https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner...)Paleontologists at the time pushed back on all of these theories, but the first two are now widely accepted by pretty much everyone, because the ones who objected have died off. The latter has pissed off paleontologists because some of them have named these “new” species and Horner has effectively wiped away their claims to fame by asking a simple question: “Where are all the baby dinosaurs?” Brusatte doesn’t even address Horner’s theory, probably because he doesn’t agree with it. Except the evidence is compelling.Everyone knows Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law (“indistinguishable from magic”) but not as many are familiar with his First: “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.” Brusatte is in his early 30s, so he doesn’t have that excuse.There are other things in this book which are irksome but don’t rise to the level of anger, such as his constant descriptions of travel. I could not care less which trains he had to catch or the type of trucks he rode in. I guess that stuff was added for flavor, but it’s entirely beside the point 90% of the time. His descriptions of fellow fossil fiends is more on point because it shows the diversity of the (mostly male) dinosaur hunters, but there are quite a few women who play tertiary roles. That’s the one valuable aspect of this book. Minor, but it’s there.He does have a weird way of describing dinosaurs. Herbivores are “plant gobblers” while carnivores are “meat gobblers”. He did mix it up once by saying “plant munchers”, so yay for linguistic diversity. Hashtag sarcasm.You don’t need to read this book. Try those others I linked above. Watch that video."

This is very much for dino fans, very readable, but not super-strict on phrasing for best presentation of the science, not enough pictures of models of dinos.So, yeah, the bad: writes of evolutionary development as if it were intentional. Speaks of T.Rex and Triceratops as 'rivals.'* Too many scientific names of species I've never heard of for me to able to keep track w/out those missing pictures. Some awkward stretches for humor.The good: Once I got the hang of reading it w/out fretting that I wasn't keeping track of every species named, I found it very engaging. And, yes, enlightening. And Brusatte does teach something about science. For example he does admit that new finds may overturn current assumptions, and he does explain *how* a lot of stuff that is understood came to be figured out:""We can tell that Rex had some of the largest and most powerful jaw muscles of any dinosaur, based on the very broad and deep gullies on the skull bones where the muscles attached.""One species mentioned early I am going to google image search: Effigia okeeffeae....... and ""human-sized ominvorous theropods called oviraptororsaurs.""... and *The Age of Reptiles* mural.... balaur bondoc""Proper grasslands would not develop until... many tens of millions of years after the dinosaurs cleared out."" (I have to pick the nit of the word choice 'cleared.' Did dinosaurs prevent grass from evolving to become grasslands? I doubt it....)""The Gobi fossils tell us that the ancestors of birds got smart before they took to the skies."" Also got feathers, wings, and efficient lungs 'flow-through' lungs before that, too. ""The feathers of nonflying, winged dinosaurs were a rainbow of different colors..."" discovered from Jakob Vinther's studies of melanosomes, and probably used for display.Walter Alvarez is Luis Alvarez' son.Anyway, you can see that the good outweighs the bad.

I didn't realize that the Burpee, which is just down the road from me, has such a wide dinosaur history, despite the fact no significant fossils have been ever discovered in Illinois. I wish there'd been less about Brusatte through. The moments where it drifted into him nerding out about dinosaurs were weakened a bit when he name dropped. Certainly, those who've done work deserve credit, but doing so in context to how you know that person or have worked with them leans a bit too hard on the ""look at how I've rubbed elbows with famous people"" side.

Anywho, this was a fascinating glimpse into the quickly changing and fast-paced world of paleontology and geology, which were not the dead-end jobs that I grew up being told (""You'll never get a job studying dinosaurs"" they said, so I...never did—also I was never super duper fascinated by dinosaurs and the past because that kitchen scene scared the living shit out of me, so), but are vibrant and growing and uncovering more and more history-altering discoveries each month. It's fascinating and incredible what new discoveries, technology and modern analytics can do—and the brilliant minds that are dedicated to understanding the mysteries of the past.This entire book was amazing, particularly when understanding the billions of years of life that came before humans—and the chain of events that led to humans being able to become the apex predators instead of the vicious T-Rex, who was cut down at the height of its reign (and who had great eyesight and could not outrun a Jeep and could totally crush a car in half with its jaws, so thank you for giving me a false sense of security, Jurassic Park). Additionally, earlier periods of dinosaurs and non-dinosaurs were covered, particularly the evolution of crocodiles (who were scary AF) and also birds.Spoiler alert: birds are dinosaurs.Double spoiler alert: that meteorite did end the dinosaur's reign.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was clearly written, and while repetitive at times it clearly illustrated the vast biodiversity of Earth's history and how various climate changes and environments influence what flourishes were and how simple changes can have dramatic effects in various ecosystems.Definitely a must-read if you want to learn more about dinosaurs and the prehistoric Earth but don't know where to start.But, since dinosaurs are (mostly) extinct, all we can do is attempt to recreate the past:"
237,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I listened to this audiobook during one of my many long drives this last week, and I really enjoyed it, despite some annoying flaws. As y'all may be aware, I love me some nonfiction these days, and when it's well-written and accessible and brings the information being conveyed to the reader (or listener) in an entertaining way, so much the better. History, science, technology, sociology, whatever, I'm into it. This book ticked some of the boxes, but not as many as I'd have wanted. I enjoyed the information being presented, but not the method of presentation, if that makes sense. Lemme elaborate. Stephen Brusatte is definitely a dino-nerd. And I say this with the utmost respect. You can tell that he's excited and passionate about learning about dinosaurs, how they came to exist, and how they came to no longer exist. His writing is well-informed, interesting, and he knows his stuff, and presents his facts and supporting arguments well, whether it's the cause of the extinction event that cause the dinosaurs to become ""extinct"", or the argument that modern day birds ARE dinosaurs and therefore not all dinosaurs are extinct after all. They've just evolved. But, a bit of that gets lost in the overwhelming amount of hard to follow scientific species names and tidbit detail, and there was a lot of it. Discovery of new fossils, the qualities and criteria for distinguishing it as a Bellusaurus vs a Barosaurus vs a Barapasaurus vs a Brachiosaurus... etc. I think, even had I read this in print, this amount of quick-fire detail wouldn't work well, but in audio, it was just overwhelming. I ended up listening to this book MUCH MUCH slower than I usually listen to audiobooks, just to try to follow along and track the myriad dinos and their traits. But then, we come to the Spotlight Sections. Where we spend a lot of time focusing on one dinosaur (or idea) and examining it in detail. Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course, was the dinosaur, because it's everyone's favorite. I did learn quite a bit about them, and it was good information and fascinating stuff, but I wish that there were more sections of detail rather than a few of them interspersed within the general overview jam packed with rapid-fire facts. Then we have the humans. I actually feel a little bit bad about the annoyance I felt about this, but I did feel it, so there it is. Whenever Brusatte would introduce a new human into the story, whether they found one dinosaur bone in their backyard or have found millions of them around the globe, we got as much of their life story as possible in their intro. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in their expertise and why I should trust them and their conclusions, but do I really need to know that they enjoy kayaking? Not really. Let's keep it relevant. Finally, there was the reader. Holy moly, dude, take a BREATH. I feel like this guy was on a deadline to spit this book out. I had SUCH a hard time finding places to pause, because he literally never did. Even between chapters, a pause that might usually go for 2-3 seconds was MAYBE a 1 second pause here. I was NEVER quick enough to pause at the end of a section or chapter without cutting it off mid-word as he started the next section. It was crazy. And this while listening to this at a SLOWER speed than I normally do. O_OBut those complaints aside, this really was a fascinating, informative, and entertaining look at dinosaurs and their history. And their modernity. I loved the science and methodology of the discovery and determination of fossils and how they went about piecing together the lives that these animals would have lived. It really was very well researched, and I love reading books by people who are truly passionate and excited about their work. It does show. I do just wish that it was maybe presented in a little bit more measured of a way so that the reader can really absorb the massive amount of information here. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in dinosaurs, or earth's or life's history at all. There are lessons here about so much more than just dinosaurs, but about time and change and impermanence, but also about resilience and tenacity. The section about the extinction event that wiped out most of the species of life on the planet was harrowing and nerve-wracking, and I'm experiencing it from millions and millions of years removed from the actual event. Such was Brusatte's skill at delving into the detail and bringing the story to life. I was heartbroken for these animals that have been dead for millennia. It was a stark reminder that nothing at all guarantees our time on this rock, but that maybe something new and interesting can be given an opportunity to spring up in our place. "
238,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,2,"This could have been good. Maybe. If the author had stuck to dinosaurs which he didn't when he basically had to mention every person he has ever met in paleontology or has touched paleontology in some way. The first few chapters were definitely full of name dropping, mostly of male paleontologists. Female paleontologists were mentioned only if they were married to another paleontologist or just had their work mentioned while the men got full page biographies and accolades (and the overuse of certain adjectives). I do have to point out one female paleontologist did get a bit more of an introduction but she gets mentioned and then ignored. I know science , in certain fields, can still be male dominated but this felt more like blatant sexism by the author. I mean, the men get full page biographies, their work is highlighted, their connections to others in the field are highlighted, they get treated with respect and admiration. The women are pointed out in relation to their husbands (if married) and might get a sentence about their work. Or just a sentence about their work if they're not married. If these women's work hadn't impacted his own, I don't think the author would have mentioned them at all.The writing and organization are all over the place. This was supposed to be a history of the dinosaurs but this was more a biography of the author's work. And a lot of the material just didn't feel like it was really new and I'm not big into dinosaurs but I knew a lot already. And I haven't read anything on dinosaurs since elementary school, I think. There were times when there should have been less detail and times when there should have been more detail. The few middle chapters did seem to improve (more dinosaurs, less author self-promotion) but it never really got good. I also felt the author didn't seem to know who he was writing for, who his audience was supposed to be. Things were all over the place. This has potential but never seemed to get off the ground. Not worth reading."
239,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"Steve Brusatte really likes dinosaurs and prospecting for fossils and analyzing dinosaur history. And he is able to communicate that love really well. I enjoyed this book a lot. Brusatte presents the current state of dinosaur knowledge (Note: Spielberg had a lot of it wrong.) and brings it to life. Not just the dinosaurs themselves, but the many dedicated researchers who have made all these discoveries. The writing is lucid and accessible to the non-scientist. Okay, occasionally all the Latin names for different species cause a little eye-glazing, but it's not necessary to remember them to absorb the sense of the text. The description of the day the asteroid hit is especially vivid. And the explanations of evolution as reflected in the dinosaurs were very clear and helpful. I think Brusatte must be an excellent teacher. "

There have been amazing breakthroughs in our knowledge regarding dinosaurs; and with the advent of grandsons, it was clearly time for me to ‘up my game’!Brusatte has written a highly readable account of those new advances. He is an enthusiastic fossil hunter that takes the reader around the world from Georgia O’Keefe’s Ghost Ranch “bursting with dinosaur bones”; to Hell Creek, Montana—a Triceratops graveyard; to China and its plethora of feather-covered fossils; and to Italy where a thin layer of iridium indicates that an asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago.I admit that I enjoy reading about how paleontologists have determined that dinosaurs had feathers; that they were colored, and likely proved to be advantageous in attracting mates. And those dinosaurs that later became birds may have first used wing action to attract more attention, and just stumbled upon how wing action could result in gliding and eventually flying. It just takes a few millennia to make it happen.The number of new discoveries regarding dinosaurs over the past twenty years is mind-boggling. I look forward to learning more in the next twenty. Recommend."

Gives a really vivid picture of the Mesozoic world and its creatures as moving, eating, breeding things. Some great history of the science too, if a bit laddish at points in the insistent ""hey we drink beer we definitely aren't nerds"". I don't know whether at this point in human history it's comfortable or not to reflect that the earth has seen multiple animal kingdoms wiped out when soaring carbon dioxide turned the atmosphere into an oven. There's a kind of comfort in looking at it from a cosmic level, I guess? "
242,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,5,"This was a book I HAD to read--to catch up on the subject I obsessed so much about in elementary school-Dinosaurs! When I was a kid I read every book on dinosaurs that I could find in my local library and my parents bought me even more books--and I was thrilled no end to go to the nearby Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago! but that was in the 60s and I thought we knew everything there was to know about the big guys. They were slow, brainless giants doomed to extinction so that the way could be cleared for The Rise of Man. But, as paleontologist Steve Brusatte points out, at the end of the 60s and going into the 70s, a new paradigm took shape, in which dinosaurs have been viewed as active, even energetic, animals, some being social and intelligent. Rather than doomed to failure, they were among the most successful animals for over 150 million years. If it had not been for what Brusatte calls ""the worst day in the history of our planet,"" when the asteroid (or comet) hit 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs would still dominate the Earth. The good news is that the dinos did not completely die out. I see some flitting about my bird feeder even as I type this. The birds are now classified as dinosaurs, as theropods, related to T-rex and velociraptors. For me, the most interesting part of the book (as a bird-lover) is his discussing the origin and evolution of the birds (and feathers!). I'm so glad they escaped the Cretaceous (Fifth) Extinction Event, but it's an open question whether they can escape the current or Sixth Extinction Event... I enjoyed this narrative greatly because not only does Steve share his passion with the reader (he's one guy who sure does love his job!) but he relates his experiences taking part in expeditions around the globe. This does seem to be a golden age of discovery of dinosaurs--and I missed it! BUT at least I can read about it. Thanks, Steve Brusatte! And I look forward to hearing more from this amazing young man!"
243,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"Off to a good start. I prefer to read pop-science books written by scientists, and Brusatte is a young vertebrate paleontologist at the Univ. of Edinburgh. Like all of us, he caught the dino bug when he was a kid. Unlike most, he made a career of it, and it's been an interesting one. Dino books are generally written by seniors, so it's fun to see one of the ""young guns"" take up the pen (or computer). Brusatte is an adequate writer, which is fine, since he's got some great stories to tell. And it's a great time for the field -- he says that lately, there's a new dino species described, on average, every week!The good quality continues, and I enjoyed the book, although I got dino-overload at times. He's a decent writer, but the prose gets purple, as in the Great Asteroid that (probably) killed off the dinosaurs (except for the birds!). His science is up-to-date, and I recommend the book, especially for dinosaur fans. 3.8 stars.Here's a nice sample, that is (I think) pretty much a chapter in the book:https://www.scientificamerican.com/ar..."

All those dinosaur and animal names and descriptions without pictures to refer to can get a bit confusing, especially when you're not listening in your native language... Obviously, this was completely my own fault, so I'm not critising the book here. Just a heads-up for anyone who is thinking of getting the audio book.***I am doing the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge and this is where I need to start cheating a little bit. The cue ""Continental drift: Read a book set on every continent"" could mean you read ONE book that travels through all continents or SEVERAL books, one for each continent. Since I'm almost sure I won't be able to add six more books to my already ambitious summer TBR, I decided to give this one a go. I mean, the supercontinent Pangea did incorporate most 0f Earth's landmasses at one point. And dinosaurs are just cool."
245,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"I caught the dino bug when I was probably seven years old, and have never stopped being utterly entranced by these amazing creatures. Much of what I learned as a child about the big lizards has since been refuted by new fossils, better analysis, and new research. Stephen Brusatte caught the dino bug when he was young and became a vertebrate paleontologist. His passion comes through loud and clear in this book, as he takes his readers from ancient history to the end of most dinosaurs on this planet, starting with the biggest mass extinction on this planet at the end of the Permian age; this die-off made way for some unusual reptiles with a different body plan than many of their peers that proved to be amazingly successful for these reptiles and their countless descendants for millennia afterwards through the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. Though I was already familiar with much that Brusatte covered, his writing style made the material approachable and easy to understand. There were not as many images as I would have liked; despite my familiarity with many of the creatures, it’s still hard to remember the little differences between similar individuals in a group, and more drawings would have been helpful.I particularly liked Brusatte's chapters on the Permian-Triassic transition, tyrannosaurs, birds, and the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous especially. I am a fan of theropods, and Brusatte is clearly a huge fan of the tyrannosaurids. He tended to wax a little melodramatic about these carnivorous dinosaurs, but then it's a little hard not to be in awe of such terrifying beings. (Especially the huge carnivorous members of this group.)This book was a good refresher on many points about dinosaurs, and the author's writing style and obvious enthusiasm for the subject made this an enjoyable read."

It's like wondering what might have happened if the archduke was never shot.The whole these-were-the-coolest-beings-that-ever-roamed-the-earth moniker has always made me a dino fan. The amazing variations of these huge oddballs have always been intriguing and this book does its best to piece everything together. Which is a very good thing, because there have been so many new discoveries and new theories since I was a child that I lost track of which was the coolest dino (welcome back, Brontosaurus).Steve Brusatte is one of the world's eminent paleontologists whose other books, especially Field Guide to Dinosaurs, have made me a fan of his writing and his obvious enthusiasm for his work. Here, he charts the very beginnings of the dinosaur, even before they evolved. He starts with the Permian Extinction, which eliminated 95% of life on earth. Somehow, some little things survived and that eventually led the way for the bigger things to arrive later on. Right off, his description of the Great Dying kept me glued to the pages as the volcanoes spewed forth lava mud and carbon dioxide. How anything managed to live through all of that is simply amazing.As the dinosaurs grew, the earth was also changing, with the continents moving toward their current locations and the environment becoming a bit nicer. Well, nicer like walking outside at noon during an Alabama summer. The dinosaurs became larger and larger and ruled the world until the day that nasty asteroid slammed into Earth. Then, Brusatte relates what it must have felt like to wake up that day as a dino, thinking you were just going about your business as usual. Nope. Any dinosaur too close to the impact was vaporised while the ones further away endured boiling hot hail, mammoth earthquakes, renewed lava flows, loss of sun, loss of trees, and ergo, loss of life. The dinosaurs didn't all die at once, he states, but probably over a few hundred or few thousand years. Given the fact that they had been around for millions of years, the dinosaur extinction was relatively quick.The book doesn't just end with the catastrophic impact but instead continues with the rise of the birds, our current dinosaurs. All very fascinating. While there are some b&w illustrations at the beginning of each chapter, the book is mostly text with various photos of fossils and the paleontologists who discovered the dino fossils. That's because this book is as much a tribute to the men and women who found those dragon bones as it is to the dinosaur. I deducted a star for the continuous focus on the author (we get it, Steve, you like dinosaurs and you go on lots of expeditions). So pretty good book, but it forced me to check out another library book (The Great Dinosaur Discoveries) so I could see the actual illustrations of what these big brutes would have looked like.That darn asteroid.Book Season = Year Round (looking at the finches with suspicion)"

It puts perspective on “our” life and “our” Earth and how we really don’t know it all. All we have are the few pieces of evidence of a life completely different from our own. I really appreciate all the researchers and paleontologists who put their time and energy, (and sometimes their life) into helping us better understand these eras and species long gone. The end really made me sad. Seeing these beautiful creatures end so abruptly (and in the way that it did) is such a shame. However, few of these creatures did leave their footprint to give future species, like us, proof and imagination of an insanely different time here on Earth. Just imagine all the things we don’t know because we don’t have proof, haven’t found it yet, or might have wrong. It’s surreal to think about. That said, I do wish the author talked less about the people who studied the fossils and more about the dinosaurs. I also wish he threw in more pictures of what he was explaining so I could get a picture of what he was discussing. I found myself with my phone in one hand and the book in the other, constantly looking up pictures of the dinosaurs he mentioned, the eras, and anything he named and just assumed the reader knew. "

I got to go through the same thing when my kids went through the phase as well and I got all caught up with things like Walking With Dinosaurs and its ilk. Which is all a round-about way of saying that I thought of myself as being fairly well-informed about paleontology, at least from a pop-science perspective.This book did an excellent job of bringing that pop-science overview of the field much more up-to-date. For instance, I was aware that paleontology in China had been going off with some really exciting discoveries, but I had no idea how key that has been to the overall understanding of dinosaur lineage. There also appears to be some fairly exciting new thinking about the origin of dinosaurs and the early period of the Triassic that I was entirely unaware of.In short, this is a great book for establishing an up-to-date popular science-level overview of the dinosaur element of paleontology, all made that much more engaging by a series of personal anecdotes from the author and his own career and interaction with his peers."

The rise and fall of the dinosaurs is an incredible story, of a time when giant beasts and other fantastic creatures made the world their own. They walked on the very ground below us, their fossils now entombed in rock – the clues that tell this story. To me, it's one of the greatest narratives in the history of our planet.
The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is thoroughly enjoyable pop science: author (and celebrated young paleontologist) Steve Brusatte uses his own learning journey to outline the exciting advances occurring today in his field (he calls this the “golden age” of paleontology, noting that new species of dinosaurs are discovered/described at the astounding rate of about one per week), and not only did I learn new and fascinating information from the deep history of our remarkable planet, but I found Brusatte's enthusiasm to be contagious. Who doesn't love dinosaurs? Totally accessible (but fact-filled) and balanced with personal stories (which I acknowledge might strain the patience of those of a more academic bent), it all worked for me.Early on, Brusatte – who is a Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Edinburgh – refers to his “ebullient, wildly animated lecturing style”, and for the purposes of this review, I'd rather demonstrate this ebullience than attempt to list everything that Brusatte taught me. On the sauropods whose tracks he studied on the Scottish Isle of Skye:
There's really no better way to say it: the sauropods that made their marks in that ancient Scottish lagoon were awesome creatures. Awesome in the literal sense of the word – impressive, daunting, inspiring awe. If I was handed a blank sheet of paper and pen and told to create a mythical beast, my imagination could never match what evolution created in sauropods.
Brusatte devotes plenty of breathless space to the Tyrannosaurus rex – including debunking what Jurassic Park got wrong about the apex predators (turns out that their eyesight was perfectly sharp, but they couldn't have outrun a jeep) – and writes, “The seat of Rex's power was its head. It was a killing machine, torture chamber for its prey, and an evil mask all in one.” And after having repeatedly referred to T. Rex arms as “sad” and “pathetic”, Brusatte shares new research that has determined, based on strong shoulder extensors and elbow flexors, the Rex used these “short but strong arms to hold down struggling prey while the jaws did their bone-crunching thing. The arms were accessories to murder.” Murder! The writing gets amped up when T. Rex meets its favourite meal:Triceratops, like its archnemesis T. rex, is a dinosaur icon. In films and documentaries, it usually plays the gentle, sympathetic plant-eater, the perfect dramatic foil to the Tyrant King. Sherlock versus Moriarty, Batman versus the Joker, Trike versus Rex. But it's not all movie magic; no, these two dinosaurs truly would have been rivals 66 million years ago...The King needed immense amounts of flesh to fuel its metabolism; its three-horned comrade was fourteen tons of slow-moving prime steak. You can figure out what happened next.So, you either enjoy a professor writing like a teenaged dino-fanboy, or you don't. Interspersed with the timeline of dinosaur evolution, Brusatte outlines the history of fossil hunting from the “Bone Wars” (which saw 19th-century rivals Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh sending out teams of mercenaries to hunt for bones for their individual glory; in the pursuit of which they weren't above stealing, lying, and sabotaging each other's sites) to the academics of today. In addition to referring to individuals as the “hot shots” or “rock stars” or the “Rat Pack” of paleontology, Brusatte proves that paleontologists just might be a special breed unto themselves. Barnum Brown, the first celebrity paleontologist at the turn of the twentieth century, prospected for dino bones in high summer “decked out in his fur coat with his pickaxe slung over his shoulder”. Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás – an adventurer, WWI spy, and the first paleobiologist – was a “flamboyant dandy and a tragic genius, whose exploits hunting dinosaurs in Transylvania were brief respites from the insanity of the rest of his life. Dracula, in all seriousness, has nothing on the Dinosaur Baron.” And as for Brusatte's modern day colleagues:Thomas Carr – my absinthe-drinking, Goth-dressing friend who studies T. rex – was with us on the expedition and was part of this team. Clad in khaki (it was far too hot for his usual all-black getup) and sucking down Gatorade by the gallon (absinthe was more of an indoor pursuit), he attacked the mudstones with his rock hammer (which he nicknamed Warrior) and his pickaxe (Warlord), exposing a number of new Triceratops bones.And working on the other side of the world in China, Brusatte describes another rising star:
Jingmai (O'Connor) calls herself a paleontologista – fitting given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia. A native of Southern California – half Irish, half-Chinese by blood – Jingmai is a Roman Candle of energy – delivering caustic one-liners one moment, speaking in eloquent paragraphs about politics the next, and then it's on to music or art or her own unique brand of Buddhist philosophy. Oh yes, and she’s also the world’s number-one expert on those first birds that broke the bounds of Earth to fly above their dinosaur ancestors.
And speaking of the first birds: as uncomfortable as I find this book's cover art – depicting a wispily feathered T. rex confronting wispily feathered prey dinos – that's a mental-shift I'll need to force myself to make: Brusatte makes the incontrovertible case that all true dinosaurs (not crocs or other proto-reptiles) were in a direct line to modern day birds and shared many of the same body features (flow-through lungs, wishbones, and yes, feathers; there's a paleontologist working today who can even determine the colours of their plumage). But, if I can mentally shift the T. rex from the upright Barney-the-dinosaur stance depicted in my youth to the balanced-forward pose accepted today, I suppose I can eventually re-imagine it covered in feathers. After all of the enthusiasm Brusatte displays for the rise and evolutionary success of the dinosaurs, the final chapter on their sudden demise is urgently and tragically related:It was the worst day in the history of our planet. A few hours of unimaginable violence that undid more than 150 million years of evolution and set life on a new course. T. rex was there to see it.An impact from a meteorite (or possibly comet), hitting with the force of “a billion nuclear bombs' worth of energy”, caused the near total extinction of the earth's most successful and widespread species (excepting, of course, for those dinosaurs who survived to evolve into what we think of as birds). The good news is that this catastrophic event paved the wave for the rise of the mammals, and us; the bad news is that we're no more special than the dinosaurs, and catastrophes – including those of our own making – can strike at any time. If you like your pop science poppy, this is an entertaining and informative read."
252,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Dinosaurs aren't a hard sell. People are just into them. I'm one of those people. In this book, Brusatte notes that his generation (which I'm a part of ~ thirtysomethings) were indelibly drawn to dinosaurs because of Jurassic Park. Of course, the interest preceded that film (umm, what about 1988's Land Before Time?), but it did solidify it!I've had this book since it came out in 2018 and knew I'd be reading it for this round of Science September. It's a great primer, a deep dive into modern #paleontology and evolutionary biology, with all the new fossils and species identifications.You come for the dinosaurs, and Brusatte's engaging storytelling and infectious enthusiasm for the subject keep you reading. He has what I can only describe as a ""folksy"" writing style, describing nearly every person in the book as 'the greatest paleontogist' or 'the nicest person you'll ever meet' (it's endearing, but it makes you wonder if it's all exactly true... Are they all this nice?) My favorite sections of the book were about dinosaur anatomy and biomechanics - the descriptions of their lungs and breathing patterns, and how this resembles modern birds' lungs, their bones' hollow structure, and their locomotion and moving speeds. How does a creature that weighs TONS pump blood? New and more complete #fossils have shown us how they moved, breathed, circulated blood, digested food, and how they looked (feathers! Even Tyrannosaurus Rex had feathers - not the plumage, but more likely quills and downy fuzz feathers). It's completely fascinating.This was a great companion piece with Peter Brannen's The Ends of the World that I read last week. There is overlap in topic of mass extinction after the asteroid hit, but Brusatte's book goes into more depth in the paleontology (and some anecdotes about cold calling Walter Alvarez for travel advice!) and the #evolution that led to the bird-dinosaurs we know today."
253,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Overall, a really interesting book & well laid out, but I floundered with all the odd names. A lot of that is my own ignorance & I think I would have enjoyed this more if I knew the names better. It's obvious that Brusatte lives & breathes this stuff & loves it. The narrator was excellent & conveyed Brusatte's enthusiasm well, but I glazed over from the terminology occasionally.It was a great trip, though. I learned not just about the evolution of dinosaurs, but about the other critters of the times, ones I'd often confused with them. He describes their rise very well & dispels many of the older ideas that I learned in school. For instance, he made sense of their feathers far better than anything else I've read on the subject which is admittedly little. In doing so, he shows why we didn't realize they had them for so long.Reconstructing the story of the dinosaurs is tough due to the time involved. Their reign ended 66 million years ago, but it was only about 50 years ago that we nailed down why. Fossils aren't common & many of the best sites were plundered by ignorant, greedy men. He shows how this was both good & bad. The interest in them led to money for expeditions that are expensive, hard, & time consuming, but we have many fossils that aren't properly cataloged or investigated as he shows through several discoveries made by students, including himself. New methods & tools have brought some amazing clarity.Definitely recommended in any format."
254,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070393-natch,2,"I'm not sure that I've ever been more disappointed in a book. I went into it thinking that it would be a basic-level summary of the evolution of dinosaurs and the world events that shaped them. Instead, the majority of the book (or so it seemed) was about the author's (and others) meetings and, occasionally, trips to find dinosaur bones. What made the book particularly insufferable (as others have mentioned previously) was that the author has to be in his thirties, at most (I didn't look it up), and, frankly, he doesn't possess any real critical insight of himself or others. As a consequence, the book does not start as you would expect - here's what the world looked like pre-dinosaur and here's what inhabited; it starts as an autobiography with the occasional dinosaur story thrown in. For example, his first story centers on going to Poland (if I remember correctly), getting off the train, and meeting a rather unfriendly looking guy...but, turns out, that guy was really friendly! And they found footprints! And wrote an article about it!...Oh, and the proto-dinosaurs were less like salamanders in their movements and more directional and we figured out what they probably looked like...but instead of a good description, here's a little photo and that's all. But it continues in this vein. Okay, next, the author went to Portugal. There, he met a dude who was the best at finding the fossils in the places he explored since childhood. Isn't that great? Isn't that guy brilliant? Just like the other paleontologists the author knows? Well, no. I grew up on a beach known to have plenty of fossilized shark teeth. I'm pretty good at finding shark teeth. So is every other person who grew up there or has lived there for a while and looks (cue certain little, old ladies). A visitor who shows up once for two weeks is going to be terrible compared to all us natives. The other thing that really bugged me was how everyone the author has ever met in the world of paleontology is ""brilliant"" or some equivalent...and there are several pages which are just lists of people and their specialties. I'm not sure how many paleontologists there are in the world, but I would guess that a fair number were listed in this book as ""brilliant."" I just don't think that's the case, unless paleontology is only populated by MENSA members. It really seemed like this book was more the autobiography of a dude in his thirties who happens to study dinosaurs and who thought to throw in some statements about dinosaurs. Disappointingly, those statements aren't always well thought out or explained. For example, the author talks about Pangea pretty early on, describing it as a single landmass stretching from the artic to antartic and centered on the equator with a desert spanning the equator so hostile to dinosaur-life that it was, essentially, a dinosaur-less. Yet, in the same breath says that on either side of that desert were dinosaurs in the early Triassic period. What he never seems to tell us is how those dinosaurs bypassed the desert to become distributed on both sides or whether dinosaurs evolved twice (one on each side) or what might have happened. I had to go on Wikipedia to look it up. Seriously. A history book should not require readers to resort to Wikipedia to explain what happened. (Dinosaurs appear to have been able to migrate past the desert areas, fyi).I ended up giving this book two stars because it does actually talk about dinosaurs a fair bit, albeit in a kinda rushed manner. And, I guess, I felt the talk of dinosaurs was colored by my perceptions of the protagonist of the story, the author himself. I'm a bit concerned by how much beer he drinks. There was more than one description of events being described as the best (the best conference, etc.) which seem to have been wholly related to the availability of alcohol and, in the case of Argentina, beef. Further, I'm a bit concerned about the author's relationship to women. He seems to revel in ribald jokes, as, I think, other commentators have mentioned, and seems to have a bit of a negative view of them. That might be okay for the character in a novel, but it's something that should be addressed in the world of real people. Those things really did color my feelings on this book and definitely contributed to the loss of a star. The other two were lost because of how much space seemed to be devoted to personal antedotes and urgings to read his other works rather than the story of dinosaurs. "

256,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Highway to Hell Creek; the discovery of the remnants of Jurassic park In this dazzling rehash, author Steve Brusatte tells the mesmerizing story of dinosaurs; their origins, evolution, diversity, habitats and their cataclysmic extinction. This is a captivating narrative that engages the reader till the end of the book. Highly readable and well researched that interest readers focused in ancient history this planet, dinosaurs, and life in late cretaceous era (100 – 66 million Years). The book describes immediate events after planet was hit by 6.5-mile-long asteroid (Chicxulub meteorite), at the speed of 67,000 miles per hour, 65.5 million years ago. The fossils from this event are preserved all over the planet, which gives a grim picture. It simply demonstrates that life on earth is susceptible to the wrath of nature. This was the sixth extinction of life in 4.5 billion history of the planet, and it was colossal, cosmic and catastrophic. How did life witness this? The author describes in detail as what may have happened immediately before and after the greatest hit in the recent history of our planet. Although this has been discussed on several TV shows on Nat Geo, Discovery, PBS and Science channels by geophysicists, astronomers and paleontologists, it is interesting to read from the point of a paleontologist who studies dinosaurs with passion. In fact, it is common in recent days to read about the discovery of new species of dinosaurs, birds and mammals from this event. One of the goldmines for finding the lost species is Hell Creek, Montana where treasure trove of fossils is preserved. It is a mixing of fossil carcasses and a layer of glass tektites from meteorite hit with impact impressions deposited minutes to hours after the apocalypse.The Hell Creek Formation in the Upper Great Plains of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were laid down by ancient rivers and streams as they traveled from the Rocky Mountains in the west toward the east before emptying into a large interior seaway that bisected North America during the latest Cretaceous period. Due to rise in sea-level in the Late Cretaceous, North America was bisected by a seaway stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. The states of NM, AZ, CO, SD, ND and MT were buried under water in a shallow sea that ran from Mexico to NW Canada. At that time the states of CA, OR, WA and ID were on the West and the rest of United States were on the east. The Hell Creek rocks preserve the remains of dinosaurs after Chicxulub meteorite struck into the ocean in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The death and destruction of the most iconic dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus Rex, the three horned dinosaur, Triceratops, the duckbilled dinosaur, Edmontosaurus, and the tank-like armored dinosaur, Ankylosaurus. The fossils also include; crocodiles, lizards, snakes, turtles, frogs, salamanders, fishes, plants and mammals. At this time, the planet was largely one supercontinent called Pangea, but it had started to split into several fragments. Europe and Asia were still globed together, and they were linked to North America by a series of islands. But what made these animals to become big? They had to eat and digest vast quantities of food, they had to grow fast, must be able to breathe very efficiently, and shed excess body heat. This process was enabled by their unique body plan that included a highly efficient lung more related to a birdlike lung because many bones of the chest cavity had big openings. There were many air sacs that extended throughout their body that helped lungs to take in enough oxygen to stoke their metabolism.During the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous, tyrannosaurs flourished, ruling the river valleys, lakeshores, flood­ plains, forests, and deserts of North America and China. Colossal tyrannosaurs never seemed to gain a foothold in Europe or the southern continents, where other groups of large predators prospered, but in North America and China, species of tyrannosaurs were unrivaled. They had become the transcendent terrors that fire our imaginations. The species of Tyrannosaurus Rex was not a global but existed only in North West of United States. On that fateful morning 66 million years ago, when a pack of T. Rexes woke up on what would go down as the final day of the Cretaceous Period, all seemed normal in their Hell Creek kingdom, the same as it had for two millions of years. Forests of conifers and ginkgoes stretched to the horizon, interspersed with palms and magnolias. The distant churn of a river, rushing eastward to empty into the great seaway that lapped against western North America. For the last several weeks, the more perceptive of the T. Rexes may have noticed a glowing orb in the sky, far off in the distance and a hazy ball also had a fiery rim. The orb would appear and disappear for hours. As it appeared again, it was bigger, its shine illuminating much of the sky to the southeast in a cloudy psychedelic mist. Then a flash. No noise, only a split-second flare of yellow that lit up the whole sky, disorienting the animals for a moment. As they blinked their eyes back to focus, they noticed that the orb was now gone. Moments later, and then they were blindsided. Another flash, but this one far more vengeful. The rays lit the morning air in a fireworks display and burned into their retinas. In fact, no noise at all. By now, the birds and flying raptors had stopped chirping, and silence hung over Hell Creek. The calm lasted for only a few seconds. Next, the ground beneath their feet started to rumble and shake, and then flew like waves; pulses of energy were shooting through the rocks and soil, the ground rising and falling as if a giant snake were slithering underneath. Everything not rooted into the dirt was thrown upward; then it crashed down, and then up and down again, the Earth's surface was acting like a trampoline. Everything within a radius of about six hundred miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of modern-day Mexico was annihilated, and vaporized. For several years, the Earth turned cold and dark because of soot, sulfur, sulfuric acid and rock dust in the atmosphere that blocked out the sun. The darkness brought severe winter for years that only the hardiest of animals could survive. The rains were highly acidic that wiped out much of marine species. Here and there, species of lizards, crocodiles, turtles, birds and rat-size mammals made it but with lots of duress under the fury of nature. Hell-Creek was turned to Hell that reverberated in rest of the world."

258,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,5,"Phew! A pop history on Dinosaurs written by a Paleantologist is enough to trigger your curiosity and awaken the science geek in you. However, you do worry about a Ross Geller level book you will be stuck with for ages. Stephen Brusatte is more Douglas Adams than Ross Geller and he tells a story that is at once engaging and enlightening. Imagine a huge jigsaw puzzle that has to pieced together. The challenge is that the pieces are found years apart and you have dedicated science heroes who try to make the best image possible with the pieces they have. And the frustration that lasts for decades when you realise there are missing pieces. That has been the story of piecing together the history of one of the most fascinating creatures that inhabited the earth.What Brusatte has done is not just laying out the facts (and theories) but also a tribute to all the paleontologists who have played a part in building the current understanding. Starting from the Permian period fossils through the Triassic age till the Jurassic and Cretaceous - the author paints a picture that is hard to ignore of complex foodchains, rise of apex predators and the entire evolution journey on fast forward. The journey is mapped through the work of paleontologists, geologists and collectors whose stories, quirks and anecdotes too are part of this book. The history of Dinosaurs cannot be narrated without the history of the planet and hence we get a lot of information on movement of continent, rise of oceans and rise of life in general.There is a chapter dedicated to Tyranosorus Rex (Tyrant King) which almost worships the larger than life (most lives, at least) predators. The author does not miss an opportunity to compare notes and point errata to the Jurassic Park movie, which is the introduction to most of us who are googling images today. The linkage to birds apart, the single mass extinction theory that brought an end to cretareous is more like the dominant theory that most paleantologists subscribe to. He actually describes a meeting of paleantologists in 2012 to discuss the validity of the theory where everyone agreed. This is only what we know.. so far.. A good book that presents facts actually allows you to understand the origin of popular theories without judging them - like the science of Phrenology which took off in the same period classifying human beings from different continents as different species. Today we grow uncomfortable knowing that gave grounds to Eugenics and later persecution of races in terms of superiority. Scientists are impervious to the implications of truth. The book makes you ask a lot more questions and for that reason alone, I loved it. A joyride!"

It was quite informative, especially for those, like me, who haven't been able to keep up with all of the findings in this subject for the last couple of decades. I think I liked this book because it was part memoir as well as science. The author has a sense of humor, and is only three years older than me, so his pop culture and generation comments were right on par. He does mention the film Jurassic Park several times, though usually to disprove some of their science. I only had one complaint: No color pictures! I was surprised how much this bugged me, but as the author described such beautiful landscapes of where he was digging, and then only provided a black and white photograph, the beauty was lost on me. I realize it's cheaper to publish without color photos, and paleontologists most likely don't make bank, but the author is the ""resident paleontologist for BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs"" so I think color photographs isn't too much to ask. The illustrations were lovely though, even if they portrayed the dinos with feathers...I guess I can't deny a lot of dinosaurs had feathers anymore since I've now read this. Dinosaurs just don't seem as cool with them.I will just mention that I have my own personal opinion on evolution. This book talks a lot about the evolution of dinosaurs. I am religious, which probably has a lot to do with it, but I never quite agreed fully with the author on this subject.Overall, I recommend it!2018 challenge: A book with an animal in the title"

They had endured hardships, evolved superpowers like fast metabolisms and enormous size, and vanquished their rivals so that they ruled an entire planet…Then, literally, in a split second, it ended.”Riveting crash course on dino history. Very well done. "
261,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike,1,"D’ya see that subtitle? “A New History of a Lost World”? It’s one of two things: 1) utter bullshit or 2) marketing spin (which amounts to the same thing as #1). There’s no new information in this book. However, it IS a new book, so... yeah. Bullshit marketing.There are some other reasons why I’m giving this a 1-star review. One of the biggest is Brusatte’s continued insistence on ascribing INTENT to evolution. What the actual fuck, dude? No, triceratops didn’t decide to grow horns. T. rex didn’t want to grow teeth. Mammals weren’t “craving” the opportunity to supplant the dinosaurs for 100 million years. If you’re going to imbue intelligent design to evolution then you are one bad week from assuming that an almighty god did it and that the Bible is literally correct.You are doing a disservice to everyone who reads this book, especially to every kid who does so, because you are saying chance doesn’t exist in natural selection and that every species decides what it wants to become. That’s woo-woo bullshit and utterly unscientific. Stop invoking intelligent design. Stop it.In my lifetime there have been a few things which have completely upended our understanding of dinosaurs. Bakker’s insistence that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. (The Dinosaur Heresies) Which now has a mountain of evidence supporting it. Alvarez’s discovery that an asteroid impact in the Yucatán killed off the dinosaurs. (T. Rex and the Crater of Doom) And most recently, Horner’s complete and utter decimation of the plethora of dinosaur species. (https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner...)Paleontologists at the time pushed back on all of these theories, but the first two are now widely accepted by pretty much everyone, because the ones who objected have died off. The latter has pissed off paleontologists because some of them have named these “new” species and Horner has effectively wiped away their claims to fame by asking a simple question: “Where are all the baby dinosaurs?” Brusatte doesn’t even address Horner’s theory, probably because he doesn’t agree with it. Except the evidence is compelling.Everyone knows Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law (“indistinguishable from magic”) but not as many are familiar with his First: “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.” Brusatte is in his early 30s, so he doesn’t have that excuse.There are other things in this book which are irksome but don’t rise to the level of anger, such as his constant descriptions of travel. I could not care less which trains he had to catch or the type of trucks he rode in. I guess that stuff was added for flavor, but it’s entirely beside the point 90% of the time. His descriptions of fellow fossil fiends is more on point because it shows the diversity of the (mostly male) dinosaur hunters, but there are quite a few women who play tertiary roles. That’s the one valuable aspect of this book. Minor, but it’s there.He does have a weird way of describing dinosaurs. Herbivores are “plant gobblers” while carnivores are “meat gobblers”. He did mix it up once by saying “plant munchers”, so yay for linguistic diversity. Hashtag sarcasm.You don’t need to read this book. Try those others I linked above. Watch that video."

This is very much for dino fans, very readable, but not super-strict on phrasing for best presentation of the science, not enough pictures of models of dinos.So, yeah, the bad: writes of evolutionary development as if it were intentional. Speaks of T.Rex and Triceratops as 'rivals.'* Too many scientific names of species I've never heard of for me to able to keep track w/out those missing pictures. Some awkward stretches for humor.The good: Once I got the hang of reading it w/out fretting that I wasn't keeping track of every species named, I found it very engaging. And, yes, enlightening. And Brusatte does teach something about science. For example he does admit that new finds may overturn current assumptions, and he does explain *how* a lot of stuff that is understood came to be figured out:""We can tell that Rex had some of the largest and most powerful jaw muscles of any dinosaur, based on the very broad and deep gullies on the skull bones where the muscles attached.""One species mentioned early I am going to google image search: Effigia okeeffeae....... and ""human-sized ominvorous theropods called oviraptororsaurs.""... and *The Age of Reptiles* mural.... balaur bondoc""Proper grasslands would not develop until... many tens of millions of years after the dinosaurs cleared out."" (I have to pick the nit of the word choice 'cleared.' Did dinosaurs prevent grass from evolving to become grasslands? I doubt it....)""The Gobi fossils tell us that the ancestors of birds got smart before they took to the skies."" Also got feathers, wings, and efficient lungs 'flow-through' lungs before that, too. ""The feathers of nonflying, winged dinosaurs were a rainbow of different colors..."" discovered from Jakob Vinther's studies of melanosomes, and probably used for display.Walter Alvarez is Luis Alvarez' son.Anyway, you can see that the good outweighs the bad.

The absurd amount of times this guy hits you with first-person pronouns is outrageous. Let's just stick with the dinosaurs, you know, like the title suggested.

So much has happened in the decades since my youth, and getting caught up was more than worthwhile. There are over 50 dinosaur species discovered each year (!!) and more, science agrees that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs (!!!). I didn't realize that the Burpee, which is just down the road from me, has such a wide dinosaur history, despite the fact no significant fossils have been ever discovered in Illinois. I wish there'd been less about Brusatte through. The moments where it drifted into him nerding out about dinosaurs were weakened a bit when he name dropped. Certainly, those who've done work deserve credit, but doing so in context to how you know that person or have worked with them leans a bit too hard on the ""look at how I've rubbed elbows with famous people"" side. Barring that, readers who are curious about dinosaurs or haven't thought about them since elementary days will find this a worthwhile read.The audiobook worked well, too. "

I was very surprised at this shocking twist ending. I thought T-Rexs lived among us.Exhibit A:And yes, this is a brief history. This covers hundreds of millions (okay, billions but eh, semantics) and compresses a really varied and complex history into an overview so easy a caveman can read it.Aaaaaaaaand with that I'll retire all ancient puns for forever. Anywho, this was a fascinating glimpse into the quickly changing and fast-paced world of paleontology and geology, which were not the dead-end jobs that I grew up being told (""You'll never get a job studying dinosaurs"" they said, so I...never did—also I was never super duper fascinated by dinosaurs and the past because that kitchen scene scared the living shit out of me, so), but are vibrant and growing and uncovering more and more history-altering discoveries each month. It's fascinating and incredible what new discoveries, technology and modern analytics can do—and the brilliant minds that are dedicated to understanding the mysteries of the past.This entire book was amazing, particularly when understanding the billions of years of life that came before humans—and the chain of events that led to humans being able to become the apex predators instead of the vicious T-Rex, who was cut down at the height of its reign (and who had great eyesight and could not outrun a Jeep and could totally crush a car in half with its jaws, so thank you for giving me a false sense of security, Jurassic Park). Additionally, earlier periods of dinosaurs and non-dinosaurs were covered, particularly the evolution of crocodiles (who were scary AF) and also birds.Spoiler alert: birds are dinosaurs.Double spoiler alert: that meteorite did end the dinosaur's reign.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was clearly written, and while repetitive at times it clearly illustrated the vast biodiversity of Earth's history and how various climate changes and environments influence what flourishes were and how simple changes can have dramatic effects in various ecosystems.Definitely a must-read if you want to learn more about dinosaurs and the prehistoric Earth but don't know where to start.But, since dinosaurs are (mostly) extinct, all we can do is attempt to recreate the past:"
267,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I listened to this audiobook during one of my many long drives this last week, and I really enjoyed it, despite some annoying flaws. As y'all may be aware, I love me some nonfiction these days, and when it's well-written and accessible and brings the information being conveyed to the reader (or listener) in an entertaining way, so much the better. History, science, technology, sociology, whatever, I'm into it. This book ticked some of the boxes, but not as many as I'd have wanted. I enjoyed the information being presented, but not the method of presentation, if that makes sense. Lemme elaborate. Stephen Brusatte is definitely a dino-nerd. And I say this with the utmost respect. You can tell that he's excited and passionate about learning about dinosaurs, how they came to exist, and how they came to no longer exist. His writing is well-informed, interesting, and he knows his stuff, and presents his facts and supporting arguments well, whether it's the cause of the extinction event that cause the dinosaurs to become ""extinct"", or the argument that modern day birds ARE dinosaurs and therefore not all dinosaurs are extinct after all. They've just evolved. But, a bit of that gets lost in the overwhelming amount of hard to follow scientific species names and tidbit detail, and there was a lot of it. Discovery of new fossils, the qualities and criteria for distinguishing it as a Bellusaurus vs a Barosaurus vs a Barapasaurus vs a Brachiosaurus... etc. I think, even had I read this in print, this amount of quick-fire detail wouldn't work well, but in audio, it was just overwhelming. I ended up listening to this book MUCH MUCH slower than I usually listen to audiobooks, just to try to follow along and track the myriad dinos and their traits. But then, we come to the Spotlight Sections. Where we spend a lot of time focusing on one dinosaur (or idea) and examining it in detail. Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course, was the dinosaur, because it's everyone's favorite. I did learn quite a bit about them, and it was good information and fascinating stuff, but I wish that there were more sections of detail rather than a few of them interspersed within the general overview jam packed with rapid-fire facts. Then we have the humans. I actually feel a little bit bad about the annoyance I felt about this, but I did feel it, so there it is. Whenever Brusatte would introduce a new human into the story, whether they found one dinosaur bone in their backyard or have found millions of them around the globe, we got as much of their life story as possible in their intro. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in their expertise and why I should trust them and their conclusions, but do I really need to know that they enjoy kayaking? Not really. Let's keep it relevant. Finally, there was the reader. Holy moly, dude, take a BREATH. I feel like this guy was on a deadline to spit this book out. I had SUCH a hard time finding places to pause, because he literally never did. Even between chapters, a pause that might usually go for 2-3 seconds was MAYBE a 1 second pause here. I was NEVER quick enough to pause at the end of a section or chapter without cutting it off mid-word as he started the next section. It was crazy. And this while listening to this at a SLOWER speed than I normally do. O_OBut those complaints aside, this really was a fascinating, informative, and entertaining look at dinosaurs and their history. And their modernity. I loved the science and methodology of the discovery and determination of fossils and how they went about piecing together the lives that these animals would have lived. It really was very well researched, and I love reading books by people who are truly passionate and excited about their work. It does show. I do just wish that it was maybe presented in a little bit more measured of a way so that the reader can really absorb the massive amount of information here. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in dinosaurs, or earth's or life's history at all. There are lessons here about so much more than just dinosaurs, but about time and change and impermanence, but also about resilience and tenacity. The section about the extinction event that wiped out most of the species of life on the planet was harrowing and nerve-wracking, and I'm experiencing it from millions and millions of years removed from the actual event. Such was Brusatte's skill at delving into the detail and bringing the story to life. I was heartbroken for these animals that have been dead for millennia. It was a stark reminder that nothing at all guarantees our time on this rock, but that maybe something new and interesting can be given an opportunity to spring up in our place. "
268,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,2,"This could have been good. Maybe. If the author had stuck to dinosaurs which he didn't when he basically had to mention every person he has ever met in paleontology or has touched paleontology in some way. The first few chapters were definitely full of name dropping, mostly of male paleontologists. Female paleontologists were mentioned only if they were married to another paleontologist or just had their work mentioned while the men got full page biographies and accolades (and the overuse of certain adjectives). I do have to point out one female paleontologist did get a bit more of an introduction but she gets mentioned and then ignored. I know science , in certain fields, can still be male dominated but this felt more like blatant sexism by the author. I mean, the men get full page biographies, their work is highlighted, their connections to others in the field are highlighted, they get treated with respect and admiration. The women are pointed out in relation to their husbands (if married) and might get a sentence about their work. Or just a sentence about their work if they're not married. If these women's work hadn't impacted his own, I don't think the author would have mentioned them at all.The writing and organization are all over the place. This was supposed to be a history of the dinosaurs but this was more a biography of the author's work. And a lot of the material just didn't feel like it was really new and I'm not big into dinosaurs but I knew a lot already. And I haven't read anything on dinosaurs since elementary school, I think. There were times when there should have been less detail and times when there should have been more detail. The few middle chapters did seem to improve (more dinosaurs, less author self-promotion) but it never really got good. I also felt the author didn't seem to know who he was writing for, who his audience was supposed to be. Things were all over the place. This has potential but never seemed to get off the ground. Not worth reading."
269,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"Steve Brusatte really likes dinosaurs and prospecting for fossils and analyzing dinosaur history. And he is able to communicate that love really well. I enjoyed this book a lot. Brusatte presents the current state of dinosaur knowledge (Note: Spielberg had a lot of it wrong.) and brings it to life. Not just the dinosaurs themselves, but the many dedicated researchers who have made all these discoveries. The writing is lucid and accessible to the non-scientist. Okay, occasionally all the Latin names for different species cause a little eye-glazing, but it's not necessary to remember them to absorb the sense of the text. The description of the day the asteroid hit is especially vivid. And the explanations of evolution as reflected in the dinosaurs were very clear and helpful. I think Brusatte must be an excellent teacher. "

There have been amazing breakthroughs in our knowledge regarding dinosaurs; and with the advent of grandsons, it was clearly time for me to ‘up my game’!Brusatte has written a highly readable account of those new advances. He is an enthusiastic fossil hunter that takes the reader around the world from Georgia O’Keefe’s Ghost Ranch “bursting with dinosaur bones”; to Hell Creek, Montana—a Triceratops graveyard; to China and its plethora of feather-covered fossils; and to Italy where a thin layer of iridium indicates that an asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago.I admit that I enjoy reading about how paleontologists have determined that dinosaurs had feathers; that they were colored, and likely proved to be advantageous in attracting mates. And those dinosaurs that later became birds may have first used wing action to attract more attention, and just stumbled upon how wing action could result in gliding and eventually flying. It just takes a few millennia to make it happen.The number of new discoveries regarding dinosaurs over the past twenty years is mind-boggling. I look forward to learning more in the next twenty.

Gives a really vivid picture of the Mesozoic world and its creatures as moving, eating, breeding things. Some great history of the science too, if a bit laddish at points in the insistent ""hey we drink beer we definitely aren't nerds"". I don't know whether at this point in human history it's comfortable or not to reflect that the earth has seen multiple animal kingdoms wiped out when soaring carbon dioxide turned the atmosphere into an oven. There's a kind of comfort in looking at it from a cosmic level, I guess? "
272,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,5,"This was a book I HAD to read--to catch up on the subject I obsessed so much about in elementary school-Dinosaurs! When I was a kid I read every book on dinosaurs that I could find in my local library and my parents bought me even more books--and I was thrilled no end to go to the nearby Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago! but that was in the 60s and I thought we knew everything there was to know about the big guys. They were slow, brainless giants doomed to extinction so that the way could be cleared for The Rise of Man. But, as paleontologist Steve Brusatte points out, at the end of the 60s and going into the 70s, a new paradigm took shape, in which dinosaurs have been viewed as active, even energetic, animals, some being social and intelligent. Rather than doomed to failure, they were among the most successful animals for over 150 million years. If it had not been for what Brusatte calls ""the worst day in the history of our planet,"" when the asteroid (or comet) hit 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs would still dominate the Earth. The good news is that the dinos did not completely die out. I see some flitting about my bird feeder even as I type this. The birds are now classified as dinosaurs, as theropods, related to T-rex and velociraptors. For me, the most interesting part of the book (as a bird-lover) is his discussing the origin and evolution of the birds (and feathers!). I'm so glad they escaped the Cretaceous (Fifth) Extinction Event, but it's an open question whether they can escape the current or Sixth Extinction Event... I enjoyed this narrative greatly because not only does Steve share his passion with the reader (he's one guy who sure does love his job!) but he relates his experiences taking part in expeditions around the globe. This does seem to be a golden age of discovery of dinosaurs--and I missed it! BUT at least I can read about it. Thanks, Steve Brusatte! And I look forward to hearing more from this amazing young man!"
273,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"Off to a good start. I prefer to read pop-science books written by scientists, and Brusatte is a young vertebrate paleontologist at the Univ. of Edinburgh. Like all of us, he caught the dino bug when he was a kid. Unlike most, he made a career of it, and it's been an interesting one. Dino books are generally written by seniors, so it's fun to see one of the ""young guns"" take up the pen (or computer). Brusatte is an adequate writer, which is fine, since he's got some great stories to tell. And it's a great time for the field -- he says that lately, there's a new dino species described, on average, every week!The good quality continues, and I enjoyed the book, although I got dino-overload at times. He's a decent writer, but the prose gets purple, as in the Great Asteroid that (probably) killed off the dinosaurs (except for the birds!).

Just a heads-up for anyone who is thinking of getting the audio book.***I am doing the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge and this is where I need to start cheating a little bit. The cue ""Continental drift: Read a book set on every continent"" could mean you read ONE book that travels through all continents or SEVERAL books, one for each continent. Since I'm almost sure I won't be able to add six more books to my already ambitious summer TBR, I decided to give this one a go.

Much of what I learned as a child about the big lizards has since been refuted by new fossils, better analysis, and new research. Stephen Brusatte caught the dino bug when he was young and became a vertebrate paleontologist. His passion comes through loud and clear in this book, as he takes his readers from ancient history to the end of most dinosaurs on this planet, starting with the biggest mass extinction on this planet at the end of the Permian age; this die-off made way for some unusual reptiles with a different body plan than many of their peers that proved to be amazingly successful for these reptiles and their countless descendants for millennia afterwards through the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. Though I was already familiar with much that Brusatte covered, his writing style made the material approachable and easy to understand. There were not as many images as I would have liked; despite my familiarity with many of the creatures, it’s still hard to remember the little differences between similar individuals in a group, and more drawings would have been helpful.I particularly liked Brusatte's chapters on the Permian-Triassic transition, tyrannosaurs, birds, and the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous especially. I am a fan of theropods, and Brusatte is clearly a huge fan of the tyrannosaurids. He tended to wax a little melodramatic about these carnivorous dinosaurs, but then it's a little hard not to be in awe of such terrifying beings. (Especially the huge carnivorous members of this group.)This book was a good refresher on many points about dinosaurs, and the author's writing style and obvious enthusiasm for the subject made this an enjoyable read."

It's like wondering what might have happened if the archduke was never shot.The whole these-were-the-coolest-beings-that-ever-roamed-the-earth moniker has always made me a dino fan. The amazing variations of these huge oddballs have always been intriguing and this book does its best to piece everything together. Which is a very good thing, because there have been so many new discoveries and new theories since I was a child that I lost track of which was the coolest dino (welcome back, Brontosaurus).Steve Brusatte is one of the world's eminent paleontologists whose other books, especially Field Guide to Dinosaurs, have made me a fan of his writing and his obvious enthusiasm for his work. Here, he charts the very beginnings of the dinosaur, even before they evolved. He starts with the Permian Extinction, which eliminated 95% of life on earth. Somehow, some little things survived and that eventually led the way for the bigger things to arrive later on. Right off, his description of the Great Dying kept me glued to the pages as the volcanoes spewed forth lava mud and carbon dioxide. How anything managed to live through all of that is simply amazing.As the dinosaurs grew, the earth was also changing, with the continents moving toward their current locations and the environment becoming a bit nicer. Well, nicer like walking outside at noon during an Alabama summer. The dinosaurs became larger and larger and ruled the world until the day that nasty asteroid slammed into Earth. Then, Brusatte relates what it must have felt like to wake up that day as a dino, thinking you were just going about your business as usual. Nope. Any dinosaur too close to the impact was vaporised while the ones further away endured boiling hot hail, mammoth earthquakes, renewed lava flows, loss of sun, loss of trees, and ergo, loss of life. The dinosaurs didn't all die at once, he states, but probably over a few hundred or few thousand years. Given the fact that they had been around for millions of years, the dinosaur extinction was relatively quick.The book doesn't just end with the catastrophic impact but instead continues with the rise of the birds, our current dinosaurs. All very fascinating. While there are some b&w illustrations at the beginning of each chapter, the book is mostly text with various photos of fossils and the paleontologists who discovered the dino fossils. That's because this book is as much a tribute to the men and women who found those dragon bones as it is to the dinosaur. I deducted a star for the continuous focus on the author (we get it, Steve, you like dinosaurs and you go on lots of expeditions). So pretty good book, but it forced me to check out another library book (The Great Dinosaur Discoveries) so I could see the actual illustrations of what these big brutes would have looked like.That darn asteroid.Book Season = Year Round (looking at the finches with suspicion)"

It puts perspective on “our” life and “our” Earth and how we really don’t know it all. All we have are the few pieces of evidence of a life completely different from our own. I really appreciate all the researchers and paleontologists who put their time and energy, (and sometimes their life) into helping us better understand these eras and species long gone. The end really made me sad. Seeing these beautiful creatures end so abruptly (and in the way that it did) is such a shame. However, few of these creatures did leave their footprint to give future species, like us, proof and imagination of an insanely different time here on Earth. Just imagine all the things we don’t know because we don’t have proof, haven’t found it yet, or might have wrong. It’s surreal to think about. That said, I do wish the author talked less about the people who studied the fossils and more about the dinosaurs. I also wish he threw in more pictures of what he was explaining so I could get a picture of what he was discussing. I found myself with my phone in one hand and the book in the other, constantly looking up pictures of the dinosaurs he mentioned, the eras, and anything he named and just assumed the reader knew. "

I got to go through the same thing when my kids went through the phase as well and I got all caught up with things like Walking With Dinosaurs and its ilk. Which is all a round-about way of saying that I thought of myself as being fairly well-informed about paleontology, at least from a pop-science perspective.This book did an excellent job of bringing that pop-science overview of the field much more up-to-date. For instance, I was aware that paleontology in China had been going off with some really exciting discoveries, but I had no idea how key that has been to the overall understanding of dinosaur lineage. There also appears to be some fairly exciting new thinking about the origin of dinosaurs and the early period of the Triassic that I was entirely unaware of.In short, this is a great book for establishing an up-to-date popular science-level overview of the dinosaur element of paleontology, all made that much more engaging by a series of personal anecdotes from the author and his own career and interaction with his peers."

The rise and fall of the dinosaurs is an incredible story, of a time when giant beasts and other fantastic creatures made the world their own. They walked on the very ground below us, their fossils now entombed in rock – the clues that tell this story. To me, it's one of the greatest narratives in the history of our planet.
The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is thoroughly enjoyable pop science: author (and celebrated young paleontologist) Steve Brusatte uses his own learning journey to outline the exciting advances occurring today in his field (he calls this the “golden age” of paleontology, noting that new species of dinosaurs are discovered/described at the astounding rate of about one per week), and not only did I learn new and fascinating information from the deep history of our remarkable planet, but I found Brusatte's enthusiasm to be contagious. Who doesn't love dinosaurs? Totally accessible (but fact-filled) and balanced with personal stories (which I acknowledge might strain the patience of those of a more academic bent), it all worked for me.Early on, Brusatte – who is a Chancellor's Fellow in Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Edinburgh – refers to his “ebullient, wildly animated lecturing style”, and for the purposes of this review, I'd rather demonstrate this ebullience than attempt to list everything that Brusatte taught me. On the sauropods whose tracks he studied on the Scottish Isle of Skye:
There's really no better way to say it: the sauropods that made their marks in that ancient Scottish lagoon were awesome creatures. Awesome in the literal sense of the word – impressive, daunting, inspiring awe. If I was handed a blank sheet of paper and pen and told to create a mythical beast, my imagination could never match what evolution created in sauropods.
Brusatte devotes plenty of breathless space to the Tyrannosaurus rex – including debunking what Jurassic Park got wrong about the apex predators (turns out that their eyesight was perfectly sharp, but they couldn't have outrun a jeep) – and writes, “The seat of Rex's power was its head. It was a killing machine, torture chamber for its prey, and an evil mask all in one.” And after having repeatedly referred to T. Rex arms as “sad” and “pathetic”, Brusatte shares new research that has determined, based on strong shoulder extensors and elbow flexors, the Rex used these “short but strong arms to hold down struggling prey while the jaws did their bone-crunching thing. The arms were accessories to murder.” Murder! The writing gets amped up when T. Rex meets its favourite meal:Triceratops, like its archnemesis T. rex, is a dinosaur icon. In films and documentaries, it usually plays the gentle, sympathetic plant-eater, the perfect dramatic foil to the Tyrant King. Sherlock versus Moriarty, Batman versus the Joker, Trike versus Rex. But it's not all movie magic; no, these two dinosaurs truly would have been rivals 66 million years ago...The King needed immense amounts of flesh to fuel its metabolism; its three-horned comrade was fourteen tons of slow-moving prime steak. You can figure out what happened next.So, you either enjoy a professor writing like a teenaged dino-fanboy, or you don't. Interspersed with the timeline of dinosaur evolution, Brusatte outlines the history of fossil hunting from the “Bone Wars” (which saw 19th-century rivals Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh sending out teams of mercenaries to hunt for bones for their individual glory; in the pursuit of which they weren't above stealing, lying, and sabotaging each other's sites) to the academics of today. In addition to referring to individuals as the “hot shots” or “rock stars” or the “Rat Pack” of paleontology, Brusatte proves that paleontologists just might be a special breed unto themselves. Barnum Brown, the first celebrity paleontologist at the turn of the twentieth century, prospected for dino bones in high summer “decked out in his fur coat with his pickaxe slung over his shoulder”. Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás – an adventurer, WWI spy, and the first paleobiologist – was a “flamboyant dandy and a tragic genius, whose exploits hunting dinosaurs in Transylvania were brief respites from the insanity of the rest of his life. Dracula, in all seriousness, has nothing on the Dinosaur Baron.” And as for Brusatte's modern day colleagues:Thomas Carr – my absinthe-drinking, Goth-dressing friend who studies T. rex – was with us on the expedition and was part of this team. Clad in khaki (it was far too hot for his usual all-black getup) and sucking down Gatorade by the gallon (absinthe was more of an indoor pursuit), he attacked the mudstones with his rock hammer (which he nicknamed Warrior) and his pickaxe (Warlord), exposing a number of new Triceratops bones.And working on the other side of the world in China, Brusatte describes another rising star:
Jingmai (O'Connor) calls herself a paleontologista – fitting given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, and tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia. A native of Southern California – half Irish, half-Chinese by blood – Jingmai is a Roman Candle of energy – delivering caustic one-liners one moment, speaking in eloquent paragraphs about politics the next, and then it's on to music or art or her own unique brand of Buddhist philosophy. Oh yes, and she’s also the world’s number-one expert on those first birds that broke the bounds of Earth to fly above their dinosaur ancestors.
And speaking of the first birds: as uncomfortable as I find this book's cover art – depicting a wispily feathered T. rex confronting wispily feathered prey dinos – that's a mental-shift I'll need to force myself to make: Brusatte makes the incontrovertible case that all true dinosaurs (not crocs or other proto-reptiles) were in a direct line to modern day birds and shared many of the same body features (flow-through lungs, wishbones, and yes, feathers; there's a paleontologist working today who can even determine the colours of their plumage). But, if I can mentally shift the T. rex from the upright Barney-the-dinosaur stance depicted in my youth to the balanced-forward pose accepted today, I suppose I can eventually re-imagine it covered in feathers. After all of the enthusiasm Brusatte displays for the rise and evolutionary success of the dinosaurs, the final chapter on their sudden demise is urgently and tragically related:It was the worst day in the history of our planet. A few hours of unimaginable violence that undid more than 150 million years of evolution and set life on a new course. T. rex was there to see it.An impact from a meteorite (or possibly comet), hitting with the force of “a billion nuclear bombs' worth of energy”, caused the near total extinction of the earth's most successful and widespread species (excepting, of course, for those dinosaurs who survived to evolve into what we think of as birds). The good news is that this catastrophic event paved the wave for the rise of the mammals, and us; the bad news is that we're no more special than the dinosaurs, and catastrophes – including those of our own making – can strike at any time. If you like your pop science poppy, this is an entertaining and informative read."
282,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Dinosaurs aren't a hard sell. People are just into them. I'm one of those people. In this book, Brusatte notes that his generation (which I'm a part of ~ thirtysomethings) were indelibly drawn to dinosaurs because of Jurassic Park. Of course, the interest preceded that film (umm, what about 1988's Land Before Time?), but it did solidify it!I've had this book since it came out in 2018 and knew I'd be reading it for this round of Science September. It's a great primer, a deep dive into modern #paleontology and evolutionary biology, with all the new fossils and species identifications.You come for the dinosaurs, and Brusatte's engaging storytelling and infectious enthusiasm for the subject keep you reading. He has what I can only describe as a ""folksy"" writing style, describing nearly every person in the book as 'the greatest paleontogist' or 'the nicest person you'll ever meet' (it's endearing, but it makes you wonder if it's all exactly true... Are they all this nice?) My favorite sections of the book were about dinosaur anatomy and biomechanics - the descriptions of their lungs and breathing patterns, and how this resembles modern birds' lungs, their bones' hollow structure, and their locomotion and moving speeds. How does a creature that weighs TONS pump blood? New and more complete #fossils have shown us how they moved, breathed, circulated blood, digested food, and how they looked (feathers! Even Tyrannosaurus Rex had feathers - not the plumage, but more likely quills and downy fuzz feathers). It's completely fascinating.This was a great companion piece with Peter Brannen's The Ends of the World that I read last week. There is overlap in topic of mass extinction after the asteroid hit, but Brusatte's book goes into more depth in the paleontology (and some anecdotes about cold calling Walter Alvarez for travel advice!) and the #evolution that led to the bird-dinosaurs we know today."
283,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Overall, a really interesting book & well laid out, but I floundered with all the odd names. A lot of that is my own ignorance & I think I would have enjoyed this more if I knew the names better. It's obvious that Brusatte lives & breathes this stuff & loves it. The narrator was excellent & conveyed Brusatte's enthusiasm well, but I glazed over from the terminology occasionally.It was a great trip, though. I learned not just about the evolution of dinosaurs, but about the other critters of the times, ones I'd often confused with them. He describes their rise very well & dispels many of the older ideas that I learned in school. For instance, he made sense of their feathers far better than anything else I've read on the subject which is admittedly little. In doing so, he shows why we didn't realize they had them for so long.Reconstructing the story of the dinosaurs is tough due to the time involved. Their reign ended 66 million years ago, but it was only about 50 years ago that we nailed down why. Fossils aren't common & many of the best sites were plundered by ignorant, greedy men. He shows how this was both good & bad. The interest in them led to money for expeditions that are expensive, hard, & time consuming, but we have many fossils that aren't properly cataloged or investigated as he shows through several discoveries made by students, including himself. New methods & tools have brought some amazing clarity.Definitely recommended in any format."
284,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070393-natch,2,"I'm not sure that I've ever been more disappointed in a book. I went into it thinking that it would be a basic-level summary of the evolution of dinosaurs and the world events that shaped them. Instead, the majority of the book (or so it seemed) was about the author's (and others) meetings and, occasionally, trips to find dinosaur bones. What made the book particularly insufferable (as others have mentioned previously) was that the author has to be in his thirties, at most (I didn't look it up), and, frankly, he doesn't possess any real critical insight of himself or others. As a consequence, the book does not start as you would expect - here's what the world looked like pre-dinosaur and here's what inhabited; it starts as an autobiography with the occasional dinosaur story thrown in. For example, his first story centers on going to Poland (if I remember correctly), getting off the train, and meeting a rather unfriendly looking guy...but, turns out, that guy was really friendly! And they found footprints! And wrote an article about it!...Oh, and the proto-dinosaurs were less like salamanders in their movements and more directional and we figured out what they probably looked like...but instead of a good description, here's a little photo and that's all. But it continues in this vein. Okay, next, the author went to Portugal. There, he met a dude who was the best at finding the fossils in the places he explored since childhood. Isn't that great? Isn't that guy brilliant? Just like the other paleontologists the author knows? Well, no. I grew up on a beach known to have plenty of fossilized shark teeth. I'm pretty good at finding shark teeth. So is every other person who grew up there or has lived there for a while and looks (cue certain little, old ladies). A visitor who shows up once for two weeks is going to be terrible compared to all us natives. The other thing that really bugged me was how everyone the author has ever met in the world of paleontology is ""brilliant"" or some equivalent...and there are several pages which are just lists of people and their specialties. I'm not sure how many paleontologists there are in the world, but I would guess that a fair number were listed in this book as ""brilliant."" I just don't think that's the case, unless paleontology is only populated by MENSA members. It really seemed like this book was more the autobiography of a dude in his thirties who happens to study dinosaurs and who thought to throw in some statements about dinosaurs. Disappointingly, those statements aren't always well thought out or explained. For example, the author talks about Pangea pretty early on, describing it as a single landmass stretching from the artic to antartic and centered on the equator with a desert spanning the equator so hostile to dinosaur-life that it was, essentially, a dinosaur-less. Yet, in the same breath says that on either side of that desert were dinosaurs in the early Triassic period. What he never seems to tell us is how those dinosaurs bypassed the desert to become distributed on both sides or whether dinosaurs evolved twice (one on each side) or what might have happened. I had to go on Wikipedia to look it up. Seriously. A history book should not require readers to resort to Wikipedia to explain what happened. (Dinosaurs appear to have been able to migrate past the desert areas, fyi).I ended up giving this book two stars because it does actually talk about dinosaurs a fair bit, albeit in a kinda rushed manner. And, I guess, I felt the talk of dinosaurs was colored by my perceptions of the protagonist of the story, the author himself. I'm a bit concerned by how much beer he drinks. There was more than one description of events being described as the best (the best conference, etc.) which seem to have been wholly related to the availability of alcohol and, in the case of Argentina, beef. Further, I'm a bit concerned about the author's relationship to women. He seems to revel in ribald jokes, as, I think, other commentators have mentioned, and seems to have a bit of a negative view of them. That might be okay for the character in a novel, but it's something that should be addressed in the world of real people. Those things really did color my feelings on this book and definitely contributed to the loss of a star. The other two were lost because of how much space seemed to be devoted to personal antedotes and urgings to read his other works rather than the story of dinosaurs. "

286,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Highway to Hell Creek; the discovery of the remnants of Jurassic park In this dazzling rehash, author Steve Brusatte tells the mesmerizing story of dinosaurs; their origins, evolution, diversity, habitats and their cataclysmic extinction. This is a captivating narrative that engages the reader till the end of the book. Highly readable and well researched that interest readers focused in ancient history this planet, dinosaurs, and life in late cretaceous era (100 – 66 million Years). The book describes immediate events after planet was hit by 6.5-mile-long asteroid (Chicxulub meteorite), at the speed of 67,000 miles per hour, 65.5 million years ago. The fossils from this event are preserved all over the planet, which gives a grim picture. It simply demonstrates that life on earth is susceptible to the wrath of nature. This was the sixth extinction of life in 4.5 billion history of the planet, and it was colossal, cosmic and catastrophic. How did life witness this? The author describes in detail as what may have happened immediately before and after the greatest hit in the recent history of our planet. Although this has been discussed on several TV shows on Nat Geo, Discovery, PBS and Science channels by geophysicists, astronomers and paleontologists, it is interesting to read from the point of a paleontologist who studies dinosaurs with passion. In fact, it is common in recent days to read about the discovery of new species of dinosaurs, birds and mammals from this event. One of the goldmines for finding the lost species is Hell Creek, Montana where treasure trove of fossils is preserved. It is a mixing of fossil carcasses and a layer of glass tektites from meteorite hit with impact impressions deposited minutes to hours after the apocalypse.The Hell Creek Formation in the Upper Great Plains of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota were laid down by ancient rivers and streams as they traveled from the Rocky Mountains in the west toward the east before emptying into a large interior seaway that bisected North America during the latest Cretaceous period. Due to rise in sea-level in the Late Cretaceous, North America was bisected by a seaway stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. The states of NM, AZ, CO, SD, ND and MT were buried under water in a shallow sea that ran from Mexico to NW Canada. At that time the states of CA, OR, WA and ID were on the West and the rest of United States were on the east. The Hell Creek rocks preserve the remains of dinosaurs after Chicxulub meteorite struck into the ocean in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The death and destruction of the most iconic dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus Rex, the three horned dinosaur, Triceratops, the duckbilled dinosaur, Edmontosaurus, and the tank-like armored dinosaur, Ankylosaurus. The fossils also include; crocodiles, lizards, snakes, turtles, frogs, salamanders, fishes, plants and mammals. At this time, the planet was largely one supercontinent called Pangea, but it had started to split into several fragments. Europe and Asia were still globed together, and they were linked to North America by a series of islands. But what made these animals to become big? They had to eat and digest vast quantities of food, they had to grow fast, must be able to breathe very efficiently, and shed excess body heat. This process was enabled by their unique body plan that included a highly efficient lung more related to a birdlike lung because many bones of the chest cavity had big openings. There were many air sacs that extended throughout their body that helped lungs to take in enough oxygen to stoke their metabolism.During the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous, tyrannosaurs flourished, ruling the river valleys, lakeshores, flood­ plains, forests, and deserts of North America and China. Colossal tyrannosaurs never seemed to gain a foothold in Europe or the southern continents, where other groups of large predators prospered, but in North America and China, species of tyrannosaurs were unrivaled. They had become the transcendent terrors that fire our imaginations. The species of Tyrannosaurus Rex was not a global but existed only in North West of United States. On that fateful morning 66 million years ago, when a pack of T. Rexes woke up on what would go down as the final day of the Cretaceous Period, all seemed normal in their Hell Creek kingdom, the same as it had for two millions of years. Forests of conifers and ginkgoes stretched to the horizon, interspersed with palms and magnolias. The distant churn of a river, rushing eastward to empty into the great seaway that lapped against western North America. For the last several weeks, the more perceptive of the T. Rexes may have noticed a glowing orb in the sky, far off in the distance and a hazy ball also had a fiery rim. The orb would appear and disappear for hours. As it appeared again, it was bigger, its shine illuminating much of the sky to the southeast in a cloudy psychedelic mist. Then a flash. No noise, only a split-second flare of yellow that lit up the whole sky, disorienting the animals for a moment. As they blinked their eyes back to focus, they noticed that the orb was now gone. Moments later, and then they were blindsided. Another flash, but this one far more vengeful. The rays lit the morning air in a fireworks display and burned into their retinas. In fact, no noise at all. By now, the birds and flying raptors had stopped chirping, and silence hung over Hell Creek. The calm lasted for only a few seconds. Next, the ground beneath their feet started to rumble and shake, and then flew like waves; pulses of energy were shooting through the rocks and soil, the ground rising and falling as if a giant snake were slithering underneath. Everything not rooted into the dirt was thrown upward; then it crashed down, and then up and down again, the Earth's surface was acting like a trampoline. Everything within a radius of about six hundred miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of modern-day Mexico was annihilated, and vaporized. For several years, the Earth turned cold and dark because of soot, sulfur, sulfuric acid and rock dust in the atmosphere that blocked out the sun. The darkness brought severe winter for years that only the hardiest of animals could survive. The rains were highly acidic that wiped out much of marine species. Here and there, species of lizards, crocodiles, turtles, birds and rat-size mammals made it but with lots of duress under the fury of nature. Hell-Creek was turned to Hell that reverberated in rest of the world."

288,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,5,"Phew! A pop history on Dinosaurs written by a Paleantologist is enough to trigger your curiosity and awaken the science geek in you. However, you do worry about a Ross Geller level book you will be stuck with for ages. Stephen Brusatte is more Douglas Adams than Ross Geller and he tells a story that is at once engaging and enlightening. Imagine a huge jigsaw puzzle that has to pieced together. The challenge is that the pieces are found years apart and you have dedicated science heroes who try to make the best image possible with the pieces they have. And the frustration that lasts for decades when you realise there are missing pieces. That has been the story of piecing together the history of one of the most fascinating creatures that inhabited the earth.What Brusatte has done is not just laying out the facts (and theories) but also a tribute to all the paleontologists who have played a part in building the current understanding. Starting from the Permian period fossils through the Triassic age till the Jurassic and Cretaceous - the author paints a picture that is hard to ignore of complex foodchains, rise of apex predators and the entire evolution journey on fast forward. The journey is mapped through the work of paleontologists, geologists and collectors whose stories, quirks and anecdotes too are part of this book. The history of Dinosaurs cannot be narrated without the history of the planet and hence we get a lot of information on movement of continent, rise of oceans and rise of life in general.There is a chapter dedicated to Tyranosorus Rex (Tyrant King) which almost worships the larger than life (most lives, at least) predators. The author does not miss an opportunity to compare notes and point errata to the Jurassic Park movie, which is the introduction to most of us who are googling images today. The linkage to birds apart, the single mass extinction theory that brought an end to cretareous is more like the dominant theory that most paleantologists subscribe to. He actually describes a meeting of paleantologists in 2012 to discuss the validity of the theory where everyone agreed. This is only what we know.. so far.. A good book that presents facts actually allows you to understand the origin of popular theories without judging them - like the science of Phrenology which took off in the same period classifying human beings from different continents as different species. Today we grow uncomfortable knowing that gave grounds to Eugenics and later persecution of races in terms of superiority. Scientists are impervious to the implications of truth. The book makes you ask a lot more questions and for that reason alone, I loved it. A joyride!"
289,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7039679-ellen,4,"Even though I love dinosaurs, I don't really read science books...ever. So, I was surprised I liked this book, let alone finished it. It was quite informative, especially for those, like me, who haven't been able to keep up with all of the findings in this subject for the last couple of decades. I think I liked this book because it was part memoir as well as science. The author has a sense of humor, and is only three years older than me, so his pop culture and generation comments were right on par. He does mention the film Jurassic Park several times, though usually to disprove some of their science. I only had one complaint: No color pictures! I was surprised how much this bugged me, but as the author described such beautiful landscapes of where he was digging, and then only provided a black and white photograph, the beauty was lost on me. I realize it's cheaper to publish without color photos, and paleontologists most likely don't make bank, but the author is the ""resident paleontologist for BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs"" so I think color photographs isn't too much to ask. The illustrations were lovely though, even if they portrayed the dinos with feathers...I guess I can't deny a lot of dinosaurs had feathers anymore since I've now read this. Dinosaurs just don't seem as cool with them.I will just mention that I have my own personal opinion on evolution. This book talks a lot about the evolution of dinosaurs. I am religious, which probably has a lot to do with it, but I never quite agreed fully with the author on this subject.Overall, I recommend it!2018 challenge: A book with an animal in the title"

They had endured hardships, evolved superpowers like fast metabolisms and enormous size, and vanquished their rivals so that they ruled an entire planet…Then, literally, in a split second, it ended.”Riveting crash course on dino history. Very well done. "
291,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike,1,"D’ya see that subtitle? “A New History of a Lost World”? It’s one of two things: 1) utter bullshit or 2) marketing spin (which amounts to the same thing as #1). There’s no new information in this book. However, it IS a new book, so... yeah. Bullshit marketing.There are some other reasons why I’m giving this a 1-star review. One of the biggest is Brusatte’s continued insistence on ascribing INTENT to evolution. What the actual fuck, dude? No, triceratops didn’t decide to grow horns. T. rex didn’t want to grow teeth. Mammals weren’t “craving” the opportunity to supplant the dinosaurs for 100 million years. If you’re going to imbue intelligent design to evolution then you are one bad week from assuming that an almighty god did it and that the Bible is literally correct.You are doing a disservice to everyone who reads this book, especially to every kid who does so, because you are saying chance doesn’t exist in natural selection and that every species decides what it wants to become. That’s woo-woo bullshit and utterly unscientific. Stop invoking intelligent design. Stop it.In my lifetime there have been a few things which have completely upended our understanding of dinosaurs. Bakker’s insistence that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. (The Dinosaur Heresies) Which now has a mountain of evidence supporting it. Alvarez’s discovery that an asteroid impact in the Yucatán killed off the dinosaurs. (T. Rex and the Crater of Doom) And most recently, Horner’s complete and utter decimation of the plethora of dinosaur species. (https://www.ted.com/talks/jack_horner...)Paleontologists at the time pushed back on all of these theories, but the first two are now widely accepted by pretty much everyone, because the ones who objected have died off. The latter has pissed off paleontologists because some of them have named these “new” species and Horner has effectively wiped away their claims to fame by asking a simple question: “Where are all the baby dinosaurs?” Brusatte doesn’t even address Horner’s theory, probably because he doesn’t agree with it. Except the evidence is compelling.Everyone knows Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law (“indistinguishable from magic”) but not as many are familiar with his First: “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.” Brusatte is in his early 30s, so he doesn’t have that excuse.There are other things in this book which are irksome but don’t rise to the level of anger, such as his constant descriptions of travel. I could not care less which trains he had to catch or the type of trucks he rode in. I guess that stuff was added for flavor, but it’s entirely beside the point 90% of the time. His descriptions of fellow fossil fiends is more on point because it shows the diversity of the (mostly male) dinosaur hunters, but there are quite a few women who play tertiary roles. That’s the one valuable aspect of this book. Minor, but it’s there.He does have a weird way of describing dinosaurs. Herbivores are “plant gobblers” while carnivores are “meat gobblers”. He did mix it up once by saying “plant munchers”, so yay for linguistic diversity. Hashtag sarcasm.You don’t need to read this book. Try those others I linked above. Watch that video."
292,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Was anything that I learned half a century ago accurate, or anything in the Jurassic Park movie? Seems not.... This is very much for dino fans, very readable, but not super-strict on phrasing for best presentation of the science, not enough pictures of models of dinos.So, yeah, the bad: writes of evolutionary development as if it were intentional. Speaks of T.Rex and Triceratops as 'rivals.'* Too many scientific names of species I've never heard of for me to able to keep track w/out those missing pictures. Some awkward stretches for humor.The good: Once I got the hang of reading it w/out fretting that I wasn't keeping track of every species named, I found it very engaging. And, yes, enlightening. And Brusatte does teach something about science. For example he does admit that new finds may overturn current assumptions, and he does explain *how* a lot of stuff that is understood came to be figured out:""We can tell that Rex had some of the largest and most powerful jaw muscles of any dinosaur, based on the very broad and deep gullies on the skull bones where the muscles attached.""One species mentioned early I am going to google image search: Effigia okeeffeae....... and ""human-sized ominvorous theropods called oviraptororsaurs.""... and *The Age of Reptiles* mural.... balaur bondoc""Proper grasslands would not develop until... many tens of millions of years after the dinosaurs cleared out."" (I have to pick the nit of the word choice 'cleared.' Did dinosaurs prevent grass from evolving to become grasslands? I doubt it....)""The Gobi fossils tell us that the ancestors of birds got smart before they took to the skies."" Also got feathers, wings, and efficient lungs 'flow-through' lungs before that, too. ""The feathers of nonflying, winged dinosaurs were a rainbow of different colors..."" discovered from Jakob Vinther's studies of melanosomes, and probably used for display.Walter Alvarez is Luis Alvarez' son.Anyway, you can see that the good outweighs the bad. And no, despite all my notes, you can't skip this book if you're interested in the subject...

""The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs"" should have been called ""My journey into paleontology and hanging out with paleontologists and some history about dinosaurs"", or ""I was an annoying teenager obsessed with dinosaurs, and now I'm an annoying 30-something obsessed with dinosaurs with some nice degrees, here let me show you"". The absurd amount of times this guy hits you with first-person pronouns is outrageous. Let's just stick with the dinosaurs, you know, like the title suggested. Here's a snippet of where I grew most annoyed (talking about one of his expert female colleagues): ""...she can easily work from home, which is deep among the last remaining Beijing hutongs-traditional narrow-alleyed neighborhoods of single-story stone buildings pasted together. Good thing too, because she spends a lot of her non-science time hanging about in the hutongs, raving and occasionally DJ-ing in the trendy clubs of China's suddenly hip capital. Jingmai calls herself a paleontologista-fitting, given her fashionista style of leopard-print Lycra, piercings, tattoos, all of which are at home in the club but stand out (in a good way) among the plaid-and-beard crowd that dominates academia.""

294,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"I haven't thought much about dinosaurs since I was in elementary school, so this was an absorbing and engaging look at what we do -- and don't -- know about dinosaurs at this point. So much has happened in the decades since my youth, and getting caught up was more than worthwhile. There are over 50 dinosaur species discovered each year (!!) and more, science agrees that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs (!!!). I didn't realize that the Burpee, which is just down the road from me, has such a wide dinosaur history, despite the fact no significant fossils have been ever discovered in Illinois. I wish there'd been less about Brusatte through. The moments where it drifted into him nerding out about dinosaurs were weakened a bit when he name dropped. Certainly, those who've done work deserve credit, but doing so in context to how you know that person or have worked with them leans a bit too hard on the ""look at how I've rubbed elbows with famous people"" side. Barring that, readers who are curious about dinosaurs or haven't thought about them since elementary days will find this a worthwhile read.The audiobook worked well, too. "

I was very surprised at this shocking twist ending. I thought T-Rexs lived among us.Exhibit A:And yes, this is a brief history. This covers hundreds of millions (okay, billions but eh, semantics) and compresses a really varied and complex history into an overview so easy a caveman can read it.Aaaaaaaaand with that I'll retire all ancient puns for forever. Anywho, this was a fascinating glimpse into the quickly changing and fast-paced world of paleontology and geology, which were not the dead-end jobs that I grew up being told (""You'll never get a job studying dinosaurs"" they said, so I...never did—also I was never super duper fascinated by dinosaurs and the past because that kitchen scene scared the living shit out of me, so), but are vibrant and growing and uncovering more and more history-altering discoveries each month. It's fascinating and incredible what new discoveries, technology and modern analytics can do—and the brilliant minds that are dedicated to understanding the mysteries of the past.This entire book was amazing, particularly when understanding the billions of years of life that came before humans—and the chain of events that led to humans being able to become the apex predators instead of the vicious T-Rex, who was cut down at the height of its reign (and who had great eyesight and could not outrun a Jeep and could totally crush a car in half with its jaws, so thank you for giving me a false sense of security, Jurassic Park). Additionally, earlier periods of dinosaurs and non-dinosaurs were covered, particularly the evolution of crocodiles (who were scary AF) and also birds.Spoiler alert: birds are dinosaurs.Double spoiler alert: that meteorite did end the dinosaur's reign.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was clearly written, and while repetitive at times it clearly illustrated the vast biodiversity of Earth's history and how various climate changes and environments influence what flourishes were and how simple changes can have dramatic effects in various ecosystems.Definitely a must-read if you want to learn more about dinosaurs and the prehistoric Earth but don't know where to start.But, since dinosaurs are (mostly) extinct, all we can do is attempt to recreate the past:"
297,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I listened to this audiobook during one of my many long drives this last week, and I really enjoyed it, despite some annoying flaws. As y'all may be aware, I love me some nonfiction these days, and when it's well-written and accessible and brings the information being conveyed to the reader (or listener) in an entertaining way, so much the better. History, science, technology, sociology, whatever, I'm into it. This book ticked some of the boxes, but not as many as I'd have wanted. I enjoyed the information being presented, but not the method of presentation, if that makes sense. Lemme elaborate. Stephen Brusatte is definitely a dino-nerd. And I say this with the utmost respect. You can tell that he's excited and passionate about learning about dinosaurs, how they came to exist, and how they came to no longer exist. His writing is well-informed, interesting, and he knows his stuff, and presents his facts and supporting arguments well, whether it's the cause of the extinction event that cause the dinosaurs to become ""extinct"", or the argument that modern day birds ARE dinosaurs and therefore not all dinosaurs are extinct after all. They've just evolved. But, a bit of that gets lost in the overwhelming amount of hard to follow scientific species names and tidbit detail, and there was a lot of it. Discovery of new fossils, the qualities and criteria for distinguishing it as a Bellusaurus vs a Barosaurus vs a Barapasaurus vs a Brachiosaurus... etc. I think, even had I read this in print, this amount of quick-fire detail wouldn't work well, but in audio, it was just overwhelming. I ended up listening to this book MUCH MUCH slower than I usually listen to audiobooks, just to try to follow along and track the myriad dinos and their traits. But then, we come to the Spotlight Sections. Where we spend a lot of time focusing on one dinosaur (or idea) and examining it in detail. Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course, was the dinosaur, because it's everyone's favorite. I did learn quite a bit about them, and it was good information and fascinating stuff, but I wish that there were more sections of detail rather than a few of them interspersed within the general overview jam packed with rapid-fire facts. Then we have the humans. I actually feel a little bit bad about the annoyance I felt about this, but I did feel it, so there it is. Whenever Brusatte would introduce a new human into the story, whether they found one dinosaur bone in their backyard or have found millions of them around the globe, we got as much of their life story as possible in their intro. Don't get me wrong, I am interested in their expertise and why I should trust them and their conclusions, but do I really need to know that they enjoy kayaking? Not really. Let's keep it relevant. Finally, there was the reader. Holy moly, dude, take a BREATH. I feel like this guy was on a deadline to spit this book out. I had SUCH a hard time finding places to pause, because he literally never did. Even between chapters, a pause that might usually go for 2-3 seconds was MAYBE a 1 second pause here. I was NEVER quick enough to pause at the end of a section or chapter without cutting it off mid-word as he started the next section. It was crazy. And this while listening to this at a SLOWER speed than I normally do. O_OBut those complaints aside, this really was a fascinating, informative, and entertaining look at dinosaurs and their history. And their modernity. I loved the science and methodology of the discovery and determination of fossils and how they went about piecing together the lives that these animals would have lived. It really was very well researched, and I love reading books by people who are truly passionate and excited about their work. It does show. I do just wish that it was maybe presented in a little bit more measured of a way so that the reader can really absorb the massive amount of information here. Still, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in dinosaurs, or earth's or life's history at all. There are lessons here about so much more than just dinosaurs, but about time and change and impermanence, but also about resilience and tenacity. The section about the extinction event that wiped out most of the species of life on the planet was harrowing and nerve-wracking, and I'm experiencing it from millions and millions of years removed from the actual event. Such was Brusatte's skill at delving into the detail and bringing the story to life. I was heartbroken for these animals that have been dead for millennia. It was a stark reminder that nothing at all guarantees our time on this rock, but that maybe something new and interesting can be given an opportunity to spring up in our place. "
298,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,2,"This could have been good. Maybe. If the author had stuck to dinosaurs which he didn't when he basically had to mention every person he has ever met in paleontology or has touched paleontology in some way. The first few chapters were definitely full of name dropping, mostly of male paleontologists. Female paleontologists were mentioned only if they were married to another paleontologist or just had their work mentioned while the men got full page biographies and accolades (and the overuse of certain adjectives). I do have to point out one female paleontologist did get a bit more of an introduction but she gets mentioned and then ignored. I know science , in certain fields, can still be male dominated but this felt more like blatant sexism by the author. I mean, the men get full page biographies, their work is highlighted, their connections to others in the field are highlighted, they get treated with respect and admiration. The women are pointed out in relation to their husbands (if married) and might get a sentence about their work. Or just a sentence about their work if they're not married. If these women's work hadn't impacted his own, I don't think the author would have mentioned them at all.The writing and organization are all over the place. This was supposed to be a history of the dinosaurs but this was more a biography of the author's work. And a lot of the material just didn't feel like it was really new and I'm not big into dinosaurs but I knew a lot already. And I haven't read anything on dinosaurs since elementary school, I think. There were times when there should have been less detail and times when there should have been more detail. The few middle chapters did seem to improve (more dinosaurs, less author self-promotion) but it never really got good. I also felt the author didn't seem to know who he was writing for, who his audience was supposed to be. Things were all over the place. This has potential but never seemed to get off the ground. Not worth reading."
299,0062490427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"Steve Brusatte really likes dinosaurs and prospecting for fossils and analyzing dinosaur history. And he is able to communicate that love really well. I enjoyed this book a lot. Brusatte presents the current state of dinosaur knowledge (Note: Spielberg had a lot of it wrong.) and brings it to life. Not just the dinosaurs themselves, but the many dedicated researchers who have made all these discoveries. The writing is lucid and accessible to the non-scientist. Okay, occasionally all the Latin names for different species cause a little eye-glazing, but it's not necessary to remember them to absorb the sense of the text. The description of the day the asteroid hit is especially vivid. And the explanations of evolution as reflected in the dinosaurs were very clear and helpful. I think Brusatte must be an excellent teacher. "
