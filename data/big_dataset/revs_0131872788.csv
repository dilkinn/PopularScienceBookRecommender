0,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,4,"Ramachandran is brilliant. This is a really engaging book book that explores human consciousness by looking at various disorders or patients with brain damage who now function in really odd ways(Ramachandran's usual M.O.). The case studies are fascinating as always, and his commentary on them is what really makes the book(particularly his end notes, which comprise almost half the book). An interesting problem, which he brought up a few times during the course of the book, and which I myself have been wrestling with recently, is the questions surrounding qualia(the quality of our subjective experience). Neuroscience tells us that free will and even the self are illusions, convenient fictions. But if this is the case, why would evolution ever have selected for these subjective sensations? What function do they serve? And how does this mechanism work and how did it evolve? To me those are the most interesting questions being asked in neuroscience right now. "
1,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7963025-barak,1,"There was a close competition between the author's ignorance and arrogance and the jury is still out as to the winner. At the head of the most annoying chapter (out of many others that were only irritating) called ""Neuroscience - The New Philosophy"" the author is quoting himself! (""All of philosophy consists of unlocking, exhuming, and recanting what's been said before, and then getting riled up about it."" - V.S. Ramachandran) - how witty! it seems one can easily rile people up even more effectively without having a single philosophical bone in his body.The author, a neuroscientist and a professor in the department of psychology at the university of California, is working under the delusion that his very narrow expertise, if accompanied with some meager philosophical reading, allows him to reduce psychology, philosophy and even art to neuroscience, by conjecturing simplistic and in the main ludicrous theories. Even in the area where he is supposed to know better, the science of the brain, he keeps proposing different experiments, predictions, mays and shoulds, while adding things like ""this experiment was never done yet, but I predict that..."". How scientific!His knowledge and understanding of philosophy of mind and consciousness-related problems is only competing in its want with his non-existent knowledge in philosophy of art. None of that of course deters him from solving all philosophical problems using the new science of neurons. Clearly if you know where each part in the brain is and some of the functions of these parts, then you can write a book about everything and then end it with the pompous:""By studying these strange cases and asking the right questions, neuroscientists can begin to answer some of those lofty questions that have preoccupied philosophers since the dawn of history: What is free will? What is body image? Why do we blush? What is art? What is the self? Who am I? - questions that until recently were solely the province of metaphysics. No enterprise is more vital [and no one as important as the author of course] for the well-being and survival of the human race [no doubt!]. This is just as true now as it was in the past Remember that politics, colonialism, imperialism and war also originate in the human brain [let alone idiotic books].""Need I say more? (because I truly can)"
2,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,3,"Ramachandran and his work deserve more than three stars. I enjoyed The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human and Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind so much, and learned so much reading them, that I went back to this one, though it's 15 years old. This is more like a sketchy outline of some of the others, just 100 pages in five chapters, and another 60 pages of endnotes (which I didn't read). His looks into the workings of the brain are fascinating. But all of the material was covered, in more detail, in his other books. As with those other books, his ideas about art don't resonate with me. And the casual sexism in a couple of the chapters was jarring. This could be an introduction to some aspects of brain research as it was 15 or 20 years ago. But for anyone with the endurance to read 300-400 pages, Ramachandran's other books are better."
3,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,4,"V.S. Ramachandran is interested in how the scientific study of the brain can clarify some of the philosophical issues pertaining to consciousness (and thus to the mind-body problem). His work is comparable to that of António R. Damásio, although Ramachandran has more of an adventurous and speculative attitude, including a playful sense of humor.Like Damasio, Ramachandran conducts elaborate experiments which result in associating particular kinds of functional behavior with particular areas or characteristics of the brain. Wherever possible, he places the results of his research within the context of evolutionary development, showing how there is some survival benefit in the brain’s developing to support a certain function.An example would be the study of “blindsight” in which a person with damage to the visual cortex is unable to see a portion of his visual field. Yet if the person is asked to point to an object in the unseen portion of his visual field, he can do so correctly and reliably. Such a person has “blindsight,” meaning an alternate pathway for processing vision in the brain, which is not conscious. One is conscious of normal vision, and can describe what one sees. “Blindsight” is vision of which one is not conscious, but which nonetheless is functional because one can point to the object, even though one is not aware of seeing it.In the traditional mind-body problem, there are various threshold definitions for what constitutes mind. Is the mind consciousness? And if so, what exactly constitutes consciousness? Ramachandran has described a laboratory experiment in which consciousness of vision is isolated functionally and associated with a particular part of the brain. He goes on to consider how consciousness of vision may have evolved because it confers an advantage over non-conscious visual functioning.Philosophers such as Akeel Bilgrami have discussed from a purely philosophical point of view (i.e. on the basis of logic and language) the role of self-knowledge in free will and moral discourse. In the context of Ramachandran’s researches, self-knowledge is the equivalent of consciousness, so that Ramachandran has bridged a gap between a philosophical study of mind and a scientific research into the functioning and evolutionary development of the brain. Though I have outlined a simple case, there are many others, and the possibility for further insight seems promising. Ramachandran devotes a chapter to speculating on “neuroaesthetics,” on characteristics of art that are functional in an evolutionary context. He also talks about “mirror neurons” which mimic the reactions in other humans, and which might provide an evolutionary explanation for sympathy and altruism. It seems that wherever science can accurately discuss the terms of a philosophical debate, there is room for progress."
4,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"I have studied synesthesia and mirror neurons as part of my psychology degree at university, and Ramachandran has been a big name on the refference list, so it only made sense to read his books, not just his scientific papers. This is a brilliant account of some of his and his colleagues' discoveries in the field of neurobiology, and I would recommend it to anyone who has a keen interest in the human mind. Beautifully written and backed up by numerous research papers, this book might just be the start of a love affair with psychology, psychoatry and biology."
5,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711341-marfita,3,"Gah! I got to the end and discovered that the notes 11 and 12 from Chapter 5, Neuroscience - The New philosophy, aren't there! You turn to the notes and the last one is 10! Only 57% of this book is text and the rest is notes (very interesting ones!), glossary, and index. Oh, and acknowledgements - which seem to cover everyone Ramachandran has met in his life. Much of the early chapters covers material I've read about in Oliver Sacks's books. Ramachandran takes the case studies a step further by theorizing how specific brain lesions reveal how the brain works and how its abilities developed by evolution. Woot-alors! Many abilities piggybacked on other developments. Wish I could remember what they were! Oh, and we're all synesthetes! Isn't that fun to know? And eyesight is a very, very complicated. It's processed by more than one part of the brain - so if one part of that process is interrupted by a lesion, another part still registers. This means that someone can be unaware that they can see something, yet can point to it. Someone can recognize their mother's face, but because another part of the brain that would attach emotion to it no longer functions, they insist that person must be an imposter. However, they will recognize the voice over the phone and there is no problem. Ramachandran also attempts to explain art ... as an evolutionary advantage. Why are Picasso's abstracts so compelling? Why are Hindu goddesses so over-the-top voluptuous to the point of not looking real? And what's with all the arms? [That last bit should be totally understandable in that the many arms represent the many attributes of the deities and consequently help tell stories without having to make a series of statues.] Although it seems that all our thinking, experiencing, imagining is ""just"" chemicals, that doesn't make all that any the less profound or interesting. For some of us (even those of us struggling to understand), it makes it all the more fascinating; it becomes the Better Story. [Sorry, Yann Martel.]Somehow I managed to come through this without turning into the hypochondriac that The man who mistook his wife for a hat had made me. Well, phew! I only wish I were smarter, that I could remember this material better. Maybe I should own the book so I can keep referring to it! No, not if it's missing notes. :("
6,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957819-jen,2,"There's some interesting information to be gleaned from this book, but Ramachandran doesn't make many solid conclusions, and he juxtaposes his cognitive theories with some completely pointless off-color jokes and unnecessary political asides.In addition, the valuable material presented is hindered by some truly terrible proofreading and rampant errors. In the final chapter, there is a reference for endnote 12. There is no endnote 12 in that chapter.Quite possibly the most jarring science-related error was this, on page 108:...it's like asking whether the wetness of water derives mainly from the H2 or the O2 that constitute H2O.The notes section, which comprises about a third of the book, contains the most mistakes. In just a two-page span, you encounter the following:• p. 158: ""Will a face that resembles the original but is obviously perceived as differ- ent by the explicit (conscious) memory system...""• p. 158: ""This implies that the patient continues to acquire at least some new memories but without the hypocampus, she cannot index them...""• p. 158: ""The key issue regarding hypnosis is whether it is simply an elaborate form of role playing [...] or does it represent a genuinely different brain state?""• p. 159: ""In more direct test Shai Azoulai and I will...""• p. 159: ""Now imagine: I hypnotize a subject, give him two balls A and B of indentical size and weight...""• p. 159: ""But if hypnosis is just extreme suggestibility he should actually say A was heavier 'because its big!'""What I'm trying to say is that it's incredibly difficult for me, as a reader, to take the subject matter seriously when it's riddled with errors like this. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who has similar issues with poor copy editing."
7,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1133317-jeffrey-belcher,5,"To start off, I have never been interested in becoming a doctor in any way, so this is not the type of book that I would normally read. A co-worker who is studying to be a doctor had to read this book for a class, and when I was complaining that I didn’t have anything to read, she said “Here, read this and stop crying.” So I did. And it messed me up. I mean come on, phantom limbs? Pain in phantom limbs? Seeing different numbers as colors? I had never heard of any of those things. And this guy, Ramachandran, his findings are so incredibly simplistic it is ridiculous. Trick the brain by looking in a mirror, I mean come on, no pill or electro-shock therapy? This guy is awesome. Even if you have no ambitions to enter the medical field, reading this is awesome. You learn things you never knew. Aside from the actual science and medical terms that he uses that I didn’t care to understand, (or really want to try to) I lost nothing in the actual understanding of what he was saying. It was very informative and for me, a fun book to read. "
8,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261307-sassa-mifrass,4,"Ramachandran looks at some of the ways we can learn about the brain by seeing at what has changed (structurally) in a brain that no longer functions as we would suspect, such as a person who suddenly feels they are no longer alive, or someone who can no longer connect recognition of faces to emotional responses.He also examines how our brain desperately rationalises unexpected responses to stimuli, which is very intriguing and makes me feel even more highly suspicious of my own perceptions!The therapy utilising mirror neurons for phantom limb sufferers is very fascinating. If you are interested in this subject, you will love this New York Times article: http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/20...I've read so many other books that reference the research Ramachandran has conducted that I had a lot of deja-vu, but as always the more ways you learn about something the better integrated it becomes in your understanding."
9,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10769542-dianne,4,"This was a fascinating and, more importantly, extremely accessible book about some of the quirkier aspects of the human brain. I've read several books that literally required rereading multiple passages to get the drift of what the author was trying to communicate. This is NOT one of those books. Ramachandran spells things out well and clearly. If neuroscience interests you, this is a keeper. If you're one of those people who love watching documentaries about the brain and human behavior, pick this on up. You won't regret it. "
10,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22523784-aimen,4,"I loved this book. Neuroscience has always been an interest to me and the way this author presents various cases and disorders only makes me fascinated more. I enjoyed this book and it wasn't too lengthy or boring. To be honest I only disliked one of the chapters, but only because it didn't appeal to me as much as all the others did! It has a lot of the interesting cases in the Notes so I think it's important to read that. This was a greatly written non fiction book for non-neuroscientists. I'll be looking out for more books by him!"

This book is the real What the Bleep Do We Know. Accessible, engaging, concise...and it's real science, did I mention. Ramachandran has such a thoughtful, unpretentious delivery--he's the left-brained counterpart to Deepak Chopra.Read and marvel."
13,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,3,"Ramachandran is one of the most inventive brain researchers around, and enjoys writing books for the lay audience. He delves into the mysteries of perception, of unusual abilities, and traces them to defects and peculiarities of the brain and its connections. Very rewarding dip into the neuroscience pool."

Not only is VSR a racist bigot, but his research and writing isn't even as good as those forwards your mom sends you once a week which you have to use Snopes.com to prove to her they're fake. "
15,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2251009-esteban-del-mal,2,"Ramachandran's prose grates. I usually skip his articles in Scientific American Mind and this book doesn't offer anything new to the study of consciousness, toeing the strict materialist line very closely."
16,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8402762-mike,3,"Very basic but excellent (necessarily partial) overview; particularly interesting passages about the neurological basis of art, linguistics, and consciousness.Pointless insertions of the author's inconsequential political views (but what's new?).Recommended."
17,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71562638-ian,4,"In A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness, V.S. Ramachandran reviews much of the contents of his earlier book, Phantoms in the Brain, and continues reinforcing his philosophy of neurology with added insights. He touches on much of what makes human consciousness unique--including sensation, awareness, abstraction, and art. Although much of the book is focused on extremely complex topics, Ramachandran simplifies and explains concepts just enough to be understandable to those without much prior knowledge of neurology, while expanding on nuances in his notes. The first chapter of A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness focuses primarily on the basic structure of the brain, and introduces Ramachandran’s overarching philosophy of studying it. He covers some of the neurological disorders in Phantoms in the Brain including paralyzed phantom limbs and synesthesia, a disorder in which people attribute different colors to certain numbers. He revisits much of the contents of this first chapter in later ones, and often dynamically connects the different subjects. The theme of Ramachandran’s research is that by studying anomalies in science, rather than simply disregarding them, you can learn a lot about the functions of a system. He outlines the “recipe” for a scientific revolution, and explains that if this philosophy were widely adopted, it would be of great benefit to science.Although A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness is a fascinating and accessible introduction to its subjects, I suggest reading Ramachandran’s most famous book, Phantoms in the Brain, first. If you are already familiar with neurology and Ramachandran’s work, disregard this. But if not, Phantoms in the Brain is a more in-depth analysis of the experiments that Ramachandran bases much of this book on. Of course, you can read A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness on its own, but I found I enjoyed it more after having been familiarized with the subjects first. "
18,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33541069-adam,3,"Interesting stuff, though the book felt more like a teaser than full-length. Nonetheless, a good introduction to the neurology underneath consciousness, and invites consideration of consciousness as a crossroads between objective and subjective 'reality'. "
19,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4301289-lisa,3,Good for those who are interested in psychology and neuroscience but have little background on the subject. Better for those who have a university background in anything and understand the scientific method.

22,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62651466-dj-williams,3,"a decent overview of topics in cognitive neuroscience, but the author is kind of annoying and it's a wasted read if you're at all familiar with the subject already."

Being a cognitive science enthusiast, I was familiar with a lot of Ramachandran's work from YouTube videos and such, so I worried whether I would learn anything new, but I did. I also got a more thorough understanding of of the ideas that I knew about. Don't skip the notes, they're as good as the book itself."
25,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431670-sarah-gibson,2,"The quote on the front of the book says: ""...belongs to that rare category of scientific book, one as accessible as it is deep"" (Oliver Sacks). I found this book entirely too accessible and not at all deep enough.From a content perspective, I did learn a few interesting tidbits. But I did NOT learn what consciousness is. He's mostly just scratching the surface--not providing enough discussion to really engage you. He is also very speculative, which is fine, but why not provide enough evidence or examples to try to convince us that his theory is right?From a style perspective, this dude is very annoying. First of all, he uses English/American figures of speech which I think he doesn't understand. For example: ""Speculation is fine, provided it leads to testable predictions and so long as the author makes it clear when he is merely speculating--skating on thin ice--as opposed to when he's on solid ground."" (p. x) and ""Artistic skill may be an index of skillful eye-hand coordination and, therefore, and advertisement of good genes for attracting potential mates (the  'come and see my etchings'  theory)."" (p. 55)Second, he throws these random insults about different cultures around as jokes, which seem strange and out of place for a scientist. Examples: ""Every society, every civilization, every culture, has some form of laughter and humor (except for Germans)"" (p. 21) ""Believe it or not, every time you see your mother, you sweat! (And you don't even have to be Jewish.)"" (p. 90) and ""Our brains are inextricably bound to the cultural mileu they are immersed in and, if raised in a cave by wolves or in a culture-free environment (like Texas), we would barely be human"" (p. 108) My problem is that he has not shown that he has any sort of ""social capital"" to be making such jokes. I mean let's say he has a lot of German friends or spent time in Germany and has a rapport with these friends where they make fun of each other's cultures all the time...fine, but a random reader like me has no knowledge of this so he just seems inappropriate! And by the way I don't remember reading any jokes about India.Other things that annoyed me: He repeats content in Chapter 4 that he already explained in just as much detail in Chapter 1. He starts each chapter with a quote from someone, and he started the last chapter with a quote from himself. And he states, quite seriously, as far as I can tell: ""Metaphors are not to be taken literally."" (p. 71) For some reason this statement really bugs me in its obviousness!His other book, ""Phantoms in the Brain,"" may be better...but now I'm not sure if I want to read it!"
26,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/342436-chris-friend,2,"Written halfway through the book:I picked this one up because of the author's interactions with WNYC's Radio Lab. He provides very interesting and thoughtful insights on that program, and I was looking forward to diving into the ""whys and wherefores"" of his trade, his theories, and his experiences. So far, I've been a bit disappointed with how unscientific this book is. I'm sure it's a fault more of my expectations than anything, but it's very, very much aimed for the layman, not the casual, interested, somewhat-educated person hoping to get more than a passing awareness into the science.----Written after finishing it:I finally made my way through the rest of the book, and I have to say, I'm still quite disappointed. My earlier review complained of a lack of ""scientificness"", though I would now complain that the author threw in too many casual references to the names of parts of the brain. (Does telling me that something happens in the ""temporo-parieto-occipital junction"" really do anything to help me understand his point?) There's a fine line between dully uninformative and recklessly technical. Unfortunately, Mr. Ramachandran does an expert job of straddling that line as one would a thigh-high electric fence: he's firmly planted on either side but comes nowhere close to the middle.I was most intrigued by the examples he mentions -- human beings with oddities in their brains can work in the most fantastically bizarre ways. But then he jumps into telling me where the mess happens, instead of exploring the potential implications of those messes or how people overcome or tap into those differences. It was almost like reading ""So here's a cool example. That takes place in this part here. Wouldn't it be neat to know why that happens that way? Alright. Here's another example...."" for 112 pages.Which, BTW, brings me to my next gripe. (Sorry...I'm on a roll.) This book is 192 pages long, only 112 of which are actual ""story"" material. I was just about to write a brief and biting complaint, but then I realized that I was thankful the discussion ended after 112 pages, and that the remaining 80 were ""notes"" that I can easily do without. I'm over it. I did my time--this book took me months to complete because I really never wanted to return to it--and now I'm through. Those extra 80 pages of bonus content might just as well never have been written, if you ask me."
27,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63603066-sarah,3,Interesting book but I found it less engaging and less easy to understand as other popular science books on neuroscience.

Shit, skip the book and just read the notes because that's where Ramachandran's liveliness, enthusiasm, crazy and experiment ideas can be found. He still engages in some piety and monkey-hating, but far less than in the ""actual"" book. It is like two books in one!Still confused? Just answer the following:If you were given the option to read one of the following books, which would you choose?1. One in which you learn the same brain area is activated if you do an activity or if you watch someone else do it. You also find out that people clench their jaws as they cut with scissors. Their jaw is going through the same motions as their hand. As a bonus, your monkey-hatred is reinforced.2. One in which you learn that men who have had their leg amputated can now feel the sensation of the leg in their penis. A guy is quoted as saying his orgasm feels ""much bigger than it used to be."" The author then goes on to hypothesize that transsexuals might have fewer incidences of phantom penises after gender reassignment than men whose penises have been amputated. If you chose #1: read the actual book.If you chose #2: read the notes.(This review is dedicated to the guy who complained about the book only being 112 pages long with 80 pages of notes)"
29,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"First off – if you haven’t read Ramachandran’s Phantoms in the Brain, you need to read it. And I know you haven’t read it. I just looked at the page for that book and noticed that none of my friends has listed it. What’s up with that? Ramachandran starts this book with brief recapping of some of the fascinating neural disorders that he discussed in Phantoms in the Brain along with their implications for answering questions about human consciousness. Here, however, he goes beyond neuroscience to cognitive psychology and philosophy and some personal musing and speculation. The book is rather short, but contains a lot of interesting ideas. There’s a chapter about a possible neural theory of art and beauty. Ramachandran points out that unlike the various philosophical musings on this subject, a lot of what he says can be tested out for correctness. Another chapter is about more abstract notions like self, free will and qualia. My favorite chapter was the one on explaining artistic creativity and use of irony in language with a mechanism similar to synesthesia (an interesting neural condition that results in mixing up of the senses). As Ramachandran himself mentioned, the real book is in the end, in the notes. You really need to read all the notes of this book."
30,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8352718-hannah,3,"I had to read this for a psychology decision-making class, but this book has nothing to do with decision-making (I blame my teacher for that one). The book has five different chapters and lots of notes, taking a crack at different concepts of human consciousness. Each chapter addresses a different theme, and so the chapters don't flow into each other.The chapters start with scientific evidence, mostly from case studies and Ramachandran's own research. The style is very accessible and Ramachandran breaks it down into easy to understand terms, even if you've never had a psychology class before. The bad thing is that Ramachandran loves to theorize about things, and he backs his theories with scientific evidence. However, that evidence comes from case studies and sometimes unpublished data, and so, technically, since case studies are specifically about one person or event, case studies aren't too reliable as scientific evidence. It's impossible to know if one case is representative of all cases or just an exception. That being said, the book is definitely an interesting view of human consciousness, but it's mostly just theories. I advise you to read it with caution, making sure to note exactly when he's talking about scientifically proven ideas and when he's discussing his personal view on theory."
31,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242230-geoff,4,"Although I am not sure Ramachandran intended to do so, this ""brief tour"" serves as the perfect introduction to his other book, ""Phantoms in the Brain."" If you're mildly interested in the brain, then read A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness. However, if your thirst runs deeper, skip this book and go straight for Phantoms in the Brain. There is something distinctly odd about a hairless, neotenous primate that has evolved into a species that can look back over its own shoulder to ponder its origins. Odder still, the brain can not only discover how other brains work but also ask questions about itself: Who am I? What is the meaning of my existence? Why do I laugh? Why do I dream? Why do I enjoy art, music, and poetry? Does my mind consist entirely of the activity of neurons in my brain? If so, what scope is there for free will? It is the peculiar recursive quality of these questions as the brain struggles to understand itself that makes neurology so fascinating."" - Ramachandran "
32,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10466760-tom,2,"A short book, but packed full of ideas. There are three or four different ideas on almost every page -- ideas about the brain and consciousness, of course, but also about evolution, art, philosophy, ethics, and even criminal justice. They're almost all intriguing. Unfortunately, none of them are explored in sufficient depth for the reader to form much of an opinion. Most likely this is due to the fact that book originated a series of lectures. Also, most of the case studies will be familiar to anyone who has read other books on neurology, where they are often explained in much greater detail.Overall, a frustrating read. I greatly prefer the works of Oliver Sacks, or Ramachandran's own, far superior work, Phantoms in the Brain. Ramachandran ends by expressing the hope that he has conveyed ""the sense of excitement that my colleagues and I experience"" in the study of neuroscience. That he did achieve; the book exudes a palpable sense of intellectual ferment. I just wish the excitement had been channeled more effectively. "
33,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2476411-gabrielle,3,"Rama! “It’s too fucking brief!” You skipped, foot to foot, across topics! Explaining two different syndromes in two paragraphs! And they were very short paragraphs, mind you!! I wish to convey to you the lack of beauty and climactic scenes that were so ready to bloom and yet you jumped the hurtle running onto yet another (fucking brief) explanation of another syndrome.However, Rama, the chapter entitled ‘The Artful Brain’ was moving and caused a sharp change in perspective of how one views art or what makes it satisfying or timeless to the mind. I appreciate the tour of Hindu art and the context in which you set it, you see, a new Indian Arts Gallery has opened in H-town and now I can more fully appreciate it!Favorite syndromes, disorders and nouns: Cotard’s Syndrome, Derealization, Depersonalization and Lamarckian Evolution I, by the way, cannot say syndrome in any other way than with a French accent. How silly! It must be the fault of Jean-Dominique Bauby.  "
34,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,0,"Might not need the whole thing because it's a complement to Sacks' works. But Marfita says part of is about a theory of the evolutionary value of art, iiuc, so that'd be very cool.-------Too dated for me. Even the chapter on the neurological underpinnings to the aspects of art that are universal was too obvious, in hindsight. Not a bad book though if you want to read just one very shot intro. to the field. And I do mean short, as a good third of the slim book's pages are actually notes. Now, they're substantial notes, and a thorough reader wouldn't skip them... but the implication of them being in the back is that they are skippable.... (Well that structure bothers me... if they're worth including, either work them into the text or put them at the foot, or best of all, put them at the *end of each chapter.* And content notes should be distinct from referential credits, too.)Anyway, yeah, 20 minutes and I'm done."
35,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,5,"A brilliant study of the neurological basis of human consciousness by a researcher who studies really odd brain diseases and then tries to figure out what they mean for healthy brains. There are the folks whose brains get damaged so that they have blind spots for certain things or parts of their field of vision. They insist that they can't see in a particular way, yet Ramachandran's studies show that when asked to ""guess"" where the (invisible) thing might be, the patients guess correctly 99 % of the time. Ramachandran deduces from this that we have 2 pathways to sight, one conscious and the other unconscious. If one is damaged, but not the other, we can be completely convinced we can't see something, and yet know unconsciously precisely where or what it is. The brain is a very complex and interesting organism..... "
36,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"This short collection of essays came out of Ramachandran's BBC Reith Lectures, and they have the breezy, conversational tone of a popular science presentation. That's well and good if you've read Rama's previous book, Phantoms in the Brain, which contains a lot of the detail he leaves out here. With that done, I enjoyed his speculations into some new areas, particularly on the neurological basis of art and the relationship between synesthesia and human language. But this is definitely a companion book, and one that's really only 110 pages long. It's padded with 60 pages of end-notes (some interesting), glossary, and several pages of acknowledgments. Also, one can't help but get the feeling that Ramachandran is a little too pleased with himself through the entire thing— at one point he actually quotes himself in one of the chapter heads. "
37,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4849147-jocelyn,3,"This was good enough read for what it was - a quick and dirty run-down of some rather intriguing mental disturbances and their usefulness in understanding the human brain, as well as the possible implications of understanding the human mind. I'm one for details though, and every brief glimpse of a patient or study left me wanting to know more, so even though it was designed to be a quick read (and was, in fact, written from a lecture that Ramachandran did) I felt a bit cheated. Perhaps it would have been better to read before having a year and a half of Psychology study under my belt, before I already had more than a basic understanding of the biology and inner-workings of the brain, before I had gained a serious interest in the depth of case studies like the ones used as examples. Ah, well. It was enjoyable and informative, and even funny at some points."
38,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3648143-rob,3,"I picked this up at the library today because I have recently become quite interested in the philosophical implications of neuroscience. This book did not disappoint. Ramachandran begins the book saying he wants to provide an ""accessible"" overview of contemporary neuroscience, and I must say he did so flawlessly. The book is a modified/extended transcript of his speeches for the BBC Reith lectures in 2003, and a rather quick read. He covers topics ranging from phantom limbs to the universal meta aesthetics of art to human free will. Its downfall, in my opinion, is its brevity. Ramachandran acknowledges this in the book, however, claiming that his purpose was not to compile a complete survey of ""our knowledge of the brain."" Probably not a great introduction to neuroscience, but an interesting read none the less."
39,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/765512-jay,4,"My new goal in life is to get a schizophrenic to tickle himself and see what happens.I really like how well the author combines and connects philosophy and neurology. He touches on several concepts that my whacky brain has definitely thought about at one time or another, but that I've never quite been able to verbalize. It makes it satisfying to read, in that sense, even if it does make me feel less special. ;)I wish he talked more about patient interaction though, because I felt like that was a big missing piece. i.e. If you explain to the patient what's happening to them at a physical level, can they understand and possibly affect anything? He touched on it a few times, but not as much as I would have liked.Anyway, good stuff."
40,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533140-cera,5,"This is a quick & marvelous & exciting overview of neuroscience discoveries as of 2003, built on a series of lectures the author did for the BBC. The style is thus quite friendly and accessible, with technical details & wilder theoretical speculation alike placed in the notes at the end of the book for those who want them. Some of this I had encountered before in Ramachandran's 1998 Phantoms in the Brain, but there was plenty of new territory covered. I'm delighted that I read it, and re-inspired to go find more of his work at my local library."
41,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1003570-marcali,5,"Love Rama!This collects his BBC Reith lectures (so some repetition occasionally) trying to discuss the current state of Neurology to appeal to specialists and commoners alike. A great quick read with great footnotes (as he says quoting Sacks: the book is in the endnotes) that conveys his teaching voice wonderfully.Companion read with Out of Our Heads; also found myself thinking back to Our Inner Fish (Rama pondering phylogeny sources for the ""Penfield homunculus), The Philosophical Baby (Gopnik isn't sold on mirror neurons), and of course, lots of Sapolsky's stuff (schizophrenia patterns). Gonna get his Artful Brain next to compare with The Art Gene (also Art and Physics by Schlain)."
42,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,3,"I love neurology, and especially strange syndromes that result from neurological damage or malformations. This book was a quick read on various disorders, but it also discussed human things like art and understanding of the world around us. The most fascinating topic didn't come to the end, and it was a discussion of the self of ""self"" that humans alone seem to possess. Very interesting discussion. Overall I found the book very interesting, and fun to read, but not the best book on neurology that I've ever read. What did make it a bit unique was the focus on unique human attributes like self, and art, and empathy, and understanding abstract concepts, and rearranging things in the mind to come u p with completely absurd and implausible stories."
43,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1193329-stuart,2,"A great conversational approach to a number of cognitive functions (and disfunctions) along with decent bits of history, science and delightful speculation. Excellent endnotes and an awesomely non-sequitur glossary of neurochemistry terms.That said, some of Ramachandran's editorializing is obnoxious, his ideas about psychiatry are painfully outdated, there's some cringe-inducing evolutionary psychology every few pages, and the book doesn't quite get around to accomplishing its aim of ""bridging the sciences and the humanities.""Worth the two or so hours it would take to read through the actual corpus of the book, the end-notes provide a fantastic dock from which to jump into further reading."
44,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18829090-malli,5,"An extraordinary book! Ramachandran approaches neuroscience like Sherlock Holmes. From his extensive work in dealing with patients suffering from Capgras Syndrome ( where one does recognise one's close relatives and instead sees them as impostors) Cotard's Sydrome (a patient suffering from believes that he is dead), phantom limb patients etc, Ramachandran constructs a theory of the mind and consciousness. This is his second book I am reading and one motif that runs across his books is that 'Less is more'. This book has got just 120 pages but he packs in some sensational, scintillating theories. A brilliant neuroscientist who genuinely wants his reader to understand this complex subject matter. I had that warm, fuzzy, buzzing Qualia in between my ears after reading this book. Just wow!"
45,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10553508-badri,4,"Had great fun reading this. Lucid, funny, witty, bold (in going out on a limb with his speculations), but... too short. Effectively little over a 100 pages of text (based on the lecture), and some 50 pages of notes. The chapter on his speculations about the neurological basis of art was utterly fascinating - but abruptly truncated with an excuse about limited space (perhaps time limit in the original lecture). Later on in the notes he mentions a book he's working titled ""the Artful Brain"", but it's apparently not out yet. Despite me professed love for science, I am usually turned off by biology and its unpronouncable names, but this book kept me absolutely riveted and craving for more. "
46,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10168672-stacy,5,"This left me in awe by the end of it. As much as I loved it, part of me was ready to fling the book out the window and scream, ""I am so done!"" Very well written though. I loved how he nearly demands that doctors look at things from a perspective. It goes to show that things like mental illness are neither black nor white. A lot of it is gray - it's not just a question of whether it's psychological of biological, but what if there's something more to it. His writing took an interesting turn, and really made me question my own consciousness by the end of it and it left me a bit dumbfounded. And yet, I loved very bit of it."
47,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632923-carl,5,"A fascinating exploration of neuroscience and art, synaesthesia, metaphor, and self-awareness. I plan to read his Phantoms in the Brain soon, and wish I could find a copy of The Artful Brain to read more on neuroaesthetics."

Plus I absolutely loved ""Phantoms in the brain."" This book though, is very general and doesn't delve in-depth in anything, nor is it particularly engaging. It has a few good points, such as human beings being are as much a product of culture as of genes. This book is indeed very ""brief"" and exceptionally easy to read. It doesn't leave much of an imprint though, nor did I learn anything startling new, as I would have liked."
49,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/664034-briana,4,"This book is a treat for those with an interest in either psychology and/or neurology. Ramachandran provides a handful of fascinating case studies of patients with specific types of brain damage and what they can teach us about how we think and why. The book touches on everything from synaesthesia and blind sight to why we find certain types of art beautiful or stimulating. It's got enough depth to make it thought-provoking, but still manages to be a light, fun read."
50,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447150-nate,2,"---refers to the 2004 hardcover edition---I think the key word is ""Brief"" with this book. I was disappointed mostly because I expected more facts about what is currently known rather than countless (sometimes repeated) thought experiments that might tell us what we want to know. I was also annoyed by repeated anecdotes or comments and misplaced or missing footnote references.I was glad it was short. All in all, I wouldn't really recommend this book."
51,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/121155-sciborg,4,"Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran surveys the rich complexities of the human brain, describing its inner workings based on sensory data of head collisions. The theoretical explorations I found most gripping and stimulating were empirical challenges to Freud's psychoanalysis, inquiries of free will, and studies of patients with phantom limbs or synesthesia. As defined by neurology, a novel paradigm for ""the Self"" will mark a new era. "
52,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1761246-milele,3,"This book is a *tantalizingly* brief tour. I believe it was derived from some talks, which explains its briefness. Some of it almost seemed like brainstorming on what could possibly explain various aspects of human consciousness, and that kind of brainstorming is also probably more exciting and appropriate in a talk than in a scholarly book. So: short, good, but a little frustrating in lack of depth. "
53,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/148949-sara,0,"I'm disappointed by this book. It reads more like Ramachandran's journal of speculations than the more scientific brief tour of consciousness I was expecting. The book is not bereft of science, but it weighs more heavily on the side of speculation than it bills itself to be and, while I delight in some of said speculation (in fact, I even appreciate Ramachandran's willingness to entertain ideas that other more hard scientists might not allow for), I ultimately feel let down."

A must read for any scientist interested in perception."
55,0131872788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478446-adam,4,"Short but full of interesting ideas. It's written in a very conversational style, I think because it might be adapted from some lectures he gave. This is both good and bad. Good, because it's easy to follow. Bad, because he has to be so reductive (to fit into the lecture time he has) that the sometimes there aren't enough details to help you understand. You have to trust his self-assured tone.If you like Oliver Sacks you will definitely love this."
