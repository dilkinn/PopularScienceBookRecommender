It was a palimpsest – a book that was made from the pages stripped from earlier works where the earlier words were scrapped off and a new text was written over it. This was common practice in medieval times when paper was a valuable commodity. The book that was purchased was a simple thirteenth-century payer book. However, that is not what made the book valuable. The real value was the faint impressions of the much older tenth-century writing buried underneath it. It was the earliest writing of perhaps the greatest mathematicians in history – Archimedes.Co-written by Reviel Netz – a Professor of Classics at Stanford University, and William Noel – the Curator of Manuscripts at the Walters Art Museum, The Archimedes Codex chronicles the ongoing, decade-long project to discover just how deep the knowledge of Archimedes went. Archimedes was an ancient mathematician born nearly 300 years before the birth of Christ who made discoveries about the nature of mathematics that are only now being fully understood – 2,000 years after Archimedes first wrote them down.The magic of the Archimedes Codex is that there is no other copy of these specific writings in existence. In fact, even now after ten years of investigation of the text, including the use of brand new technologies never before used for such purposes, they are still discovering more about the extent of Archimedes’ genius. The writing in The Archimedes Codex itself is nothing spectacular, but it is good enough to get the points across. They do a good job of explaining the importance of the mathematical principles in a way that most people can at least appreciate, even if almost nobody can completely understand it. Even so, there are times when it becomes a really dry read, even for me – and I’m an accountant! What is far more interesting is the preservation and recovery process of the book itself. The simple fact that the book survived this long is amazing. The book is literally falling apart and all of the scientists involved are taking monumental steps to do as little damage to it as they can. The lengths that they have gone to in order to extract the impressions of words buried in the paper are fascinating. Already, they have discovered that Archimedes knew even more about modern mathematical principles then was originally believed.The Archimedes Codex itself is not a great piece of writing, but the subject is fascinating to learn about. In addition, this should be a cautionary tale of why books should never, ever be destroyed and why preserving ancient manuscripts by digitizing them doesn’t necessarily preserve everything we might someday learn from the book itself. For that reason alone, this is a good book for book lovers and collectors to experience. It made for interesting reading on a truly unique piece of history."

Here's it's dramatically stressed. Very nice.For more information (in Russian), look here: https://t.me/sictransit/301"
2,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18119369-h-l-ne-wilkinson,4,"This thrilling story about a thrilling book is one of those non-fictional books that is a joy to read. It’s packed full of fascinating information and tells a story of jaw-dropping feats of human ingenuity.What happened to the Archimedes codex is almost incredible. In 1229, the text on the original 10th century parchments was scraped off, the scraped parchment pages were then split into two and written on before being folded and bound, to create a Christian prayer book. The resulting palimpsest (from the Greek meaning “scrape again”) has suffered the attacks of extreme old age, mould and fire and has lost a few pages.The Archimedes Codex tells the story of how a team of conservationists, data imaging specialists, scholars in paleography and ancient mathematics toiled together to decipher the astonishing texts and diagrams buried underneath the 13th century writing. Considerable time and expense was devoted to the project, which is ongoing. An anonymous purchaser bought the palimpsest at an auction in 1998 and deposited it at the Walters Museum in Baltimore for conservation and curating. A comprehensive set of imaging data, together with a Google book version the palimpsest are available on www.archimedespalimpsest.org, ensuring that this privately owned treasure is made very widely accessible. Rumour has it that Jeff Bezos of Amazon fame is the mystery benefactor, identified throughout the book only as ""Mr B"".Of course, with the benefit of hindsight, we can’t help but pause and wonder whether the 13th scribe who recycled the parchment had any idea of what it had originally contained. Let’s give him the benefit of the doubt and say probably not, after all, three centuries is a long time. But what a parchment to pick. The only known copies of the “Stomachion” and “The Method of Mechanical Theorems” have been recovered from it, as has the only known copy in Greek of the famous “On Floating Bodies”. As well as seven treatises by Archimedes, the work on the palimpsest also revealed texts by Hyperides - a 4th century BCE Athenian speech writer - and a commentary on Aristotle.Reviel Netz contends that Archimedes had pushed the notion of infinity much further than anyone had so far appreciated, before a few crucial lines were deciphered in the palimpsest. It’s an exciting thought, and a fitting tribute to the wonderful achievement of giving back to the world some deep mathematical analysis that had been lost for over two millennia."
3,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,4,"This is a well-written and highly readable account of the 20th century discovery and recent high-tech analysis of the Archimedes Codex -- a medieval prayer book that had been constructed by ""erasing"" and overwriting an 11th century copy of some mathematical writings of Archimedes.The authors start by boldly asserting that Archimedes was the greatest scientist who ever lived. Well, some of us may quibble that honor should go to Newton, who mathematics dramatically simplified the known laws of motion, and which led to an enormous stream of scientific and technological advances that continue unabated to this day. Others would argue that this honor should go to Einstein (Time Magazine certainly did in awarding Einstein its ""Person of the Century"" award.) But the authors point out that the work of Archimedes anticipated much of modern mathematics, certainly including the calculus that the Newton many centuries later seized on to formulate the laws of motion.Most of this book is certainly readable by a person with only modest mathematical background. Hardly any equations appear, etc. But the authors do take the liberty of presenting in detail some of Archimedes' arguments, such as his proof that the center of gravity of a triangle is at the intersection point of the medians, and his derivation of the area of a section of a parabola. I personally found these proof sketches fascinating. But for those who do not want to focus down and follow these arguments, these portions of the book are easily skipped. You will still be treated to a very interesting historical-scientific-forensic treat.If you do enjoy this book, another recent book that you will likely also enjoy is ""Decoding the Heavens: Solving the Mystery of the World's First Computer"" by Jo Marchant. I have also posted a review of this book, which, if anything, is even more fascinating than the Archimedes Codex."
4,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2723138-cheryl-boyd,5,"Although the author's writing style is not very polished, his enthusiasm for the subject is infectious and you find yourself drawn into the search for the ancient writings of Archimedes that are hidden underneath the text of a twelfth century prayer book. I'm not a math person but I was fascinated by the early mathematical concepts developed by Archimedes. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the history of mathematics and the history of this ancient text. Very cool."

I found following the paths of discovery and revelation mesmerizing. Restricted to reading during school lunch time, I was able to share the joys of discovery with my students.I recommend to all whether math is your thing or not."
6,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"I thought this was pretty fascinating! The writing is very engaging, but really the story of the Archimedes Codex is amazing enough on its own. The book was written by Will Noel, a curator for the Walters Art Museum, and Reviel Netz, a math and science historian and classics and philosophy professor at Stanford. The two of them alternate chapers. Noel generally focuses on the work done between 1999 and 2007 (when the book was published), by many individuals and using lots of different technologies, to read the Greek text only faintly visible beneath the medieval prayer book text, mold, paint, and general decay; Netz focuses on Archimedes himself--what little is known of his history, the mathematics contained in his various works, and how some of what has been discovered in the Archimedes Palimpsest has actually changed our understanding of history. I had a few minor problems. Netz has an annoying habit of making concrete statements about things that are subjective, or about things we have no way of possibly knowing, which seems odd in someone talking about math and science. I imagine this type of dramatic language is used in an attempt to sweep the reader up in the story, especially in the parts that focus mainly on mathematical formulas, but maybe I am just too literal for that sort of thing and it mostly just served to irritate me. In addition, I found some of his sentences sloppy and confusing and felt that his chapters could have stood a little more editing.On the other hand, as someone who is NOT GOOD AT MATH, I found following the various proofs in this book not much problem at all--Netz does a very good job of explaining them for the most part (other than the very first one, which I had to go look up online to be able to figure out what he was saying about the diagram). Being able to follow along really helped me to appreciate why Archimedes and his writings are so important in the history of math and science.So yeah. Overall, this is a pretty great book on a truly fascinating subject. Totally recommended, if you're into this sort of thing... "
7,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12096563-jessica,4,"Okay, this book is definitely not for everybody, but if you are into archaeological technology, ancient Greece (well, really Sicily, but Greek culture), and especially math, this is an amazing book. In 1998, a medieval prayer book, believed to be a palimpsest, was sold at a Christie's auction to an anonymous buyer who immediately donated it to an academic team he charged with trying to read the underlying text. Half of this book is about figuring out the imaging technology to read the text, which would have been impossible until recently. The other half is about the content of that text, which turned out to be four lost works of Archimedes, one of which suggests that he discovered calculus almost two thousand years before Newton / Leibniz (I'm not going there!). The chapters alternate between the story of the team trying to reveal the text, and descriptions of the text itself and its significance. Kind of a real-life ""People of the Book."""
8,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2158618-judy,5,"Wow! A fascinating story about a parchment palimpset with text from Archimedes, covered by prayers and in some cases, forged full-page paintings -- how experts managed to ""uncover"" the ancient Greek to reveal more of the genius of Archimedes than previously known; how experts struggled to read the text when much was missing -- discarded pages, moldy pages, etc. Written by a mathematician and an antique book conservator, the chapters alternate -- those by the mathematician are harder to follow but not impossible. I am in awe!"
9,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/621005-nadine,4,"A surprisingly enjoyable read, considering that it had a lot of geometry in it, which for me is rocket science. I saw the Archimedes Codex when it came to the Field Museum and thanks to the authors clear and interesting prose, can now throw around words like palimpsest like I know what it is (basically, somebody wants to write something, has nothing to write on, so scrapes off what another wrote, turns the surface around and writes again - usually something far less interesting than what's underneath - in this case Archimedes' work). "
10,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6551109-k,4,"DNF - had to return to the library before I finished it. Would definitely borrow it again though, maybe over the summer break."
11,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6307172-lisa-christian,4,"Early in The Archimedes Codex, Reviel Netz (2007) makes the bold and poetic claim, “The safest general characterization of the European scientific tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Archimedes” (p. 27). In this way, Netz sets the tone and captures both the legend and the importance of Archimedes in western science, history, and culture. For as much as The Archimedes Codex is a narration of the discovery and recovery of Archimedes’ lost works, it is also an argument for his place in western iconography. What Plato is to philosophy, so Netz reasons, Archimedes is to mathematics and science. There is no discipline nor theory nor method that cannot find its antecedents in this scientist’s discoveries. His argument is compelling in its elegance and explanations. Along with co-author William Noel, Netz provides a detailed history of the codex, their processes of preservation and recovery, and their discoveries within Archimedes’ texts. However, the authors’ enthusiasm sometimes leads them to adopt a fanciful language that can undermine their points. Perhaps a more measured tone would not be so easily read nor so appealing to a popular audience, but it would allay some concern with their bolder claims. Netz and Noel begin with the 1998 Christies auction of the medieval prayer book containing Archimedes’ hitherto unknown Method and Stomachion and the only copy of his On Floating Bodies in its original Greek. The book was in fragile condition after “missing” for ninety years. Showing signs of fire and water damage, mold, and missing pages, the book was a far cry from the relatively well-preserved state reported by the Johan Ludwig Heiberg in 1906, when the Danish historian first discovered the faint Greek writing beneath the medieval script. He was able to read enough to recognize remnants of Archimedes’ work, including geometrical figures. Therefore, when an anonymous private collector purchased the work in 1998, he deposited it with the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, MD for display and to allow researchers to preserve and to possibly recover the ancient scientist’s work. Curator of Manuscripts William Noel quickly recruited Netz, a Classics professor at Stanford University and Archimedes expert, as well as a team of imagining experts and preservationists.Besides its fragile condition, a major obstacle was the format of the book itself – the palimpsest. The palimpsest is a parchment or vellum based book, stitched together from many older scrolls or books after being scraped clean of previous writing. Since parchment was expensive and the animal hide sturdy and elastic, this was the preferred method for transcribing works in medieval monasteries. In the early thirteenth century, this was the fate of Archimedes manuscripts in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul). Fortunately, for Netz, Noel, and their team, the medieval scribe was not entirely successful.Netz and Noel proceed to describe the painstaking process of taking apart the ancient stitching to recover the writing hidden by bindings and the book’s spine and the development of an imaging process to capture that writing without disturbing the religious text. Their aim was to recover without destroying – a process which took an entire decade. Their team developed important methods which is and will be useful to other book historians and preservationists. In particular, the team developed a multispectural imagining process that recovers faint images beneath the ""scraped"" surface of vellum manuscripts without damaging pages or the ""dominant"" script. This is, of course, invaluable to other scholars in museums and the digital humanities attempting to recover other works beneath medieval prayer books. After all, this book is essentially a work of historical recovery, particular of scientific scholarly communication, bridging a gap between the ancient, medieval, and present world of scientific communication. These sections can sometimes be a little dry, but they illustrate the complex of archivists and preservationists. Conversely, at times, it can also be a breathless race against time. It is a curious mix of styles that, for the most part succeeds. It also highlights the mix of the authors’ target audience – general and scholarly readers. Such an approach allows for explanations of Archimedes’s findings that an average reader or a non-scientist can appreciate and follow, if not always understand. In fact, it allows Netz the opportunity to explain the visual culture of ancient Greek mathematics, in which diagrams composed the language instead of equations. This is where Netz excels, in his ability to be clear and visual in his explanations, even when explaining the mathematical principles behind the concept of infinity and how Archimedes arrived at that mathematical proof millennia before anyone else (a fact uncovered by the palimpsest).That said, Netz tends to make claims not always sufficiently supported by evidence. For example, after linguistically examining Archimedes’s name by breaking it down into its separate parts, meaning “principle, rule, number one” and “mind, wisdom, wit,” he claims that Archimedes’s father so chose that name for its philosophical importance (p. 36). He does not cite tradition or other sources for Archimedes’s biography. In fact, he dismisses ancient sources, because there is no contemporary nor external evidence to support them. This marks a weakness for the entire book. Neither Netz nor Noel use footnotes, which can lead a reader to question their assertions – particularly those claims regarding the breadth of Archimedes’s influence. They explain, but they do not cite. One glaring incident of this failing comes with Noel’s history of the palimpsest, in which he relates Heiberg’s work in 1906, but does not cite him nor the scholars or historians who haven written about Heiberg’s contributions. This lack of citation is uncomfortable for the scholarly reader. The authors provide a short “further reading” list at the end of the book, though it lacks the breadth needed to cover this topic.The book can also be confusing at times. Netz and Noel alternate chapters with Noel covering preservation and book history and Netz relating the content of their discoveries and explanations of Archimedes’s texts. However, the chapters are not marked by either author and since each chapter pivots from process to discovery, the narrative is jointed. It takes the reader a few chapters to recognize each author’s voice. The book would have been perhaps better served by a Part I with Mr. Noel and a Part II with Dr. Netz. History and preservation process to discovery and explanation – this would have been a more logical and easier read. Still, even with these drawbacks and reservations, it was an eloquent, beautiful read.The Archimedes Codex also includes 42 color images. Most of these images are the codex itself throughout the ten-year project, including several of the imaging process. These images are the most fascinating, as the reader can see as the Greek writing as it emerges. Readers may also view more images and a video on the multispectral imaging process at the project and exhibit website www.archimedespalimpsest.org."
12,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104663342-fernando-pestana-da-costa,4,"This book is the Portuguese translation of the English original ""The Archimedes Codex"". The wonderful tale of the (re)discovery of the Archimedes Palimpsest, of the research that allowed us to read Archimedes' text, and of what we have learned (so far) from it. The book intersperses chapters about the book as an object (its history as well as the techniques for its restoration and study) with chapters about Archimedes and his mathematics. Of course the part about the history of the book is jaw dropping, but those chapters concerning Archimedes' mathematics, both of what was already known and of those parts unique to the Palimpsest (the actual infinity in the Method, and the combinatorics in the Stomachion) are truly great. Our mind really boggles when thinking either about the geniality of Archimedes' thought in the 3rd century BCE, the incredibly hazards this manuscript (a copy probably written twelve centuries after his death) has suffered, and the extraordinary refinement of the late 20th century technology that was needed in order to recover the original text and to have in from of us the words written twenty three centuries ago by one of the most genial minds that has ever lived."
13,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43644694-matt-mccormick,2,"Excessively detailed geometry. I wanted to know about the book – not so much about the discoveries of Archimedes himself. The two-author approach was at times difficult to follow, as it seemed to arbitrarily bounce between each. The writing self was confusing. For example, their attempt to provide a chronology for the book’s early 1900s history is a Minoan maze. Difficult to follow unless you could keep in your mind whom the various French individuals were and how they came to possess or discard the codex.What is clear, we owe a debt of thanks to the current owner. Putting aside their ability as nonfiction authors, we owe an equal debt of appreciation to the talented and committed professionals who brought the previously unread writings of Archimedes to light. Their talents and the strength of modern technology is fascinating."
14,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3540806-christian-hartman,4,"This book was the first time I ever sat stunned by the beauty and absolutely genius of math, specifically how Archimedes measured the area under a parabola using rectilinear shapes. Don't get me wrong, I don't usually go crazy over math, but this was the first time I ever been in awe of mathematics and of those who have the great minds to understand and invent these theorems. An incredible book."
15,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22928412-james-marland,4,"A great read. Not least because I was unfamiliar with the artifact so did not know how the story would end. Great blend of Greek linguistics, mathematics, science and a rollicking ride through history. Reminded me very much of The Turin Shroud."
16,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104380-andrew-austin,5,A deep dive into a palimpsest- uncovering the words of a lost codex by Archimedes a couple thousand years after the fact - what was uncovered and how it was done. VERY technical and lots of mathematics- but not understanding it all does not take away from the wonder of this discovered document and how ahead of his time Archimedes really was. 
17,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5928296-jeroen,3,"Re-read after ten years. I seem to have become more critical :-)Very interesting topic, but no so well written. Also, the maths parts are somewhat disappointing (too simplified)."
18,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2794644-nathan-glenn,4,"This book was an interesting mixture of archival science, manuscript preservation, math and math history, and history. It tells the story of a codex containing several works of Archimedes being passed on through the centuries, being remade into a prayer book (a reworked codex is called a palimpsest) and finally being bought and studied by an international team centered in Boston. It shares the history of information storage on scrolls and codices, describes how such works were created, transferred and stored, and what has become of them over the thousands of years. The authors describe their detective work figuring out the history of the Archimedes text, as well as describing the state-of-the-art techniques used to recover its contents. They ended up taking it to a particle-accelerator laboratory to get it x-rayed. They also describe the way history was changed through new insights from the book. It turned out, for example, that Archimedes used infinity, set theory and combinatorics, all thought to be only existent in very modern mathematics.Although the book has a lot of interesting insights and an interesting story to tell, sometimes it became a difficult read. The two authors, rather than collaborating on each chapter, simply divided up responsibility for the chapters and combined them again into a book. The book is written in first person, but since two people say ""I"" at different times it becomes very difficult to remember who is speaking at a given moment. They each talk about different people from different point of view, and the end result is a very confusing account.I also was very annoyed at the presentation of the mathematics inside. They might take you through several pages of careful proof so the readers can convince themselves of its correctness, only to say something like ""this part would have been obvious to Archimedes"" and drop the proof there. Why take the readers through a proof only to drop them part way through? That is SO aggravating. I found the mathematical explanations inadequate, which is unfortunate since the book is supposed to be about a mathematical genius."
19,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7420470-david,4,"Quite a portrait of an old book, its history, its tragic life, and its wanderings - physically among hands in the continents African, Asian, European, and finally American. It shows the involvement of a dozen scholarly specialists who were brought to contribute their insight, skills, and professional knowledge to treat this heavily damaged book and bring some of the original text under the palimpsest back into view and the Greek characters to be deciphered and and the words interpreted. And to determine that the palimpsest was actually created in April 1229. The portrayal of the operations of a highly skilled professional book and manuscript conservator, Abigail Quandt, is superbly presented throughout this history of one famous book. The author William Noel uses a rather breezy style (one example being the Casablanca Hypothesis on page 168 which begins with a half page on Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman), perhaps designed to reach out to the Walters constituency, the art world public, and more broadly to serve as excellent publicity for the circle of technical specialists and the world-wide society in which they stand out as admired specialists.The illustrative material is very helpful in making clear the technical actions taken and the resultant extent of visual clarity.However, the List of Illustrations concludes with two which are listed as being on the front and back Endpapers - yet the paperback edition which I hold does not have the Endpapers which presumably are in the hard-bound edition. This physically is a well-designed book using clear typography, and somewhat well-indexed (the marvelous colophon on page 216 is not indexed as ""colophon,"" nor is the scribe Raoul indexed, nor is the cloister of St Aiguan indexed. Again, apparently showing that the book is not intended primarily for the bibliographical community but rather for a general audience."
20,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2720349-teresa-tl-bruce,3,"What an interesting, but tough book to read! As a matter of fact, The Archimedes Codex, written by TWO authors, reads like THREE different books dealing with an unusually overlapping set of ideas.1. This is about the HISTORICAL journey of the ancient writings of a brilliant Greek scientist/mathematician who died almost 200 years before Christ. Time and politics were not kind to ancient records.2. This is about unraveling the actual words of Archimedes, from the ONLY surviving source of some of his works previously known only by the allusions later writers made to them. Forgive the pun, but much of this portion was ""Greek to me."" Literally. And since his Greek words explained his reasoning for many geometric proportions, laying the foundations for modern mathematics, including ""the calculus,"" even the English translations were often just as much ""Greek to me."" [I did manage to follow most of the diagrams, proudly!:]3. This is about the scientific struggle to preserve AND decipher the HORRIBLY treated ancient writings themselves. This tenth century copy of Archimedes' writings was chopped in half, its ink scraped away, its pages scrambled, AND its ""erased"" text written over by a scribe in the year 1229. Over the next 700 years it was also subjected to fire, mold, and greedy forgers who then painted over some of the 1229 prayer book texts!"
21,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,5,"""The Archimedes Codex"" is a must read for those with interest in history, history of science, mathematics, physics or manuscript preservation & recovery. The book is not only tremendously informative and educational but also simply, exciting. It tells the story of Archimedes in the 2nd century BCE, the scribes who copied his scrolls into codex (book) form, later scribes who scraped off the Archimedes text and overwrote the pages in the 13th century, a Jewish antiques dealer in Paris who in the 1940's had paintings applied over some pages to 'increase' the value of the book so he could sell it to escape the Nazi Holocaust, how the codex eventually sold for $2 million in New York in the late 90's and how conservators, translators, scholars, scientists and technologist worked to recover the lost Archimedes text, which may well define Archimedes as the greatest scientist in history. It is a truly fascinating story, superbly written, as the tale unravels over 2,200 years. The authors Riviel Netz and William Noel collaborate seamlessly to produce a suspenseful and exciting tale reminiscent of the best of Carl Sagan or Steve Gould or Richard Dawkins. Having written (badly) the above, I'll now say I am inadequate to properly review it. But don't let this cumbersome review discourage you from enjoying this magnificent work. "
22,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1752430-drew,2,"Like several other reviews of this book, I thought it should have been two short volumes instead of one. The two authors tell two stories, alternating chapters between each other. The stories are very different in that Noel tells the story of the actual manuscript over time while Netz focuses on the mathematical content of these found Archimedes items. Their authorial voices are very different so it’s a sudden jerk as you go between chapters. I’m not sure if better editing would have helped as these were just two distinct stories to be told.Netz’s hagiographic view of Archimedes put me off throughout his chapters. I’m sure this is mostly due to having devoted, necessarily, an incredible amount of time and effort on this one important project. But, it seems as if that focus pushed out other considerations of the material. It seems that Netz knew what he wanted the manuscript to say and then finds examples of his ideas in the material, instead of the other way around. He might be right but I didn’t feel he made his case as best as he could.Rating this was a bit tough as I was much more interested in the discovery and recovery of this palimpsest. I’d rate the topic a 4. I’d give 3 for Noel’s chapters on the history and work on the physical item. I’d give Netz’s chapters a 1-2. So, overall, I went with 2 for this work."
23,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/532334-jeroen,4,"I liked this book primarily because of the way the discovery of the palimpsest (and the information therein) is told. It reads like a suspense/thriller novel. I was less charmed by the failure of the writers to remain critical about the influence of ingorance and religion upon the systematic distruction of knowledge. The authors are so enormously happy and thrilled about the fact that the palimpsest remains through its (unknowing) inclusion in a prayerbook, that they cannot escape the (all to human) fallacy to confuse chance with intent, and therefor cannot help but eventually be thankful of the whitless monk who ruined a scientific masterpiece. So in the end the authors show they do not fully grasp the apparently Archimedic science of stochastic events (so Stomachion reveals us). It is by mere chance that the palimpsest remains and no one should be thanked. It should serve to remind us that it is easier to destroy than create and that ignorance should be battled whenever and wherever as to minimize the chances of these things happening again and again and again...."
24,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4501999-jim-george,3,"Archimedes was a mathematician in 200 BC, he wrote his theorems of mathematical sciences in a bound manuscript. Centuries later in a monastery, some unknowing monk painted over Archimedes work, and wrote out a prayer book. In 1998 at a Christies Auction this prayer book sold for 2 million dollars, the owner turned it over to scientists to decipher the buried theorems. These scientists using complicated highly advanced MRI equipment were able to read beneath the monk's text. Archimedes invented the physical treatment of pure mathematics, he figured out how to compute the center of balance for any object, he unveiled mathematical rules for infinity in what became later known as physics. He laid many of the foundations for modern science. He was a mathematical genius, and is credited with laying foundations that aided Newton, Galileo, Di Vinci, etc. It should be noted that his theorems were written in other manuscripts, found at different times and places in history, somehow this appears to be the only surviving manuscript."

Things I didn't like: uneven tone and style (almost inevitable with multiple writers) and setting up straw villains (I think only a naive reader wouldn't believe that his scribe-bashing is going to ""turn around""). Things I very much did like: getting a sense of Greek mathematics (especially the reliance on diagrams -- that was really well explained, especially in terms of how different a way of thinking it represents) and detailing the difficulties in dealing with the physical object.One thing that bothered me throughout the text: the insistence on Archimedes influence whilst simultaneously hammering home how much of his work was buried and lost over the years. I was left wondering at the end whether he really was influential, or whether he was a genius who had to have his work re-discovered by others over the centuries because his original work was lost..."
26,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974182-kathleen,4,"A description of the purchase and revelation of previously unknown texts by Archimedes and others through a 13th-century prayerbook written on a palimpsest, written in alternating chapters by the museum curator who organized the investigation and a mathematician who specializes in ancient science.An enjoyable read, which charts the growth of Noel's understanding of the importance of this ""moldy, illegible, legally contentious old book"" and explains the importance of the mathematical diagrams it contains. Part detective story, part puzzle, part more math than I wanted to stop and understand completely, but which I enjoyed nibbling at. This was sold to accompany a fascinating exhibition at the Walters Art Gallery of pages from the dismantled prayer book, and images of the revealed undertext. I did not find it at all hard to distinguish the authorial voices and enjoyed the different points of view."
27,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27855323-allen-murphey,2,"Reviel Netz's book was alternatingly a fascinating commentary on how the trail and the contents of a centuries old manuscript was carefully and scientifically peeled apart, layer by layer (at times literally), and a maddeningly long exploration into minutia of Archimedes's style and content.Netz would have been better advised (and we'd been better off) to have split this book into two volumes. Then book lovers could have had what they were hoping for -- a detective story centered on one of the world's oldest surviving manuscripts (and arguably one of the most important) -- and fans of mathematics could have been transfixed by insights into the thinking of one of history's most important original thinkers.In this case, the sum of these two interesting halves adds to much less than it could have been. Less would have been more.>>Support independent bookstores by buying real books from real stores where you can talk with real booksellers.<<"
28,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/201411-ron,5,"This book is almost completely excellent. The story is compelling from multiple perspectives, from the history of mathematics to the technology of writing and its preservation to the surprisingly exciting life of a classics curator at a museum in Baltimore. I admit to knowing nothing of medieval or ancient palimsests or other writing vehicles, yet I was mesmerized by the minutiae of the treatment of the relic, and the expertise that it embodies, as well as the expertise necessary to read it. If I have any beefs (or is it beeves?), it would be the overplaying of the Indiana Jones elements of some of the discoveries, and a bit of stylistic condescension of the type sometimes found in writings by academics in works intended for a mass audience. These are minor irritations, though, and did not in any meaningful way diminish my enjoyment of the book."
29,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1276600-dan,5,"Interesting take on the life of Archimedes as we see him from the present and from other ages. I am currently reading the book, and what strikes me, is that everything we think we know about Archimedes is from people writing about him three or four hundred years later. It is amazing that his work came through the middle ages. It is obvious that knowledge was not respected in those age. It is incredible that throughout time, knowledge hab been destroyed at regular intervals. Hopefully, we mankind has grown, and knowledge is more protected from destruction now. The process by which details about Archimedes are theorized is interesting. The book details the logic by which these archeologists are able to determine the accuracy of the CODEX C book. I'm still reading the book so I haven't got it all, but I am truly enjoying the book."
30,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29803086-jock-mcclees,5,"This is 3 books in one. It is about an ancient book, over 1,000 years old that was on parchment (animal skin). Originally it was some of the works of Archimedes. However, it was reused as was commonly done by scraping the surface and writing over it. Its next use was as a prayer book. One thread is about the history of the book itself. Where it had been and who owned it over history which was a detective story in itself. Then, because the book was in such bad shape, the second thread was about the elaborate steps and methods used to be able to see what was on the page. They used varying wavelengths of light and a variety of other techniques. The third thread was deciphering the math of Archimedes. For some I needed pencil and paper to work it out but I found it interesting. Probably not for everyone. My wife loved the book too, but mostly skipped over the sections on the math. "
31,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,3,"This book will be interesting to those who like the history of science and mathematics. However, the story extends into expositions on how information has been saved and passed on from century to century, a discussion of the codex (book) format as a major technological breakthrough over the scroll, and the scientific tools used to decipher a palimpsest. The book suffers at times from being co-written by a museum curator and a Greek/Ancient Mathematics scholar. The voice is not consistent, and their individual personalities come through in their writing. I would have liked more discussion on the latest techniques being used to reveal the writings hidden in the palimpsest. Altogether, it is a pretty good book on a compelling subject. See the NOVA special for more background."
32,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2194759-kevin-furr,4,"Greek mathematician Archimedes lived around 250 BC. No surprise that none of his original papyrus scrolls has survived. What did surprise me was than not one single Dark Ages-era copy of a copy of his texts has survived either -- except for this one last thousand year-old bundle of animal skin. And it's been unbound, erased, scraped clean, rebound, written over by monks, glued together, painted over and gone moldy through centuries of being shuttled and hidden everywhere from Constantinople to Jerusalem to Chicago. So this is the story of how a generous rich undisclosed patron [rumored to be Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, but that's not in the book] bought it for $2 million, and had a team of experts spend a decade teasing out every last bit of Archimedes' lost secrets."
33,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1107377-david,5,"The two authors, Netz a historian of math and Noel a museum curator, take turns telling the incredible story of a long-lost manuscript containing some unknown works of Archimedes. Noel enjoys telling the story as if he were writing an Indiana Jones screenplay. The manuscript was bought at auction by a shadowy benefactor who spares no expense to hire the best scientists to unravel the palimpsest's secrets. Netz details what was already known about the genius of Archimedes and shows how the discoveries in the new manuscript only bolster that opinion. The math stuff is a bit hard to follow, but the two voices make this book very readable and engaging."

The German magazine also refutes several key points about previous scholarship of the book. The book completely avoids controversial ownership disputes, Der Spiegel gives the salacious details.There are actually (at least) two authors of this book, and they all refer to themselves as ""I"" without identifying who is writing. Some aspects of the book cover project management, others about the science of book preservation / restoration, and others about photographing the pages.

I wish I'd had the patience and time to work out the math proofs...and if I'd really set aside the time for it, I would have. But not at this point in my life. Good to read, informative. I think I'll be picking up a book on Archimedes...a different book.I agree with the reviews about the uneven tone, but I didn't mind it so much. I wish they had told me when they were switching authors."
36,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/391903-nick,3,I enjoyed learning about Archimedes and what he and other ancient Greeks were able to discover about math and science. They apparently knew quite a lot. The story of the codex itself was interesting too. How a nearly destroyed medieval prayer book contained the only copy of some of Archimedes' writings.What I disliked was how the story was told. It was told from the point of view of the men who helped conduct the research. The tone was rather dry and academic. I can't help but think how a more capable story teller would have made the material come to life more.
37,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7730833-matthew,3,"This was a really interesting look into ancient manuscripts as well as into the mind of an ancient mathematician I really didn't know very well. Overall, I really enjoyed the book; however, the narrative choice of having two different writers using I, as well as the writing ability of the two authors leave something to be desired. Yet, the subject material definitely makes up for the writing style, and I would definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of science, science and classics, or ancient mathematics. One final thought... thank you Mr. B. "
38,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43543774-sandra,4,"Fascinating look at dumb luck, preservation, sheer determination, and greed destroying knowledge. Oh, and some geometry and calculus.Both stunning in the historical knowledge pried from the dustbin books and one of those 'why couldn't that have been preserved' what ifs. How would the would have been changed if we'd had calculus nearly 2000 years earlier? (Beside that I might have actually understood it. Archimedes was approaching calculus through geometry and I think this is the closest I got to actually understanding it viscerally.)"
39,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1118264-william,4,"A very interesting look at mathematical archeology, and the clever techniques the team used to decipher their discoveries. It is unfortunate that the progress of science over the last two thousand years suffered such a great loss of knowledge through the 300 - 1400 centuries (much like the stock market these past 10 years), but fascinating to learn how the ancients made even more progress than we had before given them credit. If only we could have complete copies of all of their works!"

But I found the sections written by Netz were more difficult for me to read; he adds valuable perspective to the importance of Archimedes' discoveries in the history of math/science, but I didn't feel like I ""got"" what most of these discoveries were."
41,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16981354-br,4,"A fascinating look at ancient mathematics and the science of preservation and restoration. I found myself wanting to see more of the mathematics behind some of the diagrams and propositions; this book covers them in a mostly cursory manner, aside from one or two truly surprising theories. It's amazing what Archimedes was able to prove so long before the development of calculus and combinatorics.If you have any interest in mathematics or ancient Greek history, definitely check this book out."
42,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47477168-simon-tyler,4,"An interesting book where the authors take turns in telling complementary stories. Netz tells the story of Archimedes, his maths and what was learned from the codex. Noel follows the text found in the codex through history, tracing its transformations, its near brushes with extinction and its recovery through imaging science. I learnt a lot from reading this book, but both narratives leave you wanting to know more - often about details that are lost to history."
43,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/277281-katie,4,"This is a fascinating and easy read that pulls together history, manuscript studies (paleography), mathematics, and modern science in an approachable and interesting way. The only difficulty I had with parts of this book was in following some of the mathematical reasonings of Archimedes, but hey, I'm no mathematician, so that's not terribly surprising. :)"
44,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3563889-joshua-zucker,4,A great story of an amazing manuscript. I wished for more discussion of the math and the actual contents rather than of how the material was recovered.

No fault of the author, but in specific sections of the book, I really needed to be able to flip back and consult the diagrams, and on a Kindle this is annoying. "
46,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,4,"A very good history of a unique manuscript. A bit of accessible mathematics, hidden history, and textual criticism thrown in make this a good read; both authors lack of writing experience do detract a little.

48,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12231612-simon,5,"There was - surprisingly? - a lot to say about this mouldy old palimpsest. The authors take it in turns to give us the fascinating story of the reading of the almost completely hidden text, and the maths that was being uncovered.

53,030681580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060514-antimidas,5,Good book on radical new manuscript conservation efforts. The background on Archimedes and how our understanding of him should change is valuable. I only wish they included the translated new texts discovered in the manuscript.
