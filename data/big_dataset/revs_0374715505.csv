0,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"This surprising book took me places I had not at all expected to go. Our sense of self, life, the world, and their meaning all rely on consciousness. While we all sort of know what we mean by “consciousness” and can talk loosely about it, we cannot precisely define it. This is not just a matter of semantics. We can’t quite wrap our conscious minds around the concept. That alone is pretty weird.Gazzaniga is a brain scientist, and his approach is scientific rather than philosophical. Science’s view of the brain sometimes comes down to regarding it as a sort of machine, one of whose byproducts is the evolutionarily useful illusion we call consciousness. Gazzaniga’s decades of work have convinced him that this is too simplistically reductionist a view. He and a number of other scientists began to see things differently. Machines did not spawn brains, evolution did, and then brains invented machines. “Brains aren’t like machines; machines are like brains with something missing.” This led to reexamining more-basic scientific assumptions, such as the idea that biology, the study of life, is simply an offshoot of physics and chemistry. What if instead physics and chemistry are simpler, neater subsets of the larger world of biology? What if life is a different sort of physical substance than inanimate matter? It certainly acts differently, always busy self-organizing, self-transforming, and self-reproducing rather than just sitting there like, well, a rock.Gazzaniga has not embraced dualism, the concept of coexisting material and nonmaterial worlds, brains and spirits. He looks instead to complementarity, the idea that matter can exist in two different states at once, such as light being simultaneously both particles and wave. Perhaps living matter must be in two different states at once.This book too seems to be in two states at once: hard science and the conceptual framework, some of it speculative, needed to make sense of the subject. This complementarity results not in an answer but a far deeper understanding of the question. The quest to explain consciousness may yet transform or crumble all we thought we “knew” about not just ourselves but also the world."

It is ever present and has been since there has been life - interesting, maybe. Not sure if it is confused with 'soul', free-will, human essence, or is all three. You may have better luck. The writing is not bad, it may be my inability to understand the subject. If the subject interests you, it may be worth your time. Nicely noted, so it may lead you to further fruitful reading. Good luck."

3,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18166904-phillip,4,4.25 / 5.0 Very nice intelligent man. Develops readers understanding of his latest theories on the neurobiology of consciousness at a steady easily accessible flow. Simple elucidating analogies are intuitive. My only criticism is with his discussions of the role of evolution. He phrases discussions as if organism had to evolve in a certain way to make full use of systems possibilities rather than than that the organisms that made best use of the systems possibilities out competed those that didn't and evolved accordingly.Good Stuff!

5,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"A very useful and thorough review of the progress that has been made in the last couple of decades in understanding the nature of mind and consciousness from a scientific perspective. There is also a well argued section on why philosophy failed to shed much useful light on this problem for two millennia, other than raising extremely useful questions. Perhaps that is why need philosophy -- to raise good questions, and we should not look at philosophers to explain the world we live in.The last part of the book tries to connect quantum mechanics and the inherent unpredictability of the microscopic reality to explain why biological systems are qualitatively different from the inanimate world. By extension, the author claims why consciousness is not reducible to simpler mechanisms at a lower level. He is definitely not a mystic, and fully believes that consciousness is a physical phenomenon, but he believes that the physics of it is such that only biological systems can display this property, and therefore a machine can never be conscious. I had a hard time understanding his argument here, but I am not knowledgeable enough in this area to refute it either. A lot of food for thought, and will try to explore this avenue further."

What is consciousness and how does it emerge from the physical meat of your brain tissue?A fascinating question, and of course, we don't know and probably never will, but it's interesting to think about. This book included a wide range of topics, not just in biological but also ancient philosophical theories of what makes humans more self-aware of our situations than other animals (or, are we...?)I was more interested in the science and less in the history and philosophy aspects, but that's just me. Also, I am increasingly annoyed by the recent plague of science books that aim to bring science to the masses by being humorous. Yes, I do need you, the author, to dumb it down for me, but spare me the stand-up comedy routine.But it was an interesting read, if you can deal with the frustrating of reading a long book about something that we only know .05% about."

8,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93716277-edwin-wong,3,"Contrasting Viewpoints on ConsciousnessGazzaniga starts by outlining the major theories on consciousness. There are the reductionists and materialists (e.g. Freud and Galen) that believe that mental states and consciousness arise from material interactions between neurons, atoms, and molecules. The reductionist and materialists are deterministic in outlook. Determinists believe that the future follows rigidly or is “determined” by the past. Behaviorists, such as Skinner, form a subset of this worldview.Then, thanks to Descartes, there are the dualists. To the dualists, mental states, the mind, and the soul are separate from the material body and brain. Dualism, according to Gazzaniga, set back science two thousand years: Aristotle, while he believed in a soul, also believed that the soul dies with the body. According to Descartes, the soul was immortal and immaterial, and being an “essence,” was not subject to scientific scrutiny.Then, there is a third theory called mentalism. Mentalists such as Roger Sperry and Michael Gazzaniga himself believe that “emergent mental powers must logically exert downward causal control over electrophysiological events in brain activity.” In other words, mental states, the “I,” and consciousness can impact and alter the physical brain. In the 1970s, the mentalist camp was a small minority. Most scientists were materialists.The New ParadigmIn The Consciousness Instinct, Gazzaniga offers a new paradigm to break free from the old debate between materialists, dualists, and mentalists. His new paradigm of consciousness is based on the latest breakthroughs in understanding how the brain works and also his observations of how people with broken brains function. According to Gazzaniga:Today we have at our fingertips a vast amount of rapidly accruing new information, and with a little luck, it affords new perspective on how the brain does its magic. The ideas of Descartes and other past thinkers that the mind is somehow floating atop the brain, and the ideas of the new mechanists that consciousness is a monolithic thing generated by a single mechanism or network, are simply wrong. I will argue that consciousness is not a thing. “Consciousness” is the word we use to describe the subjective feeling of a number of instincts and/or memories playing out in time in an organism. That is why “consciousness” is a proxy word for how a complex living organism operates. And, to understand how complex organisms work, we need to know how brains’ parts are organized to deliver conscious experience as we know it.Descartes believed that consciousness arose from the pineal gland in the brain. Gazzaniga and other neuroscientists understand otherwise. It’s always easier to see how something works by looking at how broken specimens function, and the brain is no different. By looking at people with broken brains, we now know that the brain is a modular organ, built up from many discrete modules, each with its own function and history in the evolution of the species. When one module, or multiple modules are damaged, consciousness remains. What this tells us is that consciousness does not reside in a specific area of the brain. Consciousness is a phenomenon or epiphenomenon that arises from the feedback between the different modules of the brain. It is a deep-rooted function which is incredibly hard to stamp out, even in the most damaged brains.Split-brain patients offer the strongest testimony to how consciousness is not tied to a specific neural network:Disconnecting the two half brains instantly creates a second, also independent conscious system. The right brain now purrs along carefree from the left, with its own capacities, desires, goals, insights, and feelings. One network, split into two, becomes two conscious systems.They used to–and perhaps they still do–perform split-brain surgery to cure epilepsy. The surgery works, and after the nerves between the two cerebral hemispheres are cut, consciousness is also cloven. Here’s an interesting story Gazzaniga shares of Case W.J. After his split-brain surgery, Gazzaniga had tested him to see the results of the surgery:More crazy yet, in the early months after surgery, before the two hemispheres get used to sharing a single body, one can observe them in a tug-of-war. For example, there is a simple task in which one must arrange a small set of colored blocks to match a pattern sown on a card. The right hemisphere contains visuomotor specializations that make this task a walk in the park for the left hand. The left hemisphere, on the other hand, is incompetent for such a task. When a patient whose brain has recently been split attempts the task, the left hand immediately solves the puzzle; but when the right hand tries to attempt the task, the left hand starts to mess up the right hand’s work, trying to horn in and complete the task. In one such test, we had to have the patient sit on his bossy left hand to allow the right to attempt the task, which it never could accomplish!If consciousness does not arise from a specific area of the brain, and the dualists and reductionists are mistaken, then from where does it arise? Gazzaniga’s calls his solution complementarity. It’s sort of an awkward word, but I see how he came up with it: the word is a bold rejection of Descartes’ term duality, or the mind – brain split.ComplementarityThe physicists posit that there are two worlds. There is the world of classical physics. This is Newton’s world. The world of objective observers. Processes are deterministic and predictable. Objects in the classical world can be waves or particles, but not waves and particles simultaneously. There is a spooky force over distance (e.g. gravity), but they got over this centuries ago. Classical physics explains the macro world (larger than an atom) quite well. Then there is the world of quantum mechanics. Einstein, Bohr, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and others came up with this model to explain the subatomic world. This is the world where there are no objective observers. Observers, by observing, alter the system. Processes are probabilistic and unpredictable. Reality is spooky as objects in the quantum world exist as a blur, as both particles and waves simultaneously. It is only the law of large numbers that levels out the blur so that material objects appear concrete. Complementarity describes how subatomic objects exist as both particles and waves simultaneously.The observer plays a crucial role in the quantum world. By observing quantum processes, the observer collapses the complementary reality of the subatomic object into either a wave or a particle. Choose one experiment, light acts like a particle. But choose another experiment, light acts as a wave. Physicists refer to the inescapable separation of a subject (the measurer) from the object (the measured) die Schnitt. It seemed that human consciousness played a role in collapsing quantum wave functions.But was human consciousness required in breaking down quantum wave functions. Theoretical biologist came up with an amazing breakthrough when he argued that lower levels of consciousness was able to do this. How low?Pattee proposes that the gap resulted from a process equivalent to quantum measurement that began with self-replication at the origin of life with the cell as the simplest agent. The epistemic cut, the subject/object cut, the mind/matter cut, all are rooted to that original cut at the origin of life. The gap between subjective feeling and objective neural firings didn’t come about with the appearance of brains, it was already there when the first cell started living. Two complementary modes of behavior, two levels of description are inherent in life itself, were present at the origin of life, have been conserved by evolution, and continue to be necessary for differentiating subjective experience from the even itself.What Pattee claims is that quantum measurements do not require the physicist-observer. Quantum measurements can take place even on a cellular level. For example, enzymes such as DNA polymerases perform quantum measurement during cell replication.DNA, Materialism, Symbols, and LifeMaterialists say that DNA, being made of chains of atoms, must obey the laws of nature. But, according to Pattee, the materialists don’t see that DNA is also a symbol: it contains the description of the organism. And while DNA contains the description of the organism, it is not the organism in itself. To turn DNA into the organism, two separate steps are required: translation and construction. RNA and other proteins and enzymes “read” the DNA to translate DNA and construct the organism. If the physicist-observer is the highest level of consciousness, the simplest level of consciousness, according to Gazzaniga and Pattee, is the RNA reading the DNA. Like how the physicist-observer observes subatomic particles, so too, the RNA observes the DNA sequence. At the very beginning of life, there was observation. And this observation was carried up to higher and higher levels of consciousness by evolution so that, to continue the analogy, the DNA is likened to the physical brain and the RNA likened to the subjective experience of “I.” This is an exceedingly bold claim.From Whence Consciousness?So, “consciousness” began with the beginning of life from when RNA and other bondmaker molecules “gazed” onto the DNA template or blueprint. This gaze between RNA and DNA eventually became human consciousness. But where does our consciousness arise? Gazzaniga uses a soda water analogy to illustrate consciousness. Each module of the brain produces conceptual bubbles that rise to the surface. The “I” is what lies at the surface, and whatever bubble happens to have surfaced constitutes the “I.”The History of IdeasFor those of you interested in the history of ideas, there’s a story on thermodynamics that Gazzaniga relates that reminds me of a question the astrophysicists are tackling today:Still, even though Newton’s view of things took some getting used to, his laws seemed to describe most observations of the physical world well, and they became entrenched over the next two hundred years. But soon there was a new challenge to Newtonian physics that had to do with a new invention: the steam engine. The first commercial one was patented by Thomas Savery, a military engineer, in 1698 to pump water out of flooded coal mines. Even as the engines’ design improved, one problem continued to plague them: the amount of work they produced was minuscule compared to the amount of wood that had to be burned to produce it.The early engines were all super inefficient because way too much energy was dissipated or lost. In the wholly determined world that Newton envisioned, this didn’t make much sense, so the theoretical physicists were forced to confront the puzzle of the seemingly lost energy. Soon a new field of study emerged, thermodynamics, and with it a change in theory about the nature of the world.Does the story of the missing energy remind anyone of the astrophysicists’ search for dark matter? For galaxies to spin and move through galactic superclusters, they would have to contain much, much more matter than that which we can see. It’s been argued that up to 85% of the mass of the universe has not been discovered. Just as the physicists created thermodynamics to explore and find where all the missing energy in engines was going, perhaps we’re on the verge of a new branch of physics that will discover new laws and properties of matter heretofore unknown. What I’m saying is that the history of ideas seems to recur.The Chicago SchoolI had known about the Chicago School of economics. I didn’t know there was a Chicago school of biology as well. Gazzaniga relates how the Chicago School of biology is, at bottom, anti-reductionist:As Rosen, his [Rashevsky, one of the founders of the Chicago School] student describes, “He had asked himself the basic question: “What is life?” and approached it from a viewpoint tacitly as reductionistic as any of today’s molecular biologists. The trouble was that, by dealing with individual functions of organisms, and capturing these aspects in separate models and formalisms, he had somehow lost the organisms themselves and could not get them back.” He came to the realization that “no collection of separate descriptions (i.e. models) of organisms, however comprehensive, could be pasted together to capture the organism itself…Some new principle was needed if this purpose was to be accomplished.” Rashevsky dubbed that pursuit of the new principle relational biology.Closing ThoughtsGazzaniga talks about how patients who have undergone split-brain surgery develop two separate consciousnesses. Presumably, if you tied back the nerves between the two hemispheres of split-brain patients, consciousness would merge back into one. Now, what if you were to wire together separate brains. On the split-brain analogy, if you wired together multiple brains, they should form into one consciousness (you could do experiments wiring left and right hemispheres in series or parallel as well). Would brains wired in series or parallel access to more computing horsepower or a higher consciousness? And, if yes, would this brain cluster still be human? Or, what if you hooked up an Intel processor to the brain. You’d think from reading the news they’re getting close to being able to do this. Yes, this would also be an interesting thought experiment for the ethical philosophers.Gazzaniga also talks about how evolution added more and advanced modules to the brain. It would have been interesting to read his speculations on where evolution is going to take us next. In another two or three hundred thousand years, will we have acquired additional “modules?” And what will these modules give us? Easier access to abstract mathematics? Higher IQ? Nirvana? Or?And finally, if, as Gazzaniga postulates, the act of RNA and other bondmaker molecules “gazing on” or “interpreting” DNA constitutes the first act of life and consciousness, then another question arises. Was life accidental, or will Nature bring life into being whenever it can? Is consciousness part of the natural order of things? Does consciousness arise as a natural phenomenon like how gravity will coalesce matter together into stars, clusters, and the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy?"
9,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37248999-ginger-griffin,5,"""Brains aren't like machines; machines are like brains with something missing,"" says the author. The missing elements are the parts that make the brain a living organ, not an inanimate object. We have DNA that reflects billions of years of evolution. Computers have code that reflects whatever the coder happens to need at the moment. DNA is a form of code too, of course. But genetic code has been relentlessly channeled by natural selection. It eventually was forced to create an array of instincts and emotions that seem to form the core of consciousness. In humans, the process has gone so far that we in effect have meta-consciousness: We're not only aware, we're aware that we're aware.So the brain/machine analogy needs to be abandoned, says the author (who, by the way, is a leading cognitive neuroscientist and the guy who discovered the split-brain phenomenon). What will replace the machine model? The author points toward some intriguing possibilities. Much more research will be needed. But that's the fun of science, no?"
10,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17244573-barbara,0,This is a brilliant example of a book I think I'll like but whilst reading it I realized I don't really care about the subject matter that much... or at all.
11,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,3,"I feel kind of like a heathen for not rating this higher, but in all honesty the central premise - which I find interesting and want to learn more about - wasn't half as well developed as I'd have expected. The great thing about Gazzaniga is that he's so central to neuroscience he knows everyone, but when you're opening a book with the claim that it's time for new thought, I would expect more of an effort to include new voices and even non Western perspectives. (The ""historical"" sections in this book suffer from a tendency to conflate the West with the world, even during eras when other empires' schools of thought were ascendant.)Given the amount of time devoted to quantum mechanics as an explanation for how brains work, I would have expected at least one chapter centering on the empirical definition of an ""instinct."" It's not entirely absent, but despite being in the title, it felt like more of an aside than all the background information that is presumably laying the foundation for this novel hypothesis.At the end of the day this book felt more indulgent than I was expecting, and less cogent in its premise and use of supporting evidence and studies. I do get the sense these things exist, but I didn't get much of them in the book."
12,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25167614-judy,2,"First 3/4 of book was a history of neuroscience, which was rather dry. Last 1/4 was, for me, a confusing race through the jargon of recent neuro-scientific thought. Literally, only the last few pages of the book dealt with the assertion that consciousness is an instinct. Mostly over my head."
13,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47517440-geoff-walling,2,You have to wade through this and then wind up not a lot more educated than when you started.
14,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,3,"This book was at least somewhat disappointing because it did not provide nearly as much science as I expected when it comes to the matter of consciousness.  On the other hand, the book is one of those volumes that ends up being unintentionally damaging to materialism and evolution for a variety of reasons.  For example, if consciousness is an emergent property that evolved, then it has to be present in all life forms in some fashion, which would mean that one must not only investigate the awareness of animals, many of which show some sort of response to external stimuli, but that of plants and fungi and various one-celled organisms.  The author also seems far too uninterested in the design implications of what he refers to in consciousness as being a certain complex set of instincts that become more and more complex the more intelligent a particular life form happens to be.  Naturally, there are a great many problems discussed here when it comes to the problem of defining what exactly consciousness is, as well as dealing with the mind-brain dualism that has made truly understanding consciousness impossible so far, and at least for the foreseeable future so long as scientists continue to put their head in the sand looking for evolutionary explanations.This particular book is a bit more than 200 pages and is is divided into three parts and ten chapters.  The book begins with an introduction, before the first part of the book which discusses consciousness and the preparation for modern thought as the author teleologically describes it (I), with chapters on the historical view of consciousness that the author does not approve of (1), the dawn of what the author views as ""empirical"" thinking (2), and some of what the author considers to be 20th century strides towards understanding consciousness (3).  After that the author looks at the physical system of the brain (II), with chapters on the modular nature of brains (4), the desire to understand the architecture of the brain (5), and the fine line that exists between sanity and consciousness that means that people with dementia are still conscious (6).  After that, the third part of the book discusses the origins of consciousness (III), with chapters on the concept of complementarity that comes from physics (7), the transition from non-living to living and from neurons to mind (8), the bubbling nature of personal consciousness (9), and the author's view that consciousness is an instinct (10), after which the book concludes with notes, acknowledgements, and an index.For someone who is not as wedded to evolutionary thinking as the author is, I find that this book gives a great deal of unintentional insight into consciousness and the gratitude that we should have to God for it.  For one, the author's belief that consciousness is an instinct means that there is some sort of programming for it, given that instinct contains a high degree of information content to it.  In addition to that, the author's view of the human mind as being particularly efficient due to its modular design and the author's interest in the architecture of the brain means that, however unintentionally and perhaps even against his will the author provides a great deal of insight into God as a programmer, designer, and architect.  Obviously, then, this book is of great interest to those who have a design perspective as it provides considerable insight into the ways that the human mind and even other minds were designed to deal with reality and how human beings reflect on that reality by subcreating subjective internal worlds.  Whether that is the author's intention or not is hard to say, but it is an achievement nonetheless."
15,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4947834-dave-ciskowski,4,"A strong and worthy exploration of consciousness, though I think it isn’t quite as strong in its more speculative conclusions. Gazzaniga is exceedingly knowledgeable and cogent at explaining the fundamental workings of the mind. His overall account that the brain builds consciousness at a higher level than the low-level systems is strongly argued; it’s hard to see how it would be wrong. I don’t find his quantum mechanical account of the nature of life (and also consciousness) to be persuasive at all, either in terms of its explanatory power or its accurate portrayal of physics. (I’m not well read in interpretations of QM, but I’m pretty sure that Gazzaniga is arguing an overly strong version of the Copenhagen interpretation.) I also think Gazzaniga’s negative take on the possibilities of artificial consciousness is far too categorically pessimistic. But these disagreements don’t hamper the value of the book, and ultimately he paints a convincing (though not yet complete) picture of how consciousness can work, and what many of its key features are."
16,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49822870-zhenya-frolov,5,"For the out of practice science and philosophy enthusiast, this is a very good refresher of philosophy of mind and of the philosophers' stances. Connecting the knowledge and culture of the time to the philosophy or idea brought out its depth. The author's explanation of quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle, told in different ways with different contexts, shifted my idea about the determinism of consciousness. I thought that copying a brain and all it's inputs (down to electron spin and location, etc), would yield the same conscious stream. Now, I think that even if you can guarantee equality of state, processes that depend on quantum effects will not be the same in VERY short order.I'll read reviews by people that have expertise in the fields discussed to see if there are any discussions or refutations."
17,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2703259-shane,5,"This is a short but brilliant book by someone who knows this topic as well as, maybe better than, anyone. This is not a light read, as each chapter requires some ""put it down and think about it"" time to begin to grasp what is being said. I found myself re-reading a whole sections, even a couple of chapters to pick up what I missed the first go-through. I mean all of that as a complement. If you want to understand how a scientist thinks about consciousness and aren't afraid to have some heavy lifting to do to learn (not literally, this one is only 237 pages of real content) then I can't recommend this one enough. I think I got maybe 40% of what this book was trying to tell me, and I read it slowly, carefully, and as I said repeatedly in parts. I already know I will be coming back for a re-read to pick up some more, as the failing is mine, not the author's or his book. "
18,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39390247-r-muzaffer,3,"It feels like the author introduces an important perspective but leaves it at that just when the going gets interesting. I am not clear on why introducing probability to the system would create free will. It just introduces uncertainty. Probability can occur due to two interpretations. In one interpretation, if you knew each and everything about a process you would not have any uncertainty in the system. In the other, probability can never be reduced to 0. None of those interpretations can be used to imply that free will allows us choice through uncertainty. One star docked since Pinker said good things about the book and the author references to that guy at the end. These neo modernists want to lead back the charge where the poor is poor and evil is evil due their free will. "

It did contain some good information and interesting thoughts about the conscious mind (which as the author says over and over doesn't exist in any particular part of the brain). The chapter on how the mind and the brain are related to quantum theory was unique, but even after 20 pages, not very clear at least not to me. Then at the end it appears someone published a paper during the time the book was being written about how the conscious mind is really an instinct and so the author seems to say something like, well I already wrote all this but maybe this Instinct stuff is really where it's at. Anyway, don't take my word for it but I wouldn't recommend this book, too dense and opaque."
20,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26223313-heathyr,5,"Very, very good book. Too many books on consciousness are summaries of preexisting thought, but Gazzaniga actually brings new things to the table. The first half is a history of how philosophy and psychology have approached consciousness, which he somehow makes interesting (against all odds). The second half is on fire, arguing that consciousness is the product of competition among different brain modules. How he writes this book without mentioning emergent activity switching, dynamical systems theory, or self-organizing criticality is beyond me.This book is written very clearly, and explains concepts well without being patronizing to the reader."
21,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67534179-christopher-l,4,"Thought provoking book about consciousness. It pairs really well with Jasanoff's The Biological Mind. Gazzaniga argues that consciousness is ""a property of local brain circuits"" and ""we are each a confederation of rather independent modules, orchestrated to work together"" (p. 7). The concepts of ""layering"" and ""modules"" in the brain are keys to Gazzaniga's understanding of consciousness. One of my favorite quotes (p. 230): ""Simply trying to locate the structure that produces consciousness, as Descartes and many of his predecessors have attempted, will not unveil the Holy Grail, because consciousness is inherent throughout (italicized) the brain."""
22,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6073442-jessica-long,4,"Wonderful book that has a great many insights on a field i don't know much about. I came away having a much deeper understanding of the history of philosophy around consciousness, a little bit of anatomy and physiology of the brain, and then useful frameworks for reunderstanding the problem - this was all fascinating. However, parts of the book were very dense and full of technical knowledge of physics that could have been made easier to understand with some pictures - i guess it would help to have some background knowledge of physics and DNA structures in that case. Otherwise, i recommend this book for anyone curious about how consciousness comes about."
23,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71136765-aisha,2,"2.5 stars for a decently written book, but I'm not sure of what I really learned or took away from it, given much of it was a regurgitation of AP Psych or high school physics. Much of the time the author repeats definitions for serial v parallel (it's not that hard) and it gets kind of annoying. Also, why do people always use golf analogies? So bougie. Besides that, it's decently written and gives good historical context for the ideas we have today about consciousness, as well as the other ideas in science and philosophy that influenced them. The ending was abrupt, and I'm not sure I buy that suddenly, there is instinct and grits."
24,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148345-chris-liberty,5,"The Consciousness Instinct: Unraveling the Mystery of How the Brain Makes the Mind is fascinating. It's not an easy subject, but it's thought-provoking. As I was reading, as the author suggested, so many ideas bubbled up to the surface of my own consciousness.The first third of the book is a college-level philosophy course. In the second part, the highly accomplished neuroscientist builds the brain one module at a time. And in the third section, Gazzaniga delivers the payoff—why consciousness is an instinct.Well played Michael; well played."
25,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39127645-suraj-sood,5,"As a UCSB alum who studied psychology and philosophy (undergrad), it was nice to make contact with Dr. Gazzaniga's more popular scientific work.Personal takeaway: Materialist theories of consciousness and emergentism aren't inherently incompatible (re. p. 70, print version).Gazzaniga does a great job delineating the histories of Western philosophy and science in building toward the broader topic of modern-day consciousness.Highly recommend--particularly, for undergraduate-level students of cognitive neuroscience."
26,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34914485-rajat,4,"A dense book that elucidates on the physiological and psychological aspects of the Human Mind. The author discusses the origin of the concept of 'Consciousness' and the plethora of ideas and experiments that have since defined it. A few disconcerting facts about the book it that its biological jargon can be hard to keep up with at times. However, the book does manage to distil a lot of concepts with simple analogies."
27,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277790-tony,5,"An exciting read. Nice to have someone say the brain is not like a machine. Machines are like limited brains. He states that Bohr changes the definition of objectivity to require not just a description of the material system, but a specification of the context—“what is inherent in the system/observer pair.” I’m thinking we should apply that distinction more broadly to include normal human interactions. We get by far too much without specifying the context."
28,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22403687-riccardo,4,"the book is really well written, especially the part about quantum physics vs classical physics. As a physicist I can see Gazzaniga really understood the problem of duality. however , I really need more explanation in order to understand the application of this concept to the mind / brain duality and to his theory about material / symbolism duality because I didn't understand the connections."
29,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36972877-jay,4,"Really fascinating ideas about the gap between the quantum world and the Newtonian world, life vs. non-life, etc., but the thesis of the book happens in just the last few pages and feels more like a rushed analogy than a real analysis? Some complicated stuff so maybe it just deserves another read, but its conclusion didn't feel fully fleshed out."
30,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5989640-alyssa,4,"This is a great overview of the shift from philosophy to science and even acknowledges the limitations of our current understanding. Some parts seemed to stray into scientific ideas that are not strongly related or went more in depth than necessary to address the question at hand, but overall a very interesting read."
31,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113559956-sergi-lapeira,3,"I felt very fascinated at the beginning of the book, but a little frustrated at the end. I couldn't expect only a simple metaphor (""the bubbles"" of the consciousness) to explain such a weird phenomenon of our capacity to become awareness about the world and about ourselves. Nevertheless, this is the first book I read from this author. I hope the next will be better."
32,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48064304-alejandro-mar-ez,5,"Wow, I've learned so much reading this book! It's like I highlighted the whole book. Every person interested in Neuroscience or Neuropsychology should read this book, not only because it explains the status of the study of consciousness until this point, but because it helps to understand how the brain works."
33,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42656764-carlos-allende,5,"Easy to read, very complete. I already liked Gazzaniga's writing style but this book made me a fan. His bubbles from boiling water metaphor is a terrific way to describe consciousness. A good start for those lost among a heap of difficult journal articles dealing with the subject of consciousness."
34,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10382692-tore,5,"This is my favourite kind of book, giving a brief historical overview with glimpses of the persons and ideas that came before, and landing in an interesting and scientifically sound view on that most central experience of being. And it's a relatively short read :)"
35,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69572222-william-dury,3,"Professor Gazzaniga is amiable, very intelligent and good company. Unfortunately, this one went a ways past my stop. The blurb on the cover reads: “UNRAVELING THE MYSTERY OF HOW THE BRAIN MAKES THE MIND.” If the MYSTERY was UNRAVELED remains unclear. I did get the picture of a bunch of (mainly) guys sitting around getting wired on coffee spewing theories but that’s just the resentful mumbling of an inferior mind."
36,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10716719-william,2,Too much historical rambling and not enough current thinking.
37,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40731421-zaque-eyn,5,Loved this book and all of its insights. Consciousness is Instinct (in a nut shell) and the road the author takes us on the get here is a good ride indeed. A must read for everyone!
38,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76666801-emil,5,"I enjoyed the book, but to be quite frank didn't understand it in full, it's a definitely a re-read material."
39,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28294387-laura,4,"Incredibly hard going in places, especially the start, but there are some amazing gems of ideas if you can stick it out."
40,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20053525-timothy-blaisdell,3,"Not as good as ""Who's In Charge?"" In the latter half he gets into what sounded suspiciously like fringe ideas. "
41,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73204336-simon-kirkendall,5,Well told history of neuroscience. Very interesting learning about the architecture of the brain from the point of view of a split-brain researcher.
42,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36810291-steve-hansen,5,Great unraveling of the history of thought on consciousness and new brain and evolutionary science that points to consciousness inherent in the operation of genetics that create all life.

44,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2826477-beingcristina,4,Interesting dissection of the hard problem of consciousness and the vague definition that leaves the reader hungry for more. 
45,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25487672-paul-bard,2,Only the eponymous last chapter is helpful and up to date now. I recommend Hawkins “On Intelligence” instead.
46,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67406969-ivan-mitrovic,5,"As the title says, the consciousness is an Instinct. It has been there since the beginning of life, and there is no single part of the brain responsible for consciousness. Consciousness is throughout the brain. Removing parts of the cortex will not remove consciousness. It will just change its appearance. This was a very good overview of the evolution of consciousness theory, brain & mind duality, the analogy between material brain and immaterial mind and material substance and immaterial life. The book mentioned ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" book which is the next on my reading list"
47,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18474377-hemen-kalita,3,"Not bad actually. Endedup getting some interesting nuggets of information. I found his initial chapters on the early developments in the field of cognitive studies to be interesting. The author is a little inclined towards human supremacism and couldn't come to terms with the widely accepted reductionist view of consciousness that limits our Brian to matter only. For him, there has to be something more. So, he puts forth arguments against this reductionist view of consciousness, but I don't think he managed to pull it off."
48,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27871349-john-g,3,"This is a powerful and important story about how the brain works. It is eye-opening to hear about complementarity (Neils Bohr?!) applying not just to the quantum level but to life generally and specifically to the brain.He's writing several styles, sometimes like a memoir, other times he reviews history of thinking about thinking, back to Descarte who gets blamed for misrepresenting consciousness as part of the cerebral cortext when it's really a lower brain function.Slowly he presents his main themes, which is that the brain has modules, layers and complementarity. He helpfully lists these in summary after repeating them frequently. Despite the repetition it's difficult to understand him. I don't understand a ""layer is a constraint that deconstrains"". But maybe brains are like R.Feynman saying “no one understands quantum theory”.I'll try Steven Pinker next, searching for a style that better communicates at my novice level of brain understanding."
49,0374715505,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8365028-oren,5,"Challenging but rewarding several times over. Loved this book. The author is a ground-breaking neurosurgeon who pioneered, along with Roger Sperry, research on the two sides of the brain and the role of the bundle of nerves that connects them. They studied patients that had their corpus callosum cut for other medical reasons.The book focuses on ideas like what conciousness really is with respect to the brain's architecture. Almost as if conciousness is like our operating system. And for nonhumans also. The brain is modular and layered, and Gazzaniga expands on the link between conciousness and the evolution of the creation and building of our brains. "
