Lack of arrogance and condescension toward someone who almost failed high school math a must. Must be willing to meet in heavily populated public place.* * * *Aside from that, delving into mathematics as James Gleick tells it (algebra, calculus and Boolean logic, mostly ---A watered down version for us math scarred) makes me want to write a letter to every godawful mediocre monotone high school math teacher I ever had (so, all of them) and give them some major shit for not even bothering. Really? Overhead transparencies of meaningless equations and word problems involving trains and lots of bland white kids was all they had? Worksheets and odd numbered problems in a textbook? If I had only known that math is just another way of describing the world, just, ya know, symbolism like Dostoevsky used, but with numbers, and that all that misery and embarrassment and boredom working equations at the blackboard could actually get me closer to the secrets and meaning(s) of life...So, thanks to James Gleick for that too- late realization and doing what the uninspired mathbots should have done years ago. (Are you available for tutoring?)The Information is by no means an easy read, but if you have some previous knowledge of physics(mine came from having read Brian Greene's Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time and the Texture of something or other and a biography of e = mc2 but I suspect a bit of patience and wikipedia would also be just fine), you should be able to get through this without any major confusion.Anybody wanna talk physics and Information theory? "
1,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5388599-yothgoboufnir,3,"The Information has a lot going for it. And it has a lot going against it.For starters, Gleick keeps the read enjoyable with his strong prose style. The author controls the pace and tone of his writing to carry readers along almost cinematically. Indeed, many passages read like the voice-over of a History Channel program, while simultaneously conjuring for readers the images that would play under the voice-over. It is a strong effect, engrossing and enjoyable.The other big strong point of The Information is how wide-ranging -- yet unified -- its topic is. Gleick has, rather conspicuously, rounded up a huge catalog of sources and influences and subjects. I believe if a person is really going to like this book, it will be as an exuberant, unregimented romp through the jungle that is information. The book is ambitious, and looks at the world with the wide eyes of delight ... not the furrowed brow of calculation.And given this combination of the book's ambition and approach, from The Information emerge some weaknesses. The book's treatment of its various subjects is very uneven. Gleick does a good job of impressing on readers how big a shift in mindset literacy generates. He gives an engrossing treatment of talking drums, and he gives an equally engrossing treatment of Charles Babbage and Ada Byron. These subjects together form an informal ""first half"" of the book, and succeed in prompting readers to think through the genesis of information as something (first) represented and (eventually) manipulated in tangible forms like scripts, tones, and gears.Since we today generally take for granted a certain relationship between information, our minds, and our instruments, it is a major accomplishment that Gleick gets us to note that we haven't always lived this way and to think through how we got this way.But after Gleick accomplishes this in the first portion of the book, he falters. His treatment of most subsequent topics is often not cogent. For example, in his treatment of thermodynamic information, he equivocates on what Maxwell's Demon is or isn't, and whether it exists or doesn't. Gleick ends up noting that the demon could not operate, but then he keeps referring to it as if it really does operate, a (presumably) rhetorical move that is pointless and incoherent.Later on, Gleick gives a treatment of both genes and memes that is strangely uninspired. The fact that the book's wide scope requires the treatment of any particular topic to be fairly shallow does not combine well with the fact that almost everyone these days has a passing familiarity with both genes and memes: Gleick says no more than ""the educated layperson"" already knows. In a book on The Information, it seems genes and memes must be discussed as a matter of course -- but these sections don't add value to the book.Moreover, the section on genes was even more deeply flawed. Gleick attributes to Watson and Crick the elucidation of the information content of DNA. He thereby conflates the chemical structure of the DNA molecule with the information structure of the DNA code. This is analogous to saying that the first person who figured out that a charred stick could be used to make marks on slate was the person who figured out writing. Or, it is analogous to saying that the information content of enigma-encrypted Wehrmacht transmissions was retrieved not by the codebreakers at Bletchly Park but by the radio operators who determined what radio frequency the messages were broadcast on. This is a rather profound mistake, considering the subject of The Information.And this major mistake cropped up again and again, in different contexts. Despite his attentiveness to the father of information theory, Shannon, Gleick never got around to explicitly saying what makes something information, nor did Gleick implicitly follow any solid definition of information. This becomes problematic toward the end, where Gleick wants to unify everything under quantum information -- ""it from bit"" -- with the entire universe as a collection of physical-informational states. That is an interesting concept, but it actually has little to do with ""information"" as treated in the rest of the book: alphabets, calculators, cyphers, telegraphs, genes, Wikipedia articles. In all these contexts, something is informational when one physical object stands in for something else -- say, AAG for lysine, or dot-dot-dot for s. Gleick seems aware of this special relationship that defines information (per Shannon), but never pursues it and eventually abandons it. The sense of ""information"" he ends with is simply the notion that at certain levels, such as the level of quarks, the objects of study are indistinguishable from the formalisms by which we know them. That's a deep topic, but it isn't really pursued for its own sake; it is deployed as a rhetorical way to make ""everything"" informational ... even though it's only nominally related to the informational topics discussed in the rest of the book.I found it intriguing that, in the final chapter, Gleick mentions in passing a perfect 1:1 map of everything as suggested by Lewis Carroll. Carroll was quite witty and this map is, of course, absurd. Its absurdity is precisely the problem that arises when Gleick conflates his two kinds of information. A perfect 1:1 map of everything A) would not be a map and B) would not be the thing itself.So there were some deep conceptual problems plaguing The Information. Relatedly, the book lacked form. It was sprawling, and attempts at unification (aside from leading Gleick to embrace absurdities and forget what information even is) fell flat. As Gleick reminds us at the end in his excellent prose, there is a lot of information on the internet, and a lot of particles in the universe -- not exactly a parting thought that leaves readers pondering.Finally, the references are in such bad shape that they warrant comment. None of the main body text has citations of any kind. Multiple times, I looked up authors who were quoted and found no entries in the bibliography! There is a section of ""notes"", which appears to be a collection of endnotes containing citations and comments, presumably for the many unsourced quotations in the book. This section is puzzling, because the text does not actually refer to any notes. I infer that the numerals which signal there is an endnote pertaining to some point in the text have all been removed from the book, but the notes themselves retained. Presumably the in-text designation of notes was removed to make the text appear readable rather than intimidating. A rigorously sourced book suggests to readers it is meant to be taken seriously; apparently it was decided that that would send the wrong impression for this book.-Bottom line:The Information was fun and interesting. The first half was especially strong, even illuminating. But there were also serious conceptual and formal problems that prevented the book's content from matching the potential of such an ambitious topic. The book is much more likely to reward casual reading than serious or repeated reading."
2,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I think this is perhaps as good an introduction to information theory as you are likely to read. Lucid, clear and quite nicely paced, it covers a wealth of material and it does so with beautiful ease. This guy really is a wonderful science writer. His Chaos and Newton were both stunning books. I got about half of the way through Genius, but then got distracted and never quite made it back – but I’ve always meant to. All the same, this one shines and shines.Perhaps the best chapter was the one on randomness. Randomness is such a tricky concept, but oddly, not something we generally really think about. Just how do you go about proving that a series of numbers is, in fact, random? The problem is that we humans are hopeless at spotting randomness. This is partly because we are such excellent pattern picking machines that we even spot patterns when there are none. And then we also tend to think there must be a pattern if there is repetition, but random sequences have odd repetitions too. All this means we tend to think things that aren’t random are in fact random and vice versa.The definition of randomness is that there is, in a string of numbers, a one in ten chance that you will be able to pick the next number in the sequence – in a random series you will have a one in ten chance – if you can do better than this chance at picking the number then you must have an algorithm to help you pick the next number and that means the next number can’t be random.His discussion of Turing, not just his test but also his machine and incalculable numbers, is highly readable and clear. His discussion of Gödel is somewhat less clear, but than I’m yet to have read a perfectly clear description of the incompleteness theorem – which might say more about me than it does about the descriptions I have read, who knows. This one is still good, even if it remains over my head. However, there is a wonderful discussion of the relationship between information and entropy and why entropy is an important concept for people to understand, as good an explanation as any I have ever read.The early parts of the book are a joy. The stuff about the barbed wire telegraphs is particularly fascinating. As was his explanation of why multistorey buildings needed the telephone to be invented as much as they needed lifts.I was less impressed by the discussion of memes, but mostly because I don’t find this nearly as useful a metaphor as others do and worry when ideas that are clearly meant to be provocative end up being taken much more seriously than they warrant. Selfish genes and selfish memes, with their characteristic inversion of common sense, tend to become Blackmore’s ‘self-plex’ and the end of human freewill and identity and therefore take a joke all a little too far.The discussion at the very start of this book about African talking drums is virtually worth the cover price alone. I had never realised that these communicate ‘tonally’ and that to make them work the drummer must add lots of redundancy to the message, almost like a convention of sub-phrases. This was a wonderful description of why redundancy is necessary to messages and said interesting things about Western racism. Westerners simply could not believe these drums actually could send messages or that they were not being sent by a kind of Morse Code.This book really is a pleasure and on a fascinating topic that is deftly handled by one of the best science writers alive."
3,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood is a book written in 2011 by James GleickWhat the telegraph accomplished in years the telephone has done in months. One year it was a scientific toy, without infinite possibilities of practical use; the next it was the basis of a system of communication....This is a fascinating science book written in a historical narrative format about the topic “information”. Today information theory is a practical and vital study spread across three disciplines: mathematics, computer science and electro-magnetic communications. Gleick addresses all these areas and then some. In fourteen chapters, Gleick begins with cuneiforms and ends with CD-ROMs. There is very little that one can love about these bookends so you should be dissuaded from putting the book down after the first chapter or two.Because it’s the middle chapters, four through nine, where Gleick does a masterful job. In these chapters he provides both the science and biographies of the two giants in information theory: Charles Babbage b. 1791 and Claude Shannon b. 1916.Babbage, an Englishman, was born a century ahead of his time with his many inventions but his most relevant one to this book was his difference engine. It was a mechanical computing device that thought of numbers as bits. It predates the first vacuum tube computers used in WWII by more than a hundred years. Babbage was very much like Thomas Edison who would come along about forty years later. Babbage was an indefatigable inventor and his mind knew no bounds.Claude Shannon meanwhile, amongst his many discoveries over decades of working at Bell Labs, is considered the father of modern communications. Shannon was the first to think of entropy as a measure of information. He was able to represent any communications system as a transmitter, receiver and interference source. With a certain level of interference he determined that it is was possible to tell the theoretical capacity of a system, i.e. he could determine the theoretical maximum bits of information that could be sent and received in any system model. This maximum is known as the Shannon Limit. These discoveries led to further exploration in the field of error encoding and so on. Neither cellular networks nor the physical internet would exist today without Shannon’s insights. It can be argued that Shannon was not a hundred years ahead of his time like Babbage or Einstein, but it can also be argued that Shannon’s findings have transformed the world more than any individual in history. Odd as that sounds it is probably true. 5 stars. For the middle portion of this book I would assign six stars. Gleick does an exemplary job of humanizing these men in addition to concise descriptions around the science of information theory. In a word I was enraptured."
4,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara,4,"The amount of information (pun acknowledged, but not intended) that 

James Gleick

 was able to contain in the book is mind-boggling (
Claude Shannon
 could probably tell you what the physical cost of the logical work my mind did while reading it was, but I, alas, cannot). I'm sure that for those who are well-versed in information theory, some of his omissions were glaring and seemingly arbitrary, but there is nothing wrong with a book that leaves you wanting more and feeling sufficiently motivated to go out and find it. 

The Information

, with all that it contains, is a likely candidate for the list of non-fiction books I loved, took copious notes on while reading, and would recommend, but fail to review because there is just so much to be said. However, it's 
Ada Lovelace Day
, and without Gleick I would have no clue as to who she was (and she was awesome).

My lack of time and in-depth knowledge of Lovelace suggest that my attempt to describe her right now would be inadequate, so I'll just recommend a nice New Yorker article 

“Ada Lovelace, The First Tech Visionary”

 (and/or any of the ALD features that are bound to grace the interwebs today)."

It is probably best I didn't figure this out earlier in life, because I might have pursued it and gone crazy. So I enjoy reading about it from time to time.In The Information, Gleick speaks to the interplay between mathematical progress with science, culture, information theory, and really the development of society. It is an incredible overview of topics ranging from logic to communication to memes. It is DENSE. I spread my reading over a few weeks, a chapter here, a chapter there. When the information started going over my head, I gleefully skimmed it until I could sink back in. The formulas meant very little but then he put musical fragments into it with no explanation, and at least I understood those.The chapter that first captured me detailed the history of the OED. I loved the logic chapter, talking about Boole and his contributions, someone very important to library theory and I never really knew anything about where all of that came from. It was the last chapter, as well as the epilogue, where Gleick steps beyond his thorough research to offer a few opinions on the direction of information and information overload, that I think the book really shines, or at least, where it was most interesting/useful to me. I don't know enough to speak to the accuracy of this book, but I feel like I learned a lot, as well as adding a bunch of other books to read to my list that he cites. I will also be ordering it for the academic library where I work, and using it in a presentation I'm giving in February! Win/win/win.""It sometimes seems as if curbing entropy is our quixotic purpose in this universe."" ""We make our own storehouses. The persistence of information, the difficulty of forgetting, so characteristic of our time, accretes confusion.""""When information is cheap, attention becomes expensive.

Selecting the genuine takes work; then forgetting takes even more work.""""The library will endure; it is the universe...

6,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054265-david-wiley,5,"Only half way through this book but it's one of the best I've read in a very long time. The chapter on Babbage and Lovelace filled me with rapture and awe, and a little bit of jealousy, peeking in on these great discoveries and the heady conversations and frequent advances and discoveries. What must it have been like to work at that level, to discover those things, to be so far ahead of your time? Incredible writing, so well researched, I just love this book... And as a bonus, highly applicable to my day job!"
7,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"The history of information theory is a history of increasing abstraction. To the point where the meaning of information becomes irrelevant. To the point where the universe itself can be seen as a giant computer, and each of our choices, thoughts, movements become like states in the machine. I loved reading about the African drummers who communicated over long distances via a tonal drum language with built in redundancy. I loved reading about Babbage and his calculating machine, and to think about it as a kind of steam-punk calculator fantasy world of the future. I loved reading about people decrying the telegraph and the telephone as technologies that will ruin humanity. And to read about the shortening of telegraph messages to save time and money, with phrases like wyegfef which stands for 'will you exchange gold for eastern funds?' which is interesting because here we are in 2012 coming full circle, a form of regression maybe, by using codes like ROFLOL and BRB in our chatboxes and cellphones. And also that the telegraph reminds me a bit of twitter in its shortness. I didn't love reading about Godel and Turing and Shannon, but only because I've read so much about them already in other books just like this one, but it was still interesting enough. I liked reading about genes and the gene code ok, but I really loved reading about quantum computers because I knew next to nothing about them. Something I never thought about before is how a message sent using a quantum computer cannot be intercepted or wiretapped because of Heisenberg's principle which says that you can't look at a quantum particle without effecting it, so in effect the intercepter cannot go undetected! This blew my mind. I loved reading the more philosophical chapters about how we have too much information for us to ever process, and how we must now deal with it. I loved reading about the library of babel and borges of course, how could I not? I loved thinking about how we have too much information and how everything is documented. ""It did not occur to Sophocle's audiences that it would be sad for his plays to be lost; they enjoyed the show"". I thought about that and I thought about how every performance, ceremony, or event that I've been to in the last year or so has been recorded on video (and probably up on YouTube already) and how or whether that took away from the experience, whether knowing something will be archived later makes you pay attention less now, or is it a form of insurance, a kind of just-in-case, which then made me wonder how many times I (or anyone) will ever go and watch those videos again. I thought about the last chapters and how Google and other search engines are our only means of not being completely lost in meaningless data and then I thought about how much power the role of a search engine is, to make sense of the information is also to hold all the power, to control the information, to control what information people see or don't see. I'm looking forward to the sequel."
8,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"While nothing in this book is really new, Gleick has managed to pull together a fascinating, comprehensive review of the subject of information. The book does an excellent job unifying a vast subject area. I appreciate the book's emphasis on the contributions of Claude Shannon to the field of information theory. Also, it is eye-opening to be reminded, that an animal's body is simply the vehicle that a gene--i.e., information--uses to self-replicate. And it was fun to learn about earlier methods of long-distance communications, like jungle drums and the semaphore system used in France. I would recommend this book to anybody who uses his brain to store information."
9,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,3,"20th book for 2018.In my doctorate I read and enjoyed many of the original 1950s papers applying information theory to psychology. I read Gleick's Chaos: Making a New Science many years ago and loved it, so his history of information was a natural second book for me to read. Although his writing style is good, the book was quite disappointing. The book simply covers too many different topics with little to connect them (African drums; the telegraph; encyclopedias and dictionaries; codes; Babbage and Lady Lovelace; information theory; quantum computing; Wikipedia, encyclopedias again). While the chapters are interesting in their own way, nothing really adds up into something more coherent.Not a terrible book, but it could have been so much better with a tighter focus. 3-stars."
10,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653329-gayle,5,"I begin by saying to my middle school algebra teacher, “Damn, why didn’t you just say so?” At the risk of revealing my age, I can tell you that mathematics as taught in my elementary school era certainly lacked certain clarity in the fact that rote memorization played a totally unnecessary role as far as I was concerned. Luckily for me, I knew how to manipulate money long before I went to school, so the patterns in math were already obvious. Then suddenly there were these little xs and ys and I was completely thrown for a loop! “Why are these letters slinking around with my beloved numbers?” I thought. Gee, I wish my teacher had just given me Charles Babbage to read. After the initial shock, the patterns that I knew so well did return and I moved on, loving algebra, but the process would have been so much smoother had someone simply told me to think of the “x” as an empty box waiting for the right number to complete the pattern!I am not a math and science whiz by any stretch of the imagination; I am, however, in awe of both and always have been. As far as I’m concerned, it takes a bazillion times more creativity to discover and prove a math or science concept than it does to write a story or poem. Literature is limited by the human experience and needs no proof. Math and science have no limits—think universe and ∞—and if you are unable to prove your theory, you will not become a part of the conversation unless, of course, someone else can prove your theory.The Information, as I see it, is about just that, extraordinary people seeing the patterns first, forming a theory, beginning their proofs, and others building on those proofs until new understandings emerge. It’s an exciting and wonderful journey! If you are the type of person that must understand and see clearly every concept mentioned in the book you are reading, don’t pick this one up. (Although, I’ve never understood why people who can read Oscar Wilde or T. S. Eliot comfortably can become so uncomfortable reading a book like Mr. Gleick’s that they would put it down and consider it too difficult to understand.) I have a high tolerance for the vague; it doesn’t bother me. There is a lot in this book that is vague to me, but I was constantly rewarded with so many “Ah ha!” moments that it did not interfere with my total enjoyment. For example, how do you write about a theory before there are clear and concise words to describe it? Words that everyone can agree upon must first be written about. “...where Newton wanted words for nature’s laws, Wittgenstein wanted words for words...” The limitation of words is that you must use words to describe them! Did you know that your teenager wasn’t the first to use expressions such as “lol” and “bff” to communicate? I did not, but when telegrams were charged by the word, people adapted by doing exactly the same thing—see page 154. Then there is the redundancy in language factor demonstrated nicely by one of my favorites, the James Merrill poem and 1970s subway sign “If U Cn Rd Ths, u cn gt a gd jb w hi pa.” “Bit” is a combination of binary and digit. Duh, but I truly did not know this!Near the end of the story, we go from bits to bytes, to megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes and I found myself reading faster and faster and... as if experiencing the John Lanier quote, “It’s as if you kneel to plant the seed of a tree and it grows so fast that it swallows your whole town before you can even rise to your feet,” up close and personal. (Reminds me of The Blob and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.) We’ve moved from an oral culture where words/impressions were dissipated/forgotten or changed down the line—like kids sitting in a circle playing the game Telephone—to terabytes+ of the same set in code and then disseminated exponentially through our technology. Personally I like that idea; it doesn’t scare me at all. Can you tell? I loved this book!"
11,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5593045-loring-wirbel,4,"Since I was absolutely astonished by such Gleick works as ""Chaos"" and ""What Just Happened"", and since his subject matter (Claude Shannon, Godel, info theory) is right up my alley, I was prepared to give this book five stars, particularly given raves in NY Times Book Review and elsewhere. Quite honestly, I'm tending toward the Goodreads consensus of four stars, leaning to a high three. And the reasons for that are quite specific.Gleick pulls all the right ingredients together - Charles Babbage, Lady Ada Lovelace, Claude Shannon, Alan Turing, Kurt Godel, Norbert Wiener. He gives us unique quotes from Lady Lovelace's letters, odd anecdotes of Shannon and Godel meeting at Princeton. The book is lively and readable for the most part, though the odd algebraic algorithm might scare some people. And yet, and yet.... Something feels like a perfectly prepared pudding or souffle that wasn't cooked at the right temperature, leading to a failure to set properly.Perhaps the problem is that Gleick set a high bar for himself with ""Chaos"", and a high bar was set for incompleteness theorem and information with Douglas Hofstadter's ""Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid."" Gleick quotes at length from Hofstadter, to be sure, but he doesn't achieve quite the sense of astonishment and whimsy that Hofstadter did when GEB first came out in the early 1980s. Maybe I was expecting Gleick to provide a new theory of what happens when incompleteness meets infinite recursiveness meets the compressed-code condition where a single symbol stands for a universe of meaning. Maybe that was a ridiculous expectation.This book makes a wonderful companion to Hofstadter's GEB, William Gibson's ""The Difference Engine"", and similar works. It makes Shannon and Turing seem like real people, though it does not delve into the heartache of Turing's persecution as a homosexual, which several biographies of Turing have done. Gleick ends the book with a marvelous treatise on Wikipedia's reason for being in this world, and a suggestion that we are running into a new recursiveness when an ever-expanding Wikipedia begins to stand for all sentient knowledge in the universe - have we gained anything in library management or data compression? Still, Gleick manages to end the book on an optimistic note, not wringing his hands too anxiously over information overload, etc.Remember, a pudding or souffle that comes out of the oven a little too runny still can make for good eating, and Gleick's book is often yummy. Just don't expect ""The Information"" to reach new frontiers of information theory. It's just a dime map of the reef, and that's OK."
12,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2492588-katie,5,"A wonderful and eclectic book that gave me a new perspective. I'm not sure how this book reads for those already versed in information theory - I think it's largely designed for those who are not - but it's a great introduction to the subject. Gleick is especially got at illustrating how wide-ranging this subject is, and how innovations from people like Claude Shannon or Alan Turing rippled out into fields as diverse as linguistics, genetics, and psychology. It's rare that an introductory book can legitimately offer a slightly different way of viewing the world while still remaining grounded and accurate, but this work pulls it off beautifully. I'd love to read more on information theory if anyone has any recommendations for me. "
13,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7317752-melissa,4,"If you like the idea of relating information to thermodynamics - more specifically, the second law of entropy, you will whiz through this book in one sitting despite its length. In any transformation, a dissipation occurs. Loss in one form of energy is inevitable; in our futile attempts to avoid this loss, we inadvertently gain energy in other forms. Information can be viewed similarly. As it travels through books, mouths, films, etc., it loses something each time. This loss creates room for the unintended lessons. I probably slaughtered the description with my futile attempts at explaining this – suppose that conveniently serves as further proof of the validity of his message. "
14,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"As a kid I loved to read the books on science by Issac Asimov.I once had a job (1977) as a night janitor at a telephone switching office - back in the day when there were real live operators on duty for directory assistance, etc. After finishing up my duties - cleaning ash trays, emptying wastebaskets, I would go to the basement, pull up a chair by the huge array of batteries that (still) provide backup power for the wired telephone system and read Asimov explaining the structure of the atom and how electricity works. I couldn't get enough of how things worked.James Gleick follows in the Asimov tradition as a science writer for the masses but he gets in pretty deep.The book is divided as the title describes into three sections - one about the history of information, one about the theory that developed to explain it, and finally a look at the flood of it that we are now experiencing. Throughout is that wonderful sense of excitement, discovery and adventurous thinking that Asimov was so good at relating.There are many remarkable things in this book, one of which is an account of how writing changed the way we think from what it had been before. A different mental operation is at work when you relate things aurally, about things that you have seen, than when you write in symbols that bring up concepts that cannot be physically experienced. Also mentioned is the fact that writing is not evolutionary - in the sense that stone-age humans would have been able to write if they were instructed; The potential has been there all along. This kind of thing makes me eager to turn every page for more.When Gleick gets into the theory of information even more fascination awaits. What is the information content of a printed character, of a dot or a dash of Morse code, of a photo? Much thinking went into analysis of communication before Claude Shannon came up with a formula for specifying the amount of information precisely - it has to do with novelty, unpredictability, and complexity but is completely independent of the meaning we place on communication. Now do I have your interest?But things get deep. Here is an example from where I got completely lost..."" 'Feynman's insight,' says Bennett, 'was that a quantum system is, in a sense, computing its own future all the time. You may say it's an analog computer of its own dynamics.' Researchers quickly realized that if a quantum computer had special powers in cutting though problems in simulating physics, it might be able to solve other types of intractable problems as well.""Have you got that? Fortunately, the book doesn't often get this deep and right after the above quote the author leaves the theory for the flood section - much easier to swallow!So step right up and challenge your mind to a roller coaster ride. There will be times when you will s-l-o-w d-o-w-n just as a coaster does when climbing the first height, but then you will find elation as you zoom into new ideas!"

16,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/646605-joshua,4,"I enjoyed reading this book thoroughly. However, I do not think it will satisfy everyone who is considering reading it. I know many of my librarian colleagues and my classmates from the School of Information probably have this on their to-read lists. Many of them are probably more interested in contemporary issues of information management, such as information retrieval, social network analysis and human-computer interaction. This book touches some of those issues, and indeed many others, but this book is primarily about the history of information theory. The subtitle of the book is ""A History, A Theory, A Flood,"" but the Flood part is only discussed in the final chapters. The rest of it is devoted to the theory and history.You can tell that Gleick has spent his career writing biographies and histories of physicists and mathematicians, because those subjects are covered in greater detail in this book. The two most prominent individuals that Gleick focuses upon are Charles Babbage and Claude Shannon. If you're interested in the history of science, math and philosophy, or if you would like a good explanation of information theory (which I think most people do not understand correctly) then I would recommend this book. Otherwise, this book may not be what you are hoping it to be.If you are into that sort of thing, then this book will be a fun read for you. I found it extremely fascinating. A couple passages that made me pause:An amusing quip on entropy: ""Living things manage to remain unstable."" Indeed. Increased entropy is the natural progression of the universe. But living things maintain an organized state, which is highly anti-entropic. Hence, we are all unstable people!On memes: ""...rhyme and rhythm help bits of text get remembered. Rhyme and rhythm are qualities that aid a meme's survival, just as strength and speed aid an animal's. Patterned language has an evolutionary advantage. Rhyme, rhythm, reason--for reason, too, is a form of pattern."" This is an interesting thought. Reason as simply a pattern--a memory aid. "
17,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,3,"This book was very interesting. It seems to be a history of information theory, and the author weaves together strands from a number of different disciplines, bringing to life what could be very dry. But once I'd finished it, I felt somewhat disappointed. I felt that he gave very short shrift to the internet, despite some interesting sections on wikipedia. How can you write a book on Information and not spend a good part of it discussing the internet. Of course, I'm a techie, so I'm somewhat biased, but I felt a little cheated. Also, after I finished the book I felt a little bit of ""So?"" If he was trying to make some kind of point, I'm not sure I got it. Despite that, I think it's worth reading, for the historical perspective if nothing else, just don't expect life-changing, or even thought changing, revelations."
18,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216811-wm,4,"The History chapters are the best -- the African drum system, Babbage, and the development of the telegraph were all fascinating. Once you get into the 20th century things become more mathematical and abstruse. I didn't understand all the equations. But what the structure of the book does is really show you how the technologies we have now relate to what happened in the past. Gleick weaves theory and storytelling together well. I would have like a bit more of the sociology and less of the theory. "

21,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937839-gary-schroeder,4,"This book could have alternately been titled ""A History of the Bit: How the bit made modern communication, computing, logic, an understanding of biology and a whole bunch of other stuff possible."" It's James Gleick's extremely ambitious attempt to wrap his arms around the entirety of the expansive concept of ""information."" To the uninitiated, ""information"" might seem like a rather straightforward concept, unworthy of a 400+ page book. After all, what is there to say about a concept that we all commonly refer to, understand, and take for granted? Quite a bit, as it turns out.The good news is that this is not another book about the history of computing, from the Gutenberg press to the Macintosh. There are more than enough books on that topic. So, exactly what is it about? It's hard to be succinct about that. It might be better to offer a listing of broad topics covered.He starts with the most basic of communication systems: the African drum -- a method of communication over distances that surprised early european colonizers with its apparent accuracy and specificity. From here, he moves to Babbage's mechanical difference engine and the first organized thoughts about the nature of information itself. When one has to carry out mechanical computation, it seems to be universal that an analysis of what comprises information quickly ensues. A new branch of philosophy is born.Succeeding chapters cover technologies we typically associate with the transmission of information: telegraphy and telephony. Telegraphy introduces the idea of creating one set of symbols that can represent another set. In this case, dots and dashes for an alphabet. Twenty six characters are reduced to two. Telegraphy also introduced the need to reduce even further the number of characters by which a message could be clearly received, as in representing common phrases by a series of three digit numbers. Such a reduction costs the transmitter less money to send and enables the owner of the system to send more messages in the same time, earning them more money. This is information compression in its simplest form. Sending a message through an intermediary (a telegrapher) also means that you might want to hide the meaning of the message from them. This leads to ciphers and other methods of encoding. The sender and the receiver share a common key for decoding.Telephony reduced the barriers to telecommunication by reducing the middle man, saved money for businesses by reducing the need for messengers and increasing the speed of messages. Telephony also drove further information technology innovations. Phone companies (or THE phone company at the time) devoted considerable resources to dealing with problems of long distance transmission of voice information over inherently ""lossy"" copper wires. Sifting meaningful signal from distance-induced static and noise became of focus of some particularly talented engineers. Analysis of this problem lead to mathematical abstractions as they tried to reduce ""information"" to the lowest possible common denominator. How small of a signal can carry a message? How can ""message"" be defined mathematically? The idea of the ""bit"" became common and the field of information theory began to take off. It had existed before, but it had never flowered in the way that modern communications forced it to. Claude Shannon is a central figure in the development of modern information theory and his revolutionary ideas are quoted extensively throughout the book. Parallel developments in information theory occurred with Alan Turing who developed the theoretical basis for computing before any of the hardware existed.Some familiar computing history themes are then covered in which Gleick reviews projects undertaken during World War II to create mechanical systems capable of shooting down fast moving aircraft from the ground. These projects produced mathematical methods for estimating random motion and predicting probabilities, problems very similar to the efforts of phone engineers to separate signal from noise.What Gleick tries to get across is the idea that the developments in information theory, some of which are concepts that we take for granted today, are in fact not intuitive at all. The idea that all information could be conveyed by nothing more than two states, on and off, yes or no, was revolutionary. For people of the era, these ideas would be like suggesting the existence of a new color that no one had ever imagined before. Shocking, like an intuitive leap that seemed to come from nowhere.Information theory has implications for...well, just about everything in existence. It has implications for biology. The basic units of heredity, the genes, carry a certain number of bits of information needed to describe traits. DNA molecules can be thought of as biological memory storage devices, mere transmitters of information. It also has things to say about memes, self-replicating packets of information. Gleick quotes Dawkins and wonders if they're like genes, existing to propagate themselves.Towards the end of the book, he advances to modern developments of the past 30 years or so such as information compression and quantum information science. As part of this journey, Gleick tries to cover some very challenging mathematical topics like randomness, incompleteness theorems, the absolute computability of numbers and chaos. These sections are less successful. I got the feeling that he felt the need to include them, but felt that he could not adequately reduce them to a level that even an industrious layman could handle. Many terms are introduced which are never thoroughly explained, or which are explained tautologically, using poorly explained concepts to label new ones.Finally, he ends with a light analysis of the cultural implications of the info-clogged modern world: information fatigue, information glut, and the devaluation of information that is ubiquitously available for the first time in history.This is a big topic...indeed, a massive one. While ""The Information"" rambles on in places and seems disjointed in others, it's an important book. It brings the philosophy and science of information itself to a lay audience. Mathematicians and philosophers will be familiar with many of the concepts it contains, but this may be the first book that attempts to bring these rigorously technical fields to the masses in an easily digestible form.

24,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4357283-john-david,3,"Glancing over many of the other lower ratings of this book, I’ve found that most people have already hit upon the major points of why I found it such an unsatisfying reading experience, and there were quite a few of them. To begin with, the actual title and the informational content of the book don’t really seem to jibe. There’s too much biographical information here, and of too many people, for the entire book to cohere in any meaningful way. The connection that one chapter has to the next is tenuous at best. For example, Gleick starts out talking about the ways in which African drummers drum in order to retain the information in a message over long distances (an fascinating way to the begin talking about information as a broad subject), but then almost inexplicably jumps directly into a short history of early English dictionary-making in the next chapter, and follows that with a history of the work Charles Babbage and Ada Byron Lovelace did together, including the Difference Machine and the Analytical Machine. Connecting them is only the thinnest of threads – the work of Claude Shannon and the birth of information theory - which isn’t even substantively developed until halfway through the book. Because of this, the whole endeavor ends up being a mile wide and an inch deep.Is it just me, or does most non-technical science- or technology-oriented writing “The Information” read this way? The narrative net seems like it needs to be cast so far and wide that even those readers who might be put to sleep reading about something like information theory (why are these people reading this book in the first place?) will be able to maintain their interest. It can mostly be avoided when the subject is narrowed to the life and/or ideas of one person, as in Gleick’s previous book on Isaac Newton, though I found that book a little unsatisfying for a different reason: I thought it was much too short.To give off the sense that this book wasn’t fun to read would be unfair. If you’re broadly interested in the history of science, this provides as a good introduction to a number of topics: in addition to the ones already mentioned, Gleick discusses telegraphy, the birth of statistical mechanics in physics and the concept of entropy, and the rise and difficulties of quantum computing. It’s just that the star of the show, the history of how “information” has been treated as such, suffers tremendously.I picked it up because 1) it was on the discount shelf at Barnes&Noble for a reasonable price (and if you can get it for six dollars, I would still say it’s worth investing in), and 2) I felt that my knowledge of information theory would be insufficient for a book that demanded a readership with more expertise. For those interested in something like the history of computing, this would be a wonderful place to start. Anyone expecting something more tightly focused on the likes of Claude Shannon, Norbert Weiner, their colleagues, and the development of fields like information theory and cybernetics will walk away wishing for something much more focused.

It's also been a characteristic of life since the advent of written language. And probably before that, but we can never know.I've been interested in information theory as it pertains to general systems theory in my undergraduate studies on the systems novel, and my quest of reading what Tom LeClair has dubbed the ""systext"" (a macro-novel made up of seven meganovels). However, to this point, I didn't have much reading in it beyond literary criticism, and the mastery of fictioneers like Pynchon whose forms and themes and concepts embody the core theory of information and communication. Gleick's book is an encyclopaedia of information's history, its theory and where we're at right now. In these senses it is an utter success. He maps the history of mass communication from beating drums in Africa to the most basic and indivisible form: the bit.The closing 3 chapters focus on where we are right now in our information-laden culture, with particular emphasis on Wikipedia as the real-life equivalent of Borges's library. These chapters are good, but feel a bit less ""significant"" than the rest of the book. In the closing, Gleick makes a compelling shift back toward the message and meaning and how we are the meaning-makers and information, essentially, lacks meaning until we interact with it, organize it.Also of great interest to me, and deeply affecting, was the scientific evolution of understanding information theory to finally understand our most basic atoms of information: genetics. It re-configures understanding about life and humanity to understand ourselves as computers. Processors of information. Information in the form of genetic code.If you're interested in information and communication theory, want to understand entropy better, get a compelling history of how humans have been creating devices of mass communication and computing for centuries, read this book. It will change how you understand information, how humans are information that also processes information, and what it means to be in the information."

I have read several books on information theory and have really enjoyed them. But, Gleick really knows how to convey almost every concept to his reader in the simplest, yet surprisingly complete, way. I have been annoyed with Richard Dawkins for many years now. I used to love him, but once epigenetics came on the scene and he threw fit after fit, not to mention the fit he threw about endosymbiosis, it is clear his time as an effective scientists has passed. However, Gleick's take on the selfish gene and its place in history reminded me about everything I once loved about Dawkins. From Shannon to Gamow, this book did justice to so many of the researchers whose passions gave rise to information theory. It is not as heavy on the science as some people might like, but the history is incredibly rich and interesting. I enjoyed it far more than Isaacson's The Innovators. I listened to the audio version while I jogged. Thinking back to the wonderful innovators of our time made me feel connected to the Earth and all that we have discovered about our universe. "

The library will endure; it is the universe. As for us, everything has not been written; we are not turning into phantoms. We walk the corridors, searching the shelves and rearranging them, looking for lines of meaning amid leagues of cacophony and incoherence, reading the history of the past and of the future, collecting our thoughts and collecting the thoughts of others, and every so often glimpsing mirrors, in which we may recognize creatures of the information.
The first time I saw Jurassic Park, I was surprised by the inclusion of Jeff Goldblum's character: why would the initial outsider tour of a dinosaur safari park require the presence of a Chaos Theorist? I decided his character was a popsciencey “dissenting expert” trope; “the bad boy of mathematics” being present to make author Michael Crichton look smarter than the viewer (or the reader of the original book) and to give the Paleontologists in the story someone to argue with. But in light of James Gleick's The Information, it's Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park that I'm primarily put in mind of: this is yet another book that I've read recently that takes as a given that the universe is simply a giant algorithm and humans are merely the machines evolved to compute it. If all of “the information” that we process can be expressed in binary digits, then all of life and all of experience is simply and purely math. As Gleick sketches out in this history of Information Theory, mathematicians have been grasping at this fact for the past century and a half, and throughout this time, there have always been Jeff Goldblum-type characters in the background, looking like lunatics while speaking the truth. If all of experience can be reduced to math, it follows that math can be used to predict experience, and ultimately, the Chaos Theorist was the most important member of the safari (helpfully reinforced in Crichton's story by having Jeff Goldblum be right about everything from the start). Today, we all benefit from the practical applications of Information Theory – with our laptops and smart phones and the dawn of quantum computing – but we should remember that in the shadows live these mathematician-philosophers who not only advance technology, but who are in effect changing the way that human brains work. I picked up The Information after having so enjoyed Gleick's latest book, Time Travel. What I most liked about that book were the intersections Gleick created between hard science, philosophy, and literature, and that is essentially the ethos of this earlier work, too. I do not have a math brain, but Gleick was able to lead me through the equations in the history of Information Theory, and with an interesting prose style, always bring the focus back to the fascinating people behind the evolving hypotheses. While discussing information as a flood, Gleick quotes Lewis Carrol's satirical bit about the drawbacks of creating a 1:1 scale map, and that's useful for me to remember as I attempt to record all the ideas in this book that interested me; the impulse would be to copy and paste the whole thing. Gleick begins by describing the earliest modes of faster-than-human-or-animal-conveyance long distance communication, and I was most fascinated by the idea that both African drumming (which was infinitely more rich and lyrical than later Morse Code; employing embedded redundancies much like those found later in the gene itself) and a string of bonfires are essentially both binary systems (the drums always communicated through two distinct tones and the fires were only on or off). Gleick covers the beginning of writing and the mental leap it took to evolve from hieroglyph-type pictograms to the metalanguage of substituting symbols for words and then for word-parts (which are themselves symbols). This leads to the Greek philosophers and my first wow moment: Socrates lived in a pre-writing era, and his protege Plato resisted the fad of writing down his own thoughts: warning that removing the need to remember facts would lessen our collective wisdom (and doesn't that sound familiar today?) When Plato's own protege, Aristotle, did begin to assemble knowledge in the written form, he was essentially inventing the way we now think (and I know that I could have learned, or even intuited, this before but I didn't: the reason why Aristotle was the father of all sciences and all theories of thought was because he was the first [Western] person to ever write it all down).
Logic might be imagined to exist independent of writing – syllogisms can be spoken as well as written – but it did not. Speech is too fleeting to allow for analysis. Logic descended from the written word, in Greece as well as India and China, where it developed independently. Logic turns the act of abstraction into a tool for determining what is true and what is false: truth can be discovered in words alone, apart from concrete experience. Logic takes its form in chains: sequences whose members connect one to another. Conclusions follow from premises. These require a degree of constancy. They have no power unless people can examine and evaluate them. In contrast, an oral narrative proceeds by accretion, the words passing by in a line of parade past the viewing stand, briefly present and then gone, interacting with one another via memory and association. 
Because of Aristotle, we are now people who think in terms of categories (proven to be true even for illiterate people in a literate society; a trait not found in nonliterate societies), but it wasn't until the invention of the printing press that knowledge became standardized.
Thomas Hobbes, in the seventeenth century, resisted his era’s new-media hype: “The invention of printing, though ingenious, compared with the invention of letters is no great matter.” Up to a point, he was right.  Every new medium transforms the nature of human thought. In the long run, history is the story of information becoming aware of itself.
Not long after Hobbes came Newton, and while I did know that he invented Calculus and ignited the Scientific Revolution in England, I knew but hadn't really appreciated that Newton also invented the language of Physics; being the first to use terms like “mass” and “force”; pretty much doing for math what Aristotle had earlier done for written language. The next parts that I found interesting involve the evolution of long distance communication, and especially the telegraphy towers – looking somewhat like windmills, they spoke a type of semaphore that could be seen and relayed from tower to tower – which was the height of communication right up until it wasn't: with the advent of electrical telegraphy and Morse Code, which was the height of communication right up until it wasn't: with the advent of telephones, which were the height...And in the background, there are all these mathematicians, looking like lunatics while speaking the truth, and I especially enjoyed the image of Charles Babbage and his steampunk computer, and his contemporary, the Lady Ada Lovelace (illegitimate daughter of Lord Byron and, like Babbage, a genius thinker born before her time; forced to express her mathematical insights as philosophy because technology hadn't yet caught up to her vision). Imagine the first dictionary needing to begin by explaining what is meant by “alphabetical” and how to use the system to find entries within the book itself. With the turn of the twentieth century, I was fascinated by Gödel's incompleteness theorem, Maxwell's Demon, the Turing Machine, Wiener's Cybernetics, Claude Shannon's Information Theory, and Richard Dawkin's selfish gene; for what is a human if not a means for a gene to transmit its information?
The macromolecules of organic life embody information in an intricate structure. A single hemoglobin molecule comprises four chains of polypeptides, two with 141 amino acids and two with 146, in strict linear sequence, bonded and folded together. Atoms of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and iron could mingle randomly for the lifetime of the universe and be no more likely to form hemoglobin than the proverbial chimpanzees to type the works of Shakespeare. Their genesis requires energy; they are built up from simpler, less patterned parts, and the law of entropy applies. For earthly life, the energy comes as photons from the sun. The information comes via evolution.
 So here's the tl;dr: I have read other reviews that lay out all the ways in which Gleick is supposed to have stressed the wrong ideas or misinterpreted others, but as a primer for the history of Information Theory, I found The Information to have been an accessible and fascinating read. As a non-expert, I have no idea if I understood this book down to its bones, but I do now appreciate why Jeff Goldblum's character was in Jurassic Park."
32,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,5,"James Gleick doesn’t address the beginning of human language in this book, but he seems to cover all the major developments in human communication since then. The origin and impact of writing, the challenge of conveying messages across a distance (exemplified by the talking drums of Africa as well as by the varieties of telegraph), the invention of printing, the development of information theory, the rise of computing, aspects of the history of dictionaries and encyclopedias, including the growth of Wikipedia: all that is here, along with discussions of mathematical logic, codes and code-breaking, quantum theory, cybernetics, genetics, memetics, and info-glut (a current complaint with a surprisingly long history).Does that sound like a morass of abstraction? Quite likely. But the book is an orderly thing—quite fitting, given that order and its opposite number, entropy, weigh heavily here; it’s clear, elegant, and in many ways quite down-to-earth. It has a story to tell, which progresses more or less chronologically from prehistory to the present. It even has a hero: Claude Shannon, a mathematician employed by Bell Telephone Laboratories who, in the middle of the 20th century, founded the entire field of information theory. You may not know his name, but you will have heard one of his ideas; in a groundbreaking paper published in 1948, the same year the transistor was invented (also at Bell Labs), Shannon proposed that units of information “may be called binary digits, or more briefly, bits.” (A tantalizing endnote reports that Shannon got the term from a Bell Labs researcher named John W. Tukey.) As Gleick unfolds his tale, one begins to grasp what he’s getting at in his oddly worded title. Information is history, in that history is essentially a set of recorded statements, but it’s also something that has a history, and it’s a theory as well, and it’s another name for the sense impressions, including written words, with which the world increasingly inundates us. About halfway through, Gleick gives us Shannon’s central equation (I can’t reproduce it here exactly as Gleick presents it) and goes on to say that H, the quantity it defines, is “conventionally called the entropy of a message, or the Shannon entropy, or, simply, the information.” Hence the first two words of the title. The world is a message; this book is Gleick’s way of coming to grips with what that means.Here and there, one might wish for slight differences in the treatment. Gleick emphasizes the evanescence of oral communication and the persistence of writing, but both could stand to be qualified. Oral expressions didn’t always vanish on the wind, else Homer’s work wouldn’t have survived to be recorded, nor would cultural memories of a great flood. Likewise, the written word can be impermanent; Gleick does make this point, by reference to the burning of the library at Alexandria, but he does so late in the book, a good ways after his discussion of the transition from orality to writing.Though Gregory Bateson makes a brief appearance, Gleick doesn’t include Bateson’s memorable suggestion that a piece of information is any difference that makes a difference. (There’s some dispute over exactly what Bateson said and exactly what it meant, but its import seems solid enough to me.) The concept Bateson was trying to elucidate nonetheless comes through clearly; it’s implicit in telegraphic transmissions, for instance, which employ a difference between sound and silence and, where there is sound, a difference in duration between a dot and a dash. And Gleick does quote—among many other choice gleanings—the version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics that Tom Stoppard conceived for a character in Arcadia, “You cannot stir things apart,” which ranks as one of the best plain-language statements of a scientific principle yet devised.Gleick has accomplished something important here, drawing together and distilling far-flung, seemingly unrelated elements, casting all our recent talk of an information age in a far broader context. Who would expect to find in one volume Robert Burton, Charles Babbage, Jorge Luis Borges, and Francis Crick? (Very few women appear, among them Ada Lovelace.) In a way, the book does what science itself does: it reveals an unseen order. I found it wondrous even though I already knew much of this in outline. The Information feels enormous (but isn’t—like Doctor Who’s vehicle, it’s bigger on the inside) and complete yet may leave you wanting more. Those who do can pursue Gleick’s sources in the notes and the bibliography, which together occupy 74 pages after the text. "

Admittedly he hasn't always lived up to the promise of his excellent Chaos, but most of his books have been top notch.In The Information, Gleick gives us a full bore account of the defining feature of our age. We explore the nature of information, how it has been communicated from the written word and jungle drums through to the internet, and, perhaps most fascinating of all, Gleick takes us through the social historical impact of a burgeoning quantity of information. It's fascinating that the whole idea of information overload was first brought up not as a result of the internet, but hundreds of years earlier as a response to the flood of information that the printing press released on the world. And then again for microfilm.Rather oddly for someone who has made their name as a science writer, Gleick comes across best in the social history sections. The more detailed the science, the more he loses us. In part this is down to the Claude Shannon effect. Shannon is an absolutely central figure in information theory, and yet every book I've ever read that featured him gets dull when he is mentioned. I don't know why, exactly, but Shannon is like one of those people at parties who can be talking about the most exciting subject and yet make it depressingly boring.You can't write a book like this without having a lot of Shannon turning up, but it does make it difficult for the writer to keep the reader's attention. I also thought that Gleick could have made more of the whole 'it from bit' cosmological theory - it comes across very vaguely, without the scientific backing you might expect. But there is so much more to enjoy, whether it's one of the best accounts of Babbage and Ada King (not Lovelace) and the emerging concept of computing, or Turing's work, or telegraphy wireless and otherwise. It's a rich (if not always well-structured) concoction of information about information.There's so much information in there, you suspect that Gleick's research was occasionally a bit thin. So, for instance, he refers to the transistor pioneer William Shockley as an Englishman. Shockley was an American, brought up in America. The only reason I can imagine anyone calling him English is that when you glance at his Wikipedia entry (and yes, Wikipedia gets a fascinating write-up in the book), it jumps out of you that he was born in London. Read a little further, though, and you'll see this is just because his American parents happened to be there at the time.I do also have a couple of small issues with this book as a whole. Firstly it's a doorstop. I seriously dislike books this thick, and it's a mark of how good the good parts are that I put up with a 526 page tome. There are a couple of chapters that could be done away with entirely, and there's a lot of unnecessary flowery text. The other issue is that it can stray a little into the pretentious. This comes across perhaps most strongly in the title - putting 'The' upfront feels very calculated.However, The Information does squeak in as a five star book, partly because the subject is so central to twenty-first century civilization (I find it difficult to think of a day when I haven't used the internet or touched a book) - and partly because when Gleick's writing is going brilliantly, which is for well over half the book, he is compelling to read. This is a truly interesting book, even if you may have to skip a few bits to get through it. And it is one you ought to have on your shelf. (Just make sure it is reinforced first.)Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission."

This is a work of non-fiction, but it has a few clear protagonists.Robert Cawdrey, who (in English, anyway) seems to have introduced the literate world to the idea of making a book which gave the meaning of words. He had among other tasks to introduce his readers to the idea of ""alphabetical order"", and explain to them how that worked in order to find the word they were looking for.Ada Lovelace, the patron saint of computer programmers, who has as much claim as anyone to have written the first computer program (and this before the computer was actually built yet). Sure, Babbage gets more of the credit, but Lovelace did her part, and if Babbage had been able to complete his (getting the hardware working) then she would be more famous for it.Claude Shannon, the post-WWII Bell Labs/MIT nerd who taught the world to think about ""information"" as a thing separate from meaning. Which, one could argue, was an omen of what was to come of us as a species.What Gleick is doing in his book is roughly the opposite of what these (and many other) thinkers did. We can more or less take it as self-evident that words exist, in a sense, independent of the uses they are being put to. We move without thinking of a sequence of limb movements that compose the act of walking or running; we make facial expressions without necessarily thinking of all of the possible muscle movements in the human face and how they are combined. Once upon a time, Gleick is explaining to us, information was invisible like this.We have grown up with the idea of bytes, letters, words, files, records, and the other units of information and meaning. In a way, it is as difficult for Gleick to explain how these things were discovered (or thought of, however you prefer to think of it), as it was for the discoverers to do it. The reason, is that first he has to explain to the reader, with enough well-chosen anecdotes and analogies to make us really feel it, that it was possible for untold generations of humans to speak language, make music, create images, and yet never need concepts such as 'information', or the distinction between meaning and form. It's almost like trying to explain to an adult what it is like to be a baby who doesn't know any language yet.Gleick is one of the best in the world at doing this kind of thing, which is to say thinking long and deeply about not only scientific concepts, but the history of how they were arrived at. T.S. Eliot wrote: ""We shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time."" Gleick starts in our preliterate, literally prehistoric past, and takes us right through human history again, looking at each age through the lens of how we as a species thought about information itself, and ends in the present, where we are drowning in a flood of information that we can neither comprehend, stop, nor ignore. We have no answers, but we understand the questions better than before. From many facts, Gleick brings to us a bit of meaning."
36,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,4,"Jame's Gleick's The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood is kind of all over the place, as you might expect given its nebulous subject matter. The author intends to do pretty much what the subtitle suggests: review the history of information as a concept, dive into the scientific field of information theory, and ponder what recent volume of information flow means for us as a society or even as a species. As such, it's a mix of history, hard science, and even a dash of speculation.My favorite parts of the book were the history of science bits, which Gleick presents after what seems to be exhaustive and comprehensive research. He traces the evolution of information as a concept, starting around the invention of the written word, then working up through the time line and pointing out landmarks like the printing press, the discovery of logarithms, the telegraph, Morse code, the telephone, the computer, the Internet, and the like. Each of these is discussed in the context of how they shaped the abstract concept of ""information"" and all led to the inevitable creation of a theory of information. I also loved learning about all the people behind these inventions and discoveries, and Gleick delivers the best bits of biographies on characters like Samuel Morse, Alan Turing, Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace (nee Byron), Claude Shannon, James Maxwell, and more. These parts of the book were replete with fun facts and amusing stories, like the woman who tried to ""send"" a bowl of sauerkraut by the newly invented telegraph or how the editors of the Oxford Dictionary decide what new words to add each edition. It's all very educational and made me think of information and the information technology around me in new ways. I always love learning about visionaries and how they made their mark.The sections on the formal theory of information, though, were also enjoyable, but to my layman mind they were sometimes dense to the point of being impenetrable. Gleick doesn't shy away from the hard stuff, and his discussion of information theory is flung far enough to cover many fields: mathematics, cybernetics, quantum theory, psychology, electrical engineering, chemistry, astrophysics, computer programming, genetics, history, cryptology, and more. And while Gleick doesn't revel in jargon and he makes many attempts to keep things at a high level, much of the book is unavoidably scholarly. Still, I was usually able to follow along with the WHAT he was getting at, if not the HOW. And it really is impressive how widely he casts his net.And I'm glad I did. While some of the finer points may have been lost on me, I enjoyed the history of science treatment and got enough of it to get a feel for the shape of information theory and how the general concept of information has evolved and been revealed through advances in philosophy, science, and technology --what it is, how it's measured, where it goes, and what its properties are. It's heady stuff, but fun to think about."
37,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,3,"Not done but love it so far. Everything's very meta, which may get tiring but at first blush it is afun intelectual romp. Historical and dramatic, it reads likea novel. We get to think about which came first, thought or language, and maybe some motivation to agree with the surprise answer. African drums encoding a noisy channel for fwd error correction, Aristotle as a pedantic semantic philosopher,andlots of other fun facts. A last very favorite of mine is the Babylonian closing to algoritmic recitations, spoken no doubt very reverently: ""...this is the procedure."" It was still way way BC, or they would have finished it with a solemn ""Amen.""So many fun factoids!Closing update.Centennial is a great TV miniseries. It's very old, came out after ""Roots,"" which was perhaps the first one ever. The story of how different life was in that culture, recognizable as ""here"" yet far away in time, is the fascination of history. A slide rule is another example. Mysteries of ancient technology, still impressive, inscribed like runes with permanent, inscrutable intent. Who were these ancient engineers burrowing like bees in their cubical hives? I am fascinated in an archaeological way that Ihave never felt about dusty artifacts in history museums. That fascination describes this book, as Gleick unfolds mysteries of information and communication. I was hooked as soon as I heard the jungle drums. Like Michener, Gleick offers a smorgasbord of anecdotes, a glut of information. Without the fictional aid of a single Pasquinel to tie the plot line together, and more time to cover, Gleick has to jump between topics at times. The thus partitioned chapters are bite-sized, but also a little unsatisfying. By the end I wanted more depth, and fewer pages. Was this because history becomes less interesting as it approaches present day, I wondered? Perhaps, but I lament the missing Viterbi codes, and could have used more on qubits than the superficial discussion of their spelling idiosyncracies.  JG lost me when he repeated himself. Or rather, and worse, he re-quoted someone else. This highlighted for me that we are reading a work of scholarship, not creation, where the brilliance is entirely reflected, and the mastery is that of a painstaking editor. I felt MIchener was phoning it in"" probably via instructions to a research team of undergraduatehistory interns, and that's how this book felt, towards the end. It's a shame to leave that foul taste from something that began most deliciously. There are 100 pages of index, which I mention to give you hope, and a further 100 pages of fumbling for a missing finale which you can truly skip. Enjoy this book for the first 350 pages though, and put it down at the first sign of an alternate spelling for q-bit; after that there is, alas, no more information."
38,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5456705-mindy-mcadams,5,"I LOVED this book! Oddly enough, I was already familiar with many of the ideas it covers, and that is why I was in no hurry to read it. I usually feel bored when reading about things I already know, so I thought this book would not keep me interested. Then I saw a few friends had given it 4 and 5 stars, and they also know a lot about information technologies and so on. I asked them about this book, and they persuaded me to give it a try.I would estimate that as much as half the book covers ideas and history I already knew. Part of what I loved was that even while I was reading those parts, author James Gleick still brought out things I did not know, or (better yet) made connections to other aspects of ""information"" that I had never considered in that context before. This was really wonderful, and very enjoyable. It was like having little firecrackers explode in my mind. Gleick never succumbs to pedestrian writing. He must lovingly go over each sentence many times to cut the fat and bring out a natural way of telling the story. He weaves different periods of time together (I loved how Isaac Newton reappears more than once, especially for having invented new uses for old words because it was necessary for him to be able to define and describe physics) and revisits people and concepts after you thought he was finished with them. In particular, Claude Shannon (the originator of ""information theory"") almost haunts the book like a ghost. When Gleick casually seats Shannon and Alan Turing at a lunch table together in 1943, sparks fly. They ""said nothing to each other about their work, because it was secret"" (p. 204).Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, Richard Dawkins, Norbert Wiener, and many other visionaries I have relished reading about over the years make star appearances here. But Gleick is not writing about the people. He's writing about their ideas, and how ideas breed new ideas, and how people find them, and become possessed by them (the memes replicating themselves). It's magical. It's marvelous. It's the best book ever about technology because it's not about technology. I was a little sad that Vannevar Bush's Memex is never mentioned, and I thought Tim Berners-Lee should have been in there somewhere too. Especially when Gleick wrote about Jorge Luis Borges and libraries. Those are my biases. But how delightful to see Walter Ong and the alphabet in a book that also discusses entropy (chapter 9, the best!) and quantum physics (chapter 13, the most difficult for me). This book is a great adventure of the mind. It weaves ideas together into a tapestry that is dense with difference, complexity, randomness, and unpredictability. How fabulous! "
39,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1323157-keith,4,"Gleick here does for (or to) information theory what he did for chaos theory 24 years previously. This time, however, it didn't feel quite so revolutionary. Now perhaps that's because I'm no longer freshly graduated from high school and utterly fascinated by developments that were not so much as hinted at in any class I'd yet heard about, let alone taken. But while that's surely a factor, it seems more that this simply wasn't as far along the bleeding edge as was Chaos, maybe just because in this era we are positively swimming in information: it is ubiquitous and commonplace where chaos theory was exotic and unknown, at least until the book came out, at which point it quickly devolved into a Jeff Goldblum movie cliché. Chaos, while necessarily addressing the past–even those who write about time travel still can't authoritatively author the history of the future–felt like it was the future-now, whereas Information feels more squarely historical, not just ""how did we get here?"" but ""how did we get where we've been for the last 20 years?""Nevertheless, there is still quite a lot of fascinating science history here, woven together in a way that no other pop-sci author I'm aware of has ever managed apart from the more hyper-connective Burke and perhaps the somewhat more narrowly-focused Sagan. Even having studied the field already, numerous characters were drawn in and fleshed out in ways I expected not at all. If you're a fan of pop-sci, or any of the aforementioned authors, and especially if you enjoyed

However, after reading ""The Information"", rather than rehashing knowledge I already had, I discovered my science education was deficient. James Gleick has put together a piece of text that is entertaining and informative. Using the difference machine of Charles Babbage, the abstract mathematical proofs of Kurt Godel, and the information revolution heralded by Claude Shannon, this book will revolutionise your view of the modern world. You will learn how information is key to all of our actions, how it can be used to guide and confuse us, and how it will dictate the evolution of mankind. I do feel that the book is written at such a level that people without a familiarity with university science may struggle to get the full return that this book can provide to the reader. Gleick also can get distracted by the historical circumstances of the ideas he is investigating and can be a bit too liberal with the length of quotations from other sources. However, these are very minor gripes about a piece of work that has changed my view of the world. I am still flabbergasted that my 21st century science degree hardly touched on the idea of information..."

For those less scientifically minded, he keeps the narrative moving along with fascinating facts, colorful digressions, and vivid portraits of long-forgotten inventors. Although the New York Times Book Review complained that later chapters on the meaning of information veered from science into the treacherous terrain of philosophy, other reviewers considered his final ruminations insightful and eloquent. Readers may find The Information a dense and demanding read, but this illuminating book is well worth the effort. This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
42,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076961-scotchneat,5,"I wrote a more complete review on my blog.As with Chaos, Gleick displays a mastery and a passion for the history of ideas while creating new connections himself. Thinkers great and small come to life, and he has a real knack for surfacing exactly the right quote or life detail in a the life of whatever thought he’s following.Gleick starts (and ends) with Shannon – that odd man from Bell Labs whose information theory is one of the most important developments of thought in the 20th Century, and who starred in Chaos as well. Shannon was a practical man for all that. Whatsoever you understand about information, interference, bits and bobs, data, bits and bytes, or memes, Shannon had a hand in it. He was that badass.I stopped many times to revel in a factoid or shake my head at the human-ness of the way thoughts travel across disciplines, and sometimes don't. If you have any interest in the history of thought, and especially in information theory, you really should read this book."
43,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1529137-alice,4,"The first half is an absolutely fantastic media history text that steps briskly through African drumming, the alphabet, print, the telegraph, and Turing, Babbage and Lovelace; and the second half is a slightly-less brisk, slightly-less accurate telling of some of the major advances of the 20th century in terms of transforming an array of things (genetic information, algorithms, telephony) into what we think of as ""information."" I can't give this five stars because some of the mathematicians I read it with hated it rabidly and pointed out all sorts of errors in the text I would never have found because I am not a well-read mathematician. But I enjoyed the first half so much that I will forgive Gleick the slightly-less coherent second half, in that it does not wrap everything together so well as you think a 600-page book would.Took me several weeks of intense reading and was worth all the effort. Highly recommended for media historians, iSchool academics and computer history nerds. The chapter on Ada Lovelace is amazing."

At points, it can get a bit dense when he is trying to explain difficult abstract logical, physical and mathematical concepts, but otherwise it's written in the pop science narrative style that makes those books so easy to digest.I admit that this probably isn't a 5-star book for everyone, but I felt like I learned something on just about every page. For me, that's the ultimate compliment I can pay a book. I feel like I should have had more exposure to information theory and its implications by now, but somehow I have only brushed by it. Perhaps that's why I feel I learned so much from this book. It's an introduction to something I already have innumerable touchpoints with and yet it's never been laid out or explained to me."

Here we are by happenstance, it turns out, the sons and daughters of survivalism and sexuality. There was all of a sudden only one thing to set us apart from the roughly 8.7 million other million species on this planet: our ability to process, document, and share information. But what is information?Only now do I appreciate the exceeding difficulty of answering what seems like such a straightforward question. You don't know it when you see it; you don't see it at all. Even my usually authoritative-soundng Oxford English Dictionary comes up pathetically short: ""what is conveyed or represented by a particular arrangement or sequence of things.""
  1
In interviews James Gleick has said that this is a book he has wanted to write nearly his entire life. The sweeping bibliography and index justify the delay. It took me three months to read — albeit with many other books and pauses interspersed. A deep analysis of something as abstract as 'information' leaves the reader staring often at the ceiling, trying to make sense of the perpetually perplexing.
  2
 Can information exist without communication? Is there such a thing as knowledge, or is some information merely more useful in particular contexts? Is genetic information really information — based on bits, communicated by computers? Can we eventually capture all of the genetic information of the entire biosphere on a single hard drive? And, if so, is that all we are, a humble collection of bits and algorithms? If those algorithms are pre-decided, then is our destiny as well?The book begins with a quote from Zadie Smith, and it is quite possibly the most unremarkable paragraph she has ever written; except that, when placed in this new context, it speaks directly to an inquietude that now overwhelms us all:Anyway, those tickets, the old ones, they didn't tell you where you were going, much less where you came from. He couldn't remember seeing any dates on them, either, and there was certainly no mention of time. It was all different now, of course. All this information. Archie wondered why that was.Give that information (sometimes referred to as 'culture', 'facts', 'intelligence', 'data', 'meaning', 'dogma' and 'knowledge') is what distinguishes humans from our primate predecessors, it is incredible that there was no technical definition at all until 1949 when Claude Shannon published ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication,"" giving rise to the theoretical fields of information theory and Information Science, but also to practical engineering approaches to storing information on magnetic tape and communicating it across networks. As the subtitle discloses from the get-go, this is a book that treats its topic from three different angles. First we are given an overview of the history of information before we knew how to define it. Here there are African drums that talk, optical telegraph towers constructed across France at the height of the revolution, and Samuel Morse's electric telegraph and famous code.Next we delve into theory, specifically information theory and its various applications in communication, biology, physics, chemistry and quantum mechanics. At times Gleick seems to exuberantly make the case for information theory as a Theory of Everything.
  3
 This was most economically and mystically expressed in 1989 by John Wheller: ""It from bit."" Information is physical, it must be stored on tangible objects, and must therefore obey the laws of physics. ""To do anything requires energy. To specify what is done requires information.""If all of this sounds increasingly abstract, it only becomes more so, until the theory eventually reaches an apex of abstraction: quantum computing, the fundamentals of which remain beyond my cerebral grasp. For me, the most startling and intriguing ramification of information theory is that information is a measure of probability. 1010101010 contains less information than 1010100011, despite their same quantity of digits, as the former can be expressed by ""repeat 10 five times"" whereas the latter is seemingly random. The significance is that information, randomness, complexity, and computability are four different ways to express the same principle; namely, that 'information' refers to that which we cannot predict.And then I stare at the ceiling.There are increasing accusations against information theory. It has overstepped its application, some say, limiting our understanding of natural processes by viewing everything through a metaphor of bits. As early as 2000 Paul E Griffiths called genetic information ""a metaphor in search of a theory."" Gleick devotes an entire chapter to exploring the math behind claims that information theory is reductionist, beginning with Gödel's notorious incompleteness theorems and ending with Laplace's Demon. It is a frustrating chapter; just when the concept of information seems to make so much sense, it turns out not to.And then I stare at the ceiling.Finally, we enter the third section of the book, the flood. As information becomes exponentially cheaper to store, it becomes exponentially cheaper to ""create."" Hence, as Google's Eric Schmidt is eager to remind audiences, ""every two days we now create as much information as we did up to 2003."" In Claude Shannon's groundbreaking paper he estimated the size of the greatest store of information known to humanity at the time, the Library of Congress. Shannon estimated that it was probably around a terabyte. He was very close. Today CERN generates 1 petabyte of data per second — that's 1,000 terabytes per second.Gleick writes with sympathetic compassion toward those of us who are overwhelmed by the flood. Citing a beautiful essay by David Foster Wallace, he reminds us that making decisions depends on eliminating options, and that we now have more information, more options, to eliminate than ever. He cites psycho-neurological research that shows we often make worse decisions when confronted with more information, even if it is entirely relevant.But in his review of The Information for the New York Review of Books, Freeman Dyson is decidedly less sympathetic toward the info-overwhelmed. Wikipedia, he reminds us, is a product of the flood, as is 21st century science.Ultimately, we are reminded, information is a part of evolution, and it is now up to us to adapt or drown in the flood.I only have one bone to pick with Gleick's nearly masterful overview of information, and that is his silent transition from bits to meaning. On one page he is summarizing the difficulties of incorporating classical information theory into quantum computing, and the very next page he describes the birth of Wikipedia.Wikipedians like to claim that they are organizing all of the world's knowledge, but 'knowledge' turns out to be even more difficult to define than information. We know how to measure economic capital, but intellectual capital is a guessing game. Einstein's theory of relativity probably contains more 'knowledge' than whoever came up with the idea to make a sandwich with peanut butter, honey, and banana — but only in certain circumstances. In other words, ""meaning"" refers to relevance, which is inherently subjective.Gleick emphasizes from the very beginning — and throughout the book — that Shannon's paper and the birth of information theory was only made possible by divorcing information from meaning. But he doesn't even attempt to draw the fuzziest of lines between the two, though he does seem disposed to the human-centric view of Heinz von Foerster who argued at an early cybernetics conference that it was fundament able to distinguish between the ""beep beeps"" of information theory and the ""process of understanding,"" the decoding, that takes place in the human brain. To put it another way, ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and information is in the head of the receiver."" 1 ☞ Apparently I don't have the latest version of the OED; in a blog post for the New York Review of Books, Gleick notes that the latest entry for 'information' now runs 9,400 words and prompted an essay-length meditation by OED managing editor Michael Proffitt. After all, Gleick reminds us, OED is in the information business, like so many of us.2 ☞ My intellectual insecurity was somewhat soothed when I saw that Cory Doctorow — voracious reader and perversely prolific writer — frequently ""stopped reading it a lot … stopped to stare into space and go 'huh' and 'wow' and 'huh' again.""3 ☞ ""Why does nature appear quantized?"" Gleick rhetorically asks before answering himself: ""Because information is quantized. The bit is the ultimate, unsplittable particle."""

True story: I've been a Gleick fan ever since a beguiling young woman gave me Chaos for my birthday. We were married about a year later, have two kids, and continue to enjoy chaos all year round. TMI?(Ba-DUMP-bump! Thanks, I'll be here all week; please remember to tip the hard-working wait staff.) Gleick's nothing if not well-researched, systematic, and detailed. Long before getting to the idea of too much information, he aims to break down the idea of ""information"" from its philosophical underpinnings before considering Claude Shannon's rigorous and groundbreaking mathematical definition for it, and then closing with a survey of theoretical applications since. It's a three-star sweep.Those interested in learning about Claude Shannon and information theory are best directed to William Poundstone's Fortune's Formula, which offers not only a crack summation of the topic, but titillation too in the form of its successful later applications to Vegas and Wall Street by Shannon and mathematical whiz wolf Ed Thorp. By contrast, The Information is a broader, more sprawling survey (as an utterly irrelevant aside, great band, but otherwise, why the ""the?""). Gleick tries to impose focus by prologue-teasing the development of Shannon's thinking, and then flashing back in time... sort of. However, this actually ends up more awkward than suspenseful, since he forswears transitions. You're just getting into the good stuff, when suddenly, you're off on what appears to be an utter digression about different building blocks of thought -- words, phonemes, pictograms -- and the invention of the alphabet.Gleick walks us briskly through all of Charles Babbage's nineteenth century dilettante dabblings -- the crucial one being his failed attempt to fabricate a steampunk computer -- before jumping to the respective inventions of the telegraph and telephone, Morse Code, and extemporizing for a bit on cryptography from Gilded Age obsession to contemporary driver of online finance. (Not incidentally, a better, albeit fictional exploration of this subject can be found in Neal Stephenson's brilliant Cryptonomicon.) Gleick never really bothers to consider the invention of radio, television, film, or most other media for some reason, but wireless is important, because before you know it he's talking about WWII code crackers (at last back to Shannon and, aHa! colleague Alan Turing), which then leads us through a whirlwind tour of Bell Labs (where Shannon did much of his work), the invention of the modern mechanical computer (along with the transistor that facilitated its engineering), artificial intelligence and the Turing Test, and... finally... bandwidth, compression, and the internet.A quick aside on compression... For me, the best part of this book comes when Gleick shares Shannon's demonstration of the statistical redundancies built into language (using the English language as an example). Redundancy turns out to be a crucial part of comprehension. The duplication allows you to miss or misunderstand a part of the message, but retain the meaning from the entirety of the context. (This is apparently how African talking drums work; by reproducing the pitch and rhythm of, say, the Yoruba dialect, speakers can thereby glean the intent of a longer message. You can play this as a game with someone by chanting or singing ""Da Da"" in the scansion of a well-known phrase, poem, or song and seeing whether they can figure out what it was that you meant to convey.)Another such game is called the Shannon Game (which you can also find analyzed in Brian Christian's terrific The Most Human Human). Shannon's Game is played a bit like Hangman, only each character (or space) must be guessed in order and the fun (? or at least, the ir/regularity of English spelling) is exposed as you discover how many or how few guesses it takes to come up with the next logical character in the series. As it happens, Claude Shannon calculated the measure of this statistical ir/regularity (which he called ""entropy"") and determined that the English language was about 50% redundant. He then used his statistical analysis to produce a variety of sample texts (which Gleick reproduces at pp. 226-227), to demonstrate emerging coherence. Reading these is fantastic fun, like watching language come into focus from completely random characters (""XFOML RXKHRJFFJUJ ZLPWCFWKCYJ..."") to what looks like substitution code (""OCRO HLI RGWR NMIELWIS EU LL NBNESEBYA..."") to gibberish (""IN NO IST LAT WHEY CRATICT FROURE BIRS GROCID PONDENOME..."") to doubletalk (""REPRESENTING AND SPEEDILY IS AN GOOD APT OR COME CAN DIFFERENT NATURAL HERE HE THE..."") to word salad (""THE HEAD AND IN FRONTAL ATTACK ON AN ENGLISH WRITER THAT THE CHARACTER OF THIS POINT IS THEREFORE ANOTHER METHOD...""). You can tell this use of language is intuitive, just by typing out the phrases yourself; the less random ones can be entered all the more rapidly. I just think that's neat.Gleick throws this out there in the context of a larger discussion about the evolving definition of ""entropy"" and Maxwell's Demon (which is interesting enough, but very much a tangent). He follows this up with a confusing segue into the inherent cross-disciplinary vagueness of the (competing? co-extensive?) concept of Cybernetics, along with a bit of its inventor's biography, and then, WHAM! Gleick tries to wrap up by exploring the overwhelming influence Shannon's information theory had via extrapolation to genetics (DNA), psychology (cognitive neuroscience and digital vs. analog transmissions across nerves and synapses), and even quantum physics (there's something called a quantum computer that uses quantum teleportation... or something... I couldn't really follow the principles involved, and Gleick shrugs off any extended attempt at analogy or useful metaphor by deferring to Richard Feynman's statement that the actions of quantum physics are essentially incomprehensible).I say ""tries"" to wrap up, only because it seems to me that beginning about Chapter 14 (""After the Flood""), Gleick kind of coasts philosophically along to a 40-50 page ending. Despite having taken 373 pages of pains to ground his book in the useful ramifications of distinguishing ""signal"" and ""noise"" in an agnostic manner, that is, by breaking down information content into ""bits"" capable of being transmitted and reproduced with minimal corruption wholly apart from any consideration of the content's meaning (meaning being something we ultimately determine for ourselves), Gleick sails off to philosophical shores, taking up Jorge Luis Borges' universal library (the one that contains every work ever created or yet to be created, along with every possible combination and variation of text, image, and sound, including all possible typos, glitches, and snowy confusions), and other arbitrarily selected considerations of the origins and limits of comprehensibility. This vague, metaphysical meandering brings to mind the problem of too much (or perhaps, too little) information.Personally, outside the vernacular context of exhibitionism I don't view TMI as a problem; all the handwringing strikes me very much as Chicken Little vogue. Gleick takes this on directly at pp. 400-401 by contrasting Carl Bridenbergh (President of the American Historical Association in the 1960s, who, fearing finite collective memory space, worried that constant content would lead to amnesia and the eventual deletion of history) with Elizabeth Eisenstein, who in her late '70's review The Printing Press as an Agent of Change, observed that the printed record's precise purpose was external storage, and that we should instead be concerned with ever-growing piles of new data that don't so much overwrite the past as make the good stuff harder to find. Following Eisenstein, Gleick points out that TMI alarms were sounded with every new communications technology, predating and including that of Gutenberg. He quotes a run-on diary entry from Oxford scholar Robert Burton, owner of 1,700 books in 1621, who complained even then of having too much to read.You'll be indifferent to hear that my thinking about the role of filters and search technology to separate wheat from chaff, signal from noise hasn't changed in the last three years. Those interested in reading my views on the subject can see the previous linked essay, which is directly relevant, and my two follow-ups on the logical evolutions of copyright law and libraries. As can be read elsewhere, I'm far more concerned with the difficulty of distinguishing diluted, distorted, and misattributed content than being overwhelmed by a nonstop stream that flows continuously over me unheeded. As to the opportunity cost of what I miss, well, ignorance is bliss.However, as an organic corporeal thing it is surely true that individual human capacity is finite... why, every now and again I see a comment on one of my book reviews only to find myself startled I had read the book at all (the aide memoire being a big reason I write these reviews). What's more, unless and until the aging process is halted or reversed, it is also true that the individual human life span is finite, and so a paltry 4,000 books are about the most the average reader can reasonably hope to absorb before dying. (I've calculated this as one book per week, 50 weeks per year, for 80 years.) But what of these assumptions? Neither our internal capacity nor our lifespan have changed that greatly in the modern era, nor do they seem likely to change in the near future. Frankly, as my brain must surely fill up with something, I see the ever-increasing options as more liberating than crippling. F@#! Fear Factor... gimme that remote; what other channels can I get on this thing?When it comes to considering intake, we are by no means paralyzed by choice. As Goodreads alone can attest, we are social beings who constantly throw content into one anothers' faces. Short of living one's life in an isolation tank, it's all but impossible to avoid input. Even in a state of nature (let's say Yosemite), you can't take a step without experiencing a bit of Whoa-check-out-that-(insert noun here)! In that sense, our environment has as much or more influence on our content selection than our conscious direction.Nor do the purported adverse affects of short-attention-span-theater really bother me. Recall Shannon's entropy and the talking drums. Especially with social media, so much of the content with which we are flooded is overlapping and redundant. Allow me to offer another personal anecdotal example. Every spring I am privileged to bike to work past the blooming cherry blossoms that encircle the Tidal Basin on the Washington (DC) Mall. I pay for that privilege by forced navigation of the hordes of dawn photographers, each one seeking to capture sunrise on the perfect petal. Think I'm exaggerating? Go to Flickr and type in ""DC cherry blossom festival."" Even if you're not a snap-happy tourist, you've no reason to pay more than bare printing cost if you want to have a high-quality poster of a blooming cherry tree.It seems to me that those discomfited by an ever-increasing surfeit of content are really confronted by evidence of their own anonymity and insignificance. The more material that gets published, the more information we are able to capture, store, and retrieve, and in consequence the more we must come to grips with our own humility. We are each but a pebble on a vast beachhead resting on a single planet of a vast universe. And what of that? Studies have shown that we can only maintain a sense of personal connection with about 150 people at any given time... so if influencing, imprinting, or imposing our ideas on one another is our ultimate ambition, getting across to 150 people certainly seems manageable, whether or not you are blessed with a LinkedIn account. After all, we may be only stardust among dust-like stars, but to optimistically paraphrase Joni Mitchell, we are nonetheless golden."
53,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/903066-johnny,5,"Can all life be summarized in terms of “bits” of information? Does our world have a predominantly semiotic quality to it? Those are the questions which have been buzzing around my feeble little mind since I first started reading The Information by James Gleick. The story ostensibly begins with Claude Shannon’s idea of measuring information in terms of “bits.” (p. 14 in my eBook version) The idea is that a quantity of information gets through accurately, not a concern for what the specific information is. His formula was H = -∑pi log2pi and hinges on the idea that, in a coin toss, the probability for either heads or tails is ½. So, one takes the base 2 logarithm of that probability and ends up with the equivalent of 1 bit. The simplest information is 1 bit, but the factors multiply from there.From the theory, Gleick takes us back to jungle drums and notes the way the patterns weave back and forth in informational bits. We travel through time and experience Aristotle’s association of the Greek logos (literally “word”) with the basic activity of thinking (p. 93) and verify Aristotle’s assumptions with the fieldwork described by Walter Ong with regard to the way illiterate peoples in Uzbekistan think compared to literate cultures (p. 95). Words, speech, or information provides a foundational structure for organizing human thought. Even mathematics, as demonstrated by early cuneiform tablets, depended on this semeiotic mode (p. 108). The Information constantly “informed” me of things I didn’t know. It never registered with me that the first “dictionary” in English dates back to an early 17th century table of words compiled by a village schoolmaster and priest named Robert Cawdrey (pp. 124-125) nor had I truly appreciated the rather obvious role that printing held in terms of standardizing spelling. I didn’t know that Abu Abdullah Mohammad Ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, an Arabic scholar in 9th century Baghdad created tables of trigonometric functions, copied by hand for centuries. More interesting to me was the fact that his name underscores the term algorithm which is so important to my work with computers. (p. 195)I love sharing with my History of Video Games students about Charles Babbage’s fascination with automata and Gleick describes it well: “Babbage went with his mother to John Merlin’s Mechanical Museum in Hanover Square, full of clockwork and music boxes and, most interesting simulacra of living things. A metal swan bent its neck to catch a metal fish, moved by hidden motors and cams. In the artist’s attic workshop Charles saw a pair of naked dancing women, gliding and bowing, crafted in silver at one-fifth life size. …Indeed, when he was a man in his forties he found Merlin’s silver dancer at an auction, bought it for 35 pounds, installed it on a pedestal in his home, and dressed its nude form in custom finery.” (pp. 210-211) From a philosophical perspective, I was fascinated to read Godel’s observations about consistent systems of logic, “There must be monsters of a kind hitherto unconceived: statements that can never be proved, and yet can never be disproved. There must be truths, that is, that cannot be proved—and Godel could prove it.” (p. 425) Godel showed that it was possible to construct a formula that said, “A certain number, x, is not provable.” And that this was exactly the kind of looping self-reference that Bertrand Russell was trying to avoid (p. 428). It was interesting to see the observation that “noise,” that ubiquitous problem in information theory as is “entropy” in physics and biology, was addressed early on by Norbert Weiner: “We are swimming upstream against a great torrent of disorganization, which tends to reduce everything to the heat death of equilibrium and sameness. This heat death in physics has a counterpart in the ethics of Kierkegaard, who pointed out that we live in a chaotic moral universe. …our main obligation is to establish arbitrary enclaves of order and system…” (pp. 553-554). Claude Shannon, father of information theory, definitely pointed toward this. As Gleick observes: “Not only do living things lessen the disorder in their environments; they are in themselves, their skeletons and their flesh, vesicles and membranes, shells and carapaces, leaves and blossoms, circulatory systems and metabolic pathways—miracles of pattern and structure. It sometimes seems as if curbing entropy is our quixotic purpose in this universe.” (p. 657)Another interesting discussion came from John von Neumann when he discussed “game theory.” He described it as “a mathematics of incomplete information.” (p. 569) That’s a fascinating perspective, whether one is gaming military, economic, medical, or theological scenarios. Speaking of mathematics and theology, did you know that “seven,” such an important symbolic number in the Bible, seems to be the highest number of items that most people can hold in working memory at any one time? That’s why telephone numbers used to be seven digits? (p. 605) One experiment put a random number of dots on a screen and asked subjects how many they could remember. If the pattern was seven or less, they usually got them. If the pattern was more than seven, they didn’t (p. 606). Just as information theory requires redundancy to reduce noise, it is interesting that biological systems require redundancy as well. Schrodinger “…considered it amazing—mysterious, but sure crucial in some way as yet unknown—that every single cell of an organism ‘should be in possession of a complete (double) copy of the code-script.’ He compared this to an army in which every soldier knows every detail of the general’s plans.” (p. 662) In that regard, consider the groundbreaking work of Watson and Crick. “DNA is formed of two long sequences of bases, like ciphers coded in a four-letter alphabet, each sequence complementary to the other, coiled together. Unzipped, each strand may serve as a template for replication.” (p. 680) Speaking of theological perspective, UC Berkeley scientist George Gamow stated that any living creature could be defined by “a long number written in a four-digital system.” He called this “the number of the beast” (from Revelation).” (p. 688)Building on this idea, I liked Dennett’s definition of a meme as “an information packet with attitude.” (p. 732) Frankly, if these quips from intensely fascinating discussions haven’t piqued your interest by now, The Information is not for you. I will close with a quotation from Gregory Chaitin: “In spite of incompleteness and uncomputability and even algorithmic randomness, mathematicians don’t want to give up absolute certainty. Why? Well, absolute certainty is like God.” (p. 796) In case you can’t tell, this book will be staying on my reader, indefinitely. My church congregation and my students will tire of hearing me quote from it. But it is one of those books that changes one’s entire perspective. Then again, that’s hardly surprising considering how much Gleick’s book on Chaos Theory changed my life. "
54,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9304511-sandeep-mertia,4,"Chronicling InformationHave ancient 'talking drums' of Africa played any role in the information-communication revolution of the 21st century? Did 'logic' came before 'writing' or vice-versa? Was 'alphabet' the first information technology? What is so revolutionary about the Oxford English Dictionary? How Charles Babbage's 'Wheel Work' and Ada Byron's mathematics helped them imagine the 'Analytical Machine', an idea much before it's time? Was telegraph system a nervous system for the Earth? How did Claude Shanon's 'Mathematical Theory of Communication' and Norbert Wiener's 'Cybernetics' led to something very profound called 'Information Theory'? What is the relation between Thermodynamics' Entropy, Randomness, Godel's Incompleteness Theorems, Turing's Incomputability, and Complexity? How are 'selfish genes' and 'memes' related? Is Wikipedia our 'Library of Babel'? From where and how did we get to 'Information Glut', 'Information Explosion' and 'Information Anxiety'? etc ... These diverse appearing questions are actually some of the dots which Gleick connects to compose the grand narrative of ""The Information""; 'the' definite article seems perfectly apt. Gleick's account of story of information and humanity's engagement with it throughout history is fascinating and delivers an decent understanding of what exactly is information and how it has become 'the vital principle' of the world. He takes the reader on a sweeping journey spanning human communication in ancient civilisations, beginning of writing and alphabets, emerging of science and logic, and works of seminal figures like James Murray, de Morgan, George Boole, Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Samuel Morse, etc and later of course to the likes of Hartley, Turing, Shanon, Wiener, von Nuemann, Richard Dawkins, Gregory Chaitin, A N Kolmogorov, John Wheeler, etc to build a foundation from where one can better understand to a large extent, not just the mathematics, coding, physics - electronics and communication of information but also the philosophical and historical perspectives which shaped up the information sciences and technologies. The book is not written in exact chronological order, i.e., each chapter explores ideas, concepts and philosophies in a manner which is both self-contained and develops links to the underlying story of information. So eventually the big picture has juxtaposition of many ideas which otherwise would have seemed unrelated. For example – Gleick gives a brilliant account, spread in 3-4 different chapters, of relations between the Second Law of Thermodynamics – Maxwell's Demon, randomness and algorithmic incomputability, which otherwise are not so intuitive to imagine (I'll leave the explanation part for the curious reader to explore). Being a science writer and journalist, Gleick does a good job in explaining many concepts and technologies like entropy, Turing machine, coding, random numbers, quantum theory, etc with proper analogies which even a person with little background in science can probably understand. The cardinal story within the story of information is undoubtedly of Claude Shannon, the father of Information Theory and Digital Computers. We, as students of technology, have heard his name in lectures and read his theorems in textbooks but the legacy of Shanon is much more than that. Gleick lucidly traces the trajectory of Shannon and presents his works in a light which the condensed language of textbooks cannot capture. Although Shannon left his mark over mathematics, cryptology, telephony and electronics in many ways – his single act of making the meaning of the message ""irrelevant to the engineering problem"" gave a whole new dimension to 'information' and it's impacts were felt in almost all other disciplines. Remarkably, he was quite aware of the revolution he was leading, at one of his public lectures he said, ""I think that this present century in a sense will see a great upsurge and development of this whole information business; the business of collecting information and the business of transmitting it from one point to another, and perhaps most important of all, the business of processing it.""Another important figure, during the exact same time as Shanon's was Norbert Wiener, founder of 'Cybernetics' who much to others disagreement often claimed that Shannon's work was influenced by his. Nonetheless, he and Shannon had an interesting engagement through Macy Conferences and otherwise, which led to further development of the Information Theory and other related disciplines.Although Gleick remarkably engages the reader in various tales of 'information'. But at some places I felt he ended up exaggerating the role of 'Information'. No doubt many fields like physics, psychology, economics, philosophy, etc benefitted from the Information Theory but he takes Wheeler's 'It from Bit' and Shanon's 'The Bandwagon' aphorisms a bit too far and at some places portrays the 'bit' in a larger than life sense without much theoretical backing or argument. For example - in the prologue he asserts, ""In the long run, history is the story of information becoming aware of itself"" – sounds profound, but doesn't hold much water, as information is an extension of the larger social world and not a distinct, encompassing entity. This chronicle lacks the detailed social contexts of 'information', especially for the post-Shanon era where the ideas of information age and flood/explosion/glut presented in the book appear to be slightly technologically determined, contrary to the theory of social construction of technology. Gleick manages to connect the dots in the story of information brilliantly on a time scale but the analysis remains incomplete without understanding the lateral links – the sociology of those dots and connections – may be this wasn't a part of the aim of the book at first place. Perhaps that part is better left for sociologists like Manuel Castells ('The Information Age' trilogy). The book has been received well by most critics. It was the Ney York Times Bestseller 2011, it received the 'Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books' 2012, and many other awards. Overall, the book is a must read for anyone interested in knowing more about 'information' - how did we get here and where are we heading to. Such is the impact of information on our lives that to me the following remark from the epilogue of the book seems more real than metaphysical!""We are all patrons of Library of Babel now, and we are the librarians, too.""Perhaps we also are Borges!"
55,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2265362-erik-olsen,3,"I found this sprawling book fascinating, frustrating, incomprehensible, lovely, informative, enlightening, ponderous, and ultimately satisfying. Certain chapters will make you feel like you’re newly understanding an entirely new world, if not universe. Others are so dense and incomprehensible it’s as if the words are in another language. All said, the whole concept of information/Information theory seems to be an almost required subject to grasp in the day and age we live in. I enjoyed this book, but it was not easy to get through."

58,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3209040-courtney-johnston,3,"Put aside, rather than abandoned; I hope to pick Gleick's masterly,but slow-paced, tome up later in the year, but right now my brain isscurrying about at a pace ill-suited to this book.You could read into the sentence above that I am one of the victimsof the information age - so distracted by the deluge of digitalinformation available to me that I can't concentrate on the type-setpage before me. However, I don't believe in information overload; oneof the reasons I want to return to 'The Information' is to find outwhat Gleick has to say on this topic.Gleick's argument in this book is that information technologies havechanged human consciousness - that the ability to lay down, store,retrieve and share information has changed the way we think,communicate, understand the world and out place in it:The punched card, the cash register, thenineteenth-century Difference Engine, the wires of telegraphy allplayed their parts in weaving the spiderweb of information to which wecling. Each new information technology, in its own time, set offblooms in storage and transmission. From the printing press came newspecies of of information organizers: dictionaries, cyclopaedias,almanacs - compendiums of words, classifiers of facts, trees ofknowledge. Hardly any information technology goes obsolete. Each newone throws its predecessors into relief. Thus Thomas Hobbes, in theseventeenth century, resisted his era's new-media hype: ""The inventionof printing, though ingenious, compared with the invention of lettersis no great matter."" Up to a point, he was right. Every new mediumtransforms the nature of human thought. In the long run, history isthe story of information becoming aware of itself.Gleick opens with the history of the African talking drum, a wonderfulGladwellian set piece that both reveals the ingenuity of humaninvention (African tribes who translated speech tones into drum beatsfor long-ditance communication) and the tenuousness of such inventions(in some communities the drumming has rapidly given way, and the nextcommunication technology to be widely adapted was not the letter, orthe telegraph, but the mobile phone).In the following chapter he requires of the reader 'a leap ofimagination backwards into a forgotten past' to 'try to imagine', asphilosopher Walter J. Ong wrote, '""a culture where no one has ever'looked up' anything."" In an oral culture, Ong continues, words 'haveno focus and no trace'. Every thought and every piece of speechvanishes as soon as it is completed. Gleick writes:Writing comes into being to retain information across timeand across space. Before writing, communication is evanescent andlocal; sounds carry a few yards and fade to oblivion. So fleeting wasspeech that the rare phenomenon of the echo, a sound heard once andthen again, seemed a sort of magic.My favourite part of the 120 pages of the book that I did get throughwas about early dictionaries. The story of the OED is fairly wellknown, but Gleick goes back before that Robert Cawdrey's 'A TableAlphabeticall, conteyning and teaching the true writing, andunderstanding of hard usuall English wordes ... gathered for thebenfit & helpe of Ladies, Gentlewomen, or other unskilfull persons',published in 1604. Although this dictionary was laid out, as itsrambling title indicates, in alphabetical order, Cawdrey could notcount on even educated readers to know the alphabet, and so he had towrite instructions:thou must learne the Alphabet, to wit, the order of theLetters as they stand, perfectly without booke, and where every Letterstandeth: as b near the beginning, n about the middest,and t towards the end. Nowe if the word, which thou artdesirous to find, begin with an a then looke in the beginningof this Table, but if with v look towards the end. Againe, ifthy word beginne with ca looke in the beginning of the letterc but if with cu then looke toward the end of thatletter. And so of all the rest.Our ability to organise thought and make things that convey thatthought (or observe things, and construct experiments that repeat thatobservation, if you look to science) often seems precedes our abilityto articulate these things. At the point that I gave up 'TheInformation', Charles Babbage is manfully trying to articulate hisDifference Engine - how it works, what it does, what it coulddo. I have to confess that the long section devoted to Babbage and AdaLovelace has contributed to my decision to put 'The Information' torest for a few months (I find Lovelace incredibly tiresome) but I lookforward to returning when I can do Gleick's book the justice of givingit the attention it deserves."
59,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,5,"Excellent recommendation by my friend and former Inktomi colleague, Bill. It was a strange coincidence. For some reason I was recently thinking about the Nyquist/Shannon sampling theorem (a signal with a highest frequency of f can be completely recovered by sampling it at a frequency of 2f) and wondering how the heck you would prove something like that. This put me in the mood for a book on information theory, and that same week I got a random Facebook message from Bill saying that I should check out The Information.[[[Aside: Regarding the Nyquist/Shannon theorem, I always got hung up on the boundary case of a sine wave at frequency f sampled exactly when it was at zero. Then there would be no signal in the sample, right? According to Wikipedia, this particular signal is excluded from the statement of the theorem. I wish someone had told me this earlier.]]]Anyway, this is a big messy book about information that I recommend to anyone with even the slightest interest in information, particularly the transformation of information.A lot of the revolutionary discoveries about information are surprisingly intuitive, almost innate. For example, the fact that the English language is about 50% redundant should be obvious to anyone who sends a text like ""u there?"" or ""brb.""As another example, my daughter and her best friend across the street have an elaborate system of signals they worked out using colored post-it notes and their front doors. At the ages of 9 and 10 they already understand the idea of encoding information, sending it through a channel, noise (post-it notes falling off the door), error correction, and decoding signals.They figured this out on their own. They might be happy to learn that Shannon proved that it's possible to transmit any signal through any channel without error given enough time and the proper encoding, but by the time I could explain this to them they probably will have moved on to email.The book starts with Claude Shannon, my hero, and the invention (discovery?) of the bit, which happened right around the same time as the invention of the transistor. Then it jumps back in time a few centuries to talk about African drumming, which up until very recently in history was the most reliable long distance communication possible. Then it goes through the history of the difference engine, the telegraph, and early telephone networks that used barbed wire fences. The book is not even 1/2 done at this point.If this sounds exciting to you, then you are my kind of person and you should run out and get this book. If it doesn't, then that's cool too but this book will probably frustrate you.All the guys (and one gal) who are the heroes of information theory are here: Claude Shannon, Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Norbert Weiner, Godel, Crick/Watson, James Clerk Maxwell, his demon, Turing, Morse, Hawking, his hairless black holes, Bertrand Russell, Dawkins, his selfish genes, and his memes.It's like one of those tribute rock concerts where they get a bunch of old rock stars on one stage to play Little Sister or Rave On. It's exciting to recognize the faces, plus you get the extra bonus of nodding knowingly and approvingly when the camera lands on Jeff Beck (or John Von Neumann in this case).Even though I studied a lot of this in college and have been interested in it ever since, there was a lot of material that was either new to me or presented in a fresh way. I particularly liked the different ways the connections between entropy, information, probability, and even Brownian motion were sketched out. The section about how no work is done (in a physics sense) until information is *erased* will give my brain something to chew on for a long time. That sort of freaked me out.The book started to get a little wobbly and never really recovered once memes were introduced. The growth of the Internet, Wikipedia, search engines, etc. has been covered a zillion times and is still in progress, meaning that we will never get a historical perspective on these things now. The idea that there is a lot of information in our lives is rather obvious and could have been stated more succinctly.It would have been much more interesting to end with thoughts about what is happening now that we don't generally know about. What limits in information theory (or quantum theory) are we bumping up against now? And considering that a lot of information theory was worked out during World Wars I and II, what are the current military applications for information theory? What about USCYBERCOM?But these are minor complaints. This book covers so much so well and it provides so many interesting jumping off points that it will be influencing my reading list and thinking for years."
60,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"When you buy a book with a title like ""The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood"", you expect a sprawling account of a difficult subject. This is not an easy task: even defining the word ""information"" takes many pages. I enjoyed Gleick's prior book ""Chaos: The Making of a New Science"", which attempts a similar explanation of chaos theory. But this volume didn't measure up to his past work. It was sprawling, all right, but in the negative sense: lacking cohesion and critical detail in important spots. It could have been subtitled ""a History, a Theory, a Flood, a Mush"". Gleick is at his best when he's doing science history. He has a couple of good chapters of the pre-history of information, with a particularly interesting discussion of whether logic itself was possible (as we understand it today) before the invention of writing, and another on the ""talking drums"" of Africa. Other books, like Jared Diamond's ""The Third Chimpanzee"" and ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" deal with the evolution of speech and writing in more detail, but they omit later developments in information science. Gleick does a nice job of thumbnailing the important people in the field, especially Babbage and Ada Lovelace in the 19th century, and Turing and Shannon in the 20th. Some of these discussions feel a bit rushed, but that's to be expected- especially when dealing with characters like Godel (if you want a nice bio of him to fill in the holes, I liked Rebecca Goldstein's ""Incompleteness""). As Gleick moves into the other two topics, information theory and information overload, the book gets increasingly hard to read. In the ""theory"" section, there are no diagrams, few equations, and very little in the way of practical examples to let you get your head around this difficult topic. Take this discussion, of Maxwell's Demon: ""Szilard- who did not yet use the word information- found that, if he accounted exactly for each measurement and memory, then the conversion could be computed exactly. So he computed it. He calculated that each unit of information brings a corresponding increase in entropy- specifically, by k log 2 units. Every time the demon makes a choice between one particle and another, it costs one bit of information. The payback comes at the end of the cycle, when it has to clear its memory (Szliard did not specify this last detail in words, but in mathematics). Accounting for this properly is the only way to eliminate the paradox of perpetual motion, to bring the universe back into harmony, to ""restore concordance with the Second Law."" How does this ""payback"" work? Why does the ""payback"" come at the end of cycle? How does it relate to physical ideas like entropy? Gleick just drops the topic. There are similar issues with his discussions of the information content of a message, Godel's theory, genetics, cryptography, information and consciousness, etc. (A helpful bibliography at the end of the book points to authors that do a better job- Simon Singh's ""The Code Book"", is particularly readable, and so are most of the books by Daniel Dennett, Douglas Hofstadter, and Richard Dawkins.)That's not to say that Gleick isn't capable of stretches of good writing, even in these chapters. He often makes nice analogies between disparate fields like biology and music: ""Where then, is any particular gene- say, the gene for long legs in humans? This is a little like asking where is Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E minor. Is it in the original handwritten score? The printed sheet music? Any one performance- or perhaps the sum of all performances, historical, and potential, real and imagined?"" and finds wonderful quotes, like Babbage talking about the air being ""one vast library"" of everything that has ever been spoken: ""vows unredeemed, promises unfulfilled, perpetuating in the united movements of each particle, the testimony of man's changeful will."" The last third of the book is a fairly cursory inspection of Wikipedia and the internet, with an eye towards discussing the effects of information overload on the human brain. Gleick doesn't do much right here- he deals with many of the same ideas in Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything"" in more depth. Reading his chapters here, I had the strange feeling that Gleick was unintentionally illustrating his main idea- that trying to stuff too much information down too narrow a channel can be overwhelming and unpleasant for the human being involved. So, overall, this book is a miss for anyone with a passing acquaintance with these subjects. For a reader who is new to all of it, it might be worth a read, but it's not going to be an easy one. "
61,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2964817-marc-kozak,3,"1,500 years ago, everybody knew that the Earth was the center of the universe. 500 years ago, everybody knew that the Earth was flat. And 15 minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet. Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.That's right, a Men In Black quote. It kept running through my mind during the first 200 pages of this book, as Gleick traced the origins of language and information from the creation of written symbols to the Library-of-Babel-in-progress that is Wikipedia. In relation to the overall age of mankind, written language is a new development; its worldwide proliferation even more so. It's easily taken for granted. In the first several pages, Gleick claims that the invention of language is the origin of inner consciousness, which is a reasonable and fascinating thought. How did early man process thought without language? Once we had it, our reasoning and internal processing increased exponentially, and still is. I heard someone on the train joking that they should quit their job and become a philosopher, because all you had to do was sit around and say really obvious things. What they fail to realize is that, for Plato and Aristotle, those things weren't so obvious, and without them thinking what they thought, we wouldn't have developed language and thought to the point it's at now. For all the time it takes to take each painstaking step in processing thought, language and reason, it becomes integrated and ""obvious"" almost immediately by comparison. It's amazing to see how far we've come in such a short amount of time, and daydream about the inconceivable advances yet to happen.The most fascinating part of the book deals with the origins of computation and long distance communication. How frustrating it must have been to be Charles Babbage, who could envision the abstract concepts of a computer, but was 100 years too early in technology to actually make it happen. It almost made me sad to think that everything he tried to accomplish can now be done by a crappy one dollar calculator. How alone he must have felt, trying to explain his difference engine to a nation of people who weren't even close to being on the same page. How sad it seems now to consider Turing and Morse, who would be so astounded by what we have today, as we complain about lack of television service being provided from somewhere in outer space.It's a joy to read about the lives and imaginations of these great thinkers. Unfortunately, after the groundwork is laid, Gleick gets into thermodynamics and quantum physics, and things start to get a little hazy, because I am dumb.It was interesting to consider that within the seemingly perfect system of mathematics exists several paradoxes, suggesting that no closed system can ever be complete - there will always exist things that cannot be proved. I've always been drawn to paradoxes - it's strange to think that hidden within the fringes of our language exists these errors and unknowables, and how it all stems from these written symbols we use to express thought.Gleick continually talks about the abstract thought of an idea being the most important thing, and how we would be wise to go back to that process. He thinks all of these great leaps in technology and thought were due to an abstract idea that laid a framework, and then...what, voodoo magic happens? His constant value of the abstract seems to belittle contributions by those who actually flesh out the abstract. Not to mention that to me, abstract quantum theory is still fucking impossible. I get what he's going for, but as they say, the devil is in the details.This book offers a lot of things to think about, and provides a nicely-written history of how we process information. Due to the vast applications and relevant fields, nothing is covered in enough depth to be considered more than on an abstract level, which of course, is the point. However, as a reading experience, you'll find yourself drawn to some sections and inventors more than others, leading to a long and sloggy ride through the considerable amount of pages. I'm glad I read it because now I will seek out more about fascinating people like Godel, Turing, and Feynman, so as an intro to information sciences, you could do a lot worse. I see a lot of people not making it all the way through, which is appropriate, as Gleick closes the book with a bit about the internet and tsunami of available information today, and how more isn't always better.

62,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24430849-yuganka-sharan,5,"Profoundity, profundityMy previous three reviews have been thousand word monsters. Remarkably, a thousand words seem too less to capture what Gleick manages to achieve in the book The Information, even though all I am writing is a review. So I’ll have to find a shorter way. Gleick begins the arduous task by trying to explain what “information” actually is. This is a difficult task in itself - for most of human history, the focus has merely been on the ways of recording information and not on the nature of information itself, whether one takes old papyrus scrolls, animal hides, cuneiform tablets, or, later on, the printing press. He begins by examining language and how it represents information – how a finite set of symbols can in various combinations seemingly represent an infinite number of messages. From there, he charts the growth of the telegraph, developed for sending such messages over long distances. He mentions how its advent made man feel he had conquered space and time, and draws a parallel with the modern world – managing to capture the human reaction and response whenever any new paradigms in information handling, and consequently communication, have emerged.He covers Babbage and Ada Lovelace, with the former’s conception of the Analytic Engine that could solve all sorts of problems based on “mechanical programming”. He discusses Watson and Crick’s discovery of the DNA’s structure - what genetic information is and how can an organism develop merely on the basis of the combinations of the 4 nucleobases. He discusses Turing and the history of cryptography – which began with the statistical analysis of various combinations of letters of various lengths (in a given language), followed by an algorithmic approach to find similar patterns in the encoded messages. And finally he moves on to Claude Shannon, undoubtedly the protagonist of the book (just to clear it, the book isn’t biographical in nature). Shannon, the father of Information Theory, heralded a new way of looking at information – divorce it of its meaning. For transmitting purposes, said he, “meaning” was dispensable. In effect, all of them were trying to understand what “information” is; what forms it can take; how it can be processed, understood, analysed, and what sorts of operations are possible on it. Dictionaries, code books for telegraphic codes, logarithm tables, programs, algorithms, DNA, internet – all of them, he says, are nothing but attempts at capturing the essence and manipulating the properties of “information”.Towards the end he talks about the information explosion that has taken place over the last few decades. This has not only led to a (parallel) rapid advancement in technologies to handle, process, make sense of and apply that information (we live in the IT age, remember?), but it has also affected the way humans perceive information. It has clear psychological effects, which we are not in a position to understand presently.“Information is not knowledge, and knowledge is not wisdom”.Even if you thought you knew what ‘information’ actually is, which an overwhelming majority of us anyway don’t, it will still make you look at the idea from a new perspective. The kind of analogies, parallels and connections we are shown are too profound for a reading of one sitting. I recommend not finishing this book in a few days. Let its ideas seep into you, let the enormity of the messages conveyed make a gradual impression on your mind, and let it make you ask new questions – not just on new topics, but in new realms.This is the second book I have read on this topic in the last 6-7 months. The other one was Information – a Very Short Introduction by Luciano Floridi. Undoubtedly that was a more erudite effort at conveying the same concepts, but due to the sheer size of the book – a book of the ‘A Very Short Introduction’ series (by Oxford University Press) rarely crosses 150 pages in page size octavo – the scope of the two works can’t be compared. Floridi tackles more of the theoretical and philosophical aspects related to information, whereas Gleick is tackling more of the historical and practical (read technological) narrative. Pardon if my review has meandered too much. It is mostly a result of having too many thoughts and ideas from the book at the same time - and that is precisely what you’ll take back from this book. "
63,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"Not surprisingly, the subject of James Gleick’s The Information is the field of knowledge known as “Information Theory.” The theory’s origin can be traced to a seminal article written in 1948 by Claude Shannon, an engineer employed at that time by Bell Laboratories. The article, entitled ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication,"" appeared in two parts in the Bell System Technical Journal. Shannon focused on how to optimize the amount of information a sender wants to transmit. His theory is important because, inter alia, its use and practice greatly improves the speed and amount of content that can be transmitted or communicated electronically. As Gleick points out:""Satellite television channels, pocket music players, efficient camera and telephones and countless other modern appurtenances depend on coding algorithms to compress numbers—sequences of bits—and those algorithms trace their lineage to Shannon’s original 1948 paper.”But getting a feel for how the theory works or why it is so important isn’t easy, so Gleick takes the reader on a 180-page historical tour of various earlier forms of communication between remote sites. For example, Europeans were amazed to find that tribes of sub-Saharan Africa were able to send remarkably detailed messages to one another by means of drums. The fact that their languages were tonal (like Mandarin, but unlike any European language) facilitated their “translation” into drum sounds. In another example of comparatively long-range communication, European war fleets were able to transmit messages by way of visual flag signals, but the range of possible messages was limited to a few pre-arranged commands. By the late 18th century, the French were able to send messages long distances by way of “telegraphs.” The first devices known as telegraphs were series of signaling devices like semaphores spaced within sight of one another. Signals could be sent from one device to the next, but complicated messages were difficult to transmit because there was no known efficient method to encode the message succinctly. The invention of the electrical telegraph provided the opportunity to send signals much faster than the visual “telegraphs.” However, it was not until an efficient code like the one developed by Samuel Morse was generally put in use that the transmission of complex or just long messages became practical. Just why Morse Code was efficient is related to a well-defined concept conventionally called the “entropy of a message” or the “Shannon entropy.” It encourages the removal of as much extraneous data as possible from a message to shorten it but without a loss of meaning. Most of you will be aware of this process even without knowing the history and theory behind it. The meaning of “I lv u” is clear, and takes less space than “I love you.” Conventions such as “twitter-speak” allow for even more economy: when someone only says “OMG” you know what that person is communicating, and six spaces have been saved.The initial thrust of Shannon’s theorizing was to condense the quantity of data to be transmitted over telephone lines, greatly enhancing the capacity of the lines to transmit ideas (content) without increasing the amount of physical assets needed to transmit. But the concept of quantifying the extraction of information from raw data soon flowed from telephone engineering into other fields such as psychology, genetics, and quantum physics. Gleick also discusses the tension between the concepts of information and meaning. Although Shannon famously said that meaning is “irrelevant to the engineering problem,” meaning remains the thing humans most want to convey or transmit in communication. The problem remains a sticky philosophical one, and Gleick does a nice job of analyzing it, although he does not solve it.Gleick is a master of elucidating daunting scientific concepts. Just like his earlier book, Chaos, The Information brings to light an intellectually challenging set of ideas and makes them understandable to the layman."
64,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,5,"I have not been this impressed with a general math/ science book since reading Douglas Hofstadter's 
Godel, Escher, Bach
/. Gleick's 
The Information
 introduces the reader in a pretty straight-forward way to the history of information. You learn about a lot of the key concepts -- coding, cryptography, the relationship between information & probability & entropy. And that Gleick manages to do this without reverting to the tough and often difficult math of information theory is remarkable. Since most people tend to freak out at when they see equations like this, the key equation of Information theory:What makes the equation interesting is that it is the same equation that describes the level of entropy, or disorder, in classical Thermodynamics. Which makes it appear that information is essentially a force for ordering -- and is thus disentropic in physical systems.And Gleick gleefully follows these ideas into some interesting fields. Of course, Information Theory stands behind computers. But it also explains the power of Gutenburg's printing press and literacy, a technology that allowed for completely reliable, accurate and interchangeable transcriptions of texts. And how this increased ability to capture and interpret information led to necessary standardization of core vocabulary (so we could understand each other better). And yet, instead of making us more regiments, those ""redundancies"" in language and vocabulary were, in a sense, necessary to creating truly noteworthy contributions to the world of information. Because, following the laws of Information Theory, the most valuable message follows the rules just enough to be understood. But random enough to grant us surprise. Like, say, the regualr, almost mechanical fugues of Bach. That, for all their repetitions and formulaic adherence, still manage to delight listeners. Even today.Gleick then expands his reach from the human world. And shows how scientist are applying the Theory to observed phenomena. He introduces us to Quantum Information Theory (""it from bit""). And how Information Theory has she light in evolution (through Dawkins) and how cells interpret the genetic code.But Gleick finishes up on a cliff-hanger of sorts. Because, the theory addresses only information. And treats false information the same as true. And how our modern communications channels amplify these errors -- consider that about of Americans think that Barack Obama is a Muslim, despite the evidence. And points to the next level that needs to be approached: ""Semantics."" But that, no doubt, is another book. Overall, a great book. Better than Gleick's other foray into theory, 
Chaos
, 
The Information
 is a super enjoyable, easy to read book. That updated a lot of my internal paradigms about the current state of mathematical descriptions of the world that scientists apply. And made me think about communications channels -- Sender & Message & Encoding & Decoding & Receivers -- in a way that was refreshingly new. Recommended for all science fans. And also anyone interested in communications -- writers, poets, artists, Web designers, etc. "
65,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3761228-adman,3,"At long last, time and motivation have joined forces to give me the opportunity to read this book. I found it captivating and stimulating, and a surprisingly fast read. At the same time, I struggle to record and transmit my thoughts about The Information. At the risk of being cute, in the last hundred pages of Gleick's treatise, I feel like I lost the signal. My sense of his thoughts, and my own, lost their coherence and now I am picking through a jumble of characters, looking for a singular message.For two-thirds of this book's length, Gleick assembles a toolset and with those tools, lays down a road, raises signs to point the way, and reinforces the pavement where necessary. I think - or I thought - that I understand what this road was for and where it was leading. The book seemed, at first, to be a survey of the history of communication technology (drumbeats, alphabets, dictionaries and encyclopediae, telegraphs, telephones, video, etc), as well as of the chicken-or-egg discovery (or unconscious creation?) of information-based foundations for many hard scientific subjects.I began to feel myself drifting in the chapter about DNA. At least, I started to wonder if I was on the road I thought the book was on, or if there was a road at all. On their own, ideas like Dawkins' selfish gene are fascinating, but I struggled to place these evolutionary biological concepts into the context of the book. How did these ideas arise from a conversation about entropy or computing technology, much less the telegraph?As I read on, the book felt less like a progressive assembly of ideas and discoveries and more like a rapid-fire survey of different people's applications of informational concepts. The sequencing of chapters following DNA baffled me: jumping from hard sciences to internet memes? Then backtracking into probability? Then quantum computing (okay, makes sense after probability), then wikis, encryption, and internet domain ownership wars? Some of these subjects seem to barely relate to information as a theory or science. It is as if a physics textbook suddenly began to talk about body movement in the volleyball video game Dead or Alive. The Epilogue feels like Gleick wanted to keep going for another 50 pages but was cut short by an editor.Some of my issues arise from the apparent significance of the different ideas as a function of chapter length as well as order. Compare the 40-50 pages devoted to Charles Babbage or telegraphs to the 20 pages given to DNA.I was also distracted by Gleick's increasing editorializing and pop-culture interruptions toward the end of the book. He seemed to grow impatient with his role as researcher and reporter. There are some theological pronouncements that feel way outside of the scope of this book. His art and media references might have made for nice connective tissue in a different sort of text, but I never expected this academic work to be culturally hip.Perhaps such impurities cannot be avoided in a multi-disciplinary work. On balance, I loved this book and felt inspired by its energy and spirit of discovery. I feel like some of the eagerness of these scientists and inventors has been communicated to me thanks to The Information."
66,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792472-brent-woo,5,"Pretty insane. This is the book to read if you want to know something about Gödel's Incompleteness Theorum, Bertrand Russell's paradoxes, Turing, Gamow/Watson/Crick (the DNA guys), Maxwell's demon, Ada Lovelace, Dawkin's Selfish gene, ""quantum computing"", and Claude Shannon, who I've never heard of but apparently is responsible for all of this incredibly important research. There's just so much in here, it feels like a very exciting first read, but I probably retained at most 0.1% of what was introduced — I know I'll need to read and reference it again and again. It's a lot like anything by Michio Kaku or Brian Greene that explain the very basics of incredibly complex ideas via cute metaphors and a relatable tone, where you walk away feeling like you could give a lecture on superstring theory and quantum mechanics to Hawking himself. I was of course interested in the parts about languages and linguistics, and he had a lot of material devoted to that. The opening chapter about drum languages, for example, introduces us to the idea of what a ""bit"" is and information lossiness (compression). Sign languages are actual manual wizardry, where you're transmitting information over the air -- no cables or wifi required!A lot goes into cryptography, and there's a lot of material about the Enigma/WWII/Turing/Bletchley Park intrigue. How it worked, just how much research and theory went into making and breaking crypto codes. Eh, going in, I didn't think I'd be interested in any of that stuff, but it quickly gets very exciting and high-stakes. It reminded me of a crime/mystery I read a while back, The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage, which is a lot of fun. CSI with really old computers. And I definitely now have Cryptonomicon on high to-read priority.The last big topic is about DNA and how life reduces to information too. Very provocative, since it talks about Dawkin's ""Selfish gene"" ideas.One thing I missed is music compression -- how mp3's and such are compressed from the original -- and how those schemes developed, and how it relates to info theory. (He briefly mentions Bach, but only in the context of 'regularity' in music patterns) I don't remember if he talked about that; if he did I'll have to review. I think he talks about picture compression (eg JPG).Also, I learned that Gödel and Turing both died sad and shocking deaths! (view spoiler)[Gödel slowly went insane and starved himself to death. Turing was convicted of ""homosexual crimes"" and had to take chemical gay conversion torture (therapy/treatment is too sick a euphemism), and, almost certainly because of that, took cyanide. The conviction was in 1952 in the UK. (hide spoiler)]Oh, also, he quotes Borges a lot, and structures a lot of the narrative around Borges' stories, which is great. "
67,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532590-zach,4,"This book is best looked at in terms of hard and soft facts. It's most rewarding when it presents hard facts, the stuff of the sciences, theories and speculations explained by Gleick in exceptional, clear English. The book was less rewarding in the soft sections, the history and the humanity. Some of this is of course necessary to move the narrative forward. For example, Gleick does an effective job championing Claude Shannon as the most important voice in the history of information theory. But more often, the asides into the historical facts surrounding the people making the discoveries that are the meat of The Information simply detracts from the hard material. I include this criticism mainly as a means to point out that the hard material is excellent. Before reading, I lacked even a layman's understanding of information theory. During reading, I flagged page after page, concept after concept, and upon completion, while I may not be contributing any equations to the mathematics of information theory, I at least know what the big deal is all about.I'd recommend this for anyone who likes thinking about the theoretical implications of science without having to deal with the math. Once a terrible student of math myself, this book led me to an interesting realization: I do find math fascinating, I just always knew I'd never work to reach the level of mathematical understanding necessary to get to the interesting parts; high school trig formulas didn't offer any reward. This book shows even the mathematically disinclined where that reward exists.One last criticism in what I hope is an otherwise positive review: the book ends too softly. The last chapter and the epilogue abandon almost completely the hardness of earlier chapters, partly due to the required, I suppose, section on the modern internet, which seems too familiar to be challenging (and the truly challenging ideas about it have yet to be realized), but mainly because it tries to bring things to a human level, when I think a better strategy (and one Gleick uses well throughout) is to bring the human up to the level of the ideas. I didn't want to be brought home in the end. I wanted to be sent back out into the universe the previous 400 pages had shown me."
68,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5859626-andr-spiegel,4,"I'm a computer scientist and should know all of this, but this book made me gasp with fascinating discoveries. The code by which the African Talking Drums worked — never had an idea. The network of visual telegraphs that spanned France in the late eighteenth century — and Napoleon's first tweet, sent along that network in 1799.I knew that Ada Lovelace was the first programmer, but never before did I read about the passion with which she wrote a recursive algorithm for a non-existing machine.Alas, it doesn't stay that way. From about chapter 7 onwards, the narrative turns rather dull, as the author tries to show how information theory itself was formed. These theoretical underpinnings may be a dry subject for sure, but we are not diving deep into the theory as such anyway. Instead, we see a boring succession of biographies and recollections of conferences. Given the furiousness with which the book started out, this sudden lack of engagement seems odd. The worst boredom lasts until about chapter 9, after which the book picks up again to a certain extext, as we are introduced to genes, memes, and Wikipedia. But it never quite reaches the excitement of the early chapters again.The ebb and flow of excitement might be excusable if it were somehow warranted by the subject matter. There could be some inherent structure in the presentation which demands these subjects to be covered, even if they are boring. But there isn't. Other than a mildly chronological ordering, the book is not systematic, but anecdotal. These anecdotes can be outright stunning, and it is those which will remain in my memory forever, but there are vast stretches where the book really doesn't live up to the tone it set in the beginning.Incidentally, one is somewhat flabbergasted when reaching the last page at an e-Reader location of 58%. The rest is notes, bibliography, and an index which takes up 20% of the book but is completely unnecessary in the electronic edition.I would give five stars to the first six chapters, two stars for chapters 7 to 9, and three to four stars for the rest. Altogether, just because what I gleaned from the first few chapters was so exceptional, I give four stars nonetheless."
69,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/685633-beth,4,"I am sort of torn about how to review this book. I feel like if it was titled, ""A Mathematical Theory of Information and Computing: The theory, the history, the flood"" I would give it 5 stars and raving reviews. The first half of the book, jumping from the coining of ""the bit"" and Claude Shannon, to African tribes, to Morris Code, to Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage's thinking machine) left me excited and wanting every MLIS student to be required to read it. The second half left me annoyed that he swept over Library and Information Science, seemed to equate all human knowledge to Wikipedia, and boldly declared all information to live in ""the cloud"" where anyone can access it. As wonderful as it would be to make this declaration true, there is this huge thing called ""the digital divide"" (making people unable to access things online due to financial, geographical, disabilities, lack computer and searching skills, and more.) There are also these things called archives and libraries that have no money to convert their rich and vast amounts of information into a digital format, thus they remained unavailable via the Internet. This excitement over all of human knowledge being available on the web also doesn't mention that the vast majority of research texts are blocked behind pay-walls, that governments are passing laws policies that close down the openness of the Internet, or that many countries censor what is available to their citizens online, and also that companies restrict their systems so that data can't be collected across them to create a larger picture and more connections between the information being amassed. Sigh. I would love to pick Gleick's brain about how he actually feels about these issues and his choice to sweep over them and broadly make such declarations. Did he consider these issues when writing his conclusions, or it didn't even register on his radar? He didn't have to go into detail about these issues, for this would at least double the size of the book, but he could have mentioned that there are still issues with access to information that haven't been solved (yet) by information theory, computing capabilities, etc. . . ."
70,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1944947-barnaby-thieme,4,"I'm sort of hovering between three and four stars here. The topic of information and information theory is certainly fascinating and deserves to be covered in many books. Gleick is a wonderful storyteller who brings together different threads of the story in a competent and compelling narrative, weaving his way forward from discipline to discipline to keep the story engaging. Dealing with the concept of information and its role in human culture and science, he addresses the expected subjects including Babbage, Lovelace, Turing, Gödel, Russell and Whitehead, Dawkins, and, of course, Claude Shannon. I think it's likely that many readers will know parts of the story quite well - I myself knew a lot about some of these folks and a little about all of them before taking this guided tour. Having said that, I would have preferred to see Gleick go deeper into several of the scientific aspects of information theory - I was especially disappointed by the breathless, compressed overview of its relevance to quantum mechanics. He barely got the name ""John Wheeler"" on the page before racing on to a schematic portrait of quantum computing that will be perfunctory for people who already know a bit about it and baffling to those who don't. I would have traded all of Gleick's philosophical digressions on the meaning of it all for more time spent on subjects such as those - particularly because when our author digresses into meta-level reflection, his writing flattens out and becomes alarmingly shallow. I'll just say that Marshall McLuhan is the refuge of many science writers who don't know anything about what's been going on in philosophy in the last hundred years. There are literally dozens of points of reference Gleick could have referenced that would have led to much deeper reflection on the topic - Wittgenstein, Gadamer, Derrida, Barthes, or Levi-Strauss to name a handful."

To hedge against a lack of sun hours to charge my reading device with I brought some physical books that had been lingering on my moribund to-read pile.I wasn't sure if ‘The Information’ would be worth reading as a graduate in computer science but it turns out that it is as fantastic a book as everybody said it was.Shortly summarised ‘The Information’ is a summary of a large part of my studies: the formal logic and computability parts, the signal processing and information theory parts and a bunch more. As such it functions as an easier to digest mashup of ‘Gödel, Escher, Bach’ and ‘The Baroque Cycle’ if I may call it that.The book treats many of the same topics as those books and paints a stunning picture of the history of science. It shows you in the writings of those scientists how our understanding of information evolved with time and how that evolution informs our current perspective.The book focuses on Shannon, where GEB for instance is more about Kurt Gödel and Cryptonomicon (the prelude to the Baroque Cycle) is more about Alan Turing. What is interesting to note is how Shannon's work contributed an informational turn to the social sciences.Information historical accounts are super interesting—also something that I enjoyed immensely during the Latour MOOC—but a weakness of the book is that the insights offered therein break down the closer we get to the present day. Current events move too quickly to be framed with the same flourishes as the writings of Charles Babbage and Ada Byron Lovelace."
72,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1368664-loafingcactus,4,"Seen in light of Ellul's concerns about ""la technique"" (the process and technology of progress, this is not a good definition but it will do- see The Technological Society), this book could be about some kind of horror: how our very words have changed our brains and turned us into the generators of this strange thing: the information. The book gives concrete examples, many. This history is fascinating and meaningful; in the information age the descriptive history alone makes this a book everyone should read.Perhaps the only possible answer to Ellul is also contained in this book: Schrodinger made the argument that life is a kind of anti-entropy machine (the word ""entropy"" being invented to explain something about information primarily), many make the argument that the universe is information, and thus it is possible that humans' intensive efforts to create information is fundamental to what we are. Possible. But this would require ignoring the life force that Schrodinger mocked and the spiritual force that Ellul sought.The book concludes with the possibilities of horror and redemption, and makes a fairly weak case for redemption. The better case for redemption is contained in the actual text as the history of information is told. Chopping off the final chapter and epilogue indeed would have made it a better (others have commented on the weakness of this part of the book), but incomplete, book."
73,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Science writing done right. A terrifically ambitious compendium of several stories all related to the theme of information, but not quite related to each other. Thus: the development of long-distance communication, starting from the talking drums of Africa, moving on through the first dictionaries and the attempt to catalogue the entire English language, on to the telegraph and telephone, and the switch from analog to digital, up to our present day iPhones. But also: the development of information theory, starting with some boffins working at Bell Labs, until its appropriation by the social sciences and of course the humanities, ever eager to catch up with trends and become relevant again. There is some knotty discussion of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, but lack of total comprehension won't hamper enjoyment of the book as a whole. Gleick is a terrific writer, more knowledgable than Bill Bryson (I still swear fealty to his  A Short History of Nearly Everything) and much, much saner than Douglas Hofstadter. The final chapters cover the search for true randomness and, finally, the consequences of information overload and the potential hivemind, er, sorry, crowd-wisdom of the Internet age. If you're daunted by the book as a whole, that epilogue alone is worth it. But this is a rich, ingenuous book, which opens up the seemingly impenetrable gates of the information age we live in. "
74,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2967325-jim-mcdonnell,2,"I've enjoyed other books by Gleick (his bio of Feynman, and account of the development of Chaos theory), and this one sounded interesting; as I understood it, a re-framing of the world and universe we live in as an essentially information-based artefact. I thought this might have some interesting insights into scientific theories about the deeper possible structure of spacetime hinted at or glimpsed 'between the cracks' of quantum theory etc.Sadly, no. In fact this is an entertaining enough account of the development and insinuation of information into our lives, beginning with the spoken word and moving through print and latterly electronic information. But that's all you get, and I'd expected/hoped for more. Equally disappointing (and surprising) was the book being over when I was 60% through it, according to my Kindle: the last 40% is acknowledgements, sources and appendices. What a jip! Maybe Gleick had bills to pay, I don't know - but this had the feel of a job only partly done, or maybe it was simply misrepresented by the publishers to make it sound more appealing to a wider audience (at times I certainly felt that Gleick was being asked to write more like Malcolm Gladwell). In any event I finished 'The Information' feeling distinctly dissatisfied. You can safely wait to buy/read this until it's in the reduced-price basket in the local bookshop."
75,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3512499-david-amerland,5,"From a certain perspective we are information. Our DNA is encoded data. Our entire existence summed up by the words ""signal from the noise"". I've been a James Gleick fan ever since I read ""Chaos"". The man gets science. He gets history. And he gets the people who do not get either, which allows him to synthesize answers to the questions that form in their minds. ""The Information"" can be daunting. Gleick tackles the development of our world from an informational point of view from the drums of the Congo and the eidetic memory of pre-literate societies to the hyper-connected, algorithm-dominated world of today. In the process he creates a compelling, detailed picture of us driven by the need to connect and communicate, evolving, being challenged and benefiting (always) from the ability to connect with others. If there is a need to wonder whether the connectivity we're experiencing now, which will challenge us in new ways, is going to change us in ways we cannot yet imagine, then this book answers it. Beautifully written in the Gleick way where emotional writing becomes the connecting line between historical facts, it also manages to bring to brief but colourful life some of the scientific world's most important figures. Centre to it all however is ""us"". Our ability to think (or not), progress (or not) and take seemingly insane risks at times, is what makes this account of a subject that could have been dry and boring, movingly human and, ultimately, riveting."

Alcoholic, of course, after the heavy chapters involving quantum mechanics; but we did estimate some digits by making very bad, not accurate, but so greatly efficient tools!"" -Alexander VolokhThis mnemonic covers how I feel about the latter chapters in this book, which are quite heavy. Before that are histories and biographies of telegraphs, codes, and mathematicians. These are good, but not great. The chapters on Shannon are excellent, but I would refer readers to A Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age for even better coverage. After that, the quantum discussions of information loss (black holes) and quantum entanglement. This starts off well, but soon goes to depths that would leave the average reader gasping for air. Much rereading was necessary. After this, the ending comes perhaps too quickly.As good as the (now dated) Chaos: Making a New Science, as interesting (and thorough) as Time Travel: A History, but not rising above either of those works. 4 solid stars."
77,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3957047-scott,4,Just finished on Audible. An interesting game on information and information technology. Definitely not for the casual reader although written in that respect. You do have to persevere to finish it. It took me three tries with other books in between to finish. Was finally worth it.
78,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19846169-jan-martinek,4,"A nice introduction into a partly familiar field for me. While describing the lives of various scientist, inventors and other crazy people, the book gets to the point and clearly describes various important concepts. I'd prefer a more concise style (as it's all the discourse and there are no heroes in it, you know ;-)), though maybe it's good to prominently display how diverse (and likeable) these supposed information-captivated nerds are.Most of the book is biography meets basic concepts, just the first chapter is kinda too introductory (I'd even recommend to skip it) and the final three chapters are disconnected from the rest in an attempt to cope with the emergence of the internet, Wikipedia, social media, TMI, McLuhan and stuff on as few pages as possible (I think there are better sources to cover this topic, though it did not hurt to read). With the exception of those chapters, Gleick explains basic ideas quite nicely (with some difficulties in the chapter coping with quantum mechanics and related developments that got peppered with some unexplained concepts and terms).The czech translation is not bad, but it feels like the proofreader died (or hopefully just fell asleep) halfway through tbe book :-/"
79,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/646953-patrick,3,"This will seem like a must read for the I-School set (latter-day librarians), and yet much of it will be very familiar to most of them. For the rest of the world, I am not sure how much the topic will grab them. Gleick writes well, and has gathered together many of the important themes from the history of information and info theory. He brings to life some of the most important figures, and that is probably the book's greatest strength. I have long been fascinated with Shannon, and respect him more after reading this, and I now want to read more about Kolmogorov.However, Gleick adds little in the way of substantive analysis. The last few chapters on info glut and the contemporary conflict between ease of publication, and the effort required to find content of value, fall flat, as though he just ran out of steam. The chapter on Quantum Information was tantalizing, but unsatisfying (perhaps forgivable since the topic is entirely non-trivial and likely to lose many readers). In the end, I found myself contemplating Shannon as I read Gleick, considering the entropy of the prose. Suffice it to say that much of it can be read very quickly, and will sound familiar."
80,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390990-stuart,4,"The first three quarters of this book were amazing to read. I'm not sure they'd read the same for everyone, but for me it was sort of like getting your great aunt to tell you the family history you already know, except with new twists and details your parents never told you. For one, information theory is something I think about often, and use professionally on a regular basis. It structures a lot of my thinking, and introduced me to many of the more resonant ideas I've encountered in my life. I don't know if I was filling in the gaps based on my more formal experiences with information theory, and making more connections than Gleick suggests, or if the opening sections of this book were really just _that good_, but there's a lot of detail and biography that's well presented and pretty fascinating.Unfortunately, the whole thing sputtered out for me right after the Chaitin-Kolmogorov complexity section when he gets into memes, information overload, and the internet. Those parts just seemed sort of hodge-podge and muddled without a clear thesis. Oh well. Definitely a worthwhile read nonetheless."
81,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2110715-antonio,5,"James Gleick at his best. The uses and missuses of the concept of information are described, explained and linked. Information is physical, yes, as stated by Landauer and delightfully explained by Gleick, but also, information is not equivalent to meaning, as properly stated by Nyqvist and Shannon. Both terms, the physical aspect of information and the lack of meaning present in information (as meaning is subjective) are widely explained in a very clear way.The mathematical theory of information is presented in a very interesting way, with several remarks, citations and some anecdotes. Starting with the drum communication system, permeated with a lot of redundancy in order to account of the tonal original African language , to the modern communication and computing systems, Gleick leads the reader to a very exciting journey, that of information. Information in the mathematical sense.No doubt I will encourage my students in the first semesters of computer science and maths to read it."
82,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4983981-ben-pace,2,"It's a history of information. Primitive languages, modern languages, Charles Babbage's ""Analytical Engine"", Gödel's Completeness and Incompleteness, Turing's Machines, Shannon's Information Theory, Dawkin's Gene's and Meme's, etc, with details of applications in various areas, including genetics and quantum mechanics.It's been written in a narrative style that I imagine is what Gleick is famous for (I haven't read his other books). Nonetheless, I found this to be a hindrance, because it had a lower signal to noise ratio than I'm used to. I listened to the audiobook on double speed, and that felt normal, even though a lot of it was still less interesting to me. It is probably quite enjoyable if you read light books.I think the content of the book is important, but I didn't learn about nearly any of it here, and didn't learn about it in depth, I'd advise it only to someone who doesn't really know anything about any of the ideas in the first paragraph, and even then, it is only an introduction."
83,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3250760-chris-aldrich,4,"Overall an excellent read. Given that it's an area with which I'm intimately interested, I'm not too surprised that most of it is ""review"", but I'd highly recommend it to the general public to know more about some of the excellent history, philosophy, and theory which Gleick so nicely summarizes throughout the book. There are one or two references in the back which I'll have to chase down and read and one or two, which after many years, seem like they may be worth a second revisiting after having completed this.Even for the specialist, Gleick manages to tie together some disparate thoughts to create an excellent whole which makes it a very worthwhile read. I found towards the last several chapters, Gleick's style becomes much more flowery and less concrete, but most of it is as a result of covering the ""humanities"" perspective of information as opposed to the earlier parts of the text which were more specific to history and the scientific theories he covered."

There were parts that left me feeling cross-eyed and dumb (I should say the most advanced math class I ever took was trigonometry in 11th grade). And yet the parts I understood were fascinating, mind-bending, and eye-opening. So I think I came out ahead. I read Dawkins' The Selfish Gene when I was in college, so it was interesting to have it explained again here. I really didn't fully grasp what Dawkins was saying the first time around, and I'm sure I still don't, but I may be a little closer. The discussion of memes (I didn't even remember the meme part of The Selfish Gene--I thought of it primarily as that ""I can has cheezburger"" thing) was one of my favorite parts. I love that idea that ideas have a life and their own and they want to replicate the same way genes do. "

In it the author traced not only the management of information, not only the role of information in our lives, but also the very foundation and development of the term and the concept. Working chronologically, he explored how language and writing precipitated a developmental change in our species and how encoding in various forms facilitated the growth and communication of information. At first it seemed that he was artificially divorcing information from knowledge and meaning or wisdom, but as the book progressed he discussed those aspects, too. And he addressed the ideas of information overload and forgetting. I was particularly intrigued by his presentation of the key thinkers and developers in information science over the past half century and in his highlighting of essential relevant fields such as cryptology, biology, electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, chaos theory, and others."

We look at information and how technology starting with the telegraph changes the way is transmitted. It was actually quite fun for me to see the reaction of the Newspapers to the telegraph. (Spoiler: it read like what we say of the Internet today) A good amount -no surprise really given the subject- is spent on Claude Shannon. We look at how computation changed the way the word information was used in fields that would prior to Shannon have been imagined to use it. The detour to biology and evolution and the transmission of information was a fun read for me.The final third of the book where information is described as a mathematical abstraction caught me off guard.

With people like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Charles Babbage, Albert Einstein - you get the idea.Well, James Gleick wrote the encyclopedia for my cards. Having spent my entire life in the information age, it's nice to have a book that helps put all the information (pun intended) into an ordered story. He's got interesting anecdotes about all the major players, and how they inter-relate. Although technical, I don't think the content of the book would be outside the skill of anyone who's grown up over the last 40 years to handle. As a bonus, if you read through the whole book, you will also understand a lot more of the references on Big Bang Theory!"

111,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/379992-chris,5,"Every new medium transforms the nature of human thought. In the long run, history is the story of information becoming aware of itself.This book is Gleick’s telling of that story, from the very first new mediums through to the latest. It’s a dense 500 pages that pivots around Claude Shannon’s 1948 paper titled, “A Mathematical Theory of Communication,” in which he coined the term “bit” and first proposed the idea of measuring and quantifying “information.” It was also his first formal use of the term “information theory.”So Shannon is at the core of the book, but Gleick extensively covers all the history that led up to that paper and how our understanding of information has changed since. He ranges broadly from subjects as basic as African talking drums and the beginnings of the written word through the development of dictionaries and encyclopedias, telegraphy and telephony, and more, on to modern genetics and quantum physics. He dwells with figures like Charles Babbage and Harold Weiner, Robert Cawdrey and Richard Dawkins, and so many others. He weaves an amazing quilt of topics and subjects that all have coincided in our current understanding of the idea of information, including: language, communication, messaging, cryptography, mathematics, physics, genetics, biology, social sciences, computers, electrical engineering, the world of ideas and memes, and more. It’s really too big to grasp all at once and hold in my mind even as I attempt to review what I’ve read.At times some of the mathematical formulations and technical scientific calculations were over my English major head, particularly as an audiobook experience, but the gist was always clear and I always took Gleick’s point. So even though I’m worn out from having delved through all of the fascinating information this book contains, I’m looking forward to rereading it another time or two in an attempt to better understand all the different threads he used and the patterns he created under this one massive heading of information. It’s really quite an amazing work.If you care to read a bit more, I’ll next share a few short quotes just because I like them, then some longer ones that demonstrate one of the small threads he’s woven in and out of the second half of the book. Finally, I’ll share another, more historical bit that tickled me with its similarities to something more recent.-----The sender of a message can never fully know his recipient’s mental code book. Two lights in a window might mean nothing or might mean “The British come by sea.” Every poem is a message, different for every reader.-----An undeniable truth: that in the pursuit of knowledge, slower can be better. Exploring the crowded stacks of musty libraries has its own rewards. Reading--even browsing--an old book can yield sustenance denied by a database search. Patience is a virtue, gluttony a sin.-----Information is not knowledge, and knowledge is not wisdom.-----This is a quote I found interesting from the last chapter, 15, “New News Every Day,” in reference to the idea of information overload: Having to think of information as a burden is confusing, as Charles Bennett says. ""We pay to have newspapers delivered, not taken away.” But the thermodynamics of computation shows that yesterday’s newspaper takes up space that Maxwell’s demon needs for today’s work, and modern experience teaches the same. Forgetting used to be a failing, a waste, a sign of senility. Now it takes effort. It may be as important as remembering.We have a greater understanding of what he means because of what has come before. Maxwell’s demon is first briefly mentioned in chapter 8, “The Informational Turn.”Then it’s fully explained in chapter 9, “Entropy and Its Demons,” leading into: But information is physical. Maxwell’s demon makes the link. The demon performs a conversion between information and energy, one particle at a time. Szilard--who did not yet use the word information--found that, if he accounted exactly for each measurement and memory, then the conversion could be computed exactly. So he computed it. He calculated that each unit of information brings a corresponding increase in entropy--specifically, by k log 2 units. Every time the demon makes a choice between one particle and another, it costs one bit of information. The payback comes at the end of the cycle, when it has to clear its memory (Szilard did not specify this last detail in words, but in mathematics). Accounting for this properly is the only way to eliminate the paradox of perpetual motion, to bring the universe back into harmony to “restore concordance with the Second Law.”This idea is expanded in chapter 13, “Information Is Physical”: The younger man pursued Landauer’s principle by analyzing every kind of computer he could imagine, real and abstract, from Turing machines and messenger RNA to “ballistic” computers, carrying signals via something like billiard balls. He confirmed that a great deal of computation can be done with no energy cost at all. In every case, Bennett found, heat dissipation occurs only when information is erased. Erasure is the irreversible logical operation. When the head on a Turing machine erases one square of the tape, or when an electronic computer clears a capacitor, a bit is lost, and then heat must be dissipated. In Szilard’s thought experiment, the demon does not incur an entropy cost when it observes or chooses a molecule. The payback comes at the moment of clearing the record, when the demon erases one observation to make room for the next.Forgetting takes work.Which leads to a thought in the Epilogue, one that particularly speaks to a librarian like myself, because in this age of information overload it takes experts who dwell in the information to filter it and make it usable; librarians, in other words, become more essential than ever: No deus ex machina waits in the wings; no man behind the curtain. We have no Maxwell’s demon to help us filter and search. “We want the Demon, you see,” wrote Stanislaw Lem, “to extract from the dance of atoms only information that is genuine, like mathematical theorems, fashion magazines, blueprints, historical chronicles, or a recipe for ion crumpets, or how to clean and iron a suit of asbestos, and poetry too, and scientific advice, and almanacs, and calendars, and secret documents, and everything that ever appeared in any newspaper in the Universe, and telephone books of the future.” As ever, it is the choice that informs us (in the original sense of that word). Selecting the genuine takes work; then forgetting takes even more work. This is the curse of omniscience: the answer to any question may arrive at the fingertips--via Google or Wikipedia or IMDb or YouTube or Epicurious or the National DNA Database or any of their natural heirs and successors--and still we wonder what we know.-----And this bit about the early days of the telegraph (mid 1800s) made me think of texting.Two motivations went hand in glove: secrecy and brevity. Short messages saved money--that was simple. So powerful was that impulse that English prose style soon seemed to be feeling the effects. Telegraphic and telegraphese described the new way of writing. Flowers of rhetoric cost too much, and some regretted it. ""The telegraphic style banishes all the forms of politeness,"" wrote Andrew Wynter. . . . Almost immediately, newspaper reporters began to contrive methods for transmitting more information with fewer billable words. . . .  . . . For less sensitive occasions, Vail proposed using abbreviated versions of common phrases. Instead of ""give my love to,"" he suggested sending ""gmlt."" He offered a few more suggestions:mhii - My health is improvingshf - Stocks have fallenymir - Your message is receivedwmietg - When may I expect the goods?wyegfef - Will you exchange gold for eastern funds?All these systems required prearrangement between sender and recipient: the message was to be supplemented, or altered, by preexisting knowledge shared at both ends. . . .

Can get quite detailed in the math and the science of information, so may not be for the light hearted!Really made me think about how far this science of information has come. Particular highlights for me:- the history of information: from language to words, to writing, to drums, to the turing machine, onto the computer, - history of how the science of encryption sped along the development of formal informatics (and it started with the telegraph, before the war!)- evolution to a time and place now where access to any and all information is almost instantaneous- the discussion about wikipedia and the debate over what counts as meaningful information - what topics are worth their own heading in the universal encyclopedia of all information- the idea that all information has been completely reduced by algorithms to zeros and ones (or on/off)!Very highly recommended read if any of the above interests you even a little bit!--------Up to Chapter 4 on this excellent book... Basically in an in depth historical review of information - how it has evolved from merely oral transmission, to various recordings (including the development of the alphabet, words, and written language), to the information age of today.Phenomenal, engrossing, and makes me realize I actually learned some stuff during my informatics training!So far I'd say this would NOT be for the light of hearted - heavy on detail, and not afraid to discuss the math and physics behind information...Loving it...---------------------------From NYTIMES:“The Information” offers this point-blank characterization of its author: “James Gleick is our leading chronicler of science and modern technology.” This new book goes far beyond the earlier Gleick milestones, “Chaos” and “Genius,” to validate that claim.Phyllis RoseJames GleickTHE INFORMATIONA History, a Theory, a FloodBy James GleickIllustrated. 526 pages. Pantheon Books. $29.95.“The Information” is so ambitious, illuminating and sexily theoretical that it will amount to aspirational reading for many of those who have the mettle to tackle it. Don’t make the mistake of reading it quickly. Imagine luxuriating on a Wi-Fi-equipped desert island with Mr. Gleick’s book, a search engine and no distractions. “The Information” is to the nature, history and significance of data what the beach is to sand.In this relaxed setting, take the time to differentiate among the Brownian (motion), Bodleian (library) and Boolean (logic) while following Mr. Gleick’s version of what Einstein called “spukhafte Fernwirkung,” or “spooky action at a distance.” Einstein wasn’t precise about what this meant, and Mr. Gleick isn’t always precise either. His ambitions for this book are diffuse and far flung, to the point where providing a thumbnail description of “The Information” is impossible.So this book’s prologue is its most slippery section. It does not exactly outline a unifying thesis. Instead it hints at the amalgam of logic, philosophy, linguistics, research, appraisal and anecdotal wisdom that will follow. If Mr. Gleick has one overriding goal it is to provide an animated history of scientific progress, specifically the progress of the technology that allows information to be recorded, transmitted and analyzed. This study’s range extends from communication by drumbeat to cognitive assault by e-mail.As an illustration of Mr. Gleick’s versatility, consider what he has to say about the telegraph. He describes the mechanical key that made telegraphic transmission possible; the compression of language that this new medium encouraged; that it literally was a medium, a midway point between fully verbal messages and coded ones; the damaging effect its forced brevity had on civility; the confusion it created as to what a message actually was (could a mother send her son a dish of sauerkraut?) and the new conceptual thinking that it helped implement. The weather, which had been understood on a place-by-place basis, was suddenly much more than a collection of local events.Beyond all this Mr. Gleick’s telegraph chapter, titled “A Nervous System for the Earth,” finds time to consider the kind of binary code that began to make sense in the telegraph era. It examines the way letters came to treated like numbers, the way systems of ciphers emerged. It cites the various uses to which ciphers might be put by businessmen, governments or fiction writers (Lewis Carroll, Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe). Most of all it shows how this phase of communication anticipated the immense complexities of our own information age.Although “The Information” unfolds in a roughly chronological way, Mr. Gleick is no slave to linearity. He freely embarks on colorful digressions. Some are included just for the sake of introducing the great eccentrics whose seemingly marginal inventions would prove to be prophetic. Like Richard Holmes’s “Age of Wonder” this book invests scientists with big, eccentric personalities. Augusta Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, may have been spectacularly arrogant about what she called “my immense reasoning faculties,” claiming that her brain was “something more than merely mortal.” But her contribution to the writing of algorithms can, in the right geeky circles, be mentioned in the same breath as her father’s contribution to poetry.The segments of “The Information” vary in levels of difficulty. Grappling with entropy, randomness and quantum teleportation is the price of enjoying Mr. Gleick’s simple, entertaining riffs on the Oxford English Dictionary’s methodology, which has yielded 30-odd spellings of “mackerel” and an enchantingly tongue-tied definition of “bada-bing” and on the cyber-battles waged via Wikipedia. (As he notes, there are people who have bothered to fight over Wikipedia’s use of the word “cute” to accompany a picture of a young polar bear.) That Amazon boasts of being able to download a book called “Data Smog” in less than a minute does not escape his keen sense of the absurd.As it traces our route to information overload, “The Information” pays tribute to the places that made it possible. He cites and honors the great cogitation hives of yore. In addition to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., the Mount Rushmore of theoretical science, he acknowledges the achievements of corporate facilities like Bell Labs and I.B.M.’s Watson Research Center in the halcyon days when many innovations had not found practical applications and progress was its own reward.“The Information” also lauds the heroics of mathematicians, physicists and computer pioneers like Claude Shannon, who is revered in the computer-science realm for his information theory but not yet treated as a subject for full-length, mainstream biography. Mr. Shannon’s interest in circuitry using “if ... then” choices conducting arithmetic in a binary system had novelty when he began formulating his thoughts in 1937. “Here in a master’s thesis by a research assistant,” Mr. Gleick writes, “was the essence of the computer revolution yet to come.”Among its many other virtues “The Information” has the rare capacity to work as a time machine. It goes back much further than Shannon’s breakthroughs. And with each step backward Mr. Gleick must erase what his readers already know. He casts new light on the verbal flourishes of the Greek poetry that preceded the written word: these turns of phrase could be as useful for their mnemonic power as for their art. He explains why the Greeks arranged things in terms of events, not categories; how one Babylonian text that ends with “this is the procedure” is essentially an algorithm; and why the telephone and the skyscraper go hand in hand. Once the telephone eliminated the need for hand-delivered messages, the sky was the limit.In the opinion of “The Information” the world of information still has room for expansion. We may be drowning in spam, but the sky’s still the limit today. "
113,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3235961-stormie,2,"I can't find it in me to give this book more than 2 stars.It has got to be difficult to write about /so/ many topics in just a few hundred pages, and I'll give Gleick credit for giving one hell of a go at it. Yet he writes so convincingly at times about such blatantly simplistic statements (extremely black and white, especially his epilogue--yuck!) that I can't help but /not/ be convinced. Particularly because he suggests that oral cultures were/are unable to grasp the concepts of history, logic, mathematics...I could go on and on. Basically, literate (European*) cultures are the only ones that Truly Understand Information. Two things that bugged me a lot while reading this for one of my classes, aside from the simplistic statements, were a quote included by Gleick that references Maya and Egyptian hieroglyphs as not being advanced enough to include phonemes. This quote is from a talk that occurred in 1950--but we knew that the Maya used phonemes in their hieroglyphs by the 1940s! A simple fact check could've helped, especially since this is non-fiction. Secondly, he straight out says that Prince stopped using his name because he 'got tired of it.' No, that is not true. Prince's name change was part of a--very justified--disagreement between him and the Warner Bros. contract he was signed to at the time of the name change. This should have been something SO much easier to fact check than knowing about Maya phonemes, and yet Gleick throws it in there anyway--likely assuming that no one will notice once the book is almost finished. (And yes, I know these two notes are nitpicky. But if you're going to publish non-fiction, especially such confidently written non-fiction as this, you should be critical about what you're saying, and make sure to fact check everything as much as possible.)Otherwise, this is not a bad overview of the information field. There is more focus on white American and European men than anyone else, but I didn't go into this book expecting much else, tbh. Often, the women he includes in the narrative seem more like footnotes, which was disappointing. I don't think I would have read this book had I not been assigned to do so--and to analyze certain sections of it--for my class."
114,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48051175-casey,4,"A good book, providing a history of information and information theory. More than just a deep dive into the logic and philosophy of data flows in the computer age (though that takes up the majority of the book), this book walks us through the many varied ways humans and nature have utilized communication networks. Topics include the development of language, uses of African Drums, the 19th century attempts to speed up information through telegraphy, the early attempts to build computers which could organize information more efficiently than a human “calculator.” Of course, the post WWII development of information theory is the center piece of the book. Though the author does point out that the binary bit is specifically a human creation, he makes a strong case that information throughout nature is usually broken down into binary true-false statements. Part history, part philosophy, with some mathematics, this book covers a lot of ground and can, at times, be confusing in its breadth. But it is very readable and filled with many interesting tidbits and ah-ha moments in learning how information flows around us or as we flow through information, depending on your stance towards the issue. A great book for appreciating the nuances of information flow and how the “universe is computing its own destiny.” Highly recommended for those wanting to better appreciate data flows across various networks under varying conditions. "
115,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5770036-ji,5,"I thought of creating a new ""book shelf"" for this book. It truly belongs to its own category. It's a book easily having crossed the lines of - technical- history- theory- biography (of many people)- good read (except for some parts being very boring)- educational- philosophical (to an extent that the author is very reserved in sharing his own opinions in an obvious way)- entertainingIf I have to tell you the top feature that makes this book great - then it'd have to be the way how the material in this book were gathered and put together - the choice of these material itself is well-played, and the ordering of the material seems non-trivial. A series of events in history that may or may not make sense to put together, are laid out in this book as if it was a game some God has played with human beings. Warnings ahead it's a bit dry from time to time. It took me many years from wanting to read it to actually finishing it. I might save it for revisiting sometime, since it's truly one of the most well written books.Another warning is that I don't like the ending of the book. It might as well be because there's no way to find a good ending to this book. However I suspect that the author lost energy of sorts and let it go too easily."
116,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321314-jeff-scott,4,"This book is a very thorough examination covering information from the smallest bit. A bit is the smallest piece of information that cannot be broken down whether its 1s and 0s, an African drum beat, a telegraph beep, or our own genes. Gleick covers it all here, but the book goes to places I had trouble following. It starts off with a general history of information and covers the African drum as a communication tool and follows with oral communication, written communication, and up until the telegraph. It’s at this point that I had trouble with a little too much detail. He gets into how a telegraph works and the use of electricity, then into code breaking, Babbage’s analytical machine, entropy, quantum physics and string theory. In some parts I had to recall my High School physics and a book I read earlier this year, The Grande Design (dealing with quantum physics and string theory). I couldn’t piece together a cohesive point to this direction. I was under the impression the book was about information, how it is delivered, and how we are overwhelmed by it (which he does cover), but it takes such a big sidetrack that I wasn’t sure if he could pull it all together at the end. He does thankfully, and it does all make sense after finishing the book. An example of the extreme points is when he examines a book called A Million Random Digits, which is a book with a million random digits in it. It was a book published by the Rand Corporation in an attempt to determine if there is a pattern. He also discusses genes and how those tiny bits may be controlling who you are more than you know. Although difficult, it’s fascinating. There is a part about how information can never be lost, and that it takes work to actually forget things. In fact, if information could be lost it would upend all of quantum theory, even if you burn a book, you could technically rebuild the information from the ash. The book is a flood of information in and of itself, but worth the read. I will definitely re-read this one in the future to get many of his points, but his main one is clear. It’s not a problem of losing information, but wading through and filtering all of it to find meaning. How do we find meaning with this flood of information? (It’s a call to the librarian in all of us.)“This is the challenge that remains, and not just for scientists: the establishment of meaning.” P. 372“When information is cheap, attention becomes expensive.” P. 410Favorite Passages:“It from Bit: Information gives rise to every It—every particle, every field of force, even the space-time continuum itself.” This is another way of fathoming the paradox of the observer: that the outcome of an experiment is affected, or even determined, when it is observed. Not only is the observer observing she is asking questions and making statements that must ultimately be expressed in discrete bits. “What we call reality” Wheeler wrote coyly, “arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions.” He added “all things physical are information-theoretic in origin, and this is a participatory universe.” P. 10“The alphabet spread by contagion. The new technology was both the virus and the vector of transmission. It could not be monopolized and it could not be suppressed. Even children could learn these few, lightweight semantically empty letters.” P. 39“The information has been detached from any person, detached from the person’s experience. Now it lives in the words, little life-support modules.” P. 39“Language did not function as a storehouse of words, from which users could summon the correct items, preformed. On the contrary, words were fugitive, on the fly expected to vanish again thereafter.” P. 53(There is an interesting perspective on how our view of the universe affects our language. The illiterate see geometric shapes, not as circle or rectangle, but as ball or door.)“Telephone books soon represented the most comprehensive listings of, and directories to, human populations ever attempted (They became the thickest and densest of the world’s books—four volumes for London; a 2,600 page tome for Chicago—and seemed a permanent, indispensible part of the world’s information ecology until, they were not. They went obsolete, effectively, at the turn of the 21st century. American telephone companies were officially fazing them out by 2010 in New York; the end of automatic delivery of telephone directories was estimated to save 5,000 tons of paper. ““Information is not free. Maxwell, Thomson, and the rest had implicitly talked as though knowledge was there for the taking…they did not consider the cost of this information. They could not; for them in a simpler time, it was as if the information belonged to a parallel universe, an astral plan, not linked to the universe of matter and energy, particles and forces whose behavior they were learning to calculate. P 279“When a jingle lingers in our ears or a fad turns fashion upside down, or a hoax dominates the global chatter for months and vanishes as swiftly as it came, who is master and who is slave?” P. 327“Now expectations have inverted. Everything may be recorded and preserved, at least potentially: every musical performance; every crime in a shop; elevator, or city street; every volcano or tsunami on the remotest shore; every card played or piece moved in an online game; every rugby scrum and cricket match. Having a camera at hand is normal, not exceptional, something like 500 billion images were capture in 2010…” p. 397“Overloading of circuits was a fairly new metaphor to express a sensation—too much information—that felt new. It had always felt new. One hungers for books; rereads a cherished few; begs or borrows more; waits at the library door and perhaps, in the blink of an eye, finds oneself in a state of surfeit: too much to read.” P. 401"
117,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1153204-alan,4,"""Information.""That's what the shadowy captors of Number Six demand, in the opening to the famed 1960s TV series ""The Prisoner."" He responds defiantly, ""You won't get it."" But of course his very defiance conveyed some information to them... and if they'd had James Gleick's The Information on hand, they might have gleaned even more from Patrick McGoohan's best-known character. For The Information contains a wealth of information about all the ways information can be conveyed across time and across space, about the slow flowering over millennia of human understanding about information itself.The core of the book is a relaxed and conversationally-written history of 20th-Century giants such as Claude Shannon of Bell Laboratories, who first described the mathematics of information transfer; Alan Turing, who did so much of the same for computing; physicists like Albert Einstein and John Archibald Wheeler... but The Information begins long before that era, and encompasses along the way topics as diverse as cuneiform, African talking drums, telegraphy, and many other aspects of how we systematize thoughts and pass them from mind to mind. The book could easily be called The Communication instead.""We have met the Devil of Information Overload and his impish underlings, the computer virus, the busy signal, the dead link, and the PowerPoint presentation."" (p.11)Gleick has chosen an overwhelming topic, or rather an overwhelming host of topics, and hence I think it's understandable that The Information sometimes seems scattershot and unfocused (much like this review, I fear). It's to Gleick's credit that the book remains interesting no matter what byways he wanders. Compare with Charles Petzold's complementary book Code (which you should also read)—here, Gleick is less methodical than Petzold, but more accessible. Besides, the history of a subject as woolly as information theory cannot be easily codified. How we think about the thing we think with; how we talk about how we talk... these are not easy questions. We're treading into recursion now, the bane of Bertrand Russell.Gleick himself occasionally even waxes lyrical, as on p.168, where the subheading he chooses for Chapter 6—""No Other Thing Is More Enswathed In The Unknown""—could have come straight from an exhibit in the Museum of Jurassic Technology.In a literate society, writing helps structure thought—even for the illiterate in that society, who cannot avoid coming into contact with the habits of thought that the word makes easy—as Gleick points out (in chapter 2, entitled ""The Persistence of the Word""). Perhaps this unavoidable impact on thought offers a simpler and more logical (from the Greek ""logos""—the Word) alternative to the—to my mind untenable—""bicameral mind"" hypothesis elaborated by Julian Jaynes (who indeed shows up later in that very chapter).The time-binding, world-bending impact of literacy may not be an unmixed blessing, though, at least to some... Consider this passage by T.S. Eliot, from page 403:Knowledge of speech, but not of silence;Knowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word.All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance,All our ignorance brings us nearer to death,But nearness to death no nearer to GOD.A silent, wordless God; the Devil of Information Overload... with friends like these, it's no wonder that ordinary human beings often feel themselves beleaguered and overwhelmed. But the very instruments of this overload—from the alphabet to the printing press, to the computer, to the network of computers—offer also the power to manage the flood. The prophetic Charles Babbage saw it happening. As quoted on p.124:""It is the science of calculation—which becomes continually more necessary at each step of our progress, and which must ultimately govern the whole of the applications of science to the arts of life.""In the end I think that's the central message of The Information—that even though perfect knowledge, complete information, is a mathematical impossibility, we can always know more, learn more, build on what has gone before, and with our memories thus augmented, improve upon our pasts. James Gleick may not have written the perfect book about information... but it's a worthy addition to the information we have."
118,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8192046-ted-lehmann,5," James Gleick, noted science writer, has the capacity to take the long view of the dawn of the Universe at the same time he focuses down to the sub-microscopic levels of molecular biology. He takes the reader to the edges of the universe, just seconds after the Big Bang and to the deepest part of a a cell, the chromosome, and finds they're the same place. His large and oh-so-readable book The Information, treats information at the most abstract, content free levels while also examining the world Encyclopedia, the efforts to create a compendium of all the world's knowledge, while differentiating between knowledge and information. In doing this, he helps each reader examine issues like “what makes us human,” and “how we find meaning.” While all this might sound daunting, Gleick is such a fine writer, that the impossible idea become plausible, and the difficult becomes approachable. While, as a reader and a thinker, I must own my lifelong difficulties with math and science, Gleick makes me think more deeply without wearing out his welcome. Other writers present formulas and mathematical ideas in the form of mathematical writing, and my eyes glaze over. Gleick manages always to make me think I'm, at least, on the edge of understanding, and then draws parallels that turn the wonder into insight. Introducing the inventor of the transistor, Claude Shannon (1916 – 2001), known as the father of information theory, as the central character in his story, Gleick then takes the reader on a journey that leads back to African drum languages, to the beginning of language and, perforce, thought. Gleick makes it clear that without language there is no thought nor thought without language. It seems to be completely true that “in the beginning was the word,” if not in a Biblical sense, then in a real life statement of the beginnings of understanding. In order to make Shannon's contributions clear and to point in directions still not fully realized, but opened by Shannon's work, Gleick takes us back to the beginnings of time, before conscious thought and the development of language, let alone writing. In every case, as nearly as I can tell, thought, expression, and the invention of technology link together such that great leaps can only happen when they three coincide. For example, Gleick tells the story of early nineteenth century British mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage, who invented, at least in his head, a huge, mechanical calculating machine which was never built because the technology required reached beyond what could be developed and built at the time. Nevertheless, Babbage is considered to be the “father of the computer,” although such a child always has many fathers. Similarly, humankind have been in the business of seeking to accumulate information about their own activities and environment almost since the first cave painting. Early dictionaries, mere alphabetical lists of words (Did you know that the very word alphabet is alphabetical – Alpha Beta, the first two letters?) led to efforts to write meanings of the words and then derivations. Similarly, The Encyclopedia Brittanica represents a massive effort over nearly a century's time to accumulate all (or at least a whole lot) the information. Now Wikipedia and Google, almost unimagineably large and comprehensive attempt to continue the effort. But such projects would never have been as successful as they are were it not for the massive increase in speed and storage capacity of the Internet with the continued decline of the cost of computing and memory. Your smart phone is ever so much more powerful and has significantly more memory than the early manned rockets contained as the penetrated into space. Ahhh, space! Another important strand of The Information is the work of physicists, mathematicians, and, more recently biologists in probing the edges of space and the discoveries in both theory and observation of the DNA strands that hold our entire evolutionary history within their substance, which is repeated in every cell of our bodies. All this might seem ponderous in a less graceful, clear, and, yes, witty writer. Gleick bases much of his discussion on the interaction between seminal people and the development of relevant technology. He writes about both with insight while not making the ideas so difficult to grasp that he turns off non-technical good readers. As he weaves his way through history and the science that developed, he never moves far from the search for meaning within the contentless search for relevant theory to support it. I leave it to individual readers to assess whether this book contributes to their understanding of that beyond all understanding. James Gleick was born in New York and began his career in journalism, working as an editor and reporter for the New York Times. He covered science and technology there, chronicling the rise of the Internet as the Fast Forward columnist, and in 1993 founded an Internet start-up company called The Pipeline. His books have been translated into more than twenty-five languages. He has been nominated for three Pulitzer Prizes and two National Book Awards. His next book is Time Travel: A History, for which I asked the published to send me a pre-publication review copy, and was denied. I'll read it when I can afford it. The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood by James Gleick (Pantheon Books, 2011, 527 pages, Various Prices) explores the ideas that lead to and encompass what is now called information theory. In order to do that, Gleick has had to look to the beginning of history and before and to the ends of the Universe and beyond. Chances are there are smaller particles and further empty places, and chances are, too, that Gleick will tell us about them, and each of us will understand beyond the limits we thought possible. Who could ask for more?"
119,0375423729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,5,"A magnificent overview of the topic of information, from the start (and motivations) of human language, as an encoding scheme to the science of information. The book skirts the technical-concept level of exposition after it introduces the notion of computing with Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage. Each section of the book is introduced either with a biographical sketch or an overview of the concept, and it really is useful to see how these ideas were developed in history for those readers who may be familiar with the mechanics of some of these subjects.Of all the topics covered, I found the discussion on how the idea of Shannon entropy was developed, and differentiated from thermodynamic entropy, the most interesting. Most textbooks don't dwell on this matter, but knowing that it was more accident or coincidence,.rather than purposeful is interesting. Especially as information physicality, the topic that unites the two is also dealt with in proceeding sections when the topic of entropic effects of writing to disk is discussed. Which to the surprise of the original researchers, does not increase entropy in the thermodynamic sense, but it is erasure, which dissipates heat, that does.This topic is linked in logical ways to both the notion of Maxwell's Demon and the idea of quantum computing. Other interesting topics include a really well-written exposition on Godel numbering of formal statements, and how it's used to prove the incompleteness phenomena exists for Peano Arithmetic, and how incompleteness relates to Kolmogorov Complexity, the min size of the algorithm that can generate a computational object, which was linked by Chatin. Really the author does an amazing job illustrating the centrality of this concept to several deep mysteries in formalism.Possibly one of my top 5 favourite layman books. Very informative. Highly recommended"
