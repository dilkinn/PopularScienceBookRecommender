I did skim through a fair bit of the rest, and saw that the interesting facts and historical figures associated with the nurture-nature debate persist throughout the book. Those were the bits that made it informative and interesting. But I had some serious issues with some of Ridley's opinions disguised as fact, as well as some technical choices such as referring to a ""Genome Organizing Device"" or ""GOD"" which is responsible for the development of life. He says he does this so he can write in the active rather than the passive voice, but he could easily have used ""natural selection"" or some other substitute. He says he chooses GOD to ""keep religious people happy"", which I would find incredibly patronizing if I was religious. This is just one example among many when Ridley tries to say something clever or adopts a writing style that strays from scientific interest to being pompous at best and misleading at worst.Oh, and his idea of what a meritocracy is (and how, as he says, it necessarily fails) is shudderingly narrow-minded. I could be ok with this if he put it forward as his opinion, but no, he writes facts that aren't facts. If you do read this book, it's good to keep that in mind."

Ridley sets out to tear down the wall that has divided the ""Nature vs Nurture"" debate for centuries. Readable (as always from Ridley) and engrossing, this explains how environment can trigger genes, and how genes often determine which environments we choose. If you entertain any notion that humans are unique, this book will seek to change your minds. By far my favorite parts are in his descriptions of Bonobos, Gorillas, and chimps."
2,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90635-sarah,5,"Nicely written examination of a subject which everyone should understand. He does his best to put the ""nature vs nuture"" debate to rest. Informative without being dry."
3,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"This book is along the same lines as Genome: the Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters. The best thing I can do to review these two books together is list what I think their pros and cons are:Pros:1. Writing style: Ridley's writing style is engaging and humorous, yet not condescending. He respects his readers.2. Scientific content: The science is very detailed and cutting edge. Ridley goes beyond the high-level science you'll find in other books and discusses the latest research.3. Well sourced: The notes at the end reveal that Ridley is on top of the latest academic research and writing. Each chapter has about 20 citations from within a few years that the books were published.4. Deep analysis: Ridley goes beyond the science and is willing to dig deep into the philosophical and political implications.Cons:1. Feels out-of-date: Because the scientific research cites is so cutting edge, it leaves you wondering if, in the approximately 20 years since the book was written, there has been more progress.2. Organization: Each chapter reads somewhat like a stand-alone discussion. Although Ridley has a few central messages of the book, there isn't quite a narrative continuity that holds the book together.Overall very much more enlightening and informative than you'll get from most other books."
4,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,5,A really good book.Pro:I takes a centrist view on things. It is basically science with no personal views or observations. This is the middle ground in the nature-nurture debate. Well written and short enough to not get boring. Basically all the basics on the debate and a great book.Con:Ridley knows a lot. He is a scientist. I would imagine that 90% of the non 5 stars reviews here are by people who got a bit stuck on the paragraphs talking about the studies and how they were done. It explains things well but some people might not even know how science works in practicality and have a hard time following some of the in-depth look at things. Some of the book can be a bit hard at times. That said it is still a very recommended book for all type of readers. It is another must-read if you are in any shape or form interested in social science. If you don't understand the debate or the science on it this is a great way to learn about it.
5,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7661613-jennifer,2,"While I agree with the central theme of the book, the author struggles to find the balance between an academic publication and a book for the general public. This book assumes knowledge of psychology, neurobiology, genetics, cultural anthropology, and sociology that are likely to be found only in people who have at minimum a BS degree and supplemental reading, or work experience in these fields. Reviews of pertinent studies in these fields are boring to those with this prior knowledge and insufficient for lay persons."

7,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/383392-gerald-berke,5,"A detailed, readable and witty treatise on how life is controlled by genes (nature) and how life controls genes (nurture). The research, the ideas, the roots of various theories of understanding from 100 years or more to studies that are quite current are all layed out.I've listened to audio tapes of the book for a couple of years, and am now going carefully through the book, to locate and home in on specific details that I need to study to fully grasp.The book is a marvelously readable compendium of what we know about genetics and evolution, right up to the publication date. What is also revealed is how little is known in one or two or three decades past, what 5 or 10 years can add to the science. It would surely seem to be worth another book every 5 years at the rate we are going."
8,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31165672-astha-garg,5,"This was my first science book that I read for leisure and I must say it has got me hooked on the genre. I loved Ridley's style - the humor, logic, experiments and his own thoughts. I wish there were more authors writing not-so-technical science books in my own area of expertise. "
9,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97325606-annie,4,"Quick review before I'm off to bed. Ridley’s work is a relatively good primer to classic psychology studies vis-a-vis the nature-nurture debate. Criticizing human exceptionalism, that humans differ from all other species, on account of a ‘uniqueness’ that is the law not the exception in nature, Ridley writes of the nature-nurture debate in a way that works in philosopher Mary Midgley’s critique of the “strange segregation of humans from their kindred”. Genes, carriers of evolutionary information, that turn on/off other genes directing expression of genetic information and copy themselves are often derided by a tabula rasa epistemological standpoint, that nurture is the sole molder of human nature/experience. It’s a damaging one in therapeutic practice, which is why there’s been the implementation of the biopsychosocial model. Nevertheless, over the course of my two degrees, a majority of my peers prefer the tabula rasa or solely psychosocial approach. Genetic inheritance of susceptibility to mental health disorders was first studied by Rosanoff and Kallman via twin studies, at a sensitive period in academia: (both Jewish) they were accused of Nazism. It’s quite clear now that offspring inherit genetic risk even from unaffected parents and pass it off to their offspring. This biopsychosocial approach is rather well traced through critical psychology studies: (1) William Jankowiak, 1992, 168 different ethnographic cultures all recognized the distinct form of ‘romantic love’, (2) John Money’s ‘sex roles are products of early experience’, an infant can be assigned to either sex, which he used to change one male with a botched circumcision into a female. Mickey Diamond, who argued against psychosexual neutrality or ‘brains are not ambiguous just because genitalia are’. Money’s case was considered a success, but Brenda Reiner detransitioned into a man, even insisting at 14 that he was a boy. However, this speaks little of trans experiences, (3) Simon Baron-Cohen’s students studying gender differences in 12 month old infants: girls made more eye contact than boys, due to high fetal testosterone high, replicated in 24 hour old babies, slight preference, (4) Mriganka Sur, rewired eyes of a ferret from visual to auditory cortex, but with only slight vision, indicating limits to neuroplasticity, (5) Bouchard who examined twins reared apart who were separated rather early, who turn out more similar than twins raised together, since twins reared together exaggerate their differences. Critiques of certain studies are addressed. Herein, Ridley writes that Susan Farber’s critique was riddled with methodological errors, overlooking data, but does not provide concrete examples, though Bouchard’s second study, better methodologically, was explained well. (Identical twins-apart similar at 63% correlation for political issues, and fraternal twin-apart is 21%). The behaviorist paradigm is addressed too, with Harlow’s monkeys that couldn’t make the association of parental bonds to the wire monkey and Martin Seligman’s prepared learning, that requires existing affinity to targets, that not everything can be learned with equal acuity.Prototypically ‘cultural’ elements share genetic elements as well, though at the time of writing he wasn’t able to provide robust statistical data: (1) gene BNDF, determining depression, self-consciousness, anxious, vulnerable, influences neuroticism in NEO PI R, signifying that personality has heritable dimensions resulting from protein dimensions, (2) IQ (sizable 40% correlation to brain size too), like Spearman’s g, is heritable, but dependent on environment, socioeconomic status, and nutrition, at early ages. Again, he manages to delve into the nurture side well. However, shared environment influence disappears over time: with age the less family background predicts IQ and the better genes predict it. There might be cultural aspects to a behavior that ultimately remains rooted instinct or culture will often reflect human nature than affect it, writes Ridley. It was interesting to read of Franz Boas, who pushed the idea that culture frees people from their nature. Boas’ work on head size change after migration to America was flawed, statistically. Margaret Mead, studying the sexual mores of Samoans to show how ethnocentric and cultural the ideas of sex in the west, ended up duped (at best) or fabricated data (at worst). I remember being taught of her as some significant arbiter of truth. Ridley states that Samoa was actually more censorious about sex than America. Emile Durkheim’s claim that ‘human nature is consequence not cause of social forces’ is something I find Ridley makes a weak argument against, using mostly scholarship not data. However, the fact that brain size increased before demands of culture appeared, a fact Ridley writes little of, is a better case he could have made. That environmental and sexual pressures later transformed into culture, that culture is consequence not cause is an argument I’ve seen contemporarily. I do like that he writes about the rejection of reductionism on account of the glorification of a sort of hazy holism. That reductionism is used in several fields well, as psychology uses biology, which uses chemistry, which uses physics, is a strong enough case for me. The biopsychosocial model uses it too, which is perhaps why the biological aspect is often thrown out by my peers. I wonder when ‘reductionism’ became a dirty word and why for my peers, at least when they are willing to use behaviorism, which reduces individuals to nothing but learning and external influences. Though even learning depends on the biology of the CREB genes which must be turned on and creating protein during the learning learning process. I’ve seen plenty of environmental determinism case conceptualizations, often throwing away the biological aspects, even in critical cases such as learning disorders or childhood trauma, but even those are as fatalistic as genetic determinism. The extreme determinism of innatists is a straw man position that has perhaps created some blocks toward the more biological aspects of psychology in my peers. Sad to see."
10,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35599102-monkonacid,5,"It is not that simple. One cannot simply take a small aspect of reality and ignore all the rest, especially when the rest is more than closely connected, and, at the same time, hope to come to worthy conclussions. This, unfortunately, has been a common theme in biology, psychology, sociology and what not.But here comes (the) Matt Ridley to the rescue. It is not nature or nurture, it is nature and nurture or nature via nurture as author with intelectual force proclaims. The dichotomy is false and needless. Both nature and nurture have a determining effect on the individual at the same time. Even in the most, seemingly, obvious situations when one would be too tempted to pass the opportunity to attribute effects to one or the other, it is commonly both still that have the effect in an interconnected fashion. Many fell in this trap and simply could not pass the opportunity to dichotomize falsely. But not Ridley.And in what eloquent and addictive form has he introduced this needed insight to the world, to the psychologies and to the biologies. One intriguing fact changes another, one mind bending idea comes after another. Not to forget the multi angled approach, too.A worthy read, a worthy hypothesis and a worthy conclussion. Simply, a must read."
11,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5795722-aaron-michaux,5,"The best book I have ever read on the nature-nurture debate. Ridley is an engaging author who weaves a tapestry of science, politics, history and anecdote. The binding thread is famous scientists and philosophers who have framed the nature-nurture debate over the past few hundred years. All of them have introduced profound insights, and if you were to put them all in a room together, then surely their bushy beards would all get tangled up.Apart from the human and political element, I loved Ridley's description of state-of-the-art experimentation, and especially new experimental techniques that rely on recent innovations. A tremendous amount has been learned since Dawkin's ""The Selfish Gene"". It seems that the life sciences will only extend that knowledge exponentially in the next few decades as high technology allows experimentation that previous generations could never have dreamed about.Informative and entertaining, hat goes off to Matt Ridley."
12,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"I love this author. He is direct with his examples, moves quickly and yet you never feel like you miss a step. It's always very fluid and easy with Ridley. I preferred both the Genome and the Red Queen to this however, if you have yet to read much on the subject of genetics those would be a better start. Not because anything in this one is incomprehensible in the least bit without any other knowledge, but more just because if you had to pick any one of these awesome texts those would be a better choice. Still I found this a wonderful addition to my growing Ridley Collection and was pleased at his approach. He did not in any ways take sides in the Nature/Nurture debate. Instead he tells the tale of how one naturally leads to the other and how important both are to the human system/organism. "
13,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/905513-elphaba,5,"GREAT BOOK - lots of science and even though it was published before the Human Genome project was finished, we (my book discussion group) could find nothing out of date about the data - basic premise: that Genes are not static but are an active and varying and incredibly wondrous part of the development of homo sapiens from conception to death. Many genes change sometimes as often as every second and sometimes as often as once in a lifetime and sometimes never depending on DNA switches that respond to environment or conditions during post conception (which can include during the womb). Highly recommend."

This is a real sequel and in many ways it has the advantage of being focused.The main idea expressed in this book is that Genes are the underlying mechanisms for BOTH nature and nurture and as such these two are not in a fight they are collaborating factors. No matter how common-sensical this may be, many people for long time were against it."
15,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1440558-brandon-clark,4,Good book on the role played by genetics and experience on psychology and biology.
16,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10812804-john-de-medici,4,Quite a fascinating and an informative read.
17,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,0,"I read prologue, epilogue, and discussion of free will. Considering how (relatively) old this is, that's plenty."
18,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32834735-pippo-ranito,3,"This book was hard to put down because of Ridley's extremely engaging approach, which, to me was his greatest strength and also his weakness.Let me tell you about it really quickly.Chapter 1 is perhaps my favorite. You won't understand the book nor follow its flow if you won't commit to the argument and style of chapter 1. IN that chapter, Ridley builds the foundation for his ""one long argument"", if I may borrow from Darwin.His argument follows flawlessly, like a river undisturbed. The flow is both violent and calm. The strength lies in his effective method in strengthening his points. This mode of argumentation, does not just relies not on devious tricks of trade, but Ridley gives you a reason to believe him by amply supplying his arguments with the latest scientific results at the time of writing. The bevy of scientists he paints all join in together to form this dynamic, yet, important debate among themselves, and Ridley plays the part of mediator between the two in excellence - equally (for the most part) summarizing their points in quick, witty, and accessible form.Which becomes a problem. Ridley is rich with facts and examples, and to add strength to his arguments, he quickly dispenses with individual facts quickly to move to the next one. There are extremely interesting examples that he mentions but leaves in the dust all of a sudden to call up another point, which I think is unfortunate. The quality of his argument is already there, but I think Ridley wanted to up it all up by banking on quantity.This I feel is the book's greatest paradox. The premise of the debate regarding nurture against nature is paralleled with the choice between quantity and quality. It need not be one over the other. It should be one supplementing the other and vice versa, in an endless dialogue, which I feel, in Ridley's case, is lost in his crusade to marshal all the facts that he can in order to build his case by the sheer force of quantity. One need not to be agile in apportioning facts in order to illustrate the agility of genes."
19,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39395937-rhonda-sue,3,"Science changes all the time it seems. Here we're talking genes and the environment, not either or but both play a role in how we live and exist. Genes do more than we think and in ways which we're still learning about. There are lots of studies with animals and rodents to assist the science but it's not 100%. Many in the animal kingdom share similar genes but that doesn't explain why humans developed and chimps didn't. Genes have promoters that can be turned on or off. We also have more instincts than other animals. Men seek pretty younger women while women seek men with money. This seems to be universal. Galton in the 1860s - nature vs nurture debate. Twins were always studied. Claim that genes shape personality over family environment. It's a mix of both as it turns out.Lots of others were mentioned. William James, Jean Piaget, Konrad Lorenz, Harlow. There's a chapter on formative years and imprinting and one on learning lessons. Many pioneers are mentioned including Pavlov, Skinner, Freud, Lehrman. Early years are key re language skills. Pavlov and behaviorism. BF Skinner and classical conditioning- much of this stuff has been debunked. There's a chapter on the conundrums of culture. Boas & Durkheim are cited. Culture shapes human nature says one, and social forces shape human nature says another. Then we've got info on the 7 meanings of genes. DeVries, Mendal, Johannsen all borrowed from one another. Watson and Crick and DNA, Pauling, Jacob and Monod. In short, genes aren't fixed, they extract from the environment. So, genes are enablers, not gods, but cogs. Parents still matter. Peers help one find what they're good at. Kids do conform. Individuality is a product of aptitude reinforced by appetite. We need both nature and nurture, not one or the other. Science is still trying to figure us out. "
20,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19191609-jonathan-vazquez-perez,5,"Exploring nature v nurture was always an interesting topic and this book was great at making it clear that it's not that simple. In fact the more I learn about Science, (molecular biology in this case) I learn that any claim that any 1 gene is the cause of something in particular is an insult to the real complexity that is behind the working of things. So really it's not ever nature that is the complete driving force and it's not really just nurture either, so you see examples of how nature plays a strong role and you become convinced that everything comes down to heredity and genes and then you get an example of how development and nurture plays a huge role and you become convinced it's all in nurture. The truth lies in the middle? it seems like we tend to have an addiction as humans to seek out cause-effect truths and try to simplify the complexity of an issue with many working parts, when in reality how things work, not just in science but even in politics and other disciplines in life come down to having an eye for nuance and subtlety. Reality is more than just words on a book, it's more than just theory, so i'm really straying from the amazing biology findings the book talks about which are amazing... but my take home message for the book overall is that things are never as simple as they seem even if we try to box things in little catchy phrases, there is more to it than that. "
21,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76136236-mary-beth,3,"The Agile Gene is a well-researched, well-delivered and informative book about how our genes influence who we are. Matt Ridley recounts the historical steps of the nature vs nurture debates, showing the different experiments and discoveries that contributed significant information to our current knowledge about genetics and environment. He places the history and the facts into a relevant context for any reader, and he creates useful metaphors that make scientific concepts easier for us non-scientists to understand. In the end, Ridley turns “nature vs nurture” on its head with the idea of “nature VIA nurture” - i.e., our genes and our external influences work in correlation with each other to create the individual humans that we all are. I’m a fan of paradoxes and “both-and” mentalities, so I enjoyed that aspect of the book. As a “big idea” type of thinker, I sometimes found myself bogged down by the facts upon facts within this book. (Of course, in this context, it is necessary to write this way; this is part of why I will never be a scientist.) I was never exactly bored, but I was also not spellbound. If you have an interest in the topic, this is a useful, worthwhile, and enjoyable read, but it’s not the sort of book that will suck you in and make you suddenly care about a topic that you hadn’t been interested in before. "
22,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19578117-joe-bathelt,4,"In this book, acclaimed science writer Matt Ridley tackles the centuries-old debate about nature vs nurture. He skilful integrates perspectives from behavioural genetics, molecular biology, evolutionary theory, and developmental neuroscience to convince the reader that nature vs nurture is a false dichotomy. The book provides an accessible overview of the topic and provides a helpful historical context regarding the debate. It also addresses common misconceptions about the determinism of genes. I assume that many readers like me have heard or read much of the content already from the numerous documentaries or books on the topic. However, I still stuck with the book because it provides an extremely compelling narrative that draws all of the different strands of the topic expertly together. Matt Ridley is an extremely gifted writer how aptly uses analogies that make even seemingly dry topics come to life. These analogies also provide helpful hooks to remember the finer details of the debate and are helpful to clarify one’s thinking. I highly recommend the book to anyone with an interest in biology, psychology, or education. "
23,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82398182-rishabh-jain,4,"In this book, the author presents his case over the whole nature vs nurture debate, and gives his take on this discussion. The author catalogues the nature vs nurture debate progressively through various eras and scientific beliefs. He presents evidence for both sides across various scientific discoveries, and often contrasts them to highlight how each argument isn't conclusive enough by itself. The most detailed explanations were the ones involving the schizophrenia patients. He put forth 5 to 6 different and varying claims, each of which supported either nature alone, nurture alone, or neither of the two. Similar discussions were presented on various other subject matters. The author's explanations are concise and fact driven. His arguments are easy enough to follow, and yet strong enough to be given a good thought. His explanation works well with laymen. No special scientific background is assumed for a reader, and almost with a basic education anyone can follow this book. In short, this is a good book to get a feel of the whole nature vs nurture argument, and how, in the words of the author, neither alone is solely the reason for how we turned up to be."
24,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8002761-stephen,4,"Fairly nuanced, though likely dated, discussion on the role of genes in their causal relation to different types of behaviour. Discusses the implicit assumptions and socially fashionable ideas surrounding the long debate on nature/nurture (with genes proposed as relevant to both ""sides""), and the implications of these ideas. Considerable thought is put into how our conceptualization/use of ""genes"" relate to this discussion. Author makes a fairly convincing case for how nature/nurture are inherently tangled up via the role of genetic propensities and their interaction with the ""environment"" (i.e. social conditions/circumstances). One drawback of the book is that the writer sometimes goes into what seem like scientific minutiae (i.e. names of different promoters on genes in relation to one behaviour) and tangential lines of thought, which do not really contribute much to the narrative of the book or the arguments put forth. Readers of Steven Pinker's ""The Blank Slate"" will likely enjoy this book."

It’s the second time I’ve read it and somehow it doesn’t flow as well as in 2003. It goes without saying that genetics has advanced massively in twenty years, rendering this book dated. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . In summary: is [issue X] a product of nature (genetics) or nurture (learned behaviour)? Why, it’s a product of BOTH! Rinse and repeat.The language is excellent and the examples interesting, of which I am enjoying. However, in a new 2020 era of political correctness and general wokeness, some of the casual inferences of society jar - badly. A google search present Matt Ridley (to me) as a brilliant, aging, upper class British toff. I encourage you to make sweeping assumptions based on that information the same way Ridley makes sweeping assumptions of gay men. Enjoy this book for its penetrating analysis, time capsule presentation of naughties genetics and general science history but try not to let Ridley’s boomer-esque tone get to you."

He combines the works of prominent scientists from the past with recent scientific discoveries. His somewhat colloquial style is both positive and negative, it adds to readability but it distracts from scientific rigor. His explanation of scientific concepts is good, but he does not posit a unified theory to explain behavior. Instead he goes through several specific cases and describes the influences that genetics and environment have on them, sometimes generalizing the science to broader behaviors."

Its message - that genes act via environment and environment via genes in order to shape the organism - is as relevant now as it was when the book was first published in 2003, although a couple of the recent examples have been complicated by later research, I believe. But the basic argument of the book is as sound as ever. A good read which I can recommend."

It does provide nuances to arguments that are easily to be biased against or for it. The thing that is bad about this book for me is the biology lecture. I wasn't a fan of biology, so this book was a grind to get through but surprisingly pleasant at the end. It did help me appreciate biology more, which I am grateful for, and how it can be applied to the world and researches in psychology. This was a fun book"

And it doesn't seem so odd to say- well of course the content of a persons character falls into the 'nurture' category where health and 'instinct' fall into the nature category. But should you make these assumptions I can recommend a good book that will tear your assumptions to shreds. Probably... Anyway that book is this book.Matt Ridley has compiled a treasure trove of studies which blur any lines between the influences of nature and nurture, compelling you to acquiesce that ""experiments ... show genes to be the epitomes of sensitivity, the means by which creatures can be flexible, the very servants of experience"".Okay moving on, I did have a few issues with this book. I'm quite sure that before I read Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender I was sensitive to lazy scientific gender assumptions, but perhaps not to the degree I am after having read her book. What I am getting at is that although Ridley writes with scientific clarity, there are moments where he too seems to make assertions based on 'the obvious', not the scientific consensus. He makes a few comments about men and women that just bored me. I saved a few extracts of particular comments he makes that irk me slightly:In all 37 cultures, women wanted men older than them. In nearly all cultures, social status, ambition and industriousness in a mate mattered more to women than men. Men by contrast placed more emphasis on youth (in all cultures, men wanted younger women) and physical appearance (in all cultures, men wanted beautiful women more than women wanted beautiful men). In most cultures, men also placed slightly more emphasis on chastity and fidelity in their partners, while (of course) being much more likely to seek extramarital sex themselves.Well what a surprise! Men like pretty, young, faithful women, while women like rich, ambitious, older men.Oh women! Always digging that gold.Boys like David Reimer want to be boys. They like toys, weapons, competition and action better than dolls, romance, relationships and families.Because, ya know, dolls romance and relationships are like heroin to women. I'm actually balking at the memory of all the things I wasn't allowed to do as a little girl growing up, all the things I was discouraged from doing. But anyway let's end on a fun non gender related quote:... these features are necessary for the human skill of grasping, aiming and throwing a small rock- something that is beyond the capability of a chimpanzee, whose throwing consist of randomly aimed, underarm efforts.  In defense of the chimps, they are pretty damn accurate when they are lobbing faeces at zoo patrons.I thought I took more quotes than that, oh well. Happy reading."
45,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558430-toni-daugherty,4,"Our genes and the promoters that switch them are what determine many of our decisions and physical outcomes. The dominant theme of Ridley's book is that the human genome is not simply a blueprint that will determine what an animal ends up physically, but rather, a flexible entity that also affects the processes of daily life and choices. He argues that environment also plays a role, and the nature v. nurture debate is a ridiculous one, once one sees this. When one studies the effects of genes, promoters, proteins, neurons, it is hard to give dignity to a nature/nurture debate. A gene can be affected by its environment adding another layer to the outcome of an expressed gene. Ridley explains how propogating nerve cells are sensitive to the environment - allowing a switching off/on effect that determines the outcome of that cell or many outcomes. However, it is not a linear effect, but rather a circular one, with environment and heredity playing a role. This makes for a complicated understanding of the processes of the animal body and the brain.I thought it was especially interesting that once again the environment, in the development of children, which has the greatest effect on the outcomes of children is not the household or the parents. I've read this many times before and this idea is well explained in Steven Pinker's The Blank Slate, which offers explanations of how children's environments are their peers - not their parents. It must be then, that in situations where it seems their parents have a huge impact, that in fact, the parents have merely chosen to spend time with other parents just like them, whose children probably have the same values. In societies that are homogenous, it's expected that it will appear that the parents have a huge impact but it's probably the peers that are affecting other children's behavior.That is really a side note, however. Ridley's book is really about the agility of a gene and how there is a complex number of things affecting that gene at different times, and how it will respond differently and sometimes numerously. One cause is not one effect. One cause can be many effects."
46,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6404815-henri-h-m-l-inen,4,"The Agile Gene is book from Matt Ridley about genetics, evolution and how people are people. It starts form really early in first studies about human and behaviors. It tells a full journey to the latest genetics researches.The main question in the book is the long lasting debate on nature, meaning the DNA and inherited things and nurture, the things that environment effects on people. It goes trough studies from both sides and digs deep in to the main pillars of the both explanations.One by one it starts to get more obvious that there is no one explanation on this question. Nature plays it part on growing, but nurture also has a big effect on many things. The most surprising there is that genes actually work with environment to make things possible. So those are not only enablers or disablers, but can adjust to the environment.I have to admit the book was quite hard to follow sometimes. It went such deeply to some of the scientific subjects, that it would have required some more basic understanding of genetics to follow fully. Still mainly it was fun and interesting to read. Matt Ridley knows how to write in very interesting form.Reading the book I had to change my mind many times. On some points I was sure that genes are the main influencer of what we turn out to be, but then after some tens of pages I again thought that environment is the important thing. I can't remember a book that have mixed my head more during reading the book than this was. That said in a good way.I recommend this book to those who are interested on psychology, genetics or evolution. It requires interest towards those subject, otherways it becomes too technical to read. I enjoyed it a lot. It goes to the one of the best books I've read this year.This review was first posted to my blog - here"
47,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4275337-igor-korousic,3,"I've accepted the fact that nature combines with nurture to shape most things that constitute life. Matt repeats this like a communist parole in this book. Ok, i got that. But he has filled me up with so much information that i feel that i should read this book again and write down the essential stuff and then look at the extract and try to figure out the rules. Although i learned a lot from this book, i don't know much more about how nurture influences nature than i knew before i started reading it. Do people have it in their gens but need food, exercise, viruses, certain combination of axons etc. to get it out? I know that it's an extremely difficult question to answer and that neuroscience and genetics are still at the beginning. However, i found The Genome a much more inspiring and powerfull book and i'm a bit disappointed. Also, i've found certain claims confusing and somehow naive. For example: i can accept that very often it is not clear if happy children make a happy home or is the happy home that makes happy children. But there are so many homes where even the happiest child in the world couldn' bring happines when parents are fighting, cheating, drinking or drugging. I can't accept that giving a child a feeling of safety for example does not influence his adult life. So when i tried to find answers to such questions in this book i quickly got an answer: yes, of course nurture works with nature to produce an adult but although Matt gives a lot of quotes of other people, sometimes opposing quotes, he most often doesn't give his own explanations. Instead he repeats: nature via nurture"
48,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5912240-rob,4,"Basic question - were you born with your personality/talents, or are you the product of the environment in which you were raised? The author argues it's not a nature or nurture debate, but a combination. The book is a great refresher course on many classic experiments (Pavlov's dog, teaching fear in animals, imprinting parents onto newborns, etc). I found the chapters on human instincts, and whether they are taught or innate, the most fascinating. I found the theme of the book best expressed by the words spent on imagined utopias and failed communes. Both are examples of culture attempting to change hardwired human behavior. The former is possible only under totalitarian conditions. (The book ""Walden Two"" is cited as an example, which details a society in which, as one character describes it, ""members are practically always doing what they want to do - what they 'chose' to do - but we see to it that they will do precisely the things which are best for themselves and the community. Their behavior is determined, yet they are free."") If humans could be conditioned to behave as rulers demand, then at some point control would not be necessary. The idea of communilism is destroyed by the human need (instinct?) for individualism. To quote one paragraph, ""Usually this tension first develops over sex. It seems impossible to condition human beings to enjoy free love and abolish their desire to be both selective and possessive about sexual partners. You cannot even weaken this jealousy by rearing a new generation in a sharing culture: the jealous individualism actually gets worse in the children of the commune."""
49,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,4,"As much as I like books by Richard Dawkins and Steven Pinker, I find Matt Ridley's books more readable and entertaining and his arguments more compelling. I find his way of injecting his own humor and eccentricity into his writing charming.This book is an effective argument against the false dichotomy of nature versus nurture. Neither position is as deterministic as its opponents would have us believe. I like the numerous ""fancy that"" tales of how genes are affected by both nature and nurture, such as the mechanisms by which visual skills are formed.I think Ridley did a better job of arguing against blank slate dogma than Steven Pinker did in his book, The Blank Slate. The [mistaken] idea that we are all born exactly alike and that any differences between us must be cultural and social, not genetic (because if it's in our DNA it's deterministic and the inevitable results are racism, eugenics, and other evils), is buried so deeply in our culture's registry that we barely notice it. The nurturists, or empiricists, influenced by Freudian thinking, love to blame the parents or society, and they've done a lot of harm. It's not just in news items about violent criminals. I notice it all over popular culture. There's the film ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory,"" where the parents are shouldered with the responsibility for the obnoxious behavior of their children. And it's pretty clear who's to blame for a political assassination in the last verse of Peter Gabriel's song, ""Family Snapshot.""So if Ridley gives many examples in argument against this belief, it's understandable."
50,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1754224-david,4,"Ridley is quickly becoming one of my favorite science writers yet. The Agile Gene was a nice follow up to Genome, exploring the nature-nurture link more in depth. He does a wonderful job summarizing the latest (and not so latest) research findings in the field and painting a pretty accurate picture for the layman with great analogies.He gives a summary of the major 20th century trends in psychology: including the usual (mostly deserved) jabs at Freud (he also gives Freud credit for his emphasis on one’s upbringing – even if Freud got many of the particulars very wrong), to the dawn of the cognitive revolution from that dreadful behaviorism paradigm (he cites Harry Harlow's along with Martin Seligman/Steve Maier’s experiments), and up to present day and the debates between nativists and connectionists - and the beginning of evolutionary psychology.Some repeated material from Genome, but he does a wonderful job of asserting the false dichotomy of the nature-nurture debate, whereas Genome focused more on the human genome and the complexity of genes.In one sentence, Ridley manages to sum up the extremely tiresome parental determinism debate by reconciling the extremely polarized views (one extreme being the Freudians; the other extreme being the self-help gurus) on parental determinism: “Translated into human terms it would imply that some children can be virtually orphaned and are none the worse for it; others need to be very well nurtured to turn out normal – the difference lies in the genes.” (p. 255)"
51,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23706873-igor-faynshteyn,4,"Having read ""Genome"" by Matt Ridley (and liking it very much), I am somewhat disappointed in this book. Ridley's thesis is clear: he believes that the conflict between nature and nurture is a false one, because in fact nature is expressed and manifested through nurture and therefore there is no conflict, but rather only the interaction of the two. In going about to support his thesis, he demolishes many strawmen along the way. Ridley also appears to embrace demoloshing what is often regarded as common and obvious - in other words, folksy myths.Ultimately, as Ridely himself notes throughout the book, the conflict is really between free will and genetic determinism. This has traditionally been a philosophical issue. But as scientific methods, technology and tools have advanced, this issue is becoming more of a scientific one, with philosophical undertones in the background. If this is the ultimate issue, then Ridley does an inadequate job addressing it. To be sure, he does provide some cursory commentary on the issue, but nothing in depth. On the other hand, this is a popular science book and not a scholarly one. And in that sense, Ridley's fast-paced, witty and easily understandable and digestible prose fits the bill. However, if you are looking for a serious discussion of free will vs. determinism issue, this book at best serves as an introductory material to the topic."
52,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4497443-tom,4,"This book is successful at what it touts to do: Show how nature and nature are not opposed, but interact in exceedingly complex ways to produce our variable phenotypes. Yet, I probably would've been more impressed with the work had I read it five years ago. I was already familiar with just about every study Ridley discussed, and I was more than familiar with his thesis. But it's still a great book for reconciling the whole nature/nature divide.If I had to criticize it, I would say that he brushes over some very controversial points as settled, when a consensus even today (over 10 years later) is nowhere to be found. I did find some factual errors here and there, too, but nothing major. Some of the studies he does pass over with what seems like an uncritical eye, but, this being a popular work, I suppose giving the gist is enough. Certainly, moreover, it could have benefitted from the huge increase in genetic knowledge over the past decade (though one can hardly hold that against Ridley!). Oh, and toward the end he says he solves the problem of free will, but of course he doesn't do any such thing. "
53,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69168637-hannah,1,"Ridley paints himself as someone who supports a middle ground of both nature and nurture playing a role in our development, but too many times throughout the book he seems to neglect to mention sociological explanations for things he considers to be objectively true. For example, when he refers to differences between men and women - which he considers to be innate merely because of a survey done of what women and men consider in a partner - he never pauses to reflect on the differences between the ways in which men and women are raised, going so far as to explain away aggression performed by men as merely “biological” and a product of evolution rather than something which is fed by society. It’s frustrating because the book is an enjoyable read, but he never examines anything from an “emotional” perspective, which at times leaves the reader going “well, this may be true for ___ species of monkey, but human society is just ... different.” "
54,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20661114-selmoore-codfish,5,"This is essential reading for anyone interested in the debate of free will versus determinism. The author approaches the issue mostly from biological and psychological points of view, so he frames it in terms of nature and nurture.This book is very interdisciplinary. It covers areas of anthropology, sociology, biology, philosophy, and psychology. Also, it has implications for religion. The conclusions he reaches are drawn from all of those areas. He emphasizes how nature and nurture work together.The author makes many provocative statements which are expected because the subject challenges ideas about human development. For example, he has interesting interpretations of race, gender and privilege. I thought that he missed an important example of communal living which is found in family life. However, I am overlooking that small issue."
55,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67537648-erik,5,"Nature via Nurture is Matt Ridley's expert exploration of how genes guide our experience and growth and affect us through time, via nurture, while also being affected dynamically by our experiences. He takes the reader through a number of the most famous ""nature vs nurture"" debates and shows how each time the conflict is illusory: we cannot be something that's not in our genes but our genes cannot do their job if we are not nurtured through an appropriate set of experiences - and depending on the environment we are subjectef to, our genes will respond differently.Ridley is one of my favorite writers, writing clearly and entertainingly while packing his pages full of facts. This is one of his very best books. Very highly recommended."
56,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366087-randy,4,"More in-depth than other Ridley books I've read (and that makes it more satisfying somehow). In a nutshell, Ridley is discussing the nature vs. nurture argument: are organisms the product of their genes? or their upbringing? He spends a chapter examining the history of the argument from Plato through Darwin... then the rest of the book on the pendulum swings since Darwin.In short, he holds that the answer is ""Yes."" Genes help determine development, but are affected by events and chance.Lots of topline description of watershed research: twins studies, genetic marking and splicing, epidemiology. A very enjoyable read, up to Ridley's past standards."
57,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8216511-meghan-britz,4,"Excellent book. I paid 75 cents for a book that gives me unlimited knowledge. I'm extremely satisfied, and I'm craving to find more books like this.I would recommend it to anyone interested in biology, or simply just intrigued in the argument nature vs nurture. I was absolutely thrilled to find Ridley taking neither side (such a petty argument). But what I loved most about this book is the fact ANYONE could pick it up and understand.I'm excited to pick up more of his books, and find authors similar to his style of writing. I never ventured out before, so I'm excited to start a new chapter in genres. "
58,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22993072-naomi,3,"Parts of this were really interesting and I followed the explanations with ease. A good portion of the book was quite opinionated though and some bits were hard to follow, especially the molecular biology parts although that could just mean my brain isn't cut out for molecular biology. On the whole, I quite enjoyed it and was left with some new facts and ideas but I was also left with the impression that there is so much uncertainty and complications in behaviour genetics that there's almost no point writing a book about it. A good portion was dedicated to historical approaches to behaviour genetics and the nature / nurture debate and I found this quite interesting too. "
59,1841157465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82236298-graham,5,Wonderful inspiring book. Mat Ridley clearly and concisely explains the role nurture and nature and how they influence and mediate each other . I love this book . Read it.
