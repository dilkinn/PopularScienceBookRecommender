0,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I am convinced that theoretical physicists are the true mystics of our age. Being, on the whole, smart people, they have developed some useful tricks to reduce the occupational hazards of their calling; the most dangerous of these hazards is the ever-present possibility of being killed by an angry mob who object to having their normal view of the world unexpectedly turned upside-down. Mystics have always been in the habit of evading their pursuers by using language which is difficult for the uninitiated to understand, but modern physicists have taken the idea to a new level. The strategy has proven very successful, and it's become quite rare to see a physicist burned at the stake or forced to drink hemlock.Every now and then, however, a physicist gets a little careless. In this famous essay, Schrödinger only puts in a hundred-odd pages of cover, with hardly any equations at all, before coming out with the following passage:Let us see whether we cannot draw the correct, non-contradictory conclusion from the following two premises: (i) My body functions as a pure mechanism according to the Laws of Nature. (ii) Yet I know, by incontrovertible direct experience, that I am directing its motions, of which I foresee the effects, that may be fateful and all-important, in which case I feel and take full responsibility for them. The only possible inference from these two facts is, I think, that I – I in the widest meaning of the word, that is to say, every conscious mind that has ever said or felt 'I' - am the person, if any, who controls the 'motion of the atoms' according to the Laws of Nature. Within a cultural milieu (Kulturkreis) where certain conceptions (which once had or still have a wider meaning amongst other peoples) have been limited and specialized, it is daring to give to this conclusion the simple wording that it requires. In Christian terminology to say: 'Hence I am God Almighty' sounds both blasphemous and lunatic. But please disregard these connotations for the moment and consider whether the above inference is not the closest a biologist can get to proving also their God and immortality at one stroke. In itself, the insight is not new. The earliest records to my knowledge date back some 2,500 years or more. From the early great Upanishads the recognition ATHMAN = BRAHMAN upheld in (the personal self equals the omnipresent, all-comprehending eternal self) was in Indian thought considered, far from being blasphemous, to represent the quintessence of deepest insight into the happenings of the world. The striving of all the scholars of Vedanta was, after having learnt to pronounce with their lips, really to assimilate in their minds this grandest of all thoughts. Again, the mystics of many centuries, independently, yet in perfect harmony with each other (somewhat like the particles in an ideal gas) have described, each of them, the unique experience of his or her life in terms that can be condensed in the phrase: DEUS FACTUS SUM (I have become God). To Western ideology the thought has remained a stranger, in spite of Schopenhauer and others who stood for it and in spite of those true lovers who, as they look into each other's eyes, become aware that their thought and their joy are numerically one - not merely similar or identical; but they, as a rule, are emotionally too busy to indulge in clear thinking, in which respect they very much resemble the mystic."
1,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,4,"I love reading explanations of biology from physicists; what once were magic and collections of 'just-so' stories become explanations of how and why processes occur the way they do. This book was single-handedly responsible for convincing dozens of physicists to chase issues biological and given I already had the bug, I figured it would be interesting to see what sparked it in so many others.Here's the conversation that runs through my brain when I think about this book:The Children: Grandpa Schroedinger, Grandpa Schroedinger! Tell us about biology!Grandpa Schroedinger: Well, what do you want to know?TC: What's an organism?GS: An organism is a 4D pattern that consumes negative entropy to maintain order.TC: Huh?GS: It's something that's alive.TC: Oh. Why are organisms so much bigger than atoms?GS: Ho, ho, ho! If organisms were close to the size of atoms, life would be intolerable! We'd all be buffeted about by the quantum chaos and never have a chance at predicting our environment. Think about it: your sensory organs would be useless if all they could pick up was Brownian motion. That's one hell of a signal-to-noise problem! We have to be big so that life is more predictable.TC: How come we don't know how life works? If physicists are so smart, why haven't they figured out the genetic code yet?GS (grave face): You should learn not to run your mouth. But if you must ask, it's because physicists like things that are easy to study, such as the relatively simple and elegant structures produced by statistical mechanics. But statistical mechanics produces statistical structures - periodic crystals and such. Organic molecules are aperiodic and quite foreign to physicists. We shouldn't expect that our physical models will carry over so easily; in fact, 'it is well-nigh unthinkable that the laws and regularities thus discovered should happen to apply immediately to the behaviour of systems which do not exhibit the structure on which those laws and regularities were based.' Reductionism is hard. There are many steps on the ladder between physics and phenomena, each one possibly best describable in a completely different language.TC: I heard the biologists are going to discover DNA in 7 years, but I want to know now! How does it work?!GS: Well fortunately I'm a flippin' genius and probably one of the smartest grandpas in the world so I can tell you how this DNA stuff works seven years before anyone else will know. Here's the trick: it's an aperiodic crystal stored in your chromosomes.TC: But if it's so tiny, how do we fit the recipe for a whole human being in there?GS (pats child on head): Combinatorics, my boy! Combinatorics! If you have 25 letters and want to make a 25-letter word using just 5 different letters, you know how many words you can make? More than 62 trillion!TC: Wow... but if the DNA is so tiny, how does it remain stable? You told us that tiny things get buffeted about in the quantum storm!GS: Silly child! Quantum theory can save the day again! Since molecules are only stable in discrete quantum states, these aperiodic crystals will only be stable in certain patterns. They'll need a minimum amount of energy to pop out of place, kind of like a marble stuck in a thimble. You can poke it and flick it without knocking the marble out but if you smack it too hard, kapoot! That's why high temperatures and x-ray radiation are not particularly conducive to your health. They sometimes provide enough energy so that, kapoot!, your little aperiodic DNA crystals pop out of place and mutate!TC: Wait.. I look nothing like my mom and dad. How can I be just a copy of them?GS: Well, it turns out your DNA isn't perfectly stable. It's just instable enough that mutations can occur here and there. Think of it like an optimization problem: your DNA mutates just often enough to explore different design possibilities, but just rare enough that evolution can isolate the mutation responsible when we make a good or bad move. With too many changes at once, it's impossible to judge which were 'good' and which were 'bad', but with no changes at all, the whole world would be like one big personality-less fraternity. Either that or your parents adopted you.TC: Oh... [one child walks away from crowd with head down:] So we dip into the quantum storm just often enough to be helpful.. neat! How does every cell know how to follow the recipe? Is there a DNA dictator who tells everyone what to do?GS: Nope! Organisms are more democratic than that. Every cell gets a cloned copy of the recipe. It's a bit like a collection of local governments all based on the same constitution but that each make decisions based on local conditions.TC: Wow... you really are the smartest grandpa in the world!GS: Ho, ho, ho! [pats child on head again:] Yes, I know. Now, here; take this bratwurst and run along! I have to go solve the mysteries of dark matter and energy, explain consciousness, and prove P=NP."

Yea, yellow tastes the worst. No. Let me start again. Have you ever wondered what characteristics a thing must exhibit before it can be considered living? Then I’m about to persuade you to read this book by way of a tenuously connected piece of post-apocalyptic fiction, in which a pathogen, engineered by the military, has produced a giant race of war-platypi which now dominate the terrestrial biosphere. Here we will explore the ecology of humanity’s great nemesis in order to better conceptualize the issue:Against the better judgement of your peers, you decided that a massive collection of saccharine shoujo manga should occupy the principal volume of your cramped bunker, instead of additional grape nuts, canned peaches, throwing stars, sex toys, or SAS Survival Handbooks. Sounder minds expressed concern over your inventory, to which you replied: “The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct them to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently.” Your friends and family found this aphorism quite moving (or else baffling) and said no more. But now your provisions are scant. You’ve cried your body weight in unrequited loves. You’ve exacerbated your carpel tunnel from writing fan fiction and sketching seedy doujins when you should’ve been searching for other survivors. It’s time for a change. You kneel before the only spiritual paraphernalia you saw fit to place inside this sterile capsule. Issuing soft prayers first to the poster of George Carlin, who symbolizes courage and irreverence. Secondly to a large statue of the Kool-aid man, who represents raw power and disdain for artificial barriers. And lastly, a print of Dita Von Teese, at the pinnacle of her burlesque, bathing in a martini glass. Because you’re a tasteful bacchanalian pervert who has never gained much traction with deities of wisdom - so fuck ‘em. You take up the only weapon you allowed yourself, one that perfectly suits your diminutive physique - a ceremonial Zweihänder - and strap it to your back. The weight would be reassuring if not so crushing.(Nutrition) A war platypus consumes its surroundings indiscriminately to provide itself energy. Derelict shopping carts, shrubs, canned cheeseburgers, naked mole rats, and terrified people make for a complex macronutrient profile which provides the raw materials for metabolic function. Meanwhile you’re stomping around the foothills of Kentucky looking for dry land fish (morels), dragging that lodestone of a weapon behind you and cursing the complete bastard that swindled you into buying it by regaling you with obvious hyperbole surrounding the battle prowess of Teutonic Knights. You were vaguely aware that the mongols whooped the ever loving piss outta them. Why the hell didn’t you look into becoming proficient in horse archery?(Respiration) This is the way in which these weaponized varmints, through complex biochemical pathways, turn all that squirrel gravy into the petrol that powers their funny looking, but terrifyingly fast and destructively insatiable, kinda waddling, kinda scuttling, kinda rampaging locomotion. (Movement) Once, while digging up roots and tubers with that goddamn slab of metal you’ve been using as a walking stick, you saw one of those big bastards wild as piss off consuming an entire clutch of hypnotic toads. In sweaty fascination you observed the absolute maniac, in a fitful waller, carve hateful gashes into the earth, bend trees cock-eyed, crush a mule deer into paste, and render totally inoperable the ATV you’d boosted.(Sensitivity) As misfortune would have it, these organisms have been engineered to resist any chemical attempt to pacify their wanton violence, and as such, recover from tripping balls with horrifying alacrity. They’re also equipped with excellent visual acuity, an olfactory sense that would blast the hair off a grizzly’s ass, and (here’s something most people don’t know) electrolocation. Needless to say, all would-be Peeping Toms are inexorably shagged. (Excrement) Well, this is better left to the imagination. But, given the circumstances, I think it’s forgivable to have a malfunctioning of bladder and bowel. Briefly: this is necessary to get rid of waste that, if allowed to build up within cells, would poison and kill the organism.(Movement) You set outta there like a sex starved succubus fleeing long internment at a nunnery. Moving your gangling ass with a grace heretofore unseen thanks to a blistering shot of adrenaline. Screaming: “But what changes come upon the weary desert of our culture, so darkly described, when it is touched by the magic of Dionysus! A storm seizes everything decrepit, rotten, broken, stunted; shrouds it in a whirling red cloud of dust and carries it into the air like a vulture. In vain confusion we seek for all that has vanished; for what we see has risen as if from beneath the earth into the gold light, so full and green, so luxuriantly alive, immeasurable and filled with yearning. Tragedy sits in sublime rapture amidst this abundance of life, suffering and delight, listening to a far-off, melancholy song which-HELP ME DITA! This egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed colossus is gaining on me! Did you know it’s one of the few species of venomous mammal?! (Growth) And the male has a spur the size of a Clydesdale on it’s hind foot that’s capable of delivering a neurotoxin that instills in its victim a fatal desire for lasagna?! Which is a dreadful affliction to have in a world of scarcity!”Shouting fractured bits of zoological trivia and philosophy is a persistent nervous tic of yours.(Reproduction) You come to a clearing and find an enormous collection of eggs, and some haggard looking bastard shoveling out the contents of one. He pivots with nervous energy upon your arrival and exclaims:“That’s an incredible sword you’ve got there, lady! You get that at the trading post?! OH CHRIST YOU’VE LED IT STRAIGHT TO US!”Well, look, the book is nothing like this. But imagine everything I wrote, except more coherent and chocked full of penetrating insight from a brilliant physicist (who is arguably the father of all cat memes), speculating from atop the ramparts of the most fundamental of the sciences on matters of: 4D human centipedes consuming disorder and shitting out negative entropy. Diffusion. Quantum mechanical processes which might underlie biology. The likely “aperiodic” crystal structure of heredity (bear in mind this was written years in advance of Watson & Crick). The omnipresent second law of thermodynamics. And finally matters of determinism, freewill, and consciousness, which goes from zero to Deepak Chopra in half a heart beat.Learn the difference between a ceremonial sword and a functional one with this book!"
3,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"In 1943, a scientist, at one remove from the world of biology, gave a series of lectures in Dublin - called provocatively ‘What Is Life?’.Erwin Schrödinger, had shared the Nobel prize in physics in 1933 for laying the foundations of wave mechanics. In his Dublin lectures, Schrödinger addressed what puzzled many students — why biology was treated as a subject completely separate from physics and chemistry: frogs, fruit-flies and cells on one side, atoms and molecules, electricity and magnetism, on the other. The time had come, Schrödinger declared, to think of living organisms in terms of their molecular and atomic structure. There was no great divide between the living and non-living; they all obey the same laws of physics and chemistry.He put a physicist’s question to biology. If entropy is (according to the second law of thermodynamics) things falling apart, the natural disintegration of order into disorder, why don’t genes decay? Why are they instead passed intact from generation to generation?He gave his own answer. ‘Life’ is matter that is doing something. The technical term is metabolism — ‘eating, drinking, breathing, assimilating, replicating, avoiding entropy’. To Schrodinger, life could be defined as ‘negative entropy’ — something not falling into chaos and approaching ‘the dangerous state of maximum entropy, which is death’. Genes, he said, preserve their structure because the chromosome that carries them is an 'irregular crystal'. The arrangement of units within the crystal constitutes the hereditary code.The lectures were published as a book the following year, ready for physicists to read just as the war ended and they looked for new frontiers to explore. To this new breed, “What Is Life?” was the Uncle Tom’s Cabin of biology — a small book that started a revolution. For post-war physicists, suffering from professional malaise, Schrödinger showed a new way forward - ‘When one of the inventors of quantum mechanics could ask ‘‘What is life?’’, they were confronted with a fundamental problem worthy of their mettle.’ Biological problems could now be tackled with their own language, physics. The first half of the Twentieth-century science belonged to physics, with the general theory of relativity, quantum mechanics and nuclear fission. The second half would belong to biology."
4,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Can Physics account fully for the mysteries of Biology? This is what Schrödinger wants to know. He ends up writing something half-mystical, half-radical and fully-confusing, as Manny says in another review to this book. Now the beauty of any sufficiently confusing book by a good/great scientist is that it is capable of triggering inspiration many times over. These lectures which are mostly musings on a nascent new branch of science (genetics) in the light of another nascent new branch of science (quantum physics) inspired Haldane, Watson, Crick, Wilkins, etc. to take some of the greatest scientific leaps of the modern world. We shouldn't bet against it inspiring more even today - perhaps the next round of disciples will come from among the ones who pursue AI today? Just a hunch."
5,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32374363-khashayar-mohammadi,4,"A magnificent book that approaches philosophy with strong scientific knowledge. In today's world where Rockstar scientists not only shamelessly disregard philosophy, but speak of its irrelevance, this book plays an important role fusing together Science and philosophy.If you're a layman like me, do not worry since the book has been written to be understood by those with minimal scientific knowledge. Its a book meant to challenge your mind metaphysically and not arithmetically. Schrödinger explores the history of consciousness by delving deep into the history and behaviour of particles themselves.As a bonus, the last dozen pages are dedicated to a brief chronology of Schrödinger's life himself. I recommend this to every lover of philosophy."
6,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4686064-rajat-ubhaykar,4,"A naive physicist honestly ponders upon the mysteries of life, he just happens to be Erwin Schrodinger. However a word of warning, this book may be disconcerting to the truly naive physicist. Schrodinger admits the inability of physics to comprehend the living organism, the need for extra-physical laws to explain life as it is. However, he lays a groundwork based on existing physical laws to come to terms with life and going along his train of thought also happens to predict the existence of DNA years before its discovery. A scientific man's interpretations of the philosophical questions raised by the title was particularly interesting and insightful. His eventual turn to Indian philosophy for lucidity was effortless and apparently essential. However, what is particularly interesting is how his final question is not 'What is Life?', but 'What is this I?'. "

8,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"A well thought out paper by a brilliant physicist.Would have given it five stars, but it happened to be remedial for me, but it may be more informative to you, so check it out!It's sort of eerie to hear Schrodinger contemplate with fascination and wonder something so obvious today as the nature of the DNA molecule.He gets a lot of stuff right, considering he's going on very limited evidence.Sometimes he plays devil's advocate in too convincing a way, a befuddling habit.His conclusion, mainly regarding life as a processor of ""free energy"" or ""negative entropy"" is, along with being right on the money, respectably insightful for his time."
9,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"Schrodinger wrote “What is Life?” in 1944, just a few years before Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA's structure. Schrodinger, a physicist writing about the fundamental juncture between life and non-life, flirts with a quantum theory of biology where mutations behave in “jump-like” fashion. Moving through evolutionary time as whole units leads, he believes, to life's stability in the face of ever-present forces of entropy. At its core, because of this stability, life is an effective counter-force to the entropic pressures toward heat dissipation and disorder. Life, through its seeking and defending behavior, is able to stay alive, for awhile. Through the importation of external energy (“continually sucking orderliness from its environment,” life is able to avoid “the rapid decay into the inert state of 'equilibrium'” or heat death. In contrast to non-life, where order moves to disorder, life is able to draw upon order (“less complicated organic compounds which serve them as foodstuffs”) to maintain order. Schrodinger is clear, however, that the laws of physics remain in place. Life is able to maintain order for a time, but in death, life rejoins non-life's march to thermal equilibrium.In Mind and Matter, a series of lectures he gave in 1956, Schrodinger makes several hard to follow arguments that appear to blend physics, evolutionary theory and philosophy. One of his arguments is that “increasing mechanization and 'stupidization' of most manufacturing processes involve the serious danger of a general degeneration of our organ of intelligence.” This will lead the unintelligent man to settle down to “beget offspring,” which will lead to “a negative [evolutionary] selection as regards talents and gifts.” That seems elitist as well as Lamarckian. Schrodinger also gives a nod to the Upanishads that behind all diversity lies oneness. It's not clear why Schrodinger moves in this direction. It could be that he sees mind as spirit or god, and not of space and time. While mind might see some underlying oneness, in real time, as live matter and energy, we compete and kill as well as love and cooperate. "

12,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Erwin Schrödinger: The man and his visionThis is another great work of Erwin Schrodinger which gives an insight into the biology of life from a physicist's perspective that inspired scientists like; Francis Crick who discovered the structure of DNA, J.B.S. Haldane, and Roger Penrose. It is clear from this work and other books of Schrodinger that he was one of the few physicists who deeply thought of the inner most secrets of life. This book is divided into two parts: What's Life (7 chapters) and Mind and Matter (6 chapters). The physicist's most dreaded weapon, the mathematical deduction can not be used for life because it is too complex to be accessible to equations. The orderliness required for the preservation of life does not come by the random heat motions of atoms and molecules, but statistical averages that provide order. Schrodinger asks a simple question; why is life made of so many atoms and not just a few. He offers three examples; higher magnetic fields, increase in molecular population and the error introduced into a reaction rate constant or any other physical parameter would be far too great if only few molecules are involved to form life. Hence orderliness, and of course evolution and diversity of life, requires very large population of molecules. The world is a construct of our sensations, perceptions, memories; all existing objectively and all scientific knowledge is based on sense of perception and nonetheless the scientific views of material processes formed in this way lack all sensual qualities and can not account for the latter. Theories that are developed from scientific observations of experiments never account for sensual qualities. The sentient, percipient and thinking ego does not figure anywhere in our world picture, because it is itself the world picture. It is identified with the whole and not part of it. The physical world lacks all the sensual qualities that go to make the subject of cognizance. It is colorless, soundless, and impalpable. The world is deprived of everything that makes sense in its in relation to the consciously contemplating, perceiving, and feeling the subject; no personal god can form part of world model that has only became accessible at the cost of removing everything personal from it. God is missing from spacetime picture like sense of perception or ones own personality. Upanisads (Hindu Scripture) states that Atman = Brahman, the personal self equal the all comprehending eternal self. Consciousness never experienced in plural only in the singular, and plurality is merely a series of different aspect of one soul and one conscious produced by a deception (Maya). There is no multiplicity of minds; in reality and truth there is only one mind. Before and after is not a quality of the world we perceive but pertains to the perceiving mind and don't imply the notion of space and time. After relativity, the notion of before and after reside on the cause and effect relationship. The general directedness of all happenings is explained by the mechanical or statistical theory of heat. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that order changes to disorder but not disorder to order, and time travels in one direction from past to future, but not future to past. The statistical theory of time has a stronger bearing on the philosophy of time than theory of relativity. The latter presupposes unidirectional flow of time while statistical theory constructs from order of events. My body functions according to laws of nature, but I direct body motions. The word ""I"" means to state that I who control the motion of the atoms and molecules according to the Laws of Nature. The uncertainty principle and the lack of causal connection in nature introduce certain features into physical reality. For example, we can not make any factual statement about a physical system without interacting with it which would change the physical state of the system. This explains why no complete description of any physical object is ever possible. These laws have pushed the boundary between the subject and object. In fact subject and object are only one, and no barrier exists. It is the same element that goes to compose my mind and the world. The situation is the same for every mind and its world, in spite of the unfathomable abundance of cross references between them. The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. The last chapter gives brief autobiographical sketches of Schrodinger translated by his granddaughter. Schrödinger was deeply philosophical with strong family: He loved and respected his parents. His strong interest in physics and Vedanta philosophy (one of the six schools of Hindu Philosophy) is apparent, but he shy's away from writing about his complex personal life that involved many women and numerous extramarital affairs.

13,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,1,"Scientifically very out of date, often unclear and self-condradictory. Frequently descends into religio-metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. The autobiographical part completely superficial."
14,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,5,"Schrodinger is a Trump of biology – “What is Life” has famously polarized scientific community, and Schrodinger’s 1944 thoughts on what will eventually become molecular biology are considered to be both prescient in direction and wrong in details. For example, Watson and Crick openly credit their intellectual debt to Schrodinger’s insights, whereas Max Perutz quips that “what was true in his book was not original, and most of what was original was known not to be true”.Well, let me tell you one thing, it doesn’t really matter how you feel about significance and/or inaccuracy of “aperiodic crystal”, “hereditary code-script”, negative entropy, or doctrines of Upanishads. It also doesn’t matter that you can legitimately criticize Schrodinger for attempting to bridge physics and biology, while ignoring chemistry. What matters is that he attempted that bridge by sheer intuition, and you will walk away in awe after watching one of the most celebrated minds in physics intuit the framework of thinking about heredity and life from quantum mechanical principles, and then musing on its implications for determinism and consciousness. Note, this edition includes “What is Life?” and “Mind and Matter”, and both are short and tasty. Rest are notes to self. Physical laws are statistical, so how to explain stability of hereditary mechanism from physical principles, given the relatively small number of atoms involved. “Aperiodic crystal” comes in handy (he thought it to be protein, later it turns out to be nucleic acid of course, but qualitatively he was pretty damn close). Uses Delbruck’s model and argues from quantum energy state transitions to make a case for “jump-like” spontaneous mutations. So we have a structure stable enough to contain hereditary “code-script”, with enough (but not much) mutations to power natural selection. The energy configuration of the gene is stabilized by evolution such that natural frequency of rearrangement is orders of magnitude smaller than reproduction. (According to Perutz (1987), Schrodinger ignored experimental evidence available at the time, which invalidated some of his estimates, and showed alternative likelier mechanism for mutations)There is much more about energy jumps, negative entropy, extracting order from environment to avoid entropic decay, Lamarckism, dysgenics, and evolution but you’d better read it for yourself. Schrodinger is often credited with bringing QM into biology, but until I read him I wasn’t aware that he explicitly insists that quantum effects are not due to indeterminacy, but quantum energy state transitions. And that brings about some pretty radical thinking at the tail end of “What is Life?”. Ready? Schrodinger finds himself in a bind. He disposed of indeterminism (in context of life), and he has shown how life, heredity and his body follow deterministic physical laws. He also states that he has a “direct incontrovertible experience of directing own actions”, and taking responsibility for them. From this he is forced to conclude that it is him (“ I - in the widest meaning of the word”) who controls those atoms according to the Laws of Nature. As such he is effectively becoming “God” in Christian terminology, or “Athman/Brahman” in Vedanta and Upanishads. Naturally, he fully acknowledges the Christian interpretation as lunatic, but he is clearly quite sympathetic towards Upanishads and the idea that all subjective “I”s reflect some aspect of unitary objective experience. Crazy, man, I know… However, it is peculiar the Bohr was also sympathetic towards Vedic philosophy, so go figure – QM is puzzling indeed.There are many treats in “Mind and Matter” as well. He is hypothesizing about what we know today as NCCs (Neural Correlates of Consciousness), and consciousness as a necessary mechanism for an activity/skill to be learned and internalized. And today’s neuroscientists such as Ramachandran and Christof Koch make quite a big deal of this  “zombie” within. But what bothers Schrodinger the most is “qualia”, observer effect, and plurality of subjective conscious experience. He struggles with the paradox of having to reconcile objective reality independent of observation, with the model of reality we have in our minds, the model that by construction is based on subjective observation by that very mind. He blames our conundrum on the Greeks, and thinks that science payed too high of a price for taking out the subjective mind out of the objective world being investigated. (For my money, if anything, Descartes is more at fault for that particular predicament).And so, in the last lecture, he takes a broader sweep and connects Plato, Kant and Einstein as thinkers who contributed most significantly to freeing Western thinking from insistence on subject-object dichotomy. Then he brings in Boltzmann and implied time convention when describing thermodynamic irreversibility (“arrow of time” etc). And then he goes full Schopenhauer and drops plurality of conscious minds. Vedanta, here we come."
15,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"I read this almost 10 years ago and it was time to reread and think on it some more. This book consists of both What is Life and Mind and Matter. In What is Life, Schrödinger attempts to provide a new understanding of living organisms by using thermodynamics as a backdrop. Life seems so organized. If it were subject to the second law of thermodynamics, we would expect that molecules would decay to lower energy states. They do not. In fact they remain at higher energy states through the lifespan and one organisms seems to endow future generations with this ability to resist entropy as well. The unit if heredity that provides such an advantage is called an aperiodic crystal, later termed DNA.Schrödinger explained that life can resist entropy because of metabolism. An inanimate object cannot take in a nutrient source, such as photons of light that carry energy from the sun, but an animate object can take in nutrients and use the energy from the nutrients (photons, carbon, oxygen) to resist entropy. Thanks to Schrödinger, we were able to begin looking at life, and indeed evolution, through the thermodynamical lens. From this perspective, researchers have been able to measure the intake and output of cells and larger organisms and calculate that the amount of energy organisms release is overwhelmingly more than the reduced entropy their bodies maintains by being ordered. Adam Rutherford provides a wonderfully updated understanding of Schrödinger's ideas as well as later research on the thermodynamics of life. HIs book Creation is definitely worth reading if you want to know more about Schrödinger's ideas. Mind and Matter is more philosophical than What is Life. It focuses on ethics, how humans understand Darwinian evolution, and questions about religion. "

20,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57518342-krish-sanghvi,5,"This is one of those books which can give new ideas to anyone. No wonder Watson and crick discovered [plagiarised] the structure of DNA shortly after reading this book (causality? Maybe). A physicist explaining biology is what this book is about. The central premise of this book is the question ""can physics and chemistry account for all that happens in biology"". At first sight, one may say yes, because well, it has to! But then schrodinger come in and tells us how our answer is flawed and points out some really fundamental problems. One being size. Quantum mechanics is probabilistic, and atoms follow sheer statistics, and because our bodies are fundamentally atoms, this brings the dilemma of how building blocks that are purely statistical, can crate something so definitive, like life. His solution to this was life only being able to exist at sizes large enough, to turn statistics into more definitive and directional means, with a sample size of atoms large enough, to counter any quantum effects. This to me was a pretty profound idea, which pointed towards a fundamental hypothesis: can life exist only at a size which is at a specific ratio to its quantum building blocks? And hence, can the universe to only exist at a size which is at a specific ratio to its quantum building blocks? Schrodinger keeps switching between quantum mechanics and biochemistry/ mol bio, in the book, showing how one can be derived from the other, and the many parallels that exist between the two fields. Some other, epiphanies [maybe] crossed my mind while reading this book and I shall state them below. Many of them seem like untestable hypotheses, superfluous, or even unorthodox, and may even be inaccurate (but I'm not a biochemist or cosmologist, just a humble ecologist). I have a habit of underlining and writing in my books, but this book had a significantly higher number of markings. So here it goes: (some of these are new ideas and hypotheses, some are doubts and questions, and some are just statements of what I found revealing. I would love it if someone could provide some explanations for the questions/ doubts I have posed, and correct/ alter/ provide explanations for the hypotheses I propose). 1. Schrodinger speaks about how molecules diffuse from an area of higher to lower concentration because of sheer statistical probability and this makes us feel as if molecules are diffusing in a directional way, because molecules in the higher concentration part have a greater probability of diffusing to the lower concentration. This made me think whether the universe itself could be this way. That we think the universe is accelerating and expanding in all directions because it was concentrated at the beginning of time at the singularity, while other parts of the universe were deficient In the contents (particles, stars, everything that isn't vacuum) of the universe hence causing these contents to diffuse across and accelerate to those parts of the universeThis made me further wonder if the same thing could happen temporally.Because time is in itself a dimension, and the early universe was concentrated in one part of time which we call the past, maybe the universe is diffusing through time, into the future, where the universe is present in a lower concentration. So time exists in the universe completely as a dimension (with the past and future both existing simultaneously) but the future not having any contents because contents of the past universe haven't diffused till there. Also, because different parts of the universe would diffuse through time at different speeds, this hypothesis hence would also be able to incorporate special relativity (and maybe general) into it.2. Can a mechanism exist, in which chiasma formation exists in mitosis? This would allow asexual reproduction to produce more genetic variation than usual.3. Are there any genes that regulate chiasma formation? Genes which tell the chromosome where to break off/ cross over/ recombine? Do chromosomes have a preference or bias while chiasma formations?4. Are there genes for positive mutability? It has been often hypothesised that more good mutations happen that bad mutations, although the likelihood of a mutation being good is very less. Thus, is it possible that genes/ parts of genes, control mutations such that there is a bias towards producing beneficial mutations?5. There is good or bad, fitter or more adaptable in evolution. All of this is relative to the type of selection pressure.6. Are there any genes/ parts of genes that regulate mutability of a gene/ the genome? Some organisms are more mutable than others, same goes for genes. Are there any parts of a gene which control the rate at which it mutates? To add to this, I feel that 'selfishness' in a gene can be measured by measuring its mutability. The more selfish a gene is, the less mutable it would be, because mutating would make it lose its selfishness, which it has already evolved to have. The less a gene mutates, the more it would be able to replicate as itself, hence having a greater fitness than other genes, which mutate really rapidly. 7. Are all parts of a gene independent from each other? Do mutations in one part of a gene make the other part more or less mutable? 8. Can quantum jumps be either because of quanta using some sort of wormholes through higher spatial dimensions? 9. Just like molecules require a catalyst (enzyme) to help it cross transition states by reducing the activation energy, can some sort of particle (let's call it enzymeon) exist, which helps quanta of energy to jump (quantum leap) from one energy state to another? 10. Why do mutations in a gene create an allele of that gene instead of another gene altogether? Can sympatric speciation occur, when mutations in a gene causes a new gene, instead of an allele, to occur at that locus, hence making the genome of the two incompatible and leading to speciation?11. He states that mutations are similar to changes in energy states. This would require a release or input of energy to cause a mutation. Is there any specific amount of energy (quanta) required for a mutation to occur? This would allow us to predict when and where one would occur.12. Can atoms not form anything else, other than molecules? Can the constants and laws of the universe not form anything else, other than the universe? Can sub atomic particles not form anything else except atoms? And so on.13. Can silica act as an organic molecule in the earth's mantle?14. If life is a non entropic state, can death be called a highly entropic/ equilibrium state? Is this why organisms die? Because of a quantum tendency of things to reach equilibrium? Everything that an organism does increases the entropy within it, until it reaches a state of maximum entropy, which translates as death. I just don't understand the biochemical mechanism that would entail so.Organisms catabolise energy from the external environment, hence increasing the entropy outside, and anabolise themselves, to reduce entropy and prevent death. 15. Requirements for/ definition of life: needs to be able to replicate itself. Use energy to maintain a low entropy state within. Have some sort of mechanism/ phenotype for doing so. Have a code script which can replicate as well as associate with and organise metabolising phenotypes. Low entropy. variation? (Only then will it be subject to natural selection). And competition for more efficient use of energy. There's a lovely section on origin of life, entropy, heat, and sustenance of life, but I can't go into detail here, and that section by itself makes this book worth buying and reading. That to me, was also the most profound and interesting section of this book. I especially liked his take on identity, and the idea that identity is non plural. Although in the last chapter, he says that macroscopic events can be explained by quantum statistics, which I think they have to, I didn't find his examples very convincing. Of course, this book is a very serious read, and the only fun you'll have while reading is from intellectual delight. I've read some more technical books which have also been funny, this one isn't one of them. I guess schrodinger wasn't as much fun as his cat. The book also brings out Schrödinger's naivety as a physicist commenting on biology, when he makes statements like ""nature has succeeded in making such a subtle choice of threshold values, as in necessary to make a mutation rare"". Nature doesn't make choices, dear schrodinger. Or when he says that mutations can't be inherited. But all in all, anybody looking for some revelations and insights into some fundamental questions will find something of worth in this book. I haven't read mind and matter yet, which accompanies what is life in the edition I have, but I plan to read it soon.I also feel that these are the kinds of science books that people should read, rather than those by authors like fritjof Capra."
21,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,4,"This book, which examines the physical basis of life, forms a part of the same mid-twentieth century information revolution as Claude Shannon's information theory, Norbert Wiener's cybernetics and John von Neumann's automata theory. It first asks, why atoms are so small compared to a human, or alternatively, why humans are so large compared to an atom, and answers that in a much smaller being quantum randomness and atomic discreteness (the analog of shot noise in electronics) would destroy life-giving processes. This may be true; however, the order of magnitude of size of human beings is a product of contingent events in the history of life on Earth; it does not follow from the first principles. A snake kills its victims with toxins and digests them; so does a jellyfish despite being a much simpler organism - but the jellyfish has a highly specialized killer cell, a touch-sensing harpoon-firing cnidocyte, and the snake uses organs with billions of cells to achieve the same effect. Since we only have one example, we don't know how small or large a being has to be in order to write a book explaining, why its kind is so large compared to an atom. The book then discusses genetics, and hypothesizes that the material carrier of genetic information is ""probably a large protein molecule."" That it is in fact DNA only became the scientific consensus in the 1950s. It then speculates that the discreteness of genes follows from the discreteness of states in quantum mechanics; in fact, it follows from the discreteness of molecules in chemistry. The carrier of genetic information is indeed an ""aperiodic solid"", as Schrödinger calls it. The book asks, how life manages to maintain order and avoid thermodynamic breakdown; it answers correctly: by feeding upon ""negative entropy""; animals ingest and inhale more ordered matter than what they excrete and exhale; this is not in the book, but plants take in visible light and radiate away infrared light. The book doesn't mention another factor, natural selection; individuals whose genetic material has degraded more will be less fit than those for whom it has degraded less, and will be less likely to survive and reproduce. The last chapter tries to understand, how the orderliness of life can be reconciled with thermodynamics; non-equilibrium thermodynamics such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky chemical reaction hasn't been investigated when the book was written.This book is significant not only in itself, but in having served as an inspiration to both James Watson and Francis Crick, the co-discoverers of the molecular structure of DNA."
22,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575387-jonathan,3,"Erwin Schrodinger was an Austrian physicist, biologist, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics, Darwinist, author, and professor (this list merely scratches the surface). In this book, Schrodinger tackles the mystery of organic life. He discusses the application of universal physical laws on the organism, but points out that life has a way of working with its own rules as well.His explanation and application of the laws of thermodynamics and statistical order are accessible to the layperson. His grasp of molecular science is impressive considering DNA had not been discovered at the time he wrote.His essay, Mind and Matter, delves into the ageless questions about consciousness, experience, will, and memory. Interestingly, he approaches this scientific study with an Upanishadic mindset, pointing at a collective conscience, subjectivity of time, and inheritance of memory.Schrodinger's autobiographical bit at the end is rather incomplete. He unrepentantly acknowledges this fact. He begs off the question by saying a life can be rather boring and indicating that some parts would not go over well if he did share them. According to the brief research I performed, his life was far from boring. He opposed the Nazis and fled his country. He spent time with some of the great scientific minds and educational institutions of his time. He served in the military. His reluctance to record his romantic escapades probably would detract from the rest of his writings. I'll leave it at saying he had a very open relationship with his wife.Writing this brief review almost changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars. It probably deserves 4. I suspect I was personally put off by some of his metaphysical points and his claim that: ""no special laws of nature, such as vis viva, or an entelechy, or a force of orthogenesis, etc., were at work in living organisms to abrogate or to counteract the universal laws of inanimate matter. This bothers me, because he admits that life is more than the sum of chemical and physical exchanges, the mind is more than electrochemical impulses, and that laws like entropy don't seem to apply the same to organic life.I find it interesting that authors who deny God's hand in life often reinforce my conviction that the hand of God is in all things."
23,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3416358-adeyemi-ajao,5,"I wish I had 6 stars to give here...and to think that Schödinger is famous for ""his cat""! It is the first part of this book that has gotten most recognition over the years. Certainly, a framework for the rules of heredity, mutation and evolution that ultimately inspired Franklin, Watson and Crick to discover the double helix, deserves a lot of credit on its own. Moreover, Schödinger's intuition of statistical physics rules being unable to describe the processes of the chemistry & biology within the human body due to scale are absolutely brilliant and clearly the kernel for the current search for ""Quantum Processes in the brain"" spearheaded by Roger Penrose and others. Truly a stroke of genius intuition outside his field that, in my opinion, has not been fully assimilated by modern biochemists and neurologists and, I am afraid, will probably be the underlying failure of most modern approaches to human-level AI.But the second part of the book...I was blown away. I am partial to anything Spinoza so clearly biased here but I have to say that this is the best explanation to what ""human consciousness"" actually is that I have ever read, and it is interesting that it came from a Physicist! Schödinger goes from Spinoza to the second law of thermodynamics, from Plato to The Upanishads, From the collective unconscious to...God? And I feel Schödinger actually left a lot on the table. I feel he just implied, probably due to respect (or fear?) to the very religious Trinity College where he was conducting his lectures in exile. General Relativity had already been out for a couple of decades and Schödinger actually touches on the implications of the non-linearity of time for the ultimate nature of the ""all-mind"" and creation itself...but was he too afraid of the conclusion or just too wary of the consequences of revealing the ultimate nature of God? I guess, one day, I will be able to ask him :) "

28,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914661-jason-yang,5,"I've been meaning to pick up ""What is Life?"" for a few years now, but it wasn't until a chance conversation with a brilliant scientist in Israel that I pulled the trigger. Having now finished this work, I can really appreciate how Shrodinger influenced famous molecular biologists from the 20th century.The first comment I must offer is that this is probably my favorite book from all the ones I've read these past 12 months. That said, this book isn't for everybody.In this collection of writings, Shrodinger gives a (largely philosophical) perspective on using bottom-up reasoning to think about the basis of life. As a physicist, he touches on many themes - statistical reasoning in science, the scientific method, determinism vs. free will, molecular bases for evolution, the history of genetics, the human ethos. Taking a step back, it's remarkable how insightful Shrodinger's ideas (e.g., the existence of an 'aperiodic crystal' underlying the human genome) were, given the the technical and social limitations of his time.One of the most rewarding components of reading this book was feeling the experience of rekindling my curiosity in science. As a quantitative systems biologist, I've really taken for granted the foundation of reasoning laid out by our academic ancestors - and the challenges they faced in grasping whatever understanding they could with the tools and field-wide knowledge of the time. As a junior scientist, it really is inspiring. It's been a long time since I've remembered what it feels like to be a 'kid' in science.Unfortunately, Shrodinger's language and writing style probably has little appeal to non-scientists. But that should not at all diminish this work. I absolutely loved this and think anybody who is a true academic would really appreciate this."
29,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6968193-jake,5,"To roughly paraphrase Schrödinger, 'Life is a 4D pattern that imbibes negative entropy to retain order'. The first half of this book is an exploration of life through the lens of the different fields of physics. Starting off with Classical Mechanics Schrödinger is intensely pessimistic toward's the possible newtonian explanation for life. As he moves up through the eras, he doesn't become any more optimistic it must be said. When he gets to quantum mechanics, the statistical model of QM does a much better job at offering an explanation but it's still muddied.These lectures were originally give in the 40's/50's prior to the discovery of DNA, RNA, gene mapping, etc but that doesn't get in the way of Schrödinger's interpretation. The second half of this book delves into philosophy of the mind, and Schrödinger exposes that he's a huge fan of the eastern religious interpretation of the individual and lays it pretty hard on western point of view. I was not aware of this before reading it, and from what I hear it reminds me a lot of what I've read from Oppenheimer.Schrödinger, at one point, essentially predicts the structure of DNA. He also predicts the deterministic nature of small numbers of randomly acting atoms, order from disorder essentially. So much can be learned from the juxtaposition of different disciplines. Schrödinger had just enough distance from biology to adequately create abstractions needed to explore biology in new and exciting ways, and I highly recommend this book for that."
30,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77151581-shawn,3,"Definitely dated but obviously on the right path, this book combines biology, physics, and chemistry to try an answer the question of how if it's so small our genetic molecules defy natural law and act in a uniform manor. So step by step the the reader is hand held with all the complicated maths tucked away and only brought out when absolutely necessary to avoid that awfulness until at the end one is left with an interesting proposition: what kind of weird law defying miracle are made of? Life, for all of our understanding is a square peg in a round hole, it don't make no damn sense essentially. But we try valiantly to make sense of it... for reasons. SO after all the science stuff (which is actually nice refresher on the basics of human chemistry (the notable absence of DNA notwithstanding) we are given a short treatise on how this all affects us as conscious beings. Well my ears perked up at that. Could science be the path I need to follow to kill my arch nemesis the ego? Mr. Schrödinger seems to say to me the same thing a lot of authors have been saying to me lately...namely consciousness, the ego, is a diffusive thing not to be pinned down. He does however tease some theories on the fact that if we do have free will, that means we can manipulate individual atoms, making us walking gods when we make even the tiniest of decisions. But that's countered by the possibility that life is somewhat mechanical in nature and determinism rears its ugly head.I just don't know my dudes. But I will continue the noble pursuit."

I found ot very enlightening as shrodinger repeatedly approached mainstream issues with an unusual method. How do you distinguish life from death? Easy just use the second law of thermodynamics! What I found most interesting in this book is that shrodinger would repeatedly say stange things such as: The scientific approach does not reveal the human soul, collective consciousness is due to the existence of god, plato was a genius for having invented the theory of forms and even going so far as to quote from Jung and some persian mystics! And my first reaction is to shrug it off as pseudoscience or fiction but then I'd remember im reading a book to the greatest scientists in the modern age! If anyone has the right to declare the scientific approach inadequate it's him. I also find it admirable that although famous as physicist schrodinger was much more. He is a chemist, biologists, playboy and philosopher. A truly admirable man."

I can see why the field of molecular biology would be so fascinating to those who would come after, using Schrodinger's ""aperiodic crystal"" as their template for what to seek in their eventual discovery of DNA (another win for the predictive power of science).

Even then, I found some portions of the book a little difficult to comprehend. I think it is more to do with the sentence construction used in the book and not actually because of the complexity of the ideas conveyed. Complex ideas are explained in very simple manner, by using great analogies in various cases. In all, it is a great book which, I believe, should be made available to high school students when they actually learn these topics, albeit as different subjects. It will give them a perspective of how these subjects gel together in the real world to form science as we know it. "

But then, he argues that things are really not so different. I think this book, short though it is, may take another read before I can fully grasp what he was getting at.

42,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3070035-clio,3,"All I knew about Schrodinger before reading this was about his paradoxical cat.I found his writing style a little clunky - I kept getting thrown off when he'd introduce an idea, then say ""and now we can prove that is all haberdash and silly hats"" and then go on to say something that didn't sound any more provable to me than the idea he'd just dismissed. But he did reference a lot of other books that influenced his thoughts that I hadn't read. I think if I go back and read a bunch of that, then come back and read this again, I'd follow him better. He's part of a whole tradition of ideas so it's hard to just take out his ideas and read them out of context (at least if you aren't super comfortable with quantum physics and thinking in paradoxes).In What is Life?, Schrodinger discussed the type of physical laws that he thinks govern life and the difference between statistical laws that produce order from disorder and clockwork/pure mechanical laws that produced order from order. He referenced Max Planck a bunch in that section. He also starts to talk about the Upanishads (and Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy) and the weird paradoxes of consciousness as something like a soul that is tied to one body, a thing that you identify as your Self and think is an individual, thereby distinguishing yourself from other Selves in other bodies - from what I understood in this piece and Mind and Matter, he thinks consciousness can only be one thing and the multiplicity of consciousness we see in Western thought is sort of alike a mirage that arises from our inability to see where our own mind fits into our view of the world since we are using it (or pieces of it) to interpret the world. It has to simplify our world-view by taking itself out of the picture, so our picture is not complete. Schrodinger says ""consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing, produced by a deception (the Indian Maya); the same illusation is produced in a gallery of mirrors, and in the same way Gaurisankar and Mt Everest turned out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" So in the hall of mirrors, we don't know exactly what we are looking at and think we are looking at many different images when really we are seeing one image. From different viewpoints, we may see the same thing and imagine it is different things since it may look slightly different. Although his example here is actually wrong; per the American Geological Society, Gaurisankar and Mt Everest are ""different peaks, thirty-six miles apart,"" as determined in a 1903 survey (ending an approximately 50-year argument about whether they were the same peak). In the same vein, I'm not convinced Schrodinger is right about many of his opinions here, but I think the most interesting part is not necessarily the points he puts forward as solutions but the questions he is trying to answer.He says that we may see the ""I"" within ourselves as distinct and made up of our own individual experiences and memories, but he believes the part that is really ""I"" or the consciousness is not the set of experiences but the ""canvas upon which they are collected"" - if we view consciousness in this way, it is much easier to believe it could all be of one piece. He may not be entirely convincing on any of his points in this book, but I do think he did a good job of dismissing some of the logic that would certainly bar his ideas from being true, so that you can see the things he purports could be true.Schrodinger's ideas on ethics are interesting too; he believes man is subject to a constant ethical evolution along with biological evolution, and that for Man (and each man) there is sort of a battle between the primitive will and our evolving ethical ideals, so that to be ethical we have to be ""self-conquering,"" ""chisel and statue, conquerors and conquered at the same time."" Back on the subject of the mind not really being able to see itself in its concept of the world, he quotes the hell out of Sir Charles Sherrington's Man on His Nature, which he is in love with. ""The mind per se cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand. Then the impasse meets us, the blank of the 'how' of mind, leverage on matter."" - he wonders whether we are the truly the ""doers"" of the deeds for which we feel responsible. Then he goes off on a bunch of tangents about how you can't ""see"" the mind anywhere but that we often think we see it behind someone's eyes, that we often see eyes as more active than the passive sense organs they truly are. Last night I fell asleep wondering if blind people think their minds live behind their eyes, so I guess it is an interesting question. People with different senses may use different symbols. The mind is not truly there in our heads, he reminds us: ""Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held against the life and the emotions of the soul.""He goes on another interesting tangent about how our senses work and how our brain sort of has sub-brains and their data is somehow integrated which is another source of those dang duality mirages he is always thinking about. And I started thinking about split-brain patient studies and what those and similar psychological studies say about consciousness - are we describing the inputs and behavior of the body after the fact? I remember learning in high school that researches could manipulate people's behavior and then they would try to convince themselves they had done things for certain reasons after the fact. I think I could easily fall into an internet black hole on those topics, whoa nelly. Then he starts talking about whether time and space dimensions are a property our mind applies to the world so that we can understand it or whether they are an innate property of the world - but to Schrodinger, what is the difference between what our mind tells us it sees of the world and the world itself? So for him, it doesn't matter whether the self applies these dimensions or not, but he thinks the interesting idea is that there are aspects of the ""one thing - mind or world -"" that ""may well be capable of other forms of appearance that we cannot grasp and that do not imply the notions of space and time"" - this makes a bit more space for the idea that there can be some aspect of consciousness that is not tied down by problems of ""before"" and ""after"" for its containing body. It doesn't make it any easier to conceptualize, since we can't really understand what something like that would look like, but it takes some of the finality out of the conclusions I always find myself trapped in. What is certainty when we take out dimensions, after all? (Oof I don't take enough drugs for this book.)Anyway, the questions he's thought through in this book (these lectures, I suppose) are interesting and worth thinking about if you don't mind lying awake in the dark at night. I think sometimes I have so much I want to read that I get afraid of this ambiguous thing called ""wasting time"" and so sometimes I read when I should be taking a thinking break instead. If you're always on intake mode you're never stirring those ideas around. This book made me want to stop and think, even if I didn't see where he was coming from with some of his answers.The short autobiographical section at the end was interesting to me for his description of a time of upheaval in Austria (the end of an empire, the entrance of cars, Nazis), and also for his light touches on seeing St Elmo's Fire, the phosphorescence of the sea, and jellyfish. Ah, the mysteries of the world! He also points out that the way his school did half-days gave him a lot of time to think and to study further the things he was really interested in (and to learn from his father, who he got to spend a lot of time with)."
43,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"This book was written by Schrödinger, one of the most influential physicists to ever live, making important contributions to quantum theory. His equation (Schrödinger equation), calculates the wave function of a system and how it changes across time. This work was based on public lectures from Trinity College in 1943. It's mostly concerned with biology, although it has considerable tangents. he wanted to know how life related to physics and chemistry. It starts by showing why life seems to be so big when compared to atoms. We have around 30 trillion cells. And each cell has an average of 100 trillion atoms. He argues that at small scales, reality is too chaotic to have order. Quantum chaos fluctuations prevent steady natural laws. As a system gets better, such noise gets smaller and smaller. In further chapters, he touches on hereditary, evolution, molecules, entropy and more.Some of it was truly groundbreaking. At the time, how hereditary information was passed was unknown. He made a theoretical prediction that an ""aperiodic crystal"" would store the information required for living things to pass their ""blueprint"" of how the molecules should be organized. This inspired the later discovery of DNA. He was truly a brilliant mind and it was very enjoyable to read his work. I particularly enjoyed his humility and willingness to describe his thought process. The book was written for the layman audience, and he succeeded in doing so. You don't need any background to read, although at times it was nevertheless difficult. Luckily regarding biology and hereditary, I had some previous knowledge that helped, but the few times that he went into mathematical theorems, I was completely lost. The latter part of the book was my favorite. While I enjoyed the rest, it was a times too sciency for my taste. Towards the end it left more technical subjects related to biology and physics and was more concerned with philosophy, especially as it relates to consciousness. What strikes me the most is how well aware he was of the body/mind problem, despite him a physicist. He certainly wasn't blind to a materialistic worldview, and he easily articulates many of its problems when trying to account for consciousness. Some of it I found not the best argued super well, for example when he touched on free will. But his description of qualia, for example, was incredibly well written. He even got a bit mystical at times, which took me completely by surprise, and mentioned the Upanishads (a religious/philosophical text from Hinduism) influenced by Schopenhauer and Huxley's perennial philosophy. He considered a possible ""unified consciousness"", in which each individual experience was only a fraction of the conscious universe, but nevertheless united. It's a brilliant book. The title of it couldn't be more fitting. If you wonder what life is, how can it persist through the marching and endless entropy, or what distinguishes something living from something that is dead, then Schrödinger will walk you through his genius and explain it. A journey through biology, physics, and philosophy from one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century."

It’s a beautiful walk, especially during autumn, when the golden leaves envelop the black tar of the road. At the junction, stands a tall brick coloured building with Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath written in bold, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies - DIAS. The Irish home of the Nobel prize winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger.Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies was established by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, in 1940 to “provide facilities for the furtherance of advanced study and the conduct of research in specialised branches of knowledge”. There are three schools that form the institute - School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic studies. DIAS is arguably best known for hosting the lecture series “What is Life?”, delivered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1943.Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939, Schrödinger had been invited by Éamon de Valera, to help establish the institute. He moved to Clontarf and he lived there until 1955. The lectures were converted into a book titled ‘What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell’ for the layperson.Erwin Schrödinger was a theoretical physicist whose contributions to quantum theory were unparalleled at the time. He is best known for his rather paradoxical thought experiment, involving a cat that is dead and alive at the same time. Famously known as Schrödinger’s cat, this continues to be featured in discussions regarding application of quantum mechanics to everyday objects.But what is little known about Schrödinger is his interest and knowledge of genetics and biology. He was curious about the nature of the cell and what constituted life. In the public lecture series, What is Life, Schrödinger explores these concepts and does so in the language of the lay person. The book was published based on the lecture series in 1944.Schrödinger explores the idea of the cell and of life from the perspective of a physicist. He modestly apologizes to the biologists, time and again, for not considering the biological aspects or constraints while presenting a few of his ideas.What is Life: The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell reads like a science textbook. It begins with a detailed explanation about the significance of large number of atoms coming together and how they form working components in our bodies. He enunciates the idea of cell division better than how I can remember from high school biology. The book then takes on how the concepts of thermodynamics and crystal structures shape cell behavior. And he ends it with his own musings on determinism and free will. If free will exists. What does one mean by ‘I’ and the philosophy of identity.The lecture and the subsequent publication of the book had tremendous impact on understanding the genetic aspects of the DNA. "
45,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8122302-neko,4,"(Quite a lengthy review i wrote in English class) This book has served as a source of inspiration for many scientists, especially biologists converted from the field of physics. Despite being written in the 1940's, before the discovery of DNA, it isn't hard to understand why this piece was influential. Shrödinger's modest perspective, philosophical insights and a tone so humble as making every sentence appear meticulously crafted, is not something found in typical popular-science literature. Known for being his only publication for a lay audience, ""What is Life?"" is an attempt by Schrödinger, not mainly to educate; but to inspire. It is divided into 3 parts, the first containing descriptions of basic physical principles as well as the foundation of living organisms. The second part is a more speculative and abstract presentation of the author's views of life, reality and epistemology. This edition of the book finishes with a 3:rd part entitled ""autobiographical sketches"", which -as suggested by its title- contains information about Schrödinger's own life.Let me begin by discussing the first part by briefly stating that the scope of this review is far too limited to expand on all the interesting tangential thoughts raised be the book. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to pick out some of the most pertinent topics.To emphasize the modesty of his approach, Shrödinger calls himself a naive physicist and starts by challenging the anthropocentric nature of both scientific and philosphical questions. An example is the question ""why are atoms so small?"", which can be contrasted with ""why are human sensory organs not re fined enough to perceive them?"". The latter question is both easier to explain by science (evolutionary adaptation and structure of bio-molecules etc.) and less naive. Indeed, the first question seems rather meaningless and impossible to answer with a scientific approach (as ""why?"" questions in general tend to be). An important point to consider (one that is often overlooked) is the limits of science. Schrödinger addresses this by pointing out the approximate, statistical nature of physical laws; they may be accurate enough to measure the distance to the sun, but the more decimal-places you have, the more uncertain the numbers become. On the smallest of scales, our measurements become inaccurate. But we can nevertheless determine the statistically significant outcomes by testing multiple times. Yet, since our time is also limited (death, more important occupations etc.), the constrains are at both ends of the spectrum; the infinitesimally small and the infinitely large.Although a more pragmatic approach is adopted by physicists (""what matters is what works"", to paraphrase Richard Feynman), it is both interesting and humbling to think about our limitations.Schrödinger also extends his discussion by including biology, and a comparison between quantum jumps (sudden leaps by sub-atomic particles between discrete energy-levels of an atom) with random mutations in the genome. (At this point, I'm not sure if he means that the former is a likely cause for genetic mutations, of it's merely an analogy).Another comparison he makes, is likening aperiodic crystals with chromosomes, both being of an asymmetrical form. I think the intention here is to point to the 'uniqueness' of the fundamental parts that make up a live organism; if we were made from periodic crystals, there would be no basis for diversity on which natural selection could work.But there is also another part of this discussion which, somewhat ironically concerns the stability of the hereditary substance. Despite changing through evolutionary time, the material of our genomes is relatively stable (undergoes only small changes in each generation). On this matter, the author insinuates a physical explanation based on discrete energy levels of molecules, to account for their relatively stable nature.After taking the reader through a rather lengthy discussion (which the previous passages of this review attempted to outline), Shrödinger states his main reason for writing this piece. By merging concepts from his formal occupation, physics, with biochemistry, he leaves open the possibility that yet unknown ""laws of nature"" exist on the biological level.I am not at all clear with what he meant by that, but my speculation is that he was (like many others) puzzled by the apparent fact that living organisms evade the second law of thermodynamics.But the confusion is likely a remnant of a simplistic view without considerations that bodies indeed do produce a net increase in entropy by emitting heat to their environment. Another point he leaves as food for thought, is that ""no detailed information about the functioning of the genetic mechanism can emerge from a description of its structure"". Maybe the laws of physics and chemistry leave something unexplained after all?What follows next is a sketch of opinions on issues that philosophers have been trying to answer for centuries. Although Schrödinger approaches these from his own standpoint, not biased be an occupational background in philosophy or heavy jargon. Central to the questions pondered is that of free will vs. determinism, where the author tries to draw a conclusion from the premises that;i) every living body is subject to the laws of nature, andii) one has the experience of being in control and responsible for one's actions.With inspiration from Schopenhauer and the Upanishads, he describes the ""singularity of consciousness"", which probably seems quite self-evident to any reader of his words, yet still manages to serve as reminder that you are alive and able to interact with the world (at least that's the feeling i got when reading it).It is important to note that the ""singularity of consciousness"" does not mean that there exists only one mind, and that everyone else are only ideas within that mind (solipsism). What Schrödinger meant (if i've read him correctly) is that [i]experience[/i] is always singular, i.s no one has exactly the same experience as someone else, even if the situation in which they find themselves is identical.Through further philosophical rambling, the author reaches the conclusion that the ""barrier"" between a perceiving subject and the object being perceived is and illusion. Although his writing cannot be blamed for being obscure, every time i close the book, my sense of understanding of this seems to disappear. However, there is a strong parallel to the idea that a scientist (by conducting experiments, measuring things, etc.) assumes the hypothesis of an objective world, independent of observation.This may not seem very shocking, but contemporary discoveries and theoretical advances in physics (in which Schrödinger played an important art), introduced a paradox to this fundamental assumption. The implications were basically that features of subatomic particles were dependent on measurement in such a way that if one thing was known, another was by default uncertain.This could possibly be what led Schrödinger to say that the boundary between subject and object is illusory.The last part of the book contains brief autobiographical notes of Schrödinger's life at university, the people he met, and some friendly comments toward family members, especially apologetic to his deceased parents. A little surprising, yet understandable, was the exclusion of personal achievements, (such as the wave-equation and further work on quantum mechanics) and anecdotes about experiences for which he is well-known.I have to conclude with the confession that my mpression of this influential character has shifted after reading What is Life?. Mostly, i think, because of his highly polite and formal attitude, which is quite a rare feature among physicist-authors."
46,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2708448-thomas-herzog,4,"What is Life? ★★★★★Based on a series of lectures Schrödinger gave at a point in time when much was already known about the hereditary substance (i.e.: it is the carrier of hereditary information; it is contained in the chromosomes; it is extremely durable and can be copied perfectly, yet allows for mutations to occur; etc.), but what physical form this substance actually takes was still unknown. Many years before the encoding of DNA and its double-helix structure were eventually discovered, Schrödinger muses on a possible physical structure for encoding the hereditary information, this, he speculates, aperiodic crystal. His analogy with morse code (how ""simple"" codes can encode tremendous amounts of information; see also, obviously: binary coding and the digital age) nicely anticipates the rather simple four-base encoding of DNA, and his remarks on the importance of quantum mechanical rules at the scale of the hereditary substance (whose approximate size was already known) were illuminating, as was his summary of life being something that feeds on low entropy to keep its own entropy from constantly increasing (as things are wont to do).Mind and Matter ★★★Schrödinger's speculations about the interplay of mind and matter. Some interesting thoughts, but all in all too unfocused and unconvincing.But some of you, I am sure, will call this mysticism.As, indeed, do I."

I think ""what is life"" should be separate from ""mind and matter"" as they are largely complete each on their own. While ""what is life"", containing a theoretical account - or prediction - of what is to be expected as the fundamental building blocks of life, is fascinating, I found the ideas in ""mind and matter"" even more thought-provoking and relevant (unsurprisingly so given that DNA has been discovering shortly after the initial publishing and found its way into common knowledge). "
50,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,5,"On ""What is Life?"":One of the most thought-provoking books I've read on the physiochemical basis of life. The book's based on a series of lectures Shrodinger delivered at the Institute for Advance Studies at Trinity College, Dublin in 1943. Shrodinger was writing before the discovery of the structure of DNA ten years later by Watson and Crick, so he is unaware of the gene-bearing nature of DNA. Nevertheless, he is able to deduce with near-perfect precision the kind of molecule that the ""heredity substance"" must be. Above all, it must be a large ""aperiodic solid"" or molecule, capable of an almost miraculous stability, yet also susceptible to small-scale mutations. The virtual permanence of the molecule (the fact that DNA is copied from generation to generation with near-perfect accuracy accounts for the sameness uniting parental organisms with their offspring; the fact that mutations can occur accounts for the difference between living organisms. Such is the DNA molecule. What is it, ultimately, that separates life from inanimate matter? For Shrodinger, it's life's ability to evade the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all closed systems tend toward the disorder and diffusion of energy (i.e., the entropy law). Life feeds on orderly structures, exporting disorderliness out into the universe. Life is that which works against entropy.Shrodinger was a quantum physicist. He was intensely aware of the disturbingly haphazard and random (within circumscribed limits) movement of atomic and subatomic particles. He helped develop the quantum mechanics atomic physicists still use to understand the nature of matter and reality and the very smallest scales. And it's the following paradox that motivated him to write this book: If individual atoms are subject to the haphazard laws of quantum mechanics, and if the heredity substance (the genetic ""code-script,"" as he says) is made up of a tiny number of these atoms, why isn't its molecular structure (a structure that must be EXTREMELY well-ordered in order to preserve genetic information across time) subject to the destructive randomness of quantum forces? In other words, given the randomness of individual atoms, why isn't the hereditary molecule (constituted entirely of atoms) subject to potentially destructive quantum randomness. What initially makes this especially baffling to Shrodinger is the fact that the smaller in scale you go (the more you narrow in on matter), the more disorderly atomic interactions become. If the heredity substance is necessarily tiny, in other words, shouldn't it theoretically be subject to the haphazard movements of quantum physics?It turns our that it shouldn't. Shrodinger resolves his paradox by pointing out that the individual atoms in larger molecules are bound by intensely powerful co-valent bonds, so that, even if atomic activity is disorderly, molecules bind disorderly atoms into orderly conglomerates, which are almost solid-like in their regularity. (Quantum randomness DOES affect the molecular structure, in Shrodinger's view, but only extremely rarely when an ""isomeric transition threshold"" is crossed); it's this stability at the molecular level that makes heredity information or trait-encoding genes possible, which in turn makes life possible. In sum: Shrodinger's main purpose in writing this book is to reconcile the randomness of quantum mechanics with the orderliness of biology. I'm not qualified to comment on the originality of this book, or its effectiveness in legitimizing or ""quantizing"" biology. But he certainly helped bring ""biophysics"" to the fore in the early '50s, inspiring a new generation of scientists, including but not limited to Watson and Crick.""We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it. I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true who aim be lost for ever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them - and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.""- Shrodinger, ""What is Life?"" On ""Mind and Matter"":On ""Autobiographical Sketches"":Told in the manner of an elderly man who sets out to write his life story only to stop midway, realizing that he didn't have the narrative capacities to do it justice or the boldness to reveal some of its more private phases (his ""relations with women""). This, I suppose, will always remain behind the curtain more or less. Though the sketches are dry and incomplete, I appreciate Shrodinger's mustering the wherewithal to follow through on at least a brief picture of his life. He hates chronological biographical accounts but is unable to offer anything more innovative or subtle. No worries, Shrodinger! These were still a pleasure to read."
51,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,5,"I've come across this essay multiple times in the past couple months and each time I'd resolved to read it. 3 months+ isn't so bad. This is the sort of work I wish I had the ambition and seriousness to pick over all the popular nonfiction garbage I stuff my brain with. An actual genius with original ideas communicating them beautifully in the sort of science-loving idea-centric natural-poeticism that we seem to have lost after Feynman. It's not easy to read, the ideas are in their nascent stages and still speculative, the codescript for the idea of a codescript, incomplete, in many places incorrect, and without the closure of a well-planned structural flow that today's nonfiction book would lay out in its development of a topic. In that sense it's more like high quality fiction, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or the sci-fi greats, it demands effort and it rewards attention with layers upon layers of truth, not simply facts but truth, insight into not just reality but the nature of our insight into reality, not just about scientific concepts but the concept of a scientific concept. It's only fitting therefore that it ends with the most meta concept we know, consciousness, itself an infinite recursion since the word itself automatically means the consciousness of consciousness, and so on. The density of ideas and the brevity of their exposition is breathtaking. The epilogue on consciousness alone says everything it needs to say, a book's worth of words in the hands of a less intelligent or more egoistic author, in the space of a few paragraphs. It is possible that's what sets lectures apart from books, they are condensed versions of books worth of learning, a dense representation of the knowledge on offer, to be looked up in detail later. It is more likely that's what sets apart old school geniuses like Schrodinger. I got to the end of the book and was convinced I'd received some spurious abridged cliffnotes copy, I'm so used to ideas being overexplained and developed far beyond the point of maximal marginal returns on exposition. I'm so used to a certain trajectory of information and a certain average ex post facto recce of the total new knowledge received over the hours spent, that when a piece of work like this shows up that totally trounces all benchmarks on these variables, I'm convinced that I've missed a whole lot of empty hours that contribute nothing other than bring down the trajectory to acceptable levels. NotesAnswering deep questions with simple examples (size of atoms and problem of relativity: king who made his arm-length the official distance). As complex as periodic crystals are, aperiodic crystals are that much more, like a patterned wallpaper vs a Raphael tapestry with a divine order unifying zero repetition. Hence organic chemistry (aperiodic crystals) has contributed more to the problem of life than physics (periodic crystals)Atom is 1/5000-1/2000 wavelength of yellow light. Significant because grain of light is smallest thing visible in microscope, so even this has millions of atoms. Trapped by our frame of reference: ‘why are atoms so small’ is really asking ‘why is ratio of us to atoms so large’. What we call thought needs a) orderliness b) interactions with external world (perception) that are also orderly. Need to follow physical laws. But atoms are probabilistic and chaotic, it is from this need for statistical order out of chaos that our order of reality is so vastly above atomic sizeParamagnetism: Boltzmann/Gibb showed Oxygen dipoles get magnetized by field, but why does magnetization double when field is doubled? It is a statistical phenomenon, countered by heat-motion that randomizes atoms and field creating just a slight tendency to prefer acute angle towards field such that over statistical sample, there is alignment. Langevin’s idea of heat entropy vs order, so if temperature is reduced, then magnetization is higher. When temp is close to minimum, then increasing field doesn’t have as high impact on magnetization, close to saturation. Brownian motion: upper layer of droplets slowly sinks with mathematical precision of specific gravity, viscosity, but individual droplets are totally unpredictable, small enough to be impacted by molecular impacts. Bacteria similarly are at the mercy of heat-motion etc. Diffusion: While concentration of 2 substances equalize (movement of molecules from high to low conc) by exact partial differential equation, this is just an approximation. In reality, individual molecules are engaging in random walk, and since in high-conc more are randomly walking, it will follow that in general there is a flow towards the low-conc. Maxwell’s Demon.Square root law of standard error: Error is proportional to inverse square root of sample size N. So sample 100 has 1/10 error, 10%. Sample 1000000 has 1/1000 error. Power of exponential growth of mitosis: Current me is only the 50/60th descendent of single cell egg-me! Mitosis creates 2 copies of each set of chromosomes. But some cells are set aside, reserved to become sex-cells, don’t mitosis much, and just before they’re needed, undergo meiosis, where daughter cells get only 1 copy of chromosomes (haploid), fusing during sex to create a diploid zygote. How my father’s spermatozoa split chromosome during meiosis will define my paternal inheritance of either grandmother or grandfather. But not that simple, because there is frequent crossover. Genes that are far from each other on the strand have higher chance of being crossed over because intersection point lies between them. Studying difference between haploid/diploid can tell us relative positioning of genes coding for a property.How big is a gene? Take physical size of chromosome, establish how many features it codes for, divide, get maximum size of gene (because keep discovering new features, it’s a start point). Turns out to be a cube with edge ~300Angstrom. So a gene is not more than a million or so genes. Not large enough to entail lawful behavior. How marvelous that in a genome you get a 4-dimensional picture not just of an individual, but the development/permanence of that individual in time, across generations!Dangerous mutations usually lurk in background as recessive because don’t do too much damage this way, if dominant they get selected out. That’s why the argument ‘our blood is awesome, we should interbreed’ doesn’t work, the good traits are on the surface and the bad ones are lurking.Need ceteris-paribus conditions to allow good mutations to prove themselves and take root, that’s why mutations are so rare.Most things follow diminishing return curves, true proportionality is rare and remarkable. Radiation causing mutation is proportional, ie first dose and 2nd dose are totally independent. Exact condition is that an ionization just 10 atoms away from the gamete can cause a mutation. It can be passed on to next generation without affecting current individualEnergy states are quantum, not continuous. Start at lowest energy state, absolute zero. Supply heat, increase probability that it jumps. Measured by ‘time of expectation’, how long it takes to jump. This is defined by W/kT (W=energy gap, kT is heat energy of temp T). Strangely exponential relationship. W/kT=30, time is 1/10s. At 60, it is 30,000 years!Statistical theories of heat are full of exponential function, because so highly improbable for certain energy state to be attained randomly. Nernst’s Heat Theorem, 3rd law of thermodynamics, that entropy tends to zero as temperature reaches absolute zero. Remove heat from system and reduce randomness effect. Even at room temperature, the effect of entropy is minimal on chemical reactions. If physics underlies biological phenomena, how to account for free will? One inference is to say I control the physics. I am God. Atman, Brahman.It neatly solves problem of plurality of consciousness that Western philosophy has been trying. Descartes - I exist, single consciousness. Same of everyone else. How to reconcile? 1. It dies with the body, this is intolerable. 2. There is an indivisible eternal soul, in realm of forms. Same as saying plurality is different aspects of single, Maya. "

For it is in relation to the statistical point of view that the structure of the vital parts of living organisms differs so entirely from that of any piece of matter that we physicists and chemists have ever handled physically in our laboratories or mentally at our writing desks the most essential part of a living cell the chromosome fibre may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. In physics we have dealt hitherto only with periodic crystals. To a humble physicist's mind, these are very interesting and complicated objects; they constitute one of the most fascinating and complex material structures by which inanimate nature puzzles his wits. Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal, they are rather plain and dull. Organic chemistry, indeed, in investigating more and more complicated molecules, has come very much nearer to that 'aperiodic crystal' which, in my opinion, is the material carrier of life. And therefore it is small wonder that the organic chemist has already made large and important contributions to the problem of life, whereas the physicist has made next to noneWe now recognize this fundamental law of physics to be just the natural tendency of things to approach the chaotic state (the same tendency that the books of a library or the piles of papers and manuscripts on a writing desk display) unless we obviate it. Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness ( = fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment. that we give off heat is not accidental, but essential. For this is precisely the manner in which we dispose of the surplus entropy we continually produce in our physical life process MIGUEL DE UNAMUNO (quoted from conversation) If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually never says anything at all. from all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics. all physical laws are based on statistics. the interesting statistical type of law, controlling large-scale events, is constituted from the 'dynamical' laws supposed to govern the small-scale events, the interaction of the single atoms and molecules. Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Even in the pathological cases of split consciousness or double personality the two persons alternate, they are never manifest simultaneously Yet each of us has the indisputable impression that the sum total of his own experience and memory forms a unit, quite distinct from that of any other person. He refers to it as 'I'. What is this 'I'? If you analyse it closely you will, I think, find that it is just a little bit more than a collection of single data (experiences and memories), namely the canvas upon which they are collected. And you will, on close introspection, find that what you really mean by 'I' is that ground-stuff upon which they are collected"""

54,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25570776-pi,4,"Reading some of the great minds of the 20th century, of whom Erwin Schrodinger is without a doubt one, is such a treat! You feel getting to know the author personally, with all his kinks and quirks; and Schrodinger has those aplenty: from his excessively high self-esteem, to his not-so-scientific mysticism regarding consciousness. But although this little book has been immensely prescient in predicting the discovery and structure of DNA, referred to by Schrodinger as a type of aperiodic crystal, it has also paved the way for what has been called the central dogma of molecular biology: the idea that information can only pass from DNA to RNA to proteins - never the other way around. This idea, however, has been discredited in recent decades by the amassed evidence to the contrary. Basically, Schrodinger is wrong in saying that physics is ""order from disorder"", but life is somehow different in that it is ""order from order"". Actually, according to our most recent scientific theories, life should also be viewed as (mostly) order from disorder, for it is driven by stochasticity on the micro level all the same. (Anyone interested in reading more on these and similar issues with the gene-centered Neo-Darwinian view on evolution, and the essence of life, I refer to the following recent books: Dance to the Tune of Life: Biological Relativity and The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.)What really makes What is Life?, as well as other writings from science and philosophy, worth a read, however, is not their impact on science and philosophy per se, but their influence on popular culture and literature. For instance, when I was recently reading Wetware by Rudy Rucker, I couldn't fail to notice some of the parallels with Schrodinger's work; especially Rucker's character Berenice discussing the difference in entropy production between different 'bopper' bodies. I might be wrong with this parallel, but I'm pretty sure many sci-fi authors, including Rudy Rucker, have read What is life? and it has influenced their thinking a great deal. In any case, I truly believe reading science and philosophy can significantly bolster your experience when reading anything else, especially sci-fi. So why not go for it?"
55,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65278991-aadeshnpn,4,Not easy to read but totally worth it. Found new perspective about what is life.
56,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"What I expected:Source, CC-BY-NC 2.5What I got:""What is Life?"" is a surprisingly humble take on the problems biology had in the 1940s. Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology)."
57,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"Schrödinger was a very well respected physicist, who gave us a new language to describe the behaviour of the quantum realm. It is thus with skepticism that one might approach a book (essay?) like this, applying quantum theory to biology. But throughout the book what comes through heavily is Schrödinger’s humility – which is a rare character for physicists when discussing biology. Nevertheless, his application of physics-based reasoning manages to justify some facts of biology and populate new ones. As an example, he starts with the somewhat odd question “why is the human body so much bigger than an atom” to expound core points such as whether physics can hope to quantify the behaviour of living systems.Perhaps the most surprising thing is that he actually does provide an answer to the book’s eponymous question: what is life? It is something that consumes negative entropy (i.e order) to stave off it’s own inevitable decay into disorder. In his words, all living things have: an astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos by 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environmentThat is basically saying that we consume food (highly ordered arrangements of molecules) and output it as heat (disorder), in the mean time maintaining our relatively ordered state. This is a wonderfully original perspective, but one that anyone can see to be sensible and according with the facts. On a side note, after reading this I had to read Asimov’s The Last Question again… The second law of thermodynamics is haunting."
58,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10663319-michael-kenning,4,"One thing that I did not realise about this book is that it actually contains three different books: What is Life?, Mind and Matter, and Autobiographical sketches. The first book, What is Life?, gives the reader a very basic understanding of genetics. It is precisely the hereditary substance and the nature of mutation in the genetic substance that encouraged the discovery of the double helix in DNA. It is a most essential read; and despite the fact that it was written by a physicist, it portrays Schrödinger's keen interest and understanding of biological functions—and the incorporation of his own physical knowledge.The second book goes through the consideration of mind and its role in evolution—how the mind may contribute to our (what I consider) continual progression as a species. Although, it is suggested that, like crocodiles and many insects, we have reached, not the peak of evolution (which would imply that we are the best kind of thing—not true), but a sort of plateau which means that we no longer require adjustment; mutations still occur, however. It considers the effects of mind on our various sensual apparatus, and how the memes which are passed down from generation to generation will reflect our capability to survive—what he called a 'feigned Lamarckism'. The considerations are truly inspiring.The autobiographical sketches, although somewhat insightful, contain nothing of interest. It shall only reveal to the reader the process by which Erwin Schrödinger became a scientist, which isn't very interesting; as Schrödinger said himself: 'I am not good at telling stories'."
59,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31677006-kaio,4,"These are personal notes that did not fit into the appropriate section.Interesting initial chapters on why most laws are only statistical in nature and describe things in good approximation only because of the sheer number of single ""things"" that behave according to exact laws. That extrapolation to human senses also intesting.I did not get everything on the genetics chapters, as I have not studied it in a long time, and did not bother to look it up.Very interesting idea about how life has to ""feed"" on ""negative entropy"" as he calls it, because life is constantly producing entropy (disorder) in the processes to keep it alive (metabolism) and this excess entropy has to be shed or transferred into matter or enegy (it is not that well explained) that is in a state of lower entropy. There is a necessary correlation between the ingested energy and ingested negative entropy that is not explained in the book. I need to look deeper into this.The chapters on deducing the nature of the genetic material I mostly glanced over though he seems to have made pivotal statements which somewhat led to the discovery of the DNA structure. The epilogue on consciousness, the actual reason I read this book, is much less precise logically. I came onto this book because it was stated somewhere else something along the lines of: ""One of the fathers of quantum physics tries to reduce the last bastions of human ignorance to physics, suggests it to be possible for the mechanisms of life, but claims it impossible in the case of consciousnees"".Did not add much to my understanding of the Philosophy of Mind.All in all an interesting read."
60,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77151581-shawn,3,"Definitely dated but obviously on the right path, this book combines biology, physics, and chemistry to try an answer the question of how if it's so small our genetic molecules defy natural law and act in a uniform manor. So step by step the the reader is hand held with all the complicated maths tucked away and only brought out when absolutely necessary to avoid that awfulness until at the end one is left with an interesting proposition: what kind of weird law defying miracle are made of? Life, for all of our understanding is a square peg in a round hole, it don't make no damn sense essentially. But we try valiantly to make sense of it... for reasons. SO after all the science stuff (which is actually nice refresher on the basics of human chemistry (the notable absence of DNA notwithstanding) we are given a short treatise on how this all affects us as conscious beings. Well my ears perked up at that. Could science be the path I need to follow to kill my arch nemesis the ego? Mr. Schrödinger seems to say to me the same thing a lot of authors have been saying to me lately...namely consciousness, the ego, is a diffusive thing not to be pinned down. He does however tease some theories on the fact that if we do have free will, that means we can manipulate individual atoms, making us walking gods when we make even the tiniest of decisions. But that's countered by the possibility that life is somewhat mechanical in nature and determinism rears its ugly head.I just don't know my dudes. But I will continue the noble pursuit."

I found ot very enlightening as shrodinger repeatedly approached mainstream issues with an unusual method. How do you distinguish life from death? Easy just use the second law of thermodynamics! What I found most interesting in this book is that shrodinger would repeatedly say stange things such as: The scientific approach does not reveal the human soul, collective consciousness is due to the existence of god, plato was a genius for having invented the theory of forms and even going so far as to quote from Jung and some persian mystics! And my first reaction is to shrug it off as pseudoscience or fiction but then I'd remember im reading a book to the greatest scientists in the modern age! If anyone has the right to declare the scientific approach inadequate it's him. I also find it admirable that although famous as physicist schrodinger was much more. He is a chemist, biologists, playboy and philosopher. A truly admirable man."

I can see why the field of molecular biology would be so fascinating to those who would come after, using Schrodinger's ""aperiodic crystal"" as their template for what to seek in their eventual discovery of DNA (another win for the predictive power of science).

Even then, I found some portions of the book a little difficult to comprehend. I think it is more to do with the sentence construction used in the book and not actually because of the complexity of the ideas conveyed. Complex ideas are explained in very simple manner, by using great analogies in various cases. In all, it is a great book which, I believe, should be made available to high school students when they actually learn these topics, albeit as different subjects. It will give them a perspective of how these subjects gel together in the real world to form science as we know it. "

But then, he argues that things are really not so different. I think this book, short though it is, may take another read before I can fully grasp what he was getting at.

71,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74129681-nemantro,5,"When a physicist talks about biology , the DNA becomes a ""aperiodic crystal"", mutation is all about Quantum leaps, evolution is a bunch of isomers,.. and Life is a matter of entropy and order."
72,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3070035-clio,3,"All I knew about Schrodinger before reading this was about his paradoxical cat.I found his writing style a little clunky - I kept getting thrown off when he'd introduce an idea, then say ""and now we can prove that is all haberdash and silly hats"" and then go on to say something that didn't sound any more provable to me than the idea he'd just dismissed. But he did reference a lot of other books that influenced his thoughts that I hadn't read. I think if I go back and read a bunch of that, then come back and read this again, I'd follow him better. He's part of a whole tradition of ideas so it's hard to just take out his ideas and read them out of context (at least if you aren't super comfortable with quantum physics and thinking in paradoxes).In What is Life?, Schrodinger discussed the type of physical laws that he thinks govern life and the difference between statistical laws that produce order from disorder and clockwork/pure mechanical laws that produced order from order. He referenced Max Planck a bunch in that section. He also starts to talk about the Upanishads (and Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy) and the weird paradoxes of consciousness as something like a soul that is tied to one body, a thing that you identify as your Self and think is an individual, thereby distinguishing yourself from other Selves in other bodies - from what I understood in this piece and Mind and Matter, he thinks consciousness can only be one thing and the multiplicity of consciousness we see in Western thought is sort of alike a mirage that arises from our inability to see where our own mind fits into our view of the world since we are using it (or pieces of it) to interpret the world. It has to simplify our world-view by taking itself out of the picture, so our picture is not complete. Schrodinger says ""consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing, produced by a deception (the Indian Maya); the same illusation is produced in a gallery of mirrors, and in the same way Gaurisankar and Mt Everest turned out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" So in the hall of mirrors, we don't know exactly what we are looking at and think we are looking at many different images when really we are seeing one image. From different viewpoints, we may see the same thing and imagine it is different things since it may look slightly different. Although his example here is actually wrong; per the American Geological Society, Gaurisankar and Mt Everest are ""different peaks, thirty-six miles apart,"" as determined in a 1903 survey (ending an approximately 50-year argument about whether they were the same peak). In the same vein, I'm not convinced Schrodinger is right about many of his opinions here, but I think the most interesting part is not necessarily the points he puts forward as solutions but the questions he is trying to answer.He says that we may see the ""I"" within ourselves as distinct and made up of our own individual experiences and memories, but he believes the part that is really ""I"" or the consciousness is not the set of experiences but the ""canvas upon which they are collected"" - if we view consciousness in this way, it is much easier to believe it could all be of one piece. He may not be entirely convincing on any of his points in this book, but I do think he did a good job of dismissing some of the logic that would certainly bar his ideas from being true, so that you can see the things he purports could be true.Schrodinger's ideas on ethics are interesting too; he believes man is subject to a constant ethical evolution along with biological evolution, and that for Man (and each man) there is sort of a battle between the primitive will and our evolving ethical ideals, so that to be ethical we have to be ""self-conquering,"" ""chisel and statue, conquerors and conquered at the same time."" Back on the subject of the mind not really being able to see itself in its concept of the world, he quotes the hell out of Sir Charles Sherrington's Man on His Nature, which he is in love with. ""The mind per se cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand. Then the impasse meets us, the blank of the 'how' of mind, leverage on matter."" - he wonders whether we are the truly the ""doers"" of the deeds for which we feel responsible. Then he goes off on a bunch of tangents about how you can't ""see"" the mind anywhere but that we often think we see it behind someone's eyes, that we often see eyes as more active than the passive sense organs they truly are. Last night I fell asleep wondering if blind people think their minds live behind their eyes, so I guess it is an interesting question. People with different senses may use different symbols. The mind is not truly there in our heads, he reminds us: ""Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held against the life and the emotions of the soul.""He goes on another interesting tangent about how our senses work and how our brain sort of has sub-brains and their data is somehow integrated which is another source of those dang duality mirages he is always thinking about. And I started thinking about split-brain patient studies and what those and similar psychological studies say about consciousness - are we describing the inputs and behavior of the body after the fact? I remember learning in high school that researches could manipulate people's behavior and then they would try to convince themselves they had done things for certain reasons after the fact. I think I could easily fall into an internet black hole on those topics, whoa nelly. Then he starts talking about whether time and space dimensions are a property our mind applies to the world so that we can understand it or whether they are an innate property of the world - but to Schrodinger, what is the difference between what our mind tells us it sees of the world and the world itself? So for him, it doesn't matter whether the self applies these dimensions or not, but he thinks the interesting idea is that there are aspects of the ""one thing - mind or world -"" that ""may well be capable of other forms of appearance that we cannot grasp and that do not imply the notions of space and time"" - this makes a bit more space for the idea that there can be some aspect of consciousness that is not tied down by problems of ""before"" and ""after"" for its containing body. It doesn't make it any easier to conceptualize, since we can't really understand what something like that would look like, but it takes some of the finality out of the conclusions I always find myself trapped in. What is certainty when we take out dimensions, after all? (Oof I don't take enough drugs for this book.)Anyway, the questions he's thought through in this book (these lectures, I suppose) are interesting and worth thinking about if you don't mind lying awake in the dark at night. I think sometimes I have so much I want to read that I get afraid of this ambiguous thing called ""wasting time"" and so sometimes I read when I should be taking a thinking break instead. If you're always on intake mode you're never stirring those ideas around. This book made me want to stop and think, even if I didn't see where he was coming from with some of his answers.The short autobiographical section at the end was interesting to me for his description of a time of upheaval in Austria (the end of an empire, the entrance of cars, Nazis), and also for his light touches on seeing St Elmo's Fire, the phosphorescence of the sea, and jellyfish. Ah, the mysteries of the world! He also points out that the way his school did half-days gave him a lot of time to think and to study further the things he was really interested in (and to learn from his father, who he got to spend a lot of time with)."
73,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"This book was written by Schrödinger, one of the most influential physicists to ever live, making important contributions to quantum theory. His equation (Schrödinger equation), calculates the wave function of a system and how it changes across time. This work was based on public lectures from Trinity College in 1943. It's mostly concerned with biology, although it has considerable tangents. he wanted to know how life related to physics and chemistry. It starts by showing why life seems to be so big when compared to atoms. We have around 30 trillion cells. And each cell has an average of 100 trillion atoms. He argues that at small scales, reality is too chaotic to have order. Quantum chaos fluctuations prevent steady natural laws. As a system gets better, such noise gets smaller and smaller. In further chapters, he touches on hereditary, evolution, molecules, entropy and more.Some of it was truly groundbreaking. At the time, how hereditary information was passed was unknown. He made a theoretical prediction that an ""aperiodic crystal"" would store the information required for living things to pass their ""blueprint"" of how the molecules should be organized. This inspired the later discovery of DNA. He was truly a brilliant mind and it was very enjoyable to read his work. I particularly enjoyed his humility and willingness to describe his thought process. The book was written for the layman audience, and he succeeded in doing so. You don't need any background to read, although at times it was nevertheless difficult. Luckily regarding biology and hereditary, I had some previous knowledge that helped, but the few times that he went into mathematical theorems, I was completely lost. The latter part of the book was my favorite. While I enjoyed the rest, it was a times too sciency for my taste. Towards the end it left more technical subjects related to biology and physics and was more concerned with philosophy, especially as it relates to consciousness. What strikes me the most is how well aware he was of the body/mind problem, despite him a physicist. He certainly wasn't blind to a materialistic worldview, and he easily articulates many of its problems when trying to account for consciousness. Some of it I found not the best argued super well, for example when he touched on free will. But his description of qualia, for example, was incredibly well written. He even got a bit mystical at times, which took me completely by surprise, and mentioned the Upanishads (a religious/philosophical text from Hinduism) influenced by Schopenhauer and Huxley's perennial philosophy. He considered a possible ""unified consciousness"", in which each individual experience was only a fraction of the conscious universe, but nevertheless united. It's a brilliant book. The title of it couldn't be more fitting. If you wonder what life is, how can it persist through the marching and endless entropy, or what distinguishes something living from something that is dead, then Schrödinger will walk you through his genius and explain it. A journey through biology, physics, and philosophy from one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century."

It’s a beautiful walk, especially during autumn, when the golden leaves envelop the black tar of the road. At the junction, stands a tall brick coloured building with Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath written in bold, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies - DIAS. The Irish home of the Nobel prize winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger.Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies was established by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, in 1940 to “provide facilities for the furtherance of advanced study and the conduct of research in specialised branches of knowledge”. There are three schools that form the institute - School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic studies. DIAS is arguably best known for hosting the lecture series “What is Life?”, delivered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1943.Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939, Schrödinger had been invited by Éamon de Valera, to help establish the institute. He moved to Clontarf and he lived there until 1955. The lectures were converted into a book titled ‘What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell’ for the layperson.Erwin Schrödinger was a theoretical physicist whose contributions to quantum theory were unparalleled at the time. He is best known for his rather paradoxical thought experiment, involving a cat that is dead and alive at the same time. Famously known as Schrödinger’s cat, this continues to be featured in discussions regarding application of quantum mechanics to everyday objects.But what is little known about Schrödinger is his interest and knowledge of genetics and biology. He was curious about the nature of the cell and what constituted life. In the public lecture series, What is Life, Schrödinger explores these concepts and does so in the language of the lay person. The book was published based on the lecture series in 1944.Schrödinger explores the idea of the cell and of life from the perspective of a physicist. He modestly apologizes to the biologists, time and again, for not considering the biological aspects or constraints while presenting a few of his ideas.What is Life: The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell reads like a science textbook. It begins with a detailed explanation about the significance of large number of atoms coming together and how they form working components in our bodies. He enunciates the idea of cell division better than how I can remember from high school biology. The book then takes on how the concepts of thermodynamics and crystal structures shape cell behavior. And he ends it with his own musings on determinism and free will. If free will exists. What does one mean by ‘I’ and the philosophy of identity.The lecture and the subsequent publication of the book had tremendous impact on understanding the genetic aspects of the DNA. "
75,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8122302-neko,4,"(Quite a lengthy review i wrote in English class) This book has served as a source of inspiration for many scientists, especially biologists converted from the field of physics. Despite being written in the 1940's, before the discovery of DNA, it isn't hard to understand why this piece was influential. Shrödinger's modest perspective, philosophical insights and a tone so humble as making every sentence appear meticulously crafted, is not something found in typical popular-science literature. Known for being his only publication for a lay audience, ""What is Life?"" is an attempt by Schrödinger, not mainly to educate; but to inspire. It is divided into 3 parts, the first containing descriptions of basic physical principles as well as the foundation of living organisms. The second part is a more speculative and abstract presentation of the author's views of life, reality and epistemology. This edition of the book finishes with a 3:rd part entitled ""autobiographical sketches"", which -as suggested by its title- contains information about Schrödinger's own life.Let me begin by discussing the first part by briefly stating that the scope of this review is far too limited to expand on all the interesting tangential thoughts raised be the book. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to pick out some of the most pertinent topics.To emphasize the modesty of his approach, Shrödinger calls himself a naive physicist and starts by challenging the anthropocentric nature of both scientific and philosphical questions. An example is the question ""why are atoms so small?"", which can be contrasted with ""why are human sensory organs not re fined enough to perceive them?"". The latter question is both easier to explain by science (evolutionary adaptation and structure of bio-molecules etc.) and less naive. Indeed, the first question seems rather meaningless and impossible to answer with a scientific approach (as ""why?"" questions in general tend to be). An important point to consider (one that is often overlooked) is the limits of science. Schrödinger addresses this by pointing out the approximate, statistical nature of physical laws; they may be accurate enough to measure the distance to the sun, but the more decimal-places you have, the more uncertain the numbers become. On the smallest of scales, our measurements become inaccurate. But we can nevertheless determine the statistically significant outcomes by testing multiple times. Yet, since our time is also limited (death, more important occupations etc.), the constrains are at both ends of the spectrum; the infinitesimally small and the infinitely large.Although a more pragmatic approach is adopted by physicists (""what matters is what works"", to paraphrase Richard Feynman), it is both interesting and humbling to think about our limitations.Schrödinger also extends his discussion by including biology, and a comparison between quantum jumps (sudden leaps by sub-atomic particles between discrete energy-levels of an atom) with random mutations in the genome. (At this point, I'm not sure if he means that the former is a likely cause for genetic mutations, of it's merely an analogy).Another comparison he makes, is likening aperiodic crystals with chromosomes, both being of an asymmetrical form. I think the intention here is to point to the 'uniqueness' of the fundamental parts that make up a live organism; if we were made from periodic crystals, there would be no basis for diversity on which natural selection could work.But there is also another part of this discussion which, somewhat ironically concerns the stability of the hereditary substance. Despite changing through evolutionary time, the material of our genomes is relatively stable (undergoes only small changes in each generation). On this matter, the author insinuates a physical explanation based on discrete energy levels of molecules, to account for their relatively stable nature.After taking the reader through a rather lengthy discussion (which the previous passages of this review attempted to outline), Shrödinger states his main reason for writing this piece. By merging concepts from his formal occupation, physics, with biochemistry, he leaves open the possibility that yet unknown ""laws of nature"" exist on the biological level.I am not at all clear with what he meant by that, but my speculation is that he was (like many others) puzzled by the apparent fact that living organisms evade the second law of thermodynamics.But the confusion is likely a remnant of a simplistic view without considerations that bodies indeed do produce a net increase in entropy by emitting heat to their environment. Another point he leaves as food for thought, is that ""no detailed information about the functioning of the genetic mechanism can emerge from a description of its structure"". Maybe the laws of physics and chemistry leave something unexplained after all?What follows next is a sketch of opinions on issues that philosophers have been trying to answer for centuries. Although Schrödinger approaches these from his own standpoint, not biased be an occupational background in philosophy or heavy jargon. Central to the questions pondered is that of free will vs. determinism, where the author tries to draw a conclusion from the premises that;i) every living body is subject to the laws of nature, andii) one has the experience of being in control and responsible for one's actions.With inspiration from Schopenhauer and the Upanishads, he describes the ""singularity of consciousness"", which probably seems quite self-evident to any reader of his words, yet still manages to serve as reminder that you are alive and able to interact with the world (at least that's the feeling i got when reading it).It is important to note that the ""singularity of consciousness"" does not mean that there exists only one mind, and that everyone else are only ideas within that mind (solipsism). What Schrödinger meant (if i've read him correctly) is that [i]experience[/i] is always singular, i.s no one has exactly the same experience as someone else, even if the situation in which they find themselves is identical.Through further philosophical rambling, the author reaches the conclusion that the ""barrier"" between a perceiving subject and the object being perceived is and illusion. Although his writing cannot be blamed for being obscure, every time i close the book, my sense of understanding of this seems to disappear. However, there is a strong parallel to the idea that a scientist (by conducting experiments, measuring things, etc.) assumes the hypothesis of an objective world, independent of observation.This may not seem very shocking, but contemporary discoveries and theoretical advances in physics (in which Schrödinger played an important art), introduced a paradox to this fundamental assumption. The implications were basically that features of subatomic particles were dependent on measurement in such a way that if one thing was known, another was by default uncertain.This could possibly be what led Schrödinger to say that the boundary between subject and object is illusory.The last part of the book contains brief autobiographical notes of Schrödinger's life at university, the people he met, and some friendly comments toward family members, especially apologetic to his deceased parents. A little surprising, yet understandable, was the exclusion of personal achievements, (such as the wave-equation and further work on quantum mechanics) and anecdotes about experiences for which he is well-known.I have to conclude with the confession that my mpression of this influential character has shifted after reading What is Life?. Mostly, i think, because of his highly polite and formal attitude, which is quite a rare feature among physicist-authors."

Many years before the encoding of DNA and its double-helix structure were eventually discovered, Schrödinger muses on a possible physical structure for encoding the hereditary information, this, he speculates, aperiodic crystal. His analogy with morse code (how ""simple"" codes can encode tremendous amounts of information; see also, obviously: binary coding and the digital age) nicely anticipates the rather simple four-base encoding of DNA, and his remarks on the importance of quantum mechanical rules at the scale of the hereditary substance (whose approximate size was already known) were illuminating, as was his summary of life being something that feeds on low entropy to keep its own entropy from constantly increasing (as things are wont to do).Mind and Matter ★★★Schrödinger's speculations about the interplay of mind and matter. Some interesting thoughts, but all in all too unfocused and unconvincing.But some of you, I am sure, will call this mysticism.As, indeed, do I."

I think ""what is life"" should be separate from ""mind and matter"" as they are largely complete each on their own. While ""what is life"", containing a theoretical account - or prediction - of what is to be expected as the fundamental building blocks of life, is fascinating, I found the ideas in ""mind and matter"" even more thought-provoking and relevant (unsurprisingly so given that DNA has been discovering shortly after the initial publishing and found its way into common knowledge). "
80,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,5,"On ""What is Life?"":One of the most thought-provoking books I've read on the physiochemical basis of life. The book's based on a series of lectures Shrodinger delivered at the Institute for Advance Studies at Trinity College, Dublin in 1943. Shrodinger was writing before the discovery of the structure of DNA ten years later by Watson and Crick, so he is unaware of the gene-bearing nature of DNA. Nevertheless, he is able to deduce with near-perfect precision the kind of molecule that the ""heredity substance"" must be. Above all, it must be a large ""aperiodic solid"" or molecule, capable of an almost miraculous stability, yet also susceptible to small-scale mutations. The virtual permanence of the molecule (the fact that DNA is copied from generation to generation with near-perfect accuracy accounts for the sameness uniting parental organisms with their offspring; the fact that mutations can occur accounts for the difference between living organisms. Such is the DNA molecule. What is it, ultimately, that separates life from inanimate matter? For Shrodinger, it's life's ability to evade the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all closed systems tend toward the disorder and diffusion of energy (i.e., the entropy law). Life feeds on orderly structures, exporting disorderliness out into the universe. Life is that which works against entropy.Shrodinger was a quantum physicist. He was intensely aware of the disturbingly haphazard and random (within circumscribed limits) movement of atomic and subatomic particles. He helped develop the quantum mechanics atomic physicists still use to understand the nature of matter and reality and the very smallest scales. And it's the following paradox that motivated him to write this book: If individual atoms are subject to the haphazard laws of quantum mechanics, and if the heredity substance (the genetic ""code-script,"" as he says) is made up of a tiny number of these atoms, why isn't its molecular structure (a structure that must be EXTREMELY well-ordered in order to preserve genetic information across time) subject to the destructive randomness of quantum forces? In other words, given the randomness of individual atoms, why isn't the hereditary molecule (constituted entirely of atoms) subject to potentially destructive quantum randomness. What initially makes this especially baffling to Shrodinger is the fact that the smaller in scale you go (the more you narrow in on matter), the more disorderly atomic interactions become. If the heredity substance is necessarily tiny, in other words, shouldn't it theoretically be subject to the haphazard movements of quantum physics?It turns our that it shouldn't. Shrodinger resolves his paradox by pointing out that the individual atoms in larger molecules are bound by intensely powerful co-valent bonds, so that, even if atomic activity is disorderly, molecules bind disorderly atoms into orderly conglomerates, which are almost solid-like in their regularity. (Quantum randomness DOES affect the molecular structure, in Shrodinger's view, but only extremely rarely when an ""isomeric transition threshold"" is crossed); it's this stability at the molecular level that makes heredity information or trait-encoding genes possible, which in turn makes life possible. In sum: Shrodinger's main purpose in writing this book is to reconcile the randomness of quantum mechanics with the orderliness of biology. I'm not qualified to comment on the originality of this book, or its effectiveness in legitimizing or ""quantizing"" biology. But he certainly helped bring ""biophysics"" to the fore in the early '50s, inspiring a new generation of scientists, including but not limited to Watson and Crick.""We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it. I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true who aim be lost for ever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them - and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.""- Shrodinger, ""What is Life?"" On ""Mind and Matter"":On ""Autobiographical Sketches"":Told in the manner of an elderly man who sets out to write his life story only to stop midway, realizing that he didn't have the narrative capacities to do it justice or the boldness to reveal some of its more private phases (his ""relations with women""). This, I suppose, will always remain behind the curtain more or less. Though the sketches are dry and incomplete, I appreciate Shrodinger's mustering the wherewithal to follow through on at least a brief picture of his life. He hates chronological biographical accounts but is unable to offer anything more innovative or subtle. No worries, Shrodinger! These were still a pleasure to read."
81,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,5,"I've come across this essay multiple times in the past couple months and each time I'd resolved to read it. 3 months+ isn't so bad. This is the sort of work I wish I had the ambition and seriousness to pick over all the popular nonfiction garbage I stuff my brain with. An actual genius with original ideas communicating them beautifully in the sort of science-loving idea-centric natural-poeticism that we seem to have lost after Feynman. It's not easy to read, the ideas are in their nascent stages and still speculative, the codescript for the idea of a codescript, incomplete, in many places incorrect, and without the closure of a well-planned structural flow that today's nonfiction book would lay out in its development of a topic. In that sense it's more like high quality fiction, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or the sci-fi greats, it demands effort and it rewards attention with layers upon layers of truth, not simply facts but truth, insight into not just reality but the nature of our insight into reality, not just about scientific concepts but the concept of a scientific concept. It's only fitting therefore that it ends with the most meta concept we know, consciousness, itself an infinite recursion since the word itself automatically means the consciousness of consciousness, and so on. The density of ideas and the brevity of their exposition is breathtaking. The epilogue on consciousness alone says everything it needs to say, a book's worth of words in the hands of a less intelligent or more egoistic author, in the space of a few paragraphs. It is possible that's what sets lectures apart from books, they are condensed versions of books worth of learning, a dense representation of the knowledge on offer, to be looked up in detail later. It is more likely that's what sets apart old school geniuses like Schrodinger. I got to the end of the book and was convinced I'd received some spurious abridged cliffnotes copy, I'm so used to ideas being overexplained and developed far beyond the point of maximal marginal returns on exposition. I'm so used to a certain trajectory of information and a certain average ex post facto recce of the total new knowledge received over the hours spent, that when a piece of work like this shows up that totally trounces all benchmarks on these variables, I'm convinced that I've missed a whole lot of empty hours that contribute nothing other than bring down the trajectory to acceptable levels. NotesAnswering deep questions with simple examples (size of atoms and problem of relativity: king who made his arm-length the official distance). As complex as periodic crystals are, aperiodic crystals are that much more, like a patterned wallpaper vs a Raphael tapestry with a divine order unifying zero repetition. Hence organic chemistry (aperiodic crystals) has contributed more to the problem of life than physics (periodic crystals)Atom is 1/5000-1/2000 wavelength of yellow light. Significant because grain of light is smallest thing visible in microscope, so even this has millions of atoms. Trapped by our frame of reference: ‘why are atoms so small’ is really asking ‘why is ratio of us to atoms so large’. What we call thought needs a) orderliness b) interactions with external world (perception) that are also orderly. Need to follow physical laws. But atoms are probabilistic and chaotic, it is from this need for statistical order out of chaos that our order of reality is so vastly above atomic sizeParamagnetism: Boltzmann/Gibb showed Oxygen dipoles get magnetized by field, but why does magnetization double when field is doubled? It is a statistical phenomenon, countered by heat-motion that randomizes atoms and field creating just a slight tendency to prefer acute angle towards field such that over statistical sample, there is alignment. Langevin’s idea of heat entropy vs order, so if temperature is reduced, then magnetization is higher. When temp is close to minimum, then increasing field doesn’t have as high impact on magnetization, close to saturation. Brownian motion: upper layer of droplets slowly sinks with mathematical precision of specific gravity, viscosity, but individual droplets are totally unpredictable, small enough to be impacted by molecular impacts. Bacteria similarly are at the mercy of heat-motion etc. Diffusion: While concentration of 2 substances equalize (movement of molecules from high to low conc) by exact partial differential equation, this is just an approximation. In reality, individual molecules are engaging in random walk, and since in high-conc more are randomly walking, it will follow that in general there is a flow towards the low-conc. Maxwell’s Demon.Square root law of standard error: Error is proportional to inverse square root of sample size N. So sample 100 has 1/10 error, 10%. Sample 1000000 has 1/1000 error. Power of exponential growth of mitosis: Current me is only the 50/60th descendent of single cell egg-me! Mitosis creates 2 copies of each set of chromosomes. But some cells are set aside, reserved to become sex-cells, don’t mitosis much, and just before they’re needed, undergo meiosis, where daughter cells get only 1 copy of chromosomes (haploid), fusing during sex to create a diploid zygote. How my father’s spermatozoa split chromosome during meiosis will define my paternal inheritance of either grandmother or grandfather. But not that simple, because there is frequent crossover. Genes that are far from each other on the strand have higher chance of being crossed over because intersection point lies between them. Studying difference between haploid/diploid can tell us relative positioning of genes coding for a property.How big is a gene? Take physical size of chromosome, establish how many features it codes for, divide, get maximum size of gene (because keep discovering new features, it’s a start point). Turns out to be a cube with edge ~300Angstrom. So a gene is not more than a million or so genes. Not large enough to entail lawful behavior. How marvelous that in a genome you get a 4-dimensional picture not just of an individual, but the development/permanence of that individual in time, across generations!Dangerous mutations usually lurk in background as recessive because don’t do too much damage this way, if dominant they get selected out. That’s why the argument ‘our blood is awesome, we should interbreed’ doesn’t work, the good traits are on the surface and the bad ones are lurking.Need ceteris-paribus conditions to allow good mutations to prove themselves and take root, that’s why mutations are so rare.Most things follow diminishing return curves, true proportionality is rare and remarkable. Radiation causing mutation is proportional, ie first dose and 2nd dose are totally independent. Exact condition is that an ionization just 10 atoms away from the gamete can cause a mutation. It can be passed on to next generation without affecting current individualEnergy states are quantum, not continuous. Start at lowest energy state, absolute zero. Supply heat, increase probability that it jumps. Measured by ‘time of expectation’, how long it takes to jump. This is defined by W/kT (W=energy gap, kT is heat energy of temp T). Strangely exponential relationship. W/kT=30, time is 1/10s. At 60, it is 30,000 years!Statistical theories of heat are full of exponential function, because so highly improbable for certain energy state to be attained randomly. Nernst’s Heat Theorem, 3rd law of thermodynamics, that entropy tends to zero as temperature reaches absolute zero. Remove heat from system and reduce randomness effect. Even at room temperature, the effect of entropy is minimal on chemical reactions. If physics underlies biological phenomena, how to account for free will? One inference is to say I control the physics. I am God. Atman, Brahman.It neatly solves problem of plurality of consciousness that Western philosophy has been trying. Descartes - I exist, single consciousness. Same of everyone else. How to reconcile? 1. It dies with the body, this is intolerable. 2. There is an indivisible eternal soul, in realm of forms. Same as saying plurality is different aspects of single, Maya. "

For it is in relation to the statistical point of view that the structure of the vital parts of living organisms differs so entirely from that of any piece of matter that we physicists and chemists have ever handled physically in our laboratories or mentally at our writing desks the most essential part of a living cell the chromosome fibre may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. In physics we have dealt hitherto only with periodic crystals. To a humble physicist's mind, these are very interesting and complicated objects; they constitute one of the most fascinating and complex material structures by which inanimate nature puzzles his wits. Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal, they are rather plain and dull. Organic chemistry, indeed, in investigating more and more complicated molecules, has come very much nearer to that 'aperiodic crystal' which, in my opinion, is the material carrier of life. And therefore it is small wonder that the organic chemist has already made large and important contributions to the problem of life, whereas the physicist has made next to noneWe now recognize this fundamental law of physics to be just the natural tendency of things to approach the chaotic state (the same tendency that the books of a library or the piles of papers and manuscripts on a writing desk display) unless we obviate it. Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness ( = fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment. that we give off heat is not accidental, but essential. For this is precisely the manner in which we dispose of the surplus entropy we continually produce in our physical life process MIGUEL DE UNAMUNO (quoted from conversation) If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually never says anything at all. from all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics. all physical laws are based on statistics. the interesting statistical type of law, controlling large-scale events, is constituted from the 'dynamical' laws supposed to govern the small-scale events, the interaction of the single atoms and molecules. Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Even in the pathological cases of split consciousness or double personality the two persons alternate, they are never manifest simultaneously Yet each of us has the indisputable impression that the sum total of his own experience and memory forms a unit, quite distinct from that of any other person. He refers to it as 'I'. What is this 'I'? If you analyse it closely you will, I think, find that it is just a little bit more than a collection of single data (experiences and memories), namely the canvas upon which they are collected. And you will, on close introspection, find that what you really mean by 'I' is that ground-stuff upon which they are collected"""

84,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25570776-pi,4,"Reading some of the great minds of the 20th century, of whom Erwin Schrodinger is without a doubt one, is such a treat! You feel getting to know the author personally, with all his kinks and quirks; and Schrodinger has those aplenty: from his excessively high self-esteem, to his not-so-scientific mysticism regarding consciousness. But although this little book has been immensely prescient in predicting the discovery and structure of DNA, referred to by Schrodinger as a type of aperiodic crystal, it has also paved the way for what has been called the central dogma of molecular biology: the idea that information can only pass from DNA to RNA to proteins - never the other way around. This idea, however, has been discredited in recent decades by the amassed evidence to the contrary. Basically, Schrodinger is wrong in saying that physics is ""order from disorder"", but life is somehow different in that it is ""order from order"". Actually, according to our most recent scientific theories, life should also be viewed as (mostly) order from disorder, for it is driven by stochasticity on the micro level all the same. (Anyone interested in reading more on these and similar issues with the gene-centered Neo-Darwinian view on evolution, and the essence of life, I refer to the following recent books: Dance to the Tune of Life: Biological Relativity and The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.)What really makes What is Life?, as well as other writings from science and philosophy, worth a read, however, is not their impact on science and philosophy per se, but their influence on popular culture and literature. For instance, when I was recently reading Wetware by Rudy Rucker, I couldn't fail to notice some of the parallels with Schrodinger's work; especially Rucker's character Berenice discussing the difference in entropy production between different 'bopper' bodies. I might be wrong with this parallel, but I'm pretty sure many sci-fi authors, including Rudy Rucker, have read What is life? and it has influenced their thinking a great deal. In any case, I truly believe reading science and philosophy can significantly bolster your experience when reading anything else, especially sci-fi. So why not go for it?"

86,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"What I expected:Source, CC-BY-NC 2.5What I got:""What is Life?"" is a surprisingly humble take on the problems biology had in the 1940s. Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology)."
87,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"Schrödinger was a very well respected physicist, who gave us a new language to describe the behaviour of the quantum realm. It is thus with skepticism that one might approach a book (essay?) like this, applying quantum theory to biology. But throughout the book what comes through heavily is Schrödinger’s humility – which is a rare character for physicists when discussing biology. Nevertheless, his application of physics-based reasoning manages to justify some facts of biology and populate new ones. As an example, he starts with the somewhat odd question “why is the human body so much bigger than an atom” to expound core points such as whether physics can hope to quantify the behaviour of living systems.Perhaps the most surprising thing is that he actually does provide an answer to the book’s eponymous question: what is life? It is something that consumes negative entropy (i.e order) to stave off it’s own inevitable decay into disorder. In his words, all living things have: an astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos by 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environmentThat is basically saying that we consume food (highly ordered arrangements of molecules) and output it as heat (disorder), in the mean time maintaining our relatively ordered state. This is a wonderfully original perspective, but one that anyone can see to be sensible and according with the facts. On a side note, after reading this I had to read Asimov’s The Last Question again… The second law of thermodynamics is haunting."
88,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10663319-michael-kenning,4,"One thing that I did not realise about this book is that it actually contains three different books: What is Life?, Mind and Matter, and Autobiographical sketches. The first book, What is Life?, gives the reader a very basic understanding of genetics. It is precisely the hereditary substance and the nature of mutation in the genetic substance that encouraged the discovery of the double helix in DNA. It is a most essential read; and despite the fact that it was written by a physicist, it portrays Schrödinger's keen interest and understanding of biological functions—and the incorporation of his own physical knowledge.The second book goes through the consideration of mind and its role in evolution—how the mind may contribute to our (what I consider) continual progression as a species. Although, it is suggested that, like crocodiles and many insects, we have reached, not the peak of evolution (which would imply that we are the best kind of thing—not true), but a sort of plateau which means that we no longer require adjustment; mutations still occur, however. It considers the effects of mind on our various sensual apparatus, and how the memes which are passed down from generation to generation will reflect our capability to survive—what he called a 'feigned Lamarckism'. The considerations are truly inspiring.The autobiographical sketches, although somewhat insightful, contain nothing of interest. It shall only reveal to the reader the process by which Erwin Schrödinger became a scientist, which isn't very interesting; as Schrödinger said himself: 'I am not good at telling stories'."

That extrapolation to human senses also intesting.I did not get everything on the genetics chapters, as I have not studied it in a long time, and did not bother to look it up.Very interesting idea about how life has to ""feed"" on ""negative entropy"" as he calls it, because life is constantly producing entropy (disorder) in the processes to keep it alive (metabolism) and this excess entropy has to be shed or transferred into matter or enegy (it is not that well explained) that is in a state of lower entropy. There is a necessary correlation between the ingested energy and ingested negative entropy that is not explained in the book. I need to look deeper into this.The chapters on deducing the nature of the genetic material I mostly glanced over though he seems to have made pivotal statements which somewhat led to the discovery of the DNA structure. The epilogue on consciousness, the actual reason I read this book, is much less precise logically. I came onto this book because it was stated somewhere else something along the lines of: ""One of the fathers of quantum physics tries to reduce the last bastions of human ignorance to physics, suggests it to be possible for the mechanisms of life, but claims it impossible in the case of consciousnees"".Did not add much to my understanding of the Philosophy of Mind.All in all an interesting read."

So step by step the the reader is hand held with all the complicated maths tucked away and only brought out when absolutely necessary to avoid that awfulness until at the end one is left with an interesting proposition: what kind of weird law defying miracle are made of? Life, for all of our understanding is a square peg in a round hole, it don't make no damn sense essentially. But we try valiantly to make sense of it... for reasons. SO after all the science stuff (which is actually nice refresher on the basics of human chemistry (the notable absence of DNA notwithstanding) we are given a short treatise on how this all affects us as conscious beings. Well my ears perked up at that. Could science be the path I need to follow to kill my arch nemesis the ego? Mr. Schrödinger seems to say to me the same thing a lot of authors have been saying to me lately...namely consciousness, the ego, is a diffusive thing not to be pinned down. He does however tease some theories on the fact that if we do have free will, that means we can manipulate individual atoms, making us walking gods when we make even the tiniest of decisions. But that's countered by the possibility that life is somewhat mechanical in nature and determinism rears its ugly head.I just don't know my dudes. But I will continue the noble pursuit."

I found ot very enlightening as shrodinger repeatedly approached mainstream issues with an unusual method. How do you distinguish life from death? Easy just use the second law of thermodynamics! What I found most interesting in this book is that shrodinger would repeatedly say stange things such as: The scientific approach does not reveal the human soul, collective consciousness is due to the existence of god, plato was a genius for having invented the theory of forms and even going so far as to quote from Jung and some persian mystics! And my first reaction is to shrug it off as pseudoscience or fiction but then I'd remember im reading a book to the greatest scientists in the modern age! If anyone has the right to declare the scientific approach inadequate it's him. I also find it admirable that although famous as physicist schrodinger was much more. He is a chemist, biologists, playboy and philosopher. A truly admirable man."

I can see why the field of molecular biology would be so fascinating to those who would come after, using Schrodinger's ""aperiodic crystal"" as their template for what to seek in their eventual discovery of DNA (another win for the predictive power of science).

Even then, I found some portions of the book a little difficult to comprehend.

Complex ideas are explained in very simple manner, by using great analogies in various cases. In all, it is a great book which, I believe, should be made available to high school students when they actually learn these topics, albeit as different subjects. It will give them a perspective of how these subjects gel together in the real world to form science as we know it. "

But then, he argues that things are really not so different. I think this book, short though it is, may take another read before I can fully grasp what he was getting at.

101,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74129681-nemantro,5,"When a physicist talks about biology , the DNA becomes a ""aperiodic crystal"", mutation is all about Quantum leaps, evolution is a bunch of isomers,.. and Life is a matter of entropy and order."
102,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3070035-clio,3,"All I knew about Schrodinger before reading this was about his paradoxical cat.I found his writing style a little clunky - I kept getting thrown off when he'd introduce an idea, then say ""and now we can prove that is all haberdash and silly hats"" and then go on to say something that didn't sound any more provable to me than the idea he'd just dismissed. But he did reference a lot of other books that influenced his thoughts that I hadn't read. I think if I go back and read a bunch of that, then come back and read this again, I'd follow him better. He's part of a whole tradition of ideas so it's hard to just take out his ideas and read them out of context (at least if you aren't super comfortable with quantum physics and thinking in paradoxes).In What is Life?, Schrodinger discussed the type of physical laws that he thinks govern life and the difference between statistical laws that produce order from disorder and clockwork/pure mechanical laws that produced order from order. He referenced Max Planck a bunch in that section. He also starts to talk about the Upanishads (and Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy) and the weird paradoxes of consciousness as something like a soul that is tied to one body, a thing that you identify as your Self and think is an individual, thereby distinguishing yourself from other Selves in other bodies - from what I understood in this piece and Mind and Matter, he thinks consciousness can only be one thing and the multiplicity of consciousness we see in Western thought is sort of alike a mirage that arises from our inability to see where our own mind fits into our view of the world since we are using it (or pieces of it) to interpret the world. It has to simplify our world-view by taking itself out of the picture, so our picture is not complete. Schrodinger says ""consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing, produced by a deception (the Indian Maya); the same illusation is produced in a gallery of mirrors, and in the same way Gaurisankar and Mt Everest turned out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" So in the hall of mirrors, we don't know exactly what we are looking at and think we are looking at many different images when really we are seeing one image. From different viewpoints, we may see the same thing and imagine it is different things since it may look slightly different. Although his example here is actually wrong; per the American Geological Society, Gaurisankar and Mt Everest are ""different peaks, thirty-six miles apart,"" as determined in a 1903 survey (ending an approximately 50-year argument about whether they were the same peak). In the same vein, I'm not convinced Schrodinger is right about many of his opinions here, but I think the most interesting part is not necessarily the points he puts forward as solutions but the questions he is trying to answer.He says that we may see the ""I"" within ourselves as distinct and made up of our own individual experiences and memories, but he believes the part that is really ""I"" or the consciousness is not the set of experiences but the ""canvas upon which they are collected"" - if we view consciousness in this way, it is much easier to believe it could all be of one piece. He may not be entirely convincing on any of his points in this book, but I do think he did a good job of dismissing some of the logic that would certainly bar his ideas from being true, so that you can see the things he purports could be true.Schrodinger's ideas on ethics are interesting too; he believes man is subject to a constant ethical evolution along with biological evolution, and that for Man (and each man) there is sort of a battle between the primitive will and our evolving ethical ideals, so that to be ethical we have to be ""self-conquering,"" ""chisel and statue, conquerors and conquered at the same time."" Back on the subject of the mind not really being able to see itself in its concept of the world, he quotes the hell out of Sir Charles Sherrington's Man on His Nature, which he is in love with. ""The mind per se cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand. Then the impasse meets us, the blank of the 'how' of mind, leverage on matter."" - he wonders whether we are the truly the ""doers"" of the deeds for which we feel responsible. Then he goes off on a bunch of tangents about how you can't ""see"" the mind anywhere but that we often think we see it behind someone's eyes, that we often see eyes as more active than the passive sense organs they truly are. Last night I fell asleep wondering if blind people think their minds live behind their eyes, so I guess it is an interesting question. People with different senses may use different symbols. The mind is not truly there in our heads, he reminds us: ""Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held against the life and the emotions of the soul.""He goes on another interesting tangent about how our senses work and how our brain sort of has sub-brains and their data is somehow integrated which is another source of those dang duality mirages he is always thinking about. And I started thinking about split-brain patient studies and what those and similar psychological studies say about consciousness - are we describing the inputs and behavior of the body after the fact? I remember learning in high school that researches could manipulate people's behavior and then they would try to convince themselves they had done things for certain reasons after the fact. I think I could easily fall into an internet black hole on those topics, whoa nelly. Then he starts talking about whether time and space dimensions are a property our mind applies to the world so that we can understand it or whether they are an innate property of the world - but to Schrodinger, what is the difference between what our mind tells us it sees of the world and the world itself? So for him, it doesn't matter whether the self applies these dimensions or not, but he thinks the interesting idea is that there are aspects of the ""one thing - mind or world -"" that ""may well be capable of other forms of appearance that we cannot grasp and that do not imply the notions of space and time"" - this makes a bit more space for the idea that there can be some aspect of consciousness that is not tied down by problems of ""before"" and ""after"" for its containing body. It doesn't make it any easier to conceptualize, since we can't really understand what something like that would look like, but it takes some of the finality out of the conclusions I always find myself trapped in. What is certainty when we take out dimensions, after all? (Oof I don't take enough drugs for this book.)Anyway, the questions he's thought through in this book (these lectures, I suppose) are interesting and worth thinking about if you don't mind lying awake in the dark at night. I think sometimes I have so much I want to read that I get afraid of this ambiguous thing called ""wasting time"" and so sometimes I read when I should be taking a thinking break instead. If you're always on intake mode you're never stirring those ideas around. This book made me want to stop and think, even if I didn't see where he was coming from with some of his answers.The short autobiographical section at the end was interesting to me for his description of a time of upheaval in Austria (the end of an empire, the entrance of cars, Nazis), and also for his light touches on seeing St Elmo's Fire, the phosphorescence of the sea, and jellyfish. Ah, the mysteries of the world! He also points out that the way his school did half-days gave him a lot of time to think and to study further the things he was really interested in (and to learn from his father, who he got to spend a lot of time with)."
103,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"This book was written by Schrödinger, one of the most influential physicists to ever live, making important contributions to quantum theory. His equation (Schrödinger equation), calculates the wave function of a system and how it changes across time. This work was based on public lectures from Trinity College in 1943. It's mostly concerned with biology, although it has considerable tangents. he wanted to know how life related to physics and chemistry. It starts by showing why life seems to be so big when compared to atoms. We have around 30 trillion cells. And each cell has an average of 100 trillion atoms. He argues that at small scales, reality is too chaotic to have order. Quantum chaos fluctuations prevent steady natural laws. As a system gets better, such noise gets smaller and smaller. In further chapters, he touches on hereditary, evolution, molecules, entropy and more.Some of it was truly groundbreaking. At the time, how hereditary information was passed was unknown. He made a theoretical prediction that an ""aperiodic crystal"" would store the information required for living things to pass their ""blueprint"" of how the molecules should be organized. This inspired the later discovery of DNA. He was truly a brilliant mind and it was very enjoyable to read his work. I particularly enjoyed his humility and willingness to describe his thought process. The book was written for the layman audience, and he succeeded in doing so. You don't need any background to read, although at times it was nevertheless difficult. Luckily regarding biology and hereditary, I had some previous knowledge that helped, but the few times that he went into mathematical theorems, I was completely lost. The latter part of the book was my favorite. While I enjoyed the rest, it was a times too sciency for my taste. Towards the end it left more technical subjects related to biology and physics and was more concerned with philosophy, especially as it relates to consciousness. What strikes me the most is how well aware he was of the body/mind problem, despite him a physicist. He certainly wasn't blind to a materialistic worldview, and he easily articulates many of its problems when trying to account for consciousness. Some of it I found not the best argued super well, for example when he touched on free will. But his description of qualia, for example, was incredibly well written. He even got a bit mystical at times, which took me completely by surprise, and mentioned the Upanishads (a religious/philosophical text from Hinduism) influenced by Schopenhauer and Huxley's perennial philosophy. He considered a possible ""unified consciousness"", in which each individual experience was only a fraction of the conscious universe, but nevertheless united. It's a brilliant book. The title of it couldn't be more fitting. If you wonder what life is, how can it persist through the marching and endless entropy, or what distinguishes something living from something that is dead, then Schrödinger will walk you through his genius and explain it. A journey through biology, physics, and philosophy from one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century."

It’s a beautiful walk, especially during autumn, when the golden leaves envelop the black tar of the road. At the junction, stands a tall brick coloured building with Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath written in bold, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies - DIAS. The Irish home of the Nobel prize winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger.Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies was established by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, in 1940 to “provide facilities for the furtherance of advanced study and the conduct of research in specialised branches of knowledge”. There are three schools that form the institute - School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic studies. DIAS is arguably best known for hosting the lecture series “What is Life?”, delivered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1943.Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939, Schrödinger had been invited by Éamon de Valera, to help establish the institute. He moved to Clontarf and he lived there until 1955. The lectures were converted into a book titled ‘What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell’ for the layperson.Erwin Schrödinger was a theoretical physicist whose contributions to quantum theory were unparalleled at the time. He is best known for his rather paradoxical thought experiment, involving a cat that is dead and alive at the same time. Famously known as Schrödinger’s cat, this continues to be featured in discussions regarding application of quantum mechanics to everyday objects.But what is little known about Schrödinger is his interest and knowledge of genetics and biology. He was curious about the nature of the cell and what constituted life. In the public lecture series, What is Life, Schrödinger explores these concepts and does so in the language of the lay person. The book was published based on the lecture series in 1944.Schrödinger explores the idea of the cell and of life from the perspective of a physicist. He modestly apologizes to the biologists, time and again, for not considering the biological aspects or constraints while presenting a few of his ideas.What is Life: The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell reads like a science textbook. It begins with a detailed explanation about the significance of large number of atoms coming together and how they form working components in our bodies. He enunciates the idea of cell division better than how I can remember from high school biology. The book then takes on how the concepts of thermodynamics and crystal structures shape cell behavior. And he ends it with his own musings on determinism and free will. If free will exists. What does one mean by ‘I’ and the philosophy of identity.The lecture and the subsequent publication of the book had tremendous impact on understanding the genetic aspects of the DNA. "
105,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8122302-neko,4,"(Quite a lengthy review i wrote in English class) This book has served as a source of inspiration for many scientists, especially biologists converted from the field of physics. Despite being written in the 1940's, before the discovery of DNA, it isn't hard to understand why this piece was influential. Shrödinger's modest perspective, philosophical insights and a tone so humble as making every sentence appear meticulously crafted, is not something found in typical popular-science literature. Known for being his only publication for a lay audience, ""What is Life?"" is an attempt by Schrödinger, not mainly to educate; but to inspire. It is divided into 3 parts, the first containing descriptions of basic physical principles as well as the foundation of living organisms. The second part is a more speculative and abstract presentation of the author's views of life, reality and epistemology. This edition of the book finishes with a 3:rd part entitled ""autobiographical sketches"", which -as suggested by its title- contains information about Schrödinger's own life.Let me begin by discussing the first part by briefly stating that the scope of this review is far too limited to expand on all the interesting tangential thoughts raised be the book. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to pick out some of the most pertinent topics.To emphasize the modesty of his approach, Shrödinger calls himself a naive physicist and starts by challenging the anthropocentric nature of both scientific and philosphical questions. An example is the question ""why are atoms so small?"", which can be contrasted with ""why are human sensory organs not re fined enough to perceive them?"". The latter question is both easier to explain by science (evolutionary adaptation and structure of bio-molecules etc.) and less naive. Indeed, the first question seems rather meaningless and impossible to answer with a scientific approach (as ""why?"" questions in general tend to be). An important point to consider (one that is often overlooked) is the limits of science. Schrödinger addresses this by pointing out the approximate, statistical nature of physical laws; they may be accurate enough to measure the distance to the sun, but the more decimal-places you have, the more uncertain the numbers become. On the smallest of scales, our measurements become inaccurate. But we can nevertheless determine the statistically significant outcomes by testing multiple times. Yet, since our time is also limited (death, more important occupations etc.), the constrains are at both ends of the spectrum; the infinitesimally small and the infinitely large.Although a more pragmatic approach is adopted by physicists (""what matters is what works"", to paraphrase Richard Feynman), it is both interesting and humbling to think about our limitations.Schrödinger also extends his discussion by including biology, and a comparison between quantum jumps (sudden leaps by sub-atomic particles between discrete energy-levels of an atom) with random mutations in the genome. (At this point, I'm not sure if he means that the former is a likely cause for genetic mutations, of it's merely an analogy).Another comparison he makes, is likening aperiodic crystals with chromosomes, both being of an asymmetrical form. I think the intention here is to point to the 'uniqueness' of the fundamental parts that make up a live organism; if we were made from periodic crystals, there would be no basis for diversity on which natural selection could work.But there is also another part of this discussion which, somewhat ironically concerns the stability of the hereditary substance. Despite changing through evolutionary time, the material of our genomes is relatively stable (undergoes only small changes in each generation). On this matter, the author insinuates a physical explanation based on discrete energy levels of molecules, to account for their relatively stable nature.After taking the reader through a rather lengthy discussion (which the previous passages of this review attempted to outline), Shrödinger states his main reason for writing this piece. By merging concepts from his formal occupation, physics, with biochemistry, he leaves open the possibility that yet unknown ""laws of nature"" exist on the biological level.I am not at all clear with what he meant by that, but my speculation is that he was (like many others) puzzled by the apparent fact that living organisms evade the second law of thermodynamics.But the confusion is likely a remnant of a simplistic view without considerations that bodies indeed do produce a net increase in entropy by emitting heat to their environment. Another point he leaves as food for thought, is that ""no detailed information about the functioning of the genetic mechanism can emerge from a description of its structure"". Maybe the laws of physics and chemistry leave something unexplained after all?What follows next is a sketch of opinions on issues that philosophers have been trying to answer for centuries. Although Schrödinger approaches these from his own standpoint, not biased be an occupational background in philosophy or heavy jargon. Central to the questions pondered is that of free will vs. determinism, where the author tries to draw a conclusion from the premises that;i) every living body is subject to the laws of nature, andii) one has the experience of being in control and responsible for one's actions.With inspiration from Schopenhauer and the Upanishads, he describes the ""singularity of consciousness"", which probably seems quite self-evident to any reader of his words, yet still manages to serve as reminder that you are alive and able to interact with the world (at least that's the feeling i got when reading it).It is important to note that the ""singularity of consciousness"" does not mean that there exists only one mind, and that everyone else are only ideas within that mind (solipsism). What Schrödinger meant (if i've read him correctly) is that [i]experience[/i] is always singular, i.s no one has exactly the same experience as someone else, even if the situation in which they find themselves is identical.Through further philosophical rambling, the author reaches the conclusion that the ""barrier"" between a perceiving subject and the object being perceived is and illusion. Although his writing cannot be blamed for being obscure, every time i close the book, my sense of understanding of this seems to disappear. However, there is a strong parallel to the idea that a scientist (by conducting experiments, measuring things, etc.) assumes the hypothesis of an objective world, independent of observation.This may not seem very shocking, but contemporary discoveries and theoretical advances in physics (in which Schrödinger played an important art), introduced a paradox to this fundamental assumption. The implications were basically that features of subatomic particles were dependent on measurement in such a way that if one thing was known, another was by default uncertain.This could possibly be what led Schrödinger to say that the boundary between subject and object is illusory.The last part of the book contains brief autobiographical notes of Schrödinger's life at university, the people he met, and some friendly comments toward family members, especially apologetic to his deceased parents. A little surprising, yet understandable, was the exclusion of personal achievements, (such as the wave-equation and further work on quantum mechanics) and anecdotes about experiences for which he is well-known.I have to conclude with the confession that my mpression of this influential character has shifted after reading What is Life?. Mostly, i think, because of his highly polite and formal attitude, which is quite a rare feature among physicist-authors."
106,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2708448-thomas-herzog,4,"What is Life? ★★★★★Based on a series of lectures Schrödinger gave at a point in time when much was already known about the hereditary substance (i.e.: it is the carrier of hereditary information; it is contained in the chromosomes; it is extremely durable and can be copied perfectly, yet allows for mutations to occur; etc.), but what physical form this substance actually takes was still unknown. Many years before the encoding of DNA and its double-helix structure were eventually discovered, Schrödinger muses on a possible physical structure for encoding the hereditary information, this, he speculates, aperiodic crystal. His analogy with morse code (how ""simple"" codes can encode tremendous amounts of information; see also, obviously: binary coding and the digital age) nicely anticipates the rather simple four-base encoding of DNA, and his remarks on the importance of quantum mechanical rules at the scale of the hereditary substance (whose approximate size was already known) were illuminating, as was his summary of life being something that feeds on low entropy to keep its own entropy from constantly increasing (as things are wont to do).Mind and Matter ★★★Schrödinger's speculations about the interplay of mind and matter.

While ""what is life"", containing a theoretical account - or prediction - of what is to be expected as the fundamental building blocks of life, is fascinating, I found the ideas in ""mind and matter"" even more thought-provoking and relevant (unsurprisingly so given that DNA has been discovering shortly after the initial publishing and found its way into common knowledge). "
110,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,5,"On ""What is Life?"":One of the most thought-provoking books I've read on the physiochemical basis of life. The book's based on a series of lectures Shrodinger delivered at the Institute for Advance Studies at Trinity College, Dublin in 1943. Shrodinger was writing before the discovery of the structure of DNA ten years later by Watson and Crick, so he is unaware of the gene-bearing nature of DNA. Nevertheless, he is able to deduce with near-perfect precision the kind of molecule that the ""heredity substance"" must be. Above all, it must be a large ""aperiodic solid"" or molecule, capable of an almost miraculous stability, yet also susceptible to small-scale mutations. The virtual permanence of the molecule (the fact that DNA is copied from generation to generation with near-perfect accuracy accounts for the sameness uniting parental organisms with their offspring; the fact that mutations can occur accounts for the difference between living organisms. Such is the DNA molecule. What is it, ultimately, that separates life from inanimate matter? For Shrodinger, it's life's ability to evade the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all closed systems tend toward the disorder and diffusion of energy (i.e., the entropy law). Life feeds on orderly structures, exporting disorderliness out into the universe. Life is that which works against entropy.Shrodinger was a quantum physicist. He was intensely aware of the disturbingly haphazard and random (within circumscribed limits) movement of atomic and subatomic particles. He helped develop the quantum mechanics atomic physicists still use to understand the nature of matter and reality and the very smallest scales. And it's the following paradox that motivated him to write this book: If individual atoms are subject to the haphazard laws of quantum mechanics, and if the heredity substance (the genetic ""code-script,"" as he says) is made up of a tiny number of these atoms, why isn't its molecular structure (a structure that must be EXTREMELY well-ordered in order to preserve genetic information across time) subject to the destructive randomness of quantum forces? In other words, given the randomness of individual atoms, why isn't the hereditary molecule (constituted entirely of atoms) subject to potentially destructive quantum randomness. What initially makes this especially baffling to Shrodinger is the fact that the smaller in scale you go (the more you narrow in on matter), the more disorderly atomic interactions become. If the heredity substance is necessarily tiny, in other words, shouldn't it theoretically be subject to the haphazard movements of quantum physics?It turns our that it shouldn't. Shrodinger resolves his paradox by pointing out that the individual atoms in larger molecules are bound by intensely powerful co-valent bonds, so that, even if atomic activity is disorderly, molecules bind disorderly atoms into orderly conglomerates, which are almost solid-like in their regularity. (Quantum randomness DOES affect the molecular structure, in Shrodinger's view, but only extremely rarely when an ""isomeric transition threshold"" is crossed); it's this stability at the molecular level that makes heredity information or trait-encoding genes possible, which in turn makes life possible. In sum: Shrodinger's main purpose in writing this book is to reconcile the randomness of quantum mechanics with the orderliness of biology. I'm not qualified to comment on the originality of this book, or its effectiveness in legitimizing or ""quantizing"" biology. But he certainly helped bring ""biophysics"" to the fore in the early '50s, inspiring a new generation of scientists, including but not limited to Watson and Crick.""We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it. I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true who aim be lost for ever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them - and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.""- Shrodinger, ""What is Life?"" On ""Mind and Matter"":On ""Autobiographical Sketches"":Told in the manner of an elderly man who sets out to write his life story only to stop midway, realizing that he didn't have the narrative capacities to do it justice or the boldness to reveal some of its more private phases (his ""relations with women""). This, I suppose, will always remain behind the curtain more or less. Though the sketches are dry and incomplete, I appreciate Shrodinger's mustering the wherewithal to follow through on at least a brief picture of his life. He hates chronological biographical accounts but is unable to offer anything more innovative or subtle. No worries, Shrodinger! These were still a pleasure to read."
111,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,5,"I've come across this essay multiple times in the past couple months and each time I'd resolved to read it. 3 months+ isn't so bad. This is the sort of work I wish I had the ambition and seriousness to pick over all the popular nonfiction garbage I stuff my brain with. An actual genius with original ideas communicating them beautifully in the sort of science-loving idea-centric natural-poeticism that we seem to have lost after Feynman. It's not easy to read, the ideas are in their nascent stages and still speculative, the codescript for the idea of a codescript, incomplete, in many places incorrect, and without the closure of a well-planned structural flow that today's nonfiction book would lay out in its development of a topic. In that sense it's more like high quality fiction, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or the sci-fi greats, it demands effort and it rewards attention with layers upon layers of truth, not simply facts but truth, insight into not just reality but the nature of our insight into reality, not just about scientific concepts but the concept of a scientific concept. It's only fitting therefore that it ends with the most meta concept we know, consciousness, itself an infinite recursion since the word itself automatically means the consciousness of consciousness, and so on. The density of ideas and the brevity of their exposition is breathtaking. The epilogue on consciousness alone says everything it needs to say, a book's worth of words in the hands of a less intelligent or more egoistic author, in the space of a few paragraphs. It is possible that's what sets lectures apart from books, they are condensed versions of books worth of learning, a dense representation of the knowledge on offer, to be looked up in detail later. It is more likely that's what sets apart old school geniuses like Schrodinger. I got to the end of the book and was convinced I'd received some spurious abridged cliffnotes copy, I'm so used to ideas being overexplained and developed far beyond the point of maximal marginal returns on exposition. I'm so used to a certain trajectory of information and a certain average ex post facto recce of the total new knowledge received over the hours spent, that when a piece of work like this shows up that totally trounces all benchmarks on these variables, I'm convinced that I've missed a whole lot of empty hours that contribute nothing other than bring down the trajectory to acceptable levels. NotesAnswering deep questions with simple examples (size of atoms and problem of relativity: king who made his arm-length the official distance). As complex as periodic crystals are, aperiodic crystals are that much more, like a patterned wallpaper vs a Raphael tapestry with a divine order unifying zero repetition. Hence organic chemistry (aperiodic crystals) has contributed more to the problem of life than physics (periodic crystals)Atom is 1/5000-1/2000 wavelength of yellow light. Significant because grain of light is smallest thing visible in microscope, so even this has millions of atoms. Trapped by our frame of reference: ‘why are atoms so small’ is really asking ‘why is ratio of us to atoms so large’. What we call thought needs a) orderliness b) interactions with external world (perception) that are also orderly. Need to follow physical laws. But atoms are probabilistic and chaotic, it is from this need for statistical order out of chaos that our order of reality is so vastly above atomic sizeParamagnetism: Boltzmann/Gibb showed Oxygen dipoles get magnetized by field, but why does magnetization double when field is doubled? It is a statistical phenomenon, countered by heat-motion that randomizes atoms and field creating just a slight tendency to prefer acute angle towards field such that over statistical sample, there is alignment. Langevin’s idea of heat entropy vs order, so if temperature is reduced, then magnetization is higher. When temp is close to minimum, then increasing field doesn’t have as high impact on magnetization, close to saturation. Brownian motion: upper layer of droplets slowly sinks with mathematical precision of specific gravity, viscosity, but individual droplets are totally unpredictable, small enough to be impacted by molecular impacts. Bacteria similarly are at the mercy of heat-motion etc. Diffusion: While concentration of 2 substances equalize (movement of molecules from high to low conc) by exact partial differential equation, this is just an approximation. In reality, individual molecules are engaging in random walk, and since in high-conc more are randomly walking, it will follow that in general there is a flow towards the low-conc. Maxwell’s Demon.Square root law of standard error: Error is proportional to inverse square root of sample size N. So sample 100 has 1/10 error, 10%. Sample 1000000 has 1/1000 error. Power of exponential growth of mitosis: Current me is only the 50/60th descendent of single cell egg-me! Mitosis creates 2 copies of each set of chromosomes. But some cells are set aside, reserved to become sex-cells, don’t mitosis much, and just before they’re needed, undergo meiosis, where daughter cells get only 1 copy of chromosomes (haploid), fusing during sex to create a diploid zygote. How my father’s spermatozoa split chromosome during meiosis will define my paternal inheritance of either grandmother or grandfather. But not that simple, because there is frequent crossover. Genes that are far from each other on the strand have higher chance of being crossed over because intersection point lies between them. Studying difference between haploid/diploid can tell us relative positioning of genes coding for a property.How big is a gene? Take physical size of chromosome, establish how many features it codes for, divide, get maximum size of gene (because keep discovering new features, it’s a start point). Turns out to be a cube with edge ~300Angstrom. So a gene is not more than a million or so genes. Not large enough to entail lawful behavior. How marvelous that in a genome you get a 4-dimensional picture not just of an individual, but the development/permanence of that individual in time, across generations!Dangerous mutations usually lurk in background as recessive because don’t do too much damage this way, if dominant they get selected out. That’s why the argument ‘our blood is awesome, we should interbreed’ doesn’t work, the good traits are on the surface and the bad ones are lurking.Need ceteris-paribus conditions to allow good mutations to prove themselves and take root, that’s why mutations are so rare.Most things follow diminishing return curves, true proportionality is rare and remarkable. Radiation causing mutation is proportional, ie first dose and 2nd dose are totally independent. Exact condition is that an ionization just 10 atoms away from the gamete can cause a mutation. It can be passed on to next generation without affecting current individualEnergy states are quantum, not continuous. Start at lowest energy state, absolute zero. Supply heat, increase probability that it jumps. Measured by ‘time of expectation’, how long it takes to jump. This is defined by W/kT (W=energy gap, kT is heat energy of temp T). Strangely exponential relationship. W/kT=30, time is 1/10s. At 60, it is 30,000 years!Statistical theories of heat are full of exponential function, because so highly improbable for certain energy state to be attained randomly. Nernst’s Heat Theorem, 3rd law of thermodynamics, that entropy tends to zero as temperature reaches absolute zero. Remove heat from system and reduce randomness effect. Even at room temperature, the effect of entropy is minimal on chemical reactions. If physics underlies biological phenomena, how to account for free will? One inference is to say I control the physics. I am God. Atman, Brahman.It neatly solves problem of plurality of consciousness that Western philosophy has been trying. Descartes - I exist, single consciousness. Same of everyone else. How to reconcile? 1. It dies with the body, this is intolerable. 2. There is an indivisible eternal soul, in realm of forms. Same as saying plurality is different aspects of single, Maya. "
112,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18775997-lucas,4,"A collection of quotes and sections from the book that I enjoyed:""The laws of physics and chemistry are statistical throughout. For it is in relation to the statistical point of view that the structure of the vital parts of living organisms differs so entirely from that of any piece of matter that we physicists and chemists have ever handled physically in our laboratories or mentally at our writing desks the most essential part of a living cell the chromosome fibre may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. In physics we have dealt hitherto only with periodic crystals. To a humble physicist's mind, these are very interesting and complicated objects; they constitute one of the most fascinating and complex material structures by which inanimate nature puzzles his wits. Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal, they are rather plain and dull. Organic chemistry, indeed, in investigating more and more complicated molecules, has come very much nearer to that 'aperiodic crystal' which, in my opinion, is the material carrier of life. And therefore it is small wonder that the organic chemist has already made large and important contributions to the problem of life, whereas the physicist has made next to noneWe now recognize this fundamental law of physics to be just the natural tendency of things to approach the chaotic state (the same tendency that the books of a library or the piles of papers and manuscripts on a writing desk display) unless we obviate it. Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness ( = fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment. that we give off heat is not accidental, but essential. For this is precisely the manner in which we dispose of the surplus entropy we continually produce in our physical life process MIGUEL DE UNAMUNO (quoted from conversation) If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually never says anything at all. from all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics. all physical laws are based on statistics. the interesting statistical type of law, controlling large-scale events, is constituted from the 'dynamical' laws supposed to govern the small-scale events, the interaction of the single atoms and molecules. Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Even in the pathological cases of split consciousness or double personality the two persons alternate, they are never manifest simultaneously Yet each of us has the indisputable impression that the sum total of his own experience and memory forms a unit, quite distinct from that of any other person. He refers to it as 'I'. What is this 'I'? If you analyse it closely you will, I think, find that it is just a little bit more than a collection of single data (experiences and memories), namely the canvas upon which they are collected. And you will, on close introspection, find that what you really mean by 'I' is that ground-stuff upon which they are collected"""
113,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26686799-joel-croteau,4,"An excellent book that does not require any particular scientific background, and quite insightful if you can decipher Schrödinger's chronic run-on sentences."
114,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25570776-pi,4,"Reading some of the great minds of the 20th century, of whom Erwin Schrodinger is without a doubt one, is such a treat! You feel getting to know the author personally, with all his kinks and quirks; and Schrodinger has those aplenty: from his excessively high self-esteem, to his not-so-scientific mysticism regarding consciousness. But although this little book has been immensely prescient in predicting the discovery and structure of DNA, referred to by Schrodinger as a type of aperiodic crystal, it has also paved the way for what has been called the central dogma of molecular biology: the idea that information can only pass from DNA to RNA to proteins - never the other way around. This idea, however, has been discredited in recent decades by the amassed evidence to the contrary. Basically, Schrodinger is wrong in saying that physics is ""order from disorder"", but life is somehow different in that it is ""order from order"". Actually, according to our most recent scientific theories, life should also be viewed as (mostly) order from disorder, for it is driven by stochasticity on the micro level all the same. (Anyone interested in reading more on these and similar issues with the gene-centered Neo-Darwinian view on evolution, and the essence of life, I refer to the following recent books: Dance to the Tune of Life: Biological Relativity and The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.)What really makes What is Life?, as well as other writings from science and philosophy, worth a read, however, is not their impact on science and philosophy per se, but their influence on popular culture and literature. For instance, when I was recently reading Wetware by Rudy Rucker, I couldn't fail to notice some of the parallels with Schrodinger's work; especially Rucker's character Berenice discussing the difference in entropy production between different 'bopper' bodies. I might be wrong with this parallel, but I'm pretty sure many sci-fi authors, including Rudy Rucker, have read What is life? and it has influenced their thinking a great deal. In any case, I truly believe reading science and philosophy can significantly bolster your experience when reading anything else, especially sci-fi. So why not go for it?"
115,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65278991-aadeshnpn,4,Not easy to read but totally worth it. Found new perspective about what is life.
116,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"What I expected:Source, CC-BY-NC 2.5What I got:""What is Life?"" is a surprisingly humble take on the problems biology had in the 1940s. Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology)."
117,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"Schrödinger was a very well respected physicist, who gave us a new language to describe the behaviour of the quantum realm. It is thus with skepticism that one might approach a book (essay?) like this, applying quantum theory to biology. But throughout the book what comes through heavily is Schrödinger’s humility – which is a rare character for physicists when discussing biology. Nevertheless, his application of physics-based reasoning manages to justify some facts of biology and populate new ones. As an example, he starts with the somewhat odd question “why is the human body so much bigger than an atom” to expound core points such as whether physics can hope to quantify the behaviour of living systems.Perhaps the most surprising thing is that he actually does provide an answer to the book’s eponymous question: what is life? It is something that consumes negative entropy (i.e order) to stave off it’s own inevitable decay into disorder. In his words, all living things have: an astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos by 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environmentThat is basically saying that we consume food (highly ordered arrangements of molecules) and output it as heat (disorder), in the mean time maintaining our relatively ordered state. This is a wonderfully original perspective, but one that anyone can see to be sensible and according with the facts. On a side note, after reading this I had to read Asimov’s The Last Question again… The second law of thermodynamics is haunting."
118,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10663319-michael-kenning,4,"One thing that I did not realise about this book is that it actually contains three different books: What is Life?, Mind and Matter, and Autobiographical sketches. The first book, What is Life?, gives the reader a very basic understanding of genetics. It is precisely the hereditary substance and the nature of mutation in the genetic substance that encouraged the discovery of the double helix in DNA. It is a most essential read; and despite the fact that it was written by a physicist, it portrays Schrödinger's keen interest and understanding of biological functions—and the incorporation of his own physical knowledge.The second book goes through the consideration of mind and its role in evolution—how the mind may contribute to our (what I consider) continual progression as a species. Although, it is suggested that, like crocodiles and many insects, we have reached, not the peak of evolution (which would imply that we are the best kind of thing—not true), but a sort of plateau which means that we no longer require adjustment; mutations still occur, however. It considers the effects of mind on our various sensual apparatus, and how the memes which are passed down from generation to generation will reflect our capability to survive—what he called a 'feigned Lamarckism'. The considerations are truly inspiring.The autobiographical sketches, although somewhat insightful, contain nothing of interest. It shall only reveal to the reader the process by which Erwin Schrödinger became a scientist, which isn't very interesting; as Schrödinger said himself: 'I am not good at telling stories'."
119,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31677006-kaio,4,"These are personal notes that did not fit into the appropriate section.Interesting initial chapters on why most laws are only statistical in nature and describe things in good approximation only because of the sheer number of single ""things"" that behave according to exact laws. That extrapolation to human senses also intesting.I did not get everything on the genetics chapters, as I have not studied it in a long time, and did not bother to look it up.Very interesting idea about how life has to ""feed"" on ""negative entropy"" as he calls it, because life is constantly producing entropy (disorder) in the processes to keep it alive (metabolism) and this excess entropy has to be shed or transferred into matter or enegy (it is not that well explained) that is in a state of lower entropy. There is a necessary correlation between the ingested energy and ingested negative entropy that is not explained in the book. I need to look deeper into this.The chapters on deducing the nature of the genetic material I mostly glanced over though he seems to have made pivotal statements which somewhat led to the discovery of the DNA structure. The epilogue on consciousness, the actual reason I read this book, is much less precise logically. I came onto this book because it was stated somewhere else something along the lines of: ""One of the fathers of quantum physics tries to reduce the last bastions of human ignorance to physics, suggests it to be possible for the mechanisms of life, but claims it impossible in the case of consciousnees"".Did not add much to my understanding of the Philosophy of Mind.All in all an interesting read."
120,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77151581-shawn,3,"Definitely dated but obviously on the right path, this book combines biology, physics, and chemistry to try an answer the question of how if it's so small our genetic molecules defy natural law and act in a uniform manor. So step by step the the reader is hand held with all the complicated maths tucked away and only brought out when absolutely necessary to avoid that awfulness until at the end one is left with an interesting proposition: what kind of weird law defying miracle are made of? Life, for all of our understanding is a square peg in a round hole, it don't make no damn sense essentially. But we try valiantly to make sense of it... for reasons. SO after all the science stuff (which is actually nice refresher on the basics of human chemistry (the notable absence of DNA notwithstanding) we are given a short treatise on how this all affects us as conscious beings. Well my ears perked up at that. Could science be the path I need to follow to kill my arch nemesis the ego? Mr. Schrödinger seems to say to me the same thing a lot of authors have been saying to me lately...namely consciousness, the ego, is a diffusive thing not to be pinned down. He does however tease some theories on the fact that if we do have free will, that means we can manipulate individual atoms, making us walking gods when we make even the tiniest of decisions. But that's countered by the possibility that life is somewhat mechanical in nature and determinism rears its ugly head.I just don't know my dudes. But I will continue the noble pursuit."

I found ot very enlightening as shrodinger repeatedly approached mainstream issues with an unusual method. How do you distinguish life from death? Easy just use the second law of thermodynamics! What I found most interesting in this book is that shrodinger would repeatedly say stange things such as: The scientific approach does not reveal the human soul, collective consciousness is due to the existence of god, plato was a genius for having invented the theory of forms and even going so far as to quote from Jung and some persian mystics! And my first reaction is to shrug it off as pseudoscience or fiction but then I'd remember im reading a book to the greatest scientists in the modern age! If anyone has the right to declare the scientific approach inadequate it's him. I also find it admirable that although famous as physicist schrodinger was much more.

I can see why the field of molecular biology would be so fascinating to those who would come after, using Schrodinger's ""aperiodic crystal"" as their template for what to seek in their eventual discovery of DNA (another win for the predictive power of science).

Complex ideas are explained in very simple manner, by using great analogies in various cases.

132,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3070035-clio,3,"All I knew about Schrodinger before reading this was about his paradoxical cat.I found his writing style a little clunky - I kept getting thrown off when he'd introduce an idea, then say ""and now we can prove that is all haberdash and silly hats"" and then go on to say something that didn't sound any more provable to me than the idea he'd just dismissed. But he did reference a lot of other books that influenced his thoughts that I hadn't read. I think if I go back and read a bunch of that, then come back and read this again, I'd follow him better. He's part of a whole tradition of ideas so it's hard to just take out his ideas and read them out of context (at least if you aren't super comfortable with quantum physics and thinking in paradoxes).In What is Life?, Schrodinger discussed the type of physical laws that he thinks govern life and the difference between statistical laws that produce order from disorder and clockwork/pure mechanical laws that produced order from order. He referenced Max Planck a bunch in that section. He also starts to talk about the Upanishads (and Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy) and the weird paradoxes of consciousness as something like a soul that is tied to one body, a thing that you identify as your Self and think is an individual, thereby distinguishing yourself from other Selves in other bodies - from what I understood in this piece and Mind and Matter, he thinks consciousness can only be one thing and the multiplicity of consciousness we see in Western thought is sort of alike a mirage that arises from our inability to see where our own mind fits into our view of the world since we are using it (or pieces of it) to interpret the world. It has to simplify our world-view by taking itself out of the picture, so our picture is not complete. Schrodinger says ""consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing, produced by a deception (the Indian Maya); the same illusation is produced in a gallery of mirrors, and in the same way Gaurisankar and Mt Everest turned out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" So in the hall of mirrors, we don't know exactly what we are looking at and think we are looking at many different images when really we are seeing one image. From different viewpoints, we may see the same thing and imagine it is different things since it may look slightly different. Although his example here is actually wrong; per the American Geological Society, Gaurisankar and Mt Everest are ""different peaks, thirty-six miles apart,"" as determined in a 1903 survey (ending an approximately 50-year argument about whether they were the same peak). In the same vein, I'm not convinced Schrodinger is right about many of his opinions here, but I think the most interesting part is not necessarily the points he puts forward as solutions but the questions he is trying to answer.He says that we may see the ""I"" within ourselves as distinct and made up of our own individual experiences and memories, but he believes the part that is really ""I"" or the consciousness is not the set of experiences but the ""canvas upon which they are collected"" - if we view consciousness in this way, it is much easier to believe it could all be of one piece. He may not be entirely convincing on any of his points in this book, but I do think he did a good job of dismissing some of the logic that would certainly bar his ideas from being true, so that you can see the things he purports could be true.Schrodinger's ideas on ethics are interesting too; he believes man is subject to a constant ethical evolution along with biological evolution, and that for Man (and each man) there is sort of a battle between the primitive will and our evolving ethical ideals, so that to be ethical we have to be ""self-conquering,"" ""chisel and statue, conquerors and conquered at the same time."" Back on the subject of the mind not really being able to see itself in its concept of the world, he quotes the hell out of Sir Charles Sherrington's Man on His Nature, which he is in love with. ""The mind per se cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand. Then the impasse meets us, the blank of the 'how' of mind, leverage on matter."" - he wonders whether we are the truly the ""doers"" of the deeds for which we feel responsible. Then he goes off on a bunch of tangents about how you can't ""see"" the mind anywhere but that we often think we see it behind someone's eyes, that we often see eyes as more active than the passive sense organs they truly are. Last night I fell asleep wondering if blind people think their minds live behind their eyes, so I guess it is an interesting question. People with different senses may use different symbols. The mind is not truly there in our heads, he reminds us: ""Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held against the life and the emotions of the soul.""He goes on another interesting tangent about how our senses work and how our brain sort of has sub-brains and their data is somehow integrated which is another source of those dang duality mirages he is always thinking about. And I started thinking about split-brain patient studies and what those and similar psychological studies say about consciousness - are we describing the inputs and behavior of the body after the fact? I remember learning in high school that researches could manipulate people's behavior and then they would try to convince themselves they had done things for certain reasons after the fact. I think I could easily fall into an internet black hole on those topics, whoa nelly. Then he starts talking about whether time and space dimensions are a property our mind applies to the world so that we can understand it or whether they are an innate property of the world - but to Schrodinger, what is the difference between what our mind tells us it sees of the world and the world itself? So for him, it doesn't matter whether the self applies these dimensions or not, but he thinks the interesting idea is that there are aspects of the ""one thing - mind or world -"" that ""may well be capable of other forms of appearance that we cannot grasp and that do not imply the notions of space and time"" - this makes a bit more space for the idea that there can be some aspect of consciousness that is not tied down by problems of ""before"" and ""after"" for its containing body. It doesn't make it any easier to conceptualize, since we can't really understand what something like that would look like, but it takes some of the finality out of the conclusions I always find myself trapped in. What is certainty when we take out dimensions, after all? (Oof I don't take enough drugs for this book.)Anyway, the questions he's thought through in this book (these lectures, I suppose) are interesting and worth thinking about if you don't mind lying awake in the dark at night. I think sometimes I have so much I want to read that I get afraid of this ambiguous thing called ""wasting time"" and so sometimes I read when I should be taking a thinking break instead. If you're always on intake mode you're never stirring those ideas around. This book made me want to stop and think, even if I didn't see where he was coming from with some of his answers.The short autobiographical section at the end was interesting to me for his description of a time of upheaval in Austria (the end of an empire, the entrance of cars, Nazis), and also for his light touches on seeing St Elmo's Fire, the phosphorescence of the sea, and jellyfish. Ah, the mysteries of the world! He also points out that the way his school did half-days gave him a lot of time to think and to study further the things he was really interested in (and to learn from his father, who he got to spend a lot of time with)."
133,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"This book was written by Schrödinger, one of the most influential physicists to ever live, making important contributions to quantum theory. His equation (Schrödinger equation), calculates the wave function of a system and how it changes across time. This work was based on public lectures from Trinity College in 1943. It's mostly concerned with biology, although it has considerable tangents. he wanted to know how life related to physics and chemistry. It starts by showing why life seems to be so big when compared to atoms. We have around 30 trillion cells. And each cell has an average of 100 trillion atoms. He argues that at small scales, reality is too chaotic to have order. Quantum chaos fluctuations prevent steady natural laws. As a system gets better, such noise gets smaller and smaller. In further chapters, he touches on hereditary, evolution, molecules, entropy and more.Some of it was truly groundbreaking. At the time, how hereditary information was passed was unknown. He made a theoretical prediction that an ""aperiodic crystal"" would store the information required for living things to pass their ""blueprint"" of how the molecules should be organized. This inspired the later discovery of DNA. He was truly a brilliant mind and it was very enjoyable to read his work. I particularly enjoyed his humility and willingness to describe his thought process. The book was written for the layman audience, and he succeeded in doing so. You don't need any background to read, although at times it was nevertheless difficult. Luckily regarding biology and hereditary, I had some previous knowledge that helped, but the few times that he went into mathematical theorems, I was completely lost. The latter part of the book was my favorite. While I enjoyed the rest, it was a times too sciency for my taste. Towards the end it left more technical subjects related to biology and physics and was more concerned with philosophy, especially as it relates to consciousness. What strikes me the most is how well aware he was of the body/mind problem, despite him a physicist. He certainly wasn't blind to a materialistic worldview, and he easily articulates many of its problems when trying to account for consciousness. Some of it I found not the best argued super well, for example when he touched on free will. But his description of qualia, for example, was incredibly well written. He even got a bit mystical at times, which took me completely by surprise, and mentioned the Upanishads (a religious/philosophical text from Hinduism) influenced by Schopenhauer and Huxley's perennial philosophy. He considered a possible ""unified consciousness"", in which each individual experience was only a fraction of the conscious universe, but nevertheless united. It's a brilliant book. The title of it couldn't be more fitting. If you wonder what life is, how can it persist through the marching and endless entropy, or what distinguishes something living from something that is dead, then Schrödinger will walk you through his genius and explain it. A journey through biology, physics, and philosophy from one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century."

It’s a beautiful walk, especially during autumn, when the golden leaves envelop the black tar of the road. At the junction, stands a tall brick coloured building with Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath written in bold, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies - DIAS. The Irish home of the Nobel prize winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger.Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies was established by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, in 1940 to “provide facilities for the furtherance of advanced study and the conduct of research in specialised branches of knowledge”. There are three schools that form the institute - School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic studies. DIAS is arguably best known for hosting the lecture series “What is Life?”, delivered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1943.Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939, Schrödinger had been invited by Éamon de Valera, to help establish the institute. He moved to Clontarf and he lived there until 1955. The lectures were converted into a book titled ‘What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell’ for the layperson.Erwin Schrödinger was a theoretical physicist whose contributions to quantum theory were unparalleled at the time. He is best known for his rather paradoxical thought experiment, involving a cat that is dead and alive at the same time. Famously known as Schrödinger’s cat, this continues to be featured in discussions regarding application of quantum mechanics to everyday objects.But what is little known about Schrödinger is his interest and knowledge of genetics and biology. He was curious about the nature of the cell and what constituted life. In the public lecture series, What is Life, Schrödinger explores these concepts and does so in the language of the lay person. The book was published based on the lecture series in 1944.Schrödinger explores the idea of the cell and of life from the perspective of a physicist. He modestly apologizes to the biologists, time and again, for not considering the biological aspects or constraints while presenting a few of his ideas.What is Life: The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell reads like a science textbook. It begins with a detailed explanation about the significance of large number of atoms coming together and how they form working components in our bodies. He enunciates the idea of cell division better than how I can remember from high school biology. The book then takes on how the concepts of thermodynamics and crystal structures shape cell behavior. And he ends it with his own musings on determinism and free will. If free will exists. What does one mean by ‘I’ and the philosophy of identity.The lecture and the subsequent publication of the book had tremendous impact on understanding the genetic aspects of the DNA. "
135,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8122302-neko,4,"(Quite a lengthy review i wrote in English class) This book has served as a source of inspiration for many scientists, especially biologists converted from the field of physics. Despite being written in the 1940's, before the discovery of DNA, it isn't hard to understand why this piece was influential. Shrödinger's modest perspective, philosophical insights and a tone so humble as making every sentence appear meticulously crafted, is not something found in typical popular-science literature. Known for being his only publication for a lay audience, ""What is Life?"" is an attempt by Schrödinger, not mainly to educate; but to inspire. It is divided into 3 parts, the first containing descriptions of basic physical principles as well as the foundation of living organisms. The second part is a more speculative and abstract presentation of the author's views of life, reality and epistemology. This edition of the book finishes with a 3:rd part entitled ""autobiographical sketches"", which -as suggested by its title- contains information about Schrödinger's own life.Let me begin by discussing the first part by briefly stating that the scope of this review is far too limited to expand on all the interesting tangential thoughts raised be the book. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to pick out some of the most pertinent topics.To emphasize the modesty of his approach, Shrödinger calls himself a naive physicist and starts by challenging the anthropocentric nature of both scientific and philosphical questions. An example is the question ""why are atoms so small?"", which can be contrasted with ""why are human sensory organs not re fined enough to perceive them?"". The latter question is both easier to explain by science (evolutionary adaptation and structure of bio-molecules etc.) and less naive. Indeed, the first question seems rather meaningless and impossible to answer with a scientific approach (as ""why?"" questions in general tend to be). An important point to consider (one that is often overlooked) is the limits of science. Schrödinger addresses this by pointing out the approximate, statistical nature of physical laws; they may be accurate enough to measure the distance to the sun, but the more decimal-places you have, the more uncertain the numbers become. On the smallest of scales, our measurements become inaccurate. But we can nevertheless determine the statistically significant outcomes by testing multiple times. Yet, since our time is also limited (death, more important occupations etc.), the constrains are at both ends of the spectrum; the infinitesimally small and the infinitely large.Although a more pragmatic approach is adopted by physicists (""what matters is what works"", to paraphrase Richard Feynman), it is both interesting and humbling to think about our limitations.Schrödinger also extends his discussion by including biology, and a comparison between quantum jumps (sudden leaps by sub-atomic particles between discrete energy-levels of an atom) with random mutations in the genome. (At this point, I'm not sure if he means that the former is a likely cause for genetic mutations, of it's merely an analogy).Another comparison he makes, is likening aperiodic crystals with chromosomes, both being of an asymmetrical form. I think the intention here is to point to the 'uniqueness' of the fundamental parts that make up a live organism; if we were made from periodic crystals, there would be no basis for diversity on which natural selection could work.But there is also another part of this discussion which, somewhat ironically concerns the stability of the hereditary substance. Despite changing through evolutionary time, the material of our genomes is relatively stable (undergoes only small changes in each generation). On this matter, the author insinuates a physical explanation based on discrete energy levels of molecules, to account for their relatively stable nature.After taking the reader through a rather lengthy discussion (which the previous passages of this review attempted to outline), Shrödinger states his main reason for writing this piece. By merging concepts from his formal occupation, physics, with biochemistry, he leaves open the possibility that yet unknown ""laws of nature"" exist on the biological level.I am not at all clear with what he meant by that, but my speculation is that he was (like many others) puzzled by the apparent fact that living organisms evade the second law of thermodynamics.But the confusion is likely a remnant of a simplistic view without considerations that bodies indeed do produce a net increase in entropy by emitting heat to their environment. Another point he leaves as food for thought, is that ""no detailed information about the functioning of the genetic mechanism can emerge from a description of its structure"". Maybe the laws of physics and chemistry leave something unexplained after all?What follows next is a sketch of opinions on issues that philosophers have been trying to answer for centuries. Although Schrödinger approaches these from his own standpoint, not biased be an occupational background in philosophy or heavy jargon. Central to the questions pondered is that of free will vs. determinism, where the author tries to draw a conclusion from the premises that;i) every living body is subject to the laws of nature, andii) one has the experience of being in control and responsible for one's actions.With inspiration from Schopenhauer and the Upanishads, he describes the ""singularity of consciousness"", which probably seems quite self-evident to any reader of his words, yet still manages to serve as reminder that you are alive and able to interact with the world (at least that's the feeling i got when reading it).It is important to note that the ""singularity of consciousness"" does not mean that there exists only one mind, and that everyone else are only ideas within that mind (solipsism). What Schrödinger meant (if i've read him correctly) is that [i]experience[/i] is always singular, i.s no one has exactly the same experience as someone else, even if the situation in which they find themselves is identical.Through further philosophical rambling, the author reaches the conclusion that the ""barrier"" between a perceiving subject and the object being perceived is and illusion. Although his writing cannot be blamed for being obscure, every time i close the book, my sense of understanding of this seems to disappear. However, there is a strong parallel to the idea that a scientist (by conducting experiments, measuring things, etc.) assumes the hypothesis of an objective world, independent of observation.This may not seem very shocking, but contemporary discoveries and theoretical advances in physics (in which Schrödinger played an important art), introduced a paradox to this fundamental assumption. The implications were basically that features of subatomic particles were dependent on measurement in such a way that if one thing was known, another was by default uncertain.This could possibly be what led Schrödinger to say that the boundary between subject and object is illusory.The last part of the book contains brief autobiographical notes of Schrödinger's life at university, the people he met, and some friendly comments toward family members, especially apologetic to his deceased parents. A little surprising, yet understandable, was the exclusion of personal achievements, (such as the wave-equation and further work on quantum mechanics) and anecdotes about experiences for which he is well-known.I have to conclude with the confession that my mpression of this influential character has shifted after reading What is Life?. Mostly, i think, because of his highly polite and formal attitude, which is quite a rare feature among physicist-authors."
136,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2708448-thomas-herzog,4,"What is Life? ★★★★★Based on a series of lectures Schrödinger gave at a point in time when much was already known about the hereditary substance (i.e.: it is the carrier of hereditary information; it is contained in the chromosomes; it is extremely durable and can be copied perfectly, yet allows for mutations to occur; etc.), but what physical form this substance actually takes was still unknown. Many years before the encoding of DNA and its double-helix structure were eventually discovered, Schrödinger muses on a possible physical structure for encoding the hereditary information, this, he speculates, aperiodic crystal. His analogy with morse code (how ""simple"" codes can encode tremendous amounts of information; see also, obviously: binary coding and the digital age) nicely anticipates the rather simple four-base encoding of DNA, and his remarks on the importance of quantum mechanical rules at the scale of the hereditary substance (whose approximate size was already known) were illuminating, as was his summary of life being something that feeds on low entropy to keep its own entropy from constantly increasing (as things are wont to do).Mind and Matter ★★★Schrödinger's speculations about the interplay of mind and matter. Some interesting thoughts, but all in all too unfocused and unconvincing.But some of you, I am sure, will call this mysticism.As, indeed, do I."

While ""what is life"", containing a theoretical account - or prediction - of what is to be expected as the fundamental building blocks of life, is fascinating, I found the ideas in ""mind and matter"" even more thought-provoking and relevant (unsurprisingly so given that DNA has been discovering shortly after the initial publishing and found its way into common knowledge). "
140,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,5,"On ""What is Life?"":One of the most thought-provoking books I've read on the physiochemical basis of life. The book's based on a series of lectures Shrodinger delivered at the Institute for Advance Studies at Trinity College, Dublin in 1943. Shrodinger was writing before the discovery of the structure of DNA ten years later by Watson and Crick, so he is unaware of the gene-bearing nature of DNA. Nevertheless, he is able to deduce with near-perfect precision the kind of molecule that the ""heredity substance"" must be. Above all, it must be a large ""aperiodic solid"" or molecule, capable of an almost miraculous stability, yet also susceptible to small-scale mutations. The virtual permanence of the molecule (the fact that DNA is copied from generation to generation with near-perfect accuracy accounts for the sameness uniting parental organisms with their offspring; the fact that mutations can occur accounts for the difference between living organisms. Such is the DNA molecule. What is it, ultimately, that separates life from inanimate matter? For Shrodinger, it's life's ability to evade the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all closed systems tend toward the disorder and diffusion of energy (i.e., the entropy law). Life feeds on orderly structures, exporting disorderliness out into the universe. Life is that which works against entropy.Shrodinger was a quantum physicist. He was intensely aware of the disturbingly haphazard and random (within circumscribed limits) movement of atomic and subatomic particles. He helped develop the quantum mechanics atomic physicists still use to understand the nature of matter and reality and the very smallest scales. And it's the following paradox that motivated him to write this book: If individual atoms are subject to the haphazard laws of quantum mechanics, and if the heredity substance (the genetic ""code-script,"" as he says) is made up of a tiny number of these atoms, why isn't its molecular structure (a structure that must be EXTREMELY well-ordered in order to preserve genetic information across time) subject to the destructive randomness of quantum forces? In other words, given the randomness of individual atoms, why isn't the hereditary molecule (constituted entirely of atoms) subject to potentially destructive quantum randomness. What initially makes this especially baffling to Shrodinger is the fact that the smaller in scale you go (the more you narrow in on matter), the more disorderly atomic interactions become. If the heredity substance is necessarily tiny, in other words, shouldn't it theoretically be subject to the haphazard movements of quantum physics?It turns our that it shouldn't. Shrodinger resolves his paradox by pointing out that the individual atoms in larger molecules are bound by intensely powerful co-valent bonds, so that, even if atomic activity is disorderly, molecules bind disorderly atoms into orderly conglomerates, which are almost solid-like in their regularity. (Quantum randomness DOES affect the molecular structure, in Shrodinger's view, but only extremely rarely when an ""isomeric transition threshold"" is crossed); it's this stability at the molecular level that makes heredity information or trait-encoding genes possible, which in turn makes life possible. In sum: Shrodinger's main purpose in writing this book is to reconcile the randomness of quantum mechanics with the orderliness of biology. I'm not qualified to comment on the originality of this book, or its effectiveness in legitimizing or ""quantizing"" biology. But he certainly helped bring ""biophysics"" to the fore in the early '50s, inspiring a new generation of scientists, including but not limited to Watson and Crick.""We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it. I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true who aim be lost for ever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them - and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.""- Shrodinger, ""What is Life?"" On ""Mind and Matter"":On ""Autobiographical Sketches"":Told in the manner of an elderly man who sets out to write his life story only to stop midway, realizing that he didn't have the narrative capacities to do it justice or the boldness to reveal some of its more private phases (his ""relations with women""). This, I suppose, will always remain behind the curtain more or less. Though the sketches are dry and incomplete, I appreciate Shrodinger's mustering the wherewithal to follow through on at least a brief picture of his life. He hates chronological biographical accounts but is unable to offer anything more innovative or subtle. No worries, Shrodinger! These were still a pleasure to read."
141,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,5,"I've come across this essay multiple times in the past couple months and each time I'd resolved to read it. 3 months+ isn't so bad. This is the sort of work I wish I had the ambition and seriousness to pick over all the popular nonfiction garbage I stuff my brain with. An actual genius with original ideas communicating them beautifully in the sort of science-loving idea-centric natural-poeticism that we seem to have lost after Feynman. It's not easy to read, the ideas are in their nascent stages and still speculative, the codescript for the idea of a codescript, incomplete, in many places incorrect, and without the closure of a well-planned structural flow that today's nonfiction book would lay out in its development of a topic. In that sense it's more like high quality fiction, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or the sci-fi greats, it demands effort and it rewards attention with layers upon layers of truth, not simply facts but truth, insight into not just reality but the nature of our insight into reality, not just about scientific concepts but the concept of a scientific concept. It's only fitting therefore that it ends with the most meta concept we know, consciousness, itself an infinite recursion since the word itself automatically means the consciousness of consciousness, and so on. The density of ideas and the brevity of their exposition is breathtaking. The epilogue on consciousness alone says everything it needs to say, a book's worth of words in the hands of a less intelligent or more egoistic author, in the space of a few paragraphs. It is possible that's what sets lectures apart from books, they are condensed versions of books worth of learning, a dense representation of the knowledge on offer, to be looked up in detail later. It is more likely that's what sets apart old school geniuses like Schrodinger. I got to the end of the book and was convinced I'd received some spurious abridged cliffnotes copy, I'm so used to ideas being overexplained and developed far beyond the point of maximal marginal returns on exposition. I'm so used to a certain trajectory of information and a certain average ex post facto recce of the total new knowledge received over the hours spent, that when a piece of work like this shows up that totally trounces all benchmarks on these variables, I'm convinced that I've missed a whole lot of empty hours that contribute nothing other than bring down the trajectory to acceptable levels. NotesAnswering deep questions with simple examples (size of atoms and problem of relativity: king who made his arm-length the official distance). As complex as periodic crystals are, aperiodic crystals are that much more, like a patterned wallpaper vs a Raphael tapestry with a divine order unifying zero repetition. Hence organic chemistry (aperiodic crystals) has contributed more to the problem of life than physics (periodic crystals)Atom is 1/5000-1/2000 wavelength of yellow light. Significant because grain of light is smallest thing visible in microscope, so even this has millions of atoms. Trapped by our frame of reference: ‘why are atoms so small’ is really asking ‘why is ratio of us to atoms so large’. What we call thought needs a) orderliness b) interactions with external world (perception) that are also orderly. Need to follow physical laws. But atoms are probabilistic and chaotic, it is from this need for statistical order out of chaos that our order of reality is so vastly above atomic sizeParamagnetism: Boltzmann/Gibb showed Oxygen dipoles get magnetized by field, but why does magnetization double when field is doubled? It is a statistical phenomenon, countered by heat-motion that randomizes atoms and field creating just a slight tendency to prefer acute angle towards field such that over statistical sample, there is alignment. Langevin’s idea of heat entropy vs order, so if temperature is reduced, then magnetization is higher. When temp is close to minimum, then increasing field doesn’t have as high impact on magnetization, close to saturation. Brownian motion: upper layer of droplets slowly sinks with mathematical precision of specific gravity, viscosity, but individual droplets are totally unpredictable, small enough to be impacted by molecular impacts. Bacteria similarly are at the mercy of heat-motion etc. Diffusion: While concentration of 2 substances equalize (movement of molecules from high to low conc) by exact partial differential equation, this is just an approximation. In reality, individual molecules are engaging in random walk, and since in high-conc more are randomly walking, it will follow that in general there is a flow towards the low-conc. Maxwell’s Demon.Square root law of standard error: Error is proportional to inverse square root of sample size N. So sample 100 has 1/10 error, 10%. Sample 1000000 has 1/1000 error. Power of exponential growth of mitosis: Current me is only the 50/60th descendent of single cell egg-me! Mitosis creates 2 copies of each set of chromosomes. But some cells are set aside, reserved to become sex-cells, don’t mitosis much, and just before they’re needed, undergo meiosis, where daughter cells get only 1 copy of chromosomes (haploid), fusing during sex to create a diploid zygote. How my father’s spermatozoa split chromosome during meiosis will define my paternal inheritance of either grandmother or grandfather. But not that simple, because there is frequent crossover. Genes that are far from each other on the strand have higher chance of being crossed over because intersection point lies between them. Studying difference between haploid/diploid can tell us relative positioning of genes coding for a property.How big is a gene? Take physical size of chromosome, establish how many features it codes for, divide, get maximum size of gene (because keep discovering new features, it’s a start point). Turns out to be a cube with edge ~300Angstrom. So a gene is not more than a million or so genes. Not large enough to entail lawful behavior. How marvelous that in a genome you get a 4-dimensional picture not just of an individual, but the development/permanence of that individual in time, across generations!Dangerous mutations usually lurk in background as recessive because don’t do too much damage this way, if dominant they get selected out. That’s why the argument ‘our blood is awesome, we should interbreed’ doesn’t work, the good traits are on the surface and the bad ones are lurking.Need ceteris-paribus conditions to allow good mutations to prove themselves and take root, that’s why mutations are so rare.Most things follow diminishing return curves, true proportionality is rare and remarkable. Radiation causing mutation is proportional, ie first dose and 2nd dose are totally independent. Exact condition is that an ionization just 10 atoms away from the gamete can cause a mutation. It can be passed on to next generation without affecting current individualEnergy states are quantum, not continuous. Start at lowest energy state, absolute zero. Supply heat, increase probability that it jumps. Measured by ‘time of expectation’, how long it takes to jump. This is defined by W/kT (W=energy gap, kT is heat energy of temp T). Strangely exponential relationship. W/kT=30, time is 1/10s. At 60, it is 30,000 years!Statistical theories of heat are full of exponential function, because so highly improbable for certain energy state to be attained randomly. Nernst’s Heat Theorem, 3rd law of thermodynamics, that entropy tends to zero as temperature reaches absolute zero. Remove heat from system and reduce randomness effect. Even at room temperature, the effect of entropy is minimal on chemical reactions. If physics underlies biological phenomena, how to account for free will? One inference is to say I control the physics. I am God. Atman, Brahman.It neatly solves problem of plurality of consciousness that Western philosophy has been trying.

For it is in relation to the statistical point of view that the structure of the vital parts of living organisms differs so entirely from that of any piece of matter that we physicists and chemists have ever handled physically in our laboratories or mentally at our writing desks the most essential part of a living cell the chromosome fibre may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. In physics we have dealt hitherto only with periodic crystals. To a humble physicist's mind, these are very interesting and complicated objects; they constitute one of the most fascinating and complex material structures by which inanimate nature puzzles his wits. Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal, they are rather plain and dull. Organic chemistry, indeed, in investigating more and more complicated molecules, has come very much nearer to that 'aperiodic crystal' which, in my opinion, is the material carrier of life. And therefore it is small wonder that the organic chemist has already made large and important contributions to the problem of life, whereas the physicist has made next to noneWe now recognize this fundamental law of physics to be just the natural tendency of things to approach the chaotic state (the same tendency that the books of a library or the piles of papers and manuscripts on a writing desk display) unless we obviate it. Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness ( = fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment. that we give off heat is not accidental, but essential. For this is precisely the manner in which we dispose of the surplus entropy we continually produce in our physical life process MIGUEL DE UNAMUNO (quoted from conversation) If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually never says anything at all. from all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics. all physical laws are based on statistics. the interesting statistical type of law, controlling large-scale events, is constituted from the 'dynamical' laws supposed to govern the small-scale events, the interaction of the single atoms and molecules. Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Even in the pathological cases of split consciousness or double personality the two persons alternate, they are never manifest simultaneously Yet each of us has the indisputable impression that the sum total of his own experience and memory forms a unit, quite distinct from that of any other person. He refers to it as 'I'. What is this 'I'? If you analyse it closely you will, I think, find that it is just a little bit more than a collection of single data (experiences and memories), namely the canvas upon which they are collected. And you will, on close introspection, find that what you really mean by 'I' is that ground-stuff upon which they are collected"""

144,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25570776-pi,4,"Reading some of the great minds of the 20th century, of whom Erwin Schrodinger is without a doubt one, is such a treat! You feel getting to know the author personally, with all his kinks and quirks; and Schrodinger has those aplenty: from his excessively high self-esteem, to his not-so-scientific mysticism regarding consciousness. But although this little book has been immensely prescient in predicting the discovery and structure of DNA, referred to by Schrodinger as a type of aperiodic crystal, it has also paved the way for what has been called the central dogma of molecular biology: the idea that information can only pass from DNA to RNA to proteins - never the other way around. This idea, however, has been discredited in recent decades by the amassed evidence to the contrary. Basically, Schrodinger is wrong in saying that physics is ""order from disorder"", but life is somehow different in that it is ""order from order"". Actually, according to our most recent scientific theories, life should also be viewed as (mostly) order from disorder, for it is driven by stochasticity on the micro level all the same. (Anyone interested in reading more on these and similar issues with the gene-centered Neo-Darwinian view on evolution, and the essence of life, I refer to the following recent books: Dance to the Tune of Life: Biological Relativity and The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.)What really makes What is Life?, as well as other writings from science and philosophy, worth a read, however, is not their impact on science and philosophy per se, but their influence on popular culture and literature. For instance, when I was recently reading Wetware by Rudy Rucker, I couldn't fail to notice some of the parallels with Schrodinger's work; especially Rucker's character Berenice discussing the difference in entropy production between different 'bopper' bodies. I might be wrong with this parallel, but I'm pretty sure many sci-fi authors, including Rudy Rucker, have read What is life? and it has influenced their thinking a great deal. In any case, I truly believe reading science and philosophy can significantly bolster your experience when reading anything else, especially sci-fi. So why not go for it?"

146,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"What I expected:Source, CC-BY-NC 2.5What I got:""What is Life?"" is a surprisingly humble take on the problems biology had in the 1940s. Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology)."
147,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"Schrödinger was a very well respected physicist, who gave us a new language to describe the behaviour of the quantum realm. It is thus with skepticism that one might approach a book (essay?) like this, applying quantum theory to biology. But throughout the book what comes through heavily is Schrödinger’s humility – which is a rare character for physicists when discussing biology. Nevertheless, his application of physics-based reasoning manages to justify some facts of biology and populate new ones. As an example, he starts with the somewhat odd question “why is the human body so much bigger than an atom” to expound core points such as whether physics can hope to quantify the behaviour of living systems.Perhaps the most surprising thing is that he actually does provide an answer to the book’s eponymous question: what is life? It is something that consumes negative entropy (i.e order) to stave off it’s own inevitable decay into disorder. In his words, all living things have: an astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos by 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environmentThat is basically saying that we consume food (highly ordered arrangements of molecules) and output it as heat (disorder), in the mean time maintaining our relatively ordered state. This is a wonderfully original perspective, but one that anyone can see to be sensible and according with the facts. On a side note, after reading this I had to read Asimov’s The Last Question again… The second law of thermodynamics is haunting."
148,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10663319-michael-kenning,4,"One thing that I did not realise about this book is that it actually contains three different books: What is Life?, Mind and Matter, and Autobiographical sketches. The first book, What is Life?, gives the reader a very basic understanding of genetics. It is precisely the hereditary substance and the nature of mutation in the genetic substance that encouraged the discovery of the double helix in DNA. It is a most essential read; and despite the fact that it was written by a physicist, it portrays Schrödinger's keen interest and understanding of biological functions—and the incorporation of his own physical knowledge.The second book goes through the consideration of mind and its role in evolution—how the mind may contribute to our (what I consider) continual progression as a species. Although, it is suggested that, like crocodiles and many insects, we have reached, not the peak of evolution (which would imply that we are the best kind of thing—not true), but a sort of plateau which means that we no longer require adjustment; mutations still occur, however. It considers the effects of mind on our various sensual apparatus, and how the memes which are passed down from generation to generation will reflect our capability to survive—what he called a 'feigned Lamarckism'. The considerations are truly inspiring.The autobiographical sketches, although somewhat insightful, contain nothing of interest. It shall only reveal to the reader the process by which Erwin Schrödinger became a scientist, which isn't very interesting; as Schrödinger said himself: 'I am not good at telling stories'."
149,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31677006-kaio,4,"These are personal notes that did not fit into the appropriate section.Interesting initial chapters on why most laws are only statistical in nature and describe things in good approximation only because of the sheer number of single ""things"" that behave according to exact laws. That extrapolation to human senses also intesting.I did not get everything on the genetics chapters, as I have not studied it in a long time, and did not bother to look it up.Very interesting idea about how life has to ""feed"" on ""negative entropy"" as he calls it, because life is constantly producing entropy (disorder) in the processes to keep it alive (metabolism) and this excess entropy has to be shed or transferred into matter or enegy (it is not that well explained) that is in a state of lower entropy. There is a necessary correlation between the ingested energy and ingested negative entropy that is not explained in the book. I need to look deeper into this.The chapters on deducing the nature of the genetic material I mostly glanced over though he seems to have made pivotal statements which somewhat led to the discovery of the DNA structure. The epilogue on consciousness, the actual reason I read this book, is much less precise logically. I came onto this book because it was stated somewhere else something along the lines of: ""One of the fathers of quantum physics tries to reduce the last bastions of human ignorance to physics, suggests it to be possible for the mechanisms of life, but claims it impossible in the case of consciousnees"".Did not add much to my understanding of the Philosophy of Mind.All in all an interesting read."

So step by step the the reader is hand held with all the complicated maths tucked away and only brought out when absolutely necessary to avoid that awfulness until at the end one is left with an interesting proposition: what kind of weird law defying miracle are made of? Life, for all of our understanding is a square peg in a round hole, it don't make no damn sense essentially. But we try valiantly to make sense of it... for reasons. SO after all the science stuff (which is actually nice refresher on the basics of human chemistry (the notable absence of DNA notwithstanding) we are given a short treatise on how this all affects us as conscious beings. Well my ears perked up at that. Could science be the path I need to follow to kill my arch nemesis the ego? Mr. Schrödinger seems to say to me the same thing a lot of authors have been saying to me lately...namely consciousness, the ego, is a diffusive thing not to be pinned down. He does however tease some theories on the fact that if we do have free will, that means we can manipulate individual atoms, making us walking gods when we make even the tiniest of decisions. But that's countered by the possibility that life is somewhat mechanical in nature and determinism rears its ugly head.I just don't know my dudes. But I will continue the noble pursuit."

I found ot very enlightening as shrodinger repeatedly approached mainstream issues with an unusual method. How do you distinguish life from death? Easy just use the second law of thermodynamics! What I found most interesting in this book is that shrodinger would repeatedly say stange things such as: The scientific approach does not reveal the human soul, collective consciousness is due to the existence of god, plato was a genius for having invented the theory of forms and even going so far as to quote from Jung and some persian mystics! And my first reaction is to shrug it off as pseudoscience or fiction but then I'd remember im reading a book to the greatest scientists in the modern age! If anyone has the right to declare the scientific approach inadequate it's him. I also find it admirable that although famous as physicist schrodinger was much more.

I can see why the field of molecular biology would be so fascinating to those who would come after, using Schrodinger's ""aperiodic crystal"" as their template for what to seek in their eventual discovery of DNA (another win for the predictive power of science).

Even then, I found some portions of the book a little difficult to comprehend. I think it is more to do with the sentence construction used in the book and not actually because of the complexity of the ideas conveyed. Complex ideas are explained in very simple manner, by using great analogies in various cases. In all, it is a great book which, I believe, should be made available to high school students when they actually learn these topics, albeit as different subjects.

But then, he argues that things are really not so different. I think this book, short though it is, may take another read before I can fully grasp what he was getting at.

162,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3070035-clio,3,"All I knew about Schrodinger before reading this was about his paradoxical cat.I found his writing style a little clunky - I kept getting thrown off when he'd introduce an idea, then say ""and now we can prove that is all haberdash and silly hats"" and then go on to say something that didn't sound any more provable to me than the idea he'd just dismissed. But he did reference a lot of other books that influenced his thoughts that I hadn't read. I think if I go back and read a bunch of that, then come back and read this again, I'd follow him better. He's part of a whole tradition of ideas so it's hard to just take out his ideas and read them out of context (at least if you aren't super comfortable with quantum physics and thinking in paradoxes).In What is Life?, Schrodinger discussed the type of physical laws that he thinks govern life and the difference between statistical laws that produce order from disorder and clockwork/pure mechanical laws that produced order from order. He referenced Max Planck a bunch in that section. He also starts to talk about the Upanishads (and Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy) and the weird paradoxes of consciousness as something like a soul that is tied to one body, a thing that you identify as your Self and think is an individual, thereby distinguishing yourself from other Selves in other bodies - from what I understood in this piece and Mind and Matter, he thinks consciousness can only be one thing and the multiplicity of consciousness we see in Western thought is sort of alike a mirage that arises from our inability to see where our own mind fits into our view of the world since we are using it (or pieces of it) to interpret the world. It has to simplify our world-view by taking itself out of the picture, so our picture is not complete. Schrodinger says ""consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing, produced by a deception (the Indian Maya); the same illusation is produced in a gallery of mirrors, and in the same way Gaurisankar and Mt Everest turned out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" So in the hall of mirrors, we don't know exactly what we are looking at and think we are looking at many different images when really we are seeing one image. From different viewpoints, we may see the same thing and imagine it is different things since it may look slightly different. Although his example here is actually wrong; per the American Geological Society, Gaurisankar and Mt Everest are ""different peaks, thirty-six miles apart,"" as determined in a 1903 survey (ending an approximately 50-year argument about whether they were the same peak). In the same vein, I'm not convinced Schrodinger is right about many of his opinions here, but I think the most interesting part is not necessarily the points he puts forward as solutions but the questions he is trying to answer.He says that we may see the ""I"" within ourselves as distinct and made up of our own individual experiences and memories, but he believes the part that is really ""I"" or the consciousness is not the set of experiences but the ""canvas upon which they are collected"" - if we view consciousness in this way, it is much easier to believe it could all be of one piece. He may not be entirely convincing on any of his points in this book, but I do think he did a good job of dismissing some of the logic that would certainly bar his ideas from being true, so that you can see the things he purports could be true.Schrodinger's ideas on ethics are interesting too; he believes man is subject to a constant ethical evolution along with biological evolution, and that for Man (and each man) there is sort of a battle between the primitive will and our evolving ethical ideals, so that to be ethical we have to be ""self-conquering,"" ""chisel and statue, conquerors and conquered at the same time."" Back on the subject of the mind not really being able to see itself in its concept of the world, he quotes the hell out of Sir Charles Sherrington's Man on His Nature, which he is in love with. ""The mind per se cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand. Then the impasse meets us, the blank of the 'how' of mind, leverage on matter."" - he wonders whether we are the truly the ""doers"" of the deeds for which we feel responsible. Then he goes off on a bunch of tangents about how you can't ""see"" the mind anywhere but that we often think we see it behind someone's eyes, that we often see eyes as more active than the passive sense organs they truly are. Last night I fell asleep wondering if blind people think their minds live behind their eyes, so I guess it is an interesting question. People with different senses may use different symbols. The mind is not truly there in our heads, he reminds us: ""Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held against the life and the emotions of the soul.""He goes on another interesting tangent about how our senses work and how our brain sort of has sub-brains and their data is somehow integrated which is another source of those dang duality mirages he is always thinking about. And I started thinking about split-brain patient studies and what those and similar psychological studies say about consciousness - are we describing the inputs and behavior of the body after the fact? I remember learning in high school that researches could manipulate people's behavior and then they would try to convince themselves they had done things for certain reasons after the fact. I think I could easily fall into an internet black hole on those topics, whoa nelly. Then he starts talking about whether time and space dimensions are a property our mind applies to the world so that we can understand it or whether they are an innate property of the world - but to Schrodinger, what is the difference between what our mind tells us it sees of the world and the world itself? So for him, it doesn't matter whether the self applies these dimensions or not, but he thinks the interesting idea is that there are aspects of the ""one thing - mind or world -"" that ""may well be capable of other forms of appearance that we cannot grasp and that do not imply the notions of space and time"" - this makes a bit more space for the idea that there can be some aspect of consciousness that is not tied down by problems of ""before"" and ""after"" for its containing body. It doesn't make it any easier to conceptualize, since we can't really understand what something like that would look like, but it takes some of the finality out of the conclusions I always find myself trapped in. What is certainty when we take out dimensions, after all? (Oof I don't take enough drugs for this book.)Anyway, the questions he's thought through in this book (these lectures, I suppose) are interesting and worth thinking about if you don't mind lying awake in the dark at night. I think sometimes I have so much I want to read that I get afraid of this ambiguous thing called ""wasting time"" and so sometimes I read when I should be taking a thinking break instead. If you're always on intake mode you're never stirring those ideas around. This book made me want to stop and think, even if I didn't see where he was coming from with some of his answers.The short autobiographical section at the end was interesting to me for his description of a time of upheaval in Austria (the end of an empire, the entrance of cars, Nazis), and also for his light touches on seeing St Elmo's Fire, the phosphorescence of the sea, and jellyfish. Ah, the mysteries of the world! He also points out that the way his school did half-days gave him a lot of time to think and to study further the things he was really interested in (and to learn from his father, who he got to spend a lot of time with)."
163,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"This book was written by Schrödinger, one of the most influential physicists to ever live, making important contributions to quantum theory. His equation (Schrödinger equation), calculates the wave function of a system and how it changes across time. This work was based on public lectures from Trinity College in 1943. It's mostly concerned with biology, although it has considerable tangents. he wanted to know how life related to physics and chemistry. It starts by showing why life seems to be so big when compared to atoms. We have around 30 trillion cells. And each cell has an average of 100 trillion atoms. He argues that at small scales, reality is too chaotic to have order. Quantum chaos fluctuations prevent steady natural laws. As a system gets better, such noise gets smaller and smaller. In further chapters, he touches on hereditary, evolution, molecules, entropy and more.Some of it was truly groundbreaking. At the time, how hereditary information was passed was unknown. He made a theoretical prediction that an ""aperiodic crystal"" would store the information required for living things to pass their ""blueprint"" of how the molecules should be organized. This inspired the later discovery of DNA. He was truly a brilliant mind and it was very enjoyable to read his work. I particularly enjoyed his humility and willingness to describe his thought process. The book was written for the layman audience, and he succeeded in doing so. You don't need any background to read, although at times it was nevertheless difficult. Luckily regarding biology and hereditary, I had some previous knowledge that helped, but the few times that he went into mathematical theorems, I was completely lost. The latter part of the book was my favorite. While I enjoyed the rest, it was a times too sciency for my taste. Towards the end it left more technical subjects related to biology and physics and was more concerned with philosophy, especially as it relates to consciousness. What strikes me the most is how well aware he was of the body/mind problem, despite him a physicist. He certainly wasn't blind to a materialistic worldview, and he easily articulates many of its problems when trying to account for consciousness. Some of it I found not the best argued super well, for example when he touched on free will. But his description of qualia, for example, was incredibly well written. He even got a bit mystical at times, which took me completely by surprise, and mentioned the Upanishads (a religious/philosophical text from Hinduism) influenced by Schopenhauer and Huxley's perennial philosophy. He considered a possible ""unified consciousness"", in which each individual experience was only a fraction of the conscious universe, but nevertheless united. It's a brilliant book. The title of it couldn't be more fitting. If you wonder what life is, how can it persist through the marching and endless entropy, or what distinguishes something living from something that is dead, then Schrödinger will walk you through his genius and explain it. A journey through biology, physics, and philosophy from one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century."

It’s a beautiful walk, especially during autumn, when the golden leaves envelop the black tar of the road. At the junction, stands a tall brick coloured building with Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath written in bold, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies - DIAS. The Irish home of the Nobel prize winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger.Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies was established by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, in 1940 to “provide facilities for the furtherance of advanced study and the conduct of research in specialised branches of knowledge”. There are three schools that form the institute - School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic studies. DIAS is arguably best known for hosting the lecture series “What is Life?”, delivered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1943.Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939, Schrödinger had been invited by Éamon de Valera, to help establish the institute. He moved to Clontarf and he lived there until 1955. The lectures were converted into a book titled ‘What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell’ for the layperson.Erwin Schrödinger was a theoretical physicist whose contributions to quantum theory were unparalleled at the time. He is best known for his rather paradoxical thought experiment, involving a cat that is dead and alive at the same time. Famously known as Schrödinger’s cat, this continues to be featured in discussions regarding application of quantum mechanics to everyday objects.But what is little known about Schrödinger is his interest and knowledge of genetics and biology. He was curious about the nature of the cell and what constituted life. In the public lecture series, What is Life, Schrödinger explores these concepts and does so in the language of the lay person. The book was published based on the lecture series in 1944.Schrödinger explores the idea of the cell and of life from the perspective of a physicist. He modestly apologizes to the biologists, time and again, for not considering the biological aspects or constraints while presenting a few of his ideas.What is Life: The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell reads like a science textbook. It begins with a detailed explanation about the significance of large number of atoms coming together and how they form working components in our bodies. He enunciates the idea of cell division better than how I can remember from high school biology. The book then takes on how the concepts of thermodynamics and crystal structures shape cell behavior. And he ends it with his own musings on determinism and free will. If free will exists. What does one mean by ‘I’ and the philosophy of identity.The lecture and the subsequent publication of the book had tremendous impact on understanding the genetic aspects of the DNA. "

Despite being written in the 1940's, before the discovery of DNA, it isn't hard to understand why this piece was influential. Shrödinger's modest perspective, philosophical insights and a tone so humble as making every sentence appear meticulously crafted, is not something found in typical popular-science literature. Known for being his only publication for a lay audience, ""What is Life?"" is an attempt by Schrödinger, not mainly to educate; but to inspire. It is divided into 3 parts, the first containing descriptions of basic physical principles as well as the foundation of living organisms. The second part is a more speculative and abstract presentation of the author's views of life, reality and epistemology. This edition of the book finishes with a 3:rd part entitled ""autobiographical sketches"", which -as suggested by its title- contains information about Schrödinger's own life.Let me begin by discussing the first part by briefly stating that the scope of this review is far too limited to expand on all the interesting tangential thoughts raised be the book. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to pick out some of the most pertinent topics.To emphasize the modesty of his approach, Shrödinger calls himself a naive physicist and starts by challenging the anthropocentric nature of both scientific and philosphical questions. An example is the question ""why are atoms so small?"", which can be contrasted with ""why are human sensory organs not re fined enough to perceive them?"". The latter question is both easier to explain by science (evolutionary adaptation and structure of bio-molecules etc.) and less naive. Indeed, the first question seems rather meaningless and impossible to answer with a scientific approach (as ""why?"" questions in general tend to be). An important point to consider (one that is often overlooked) is the limits of science. Schrödinger addresses this by pointing out the approximate, statistical nature of physical laws; they may be accurate enough to measure the distance to the sun, but the more decimal-places you have, the more uncertain the numbers become. On the smallest of scales, our measurements become inaccurate. But we can nevertheless determine the statistically significant outcomes by testing multiple times. Yet, since our time is also limited (death, more important occupations etc.), the constrains are at both ends of the spectrum; the infinitesimally small and the infinitely large.Although a more pragmatic approach is adopted by physicists (""what matters is what works"", to paraphrase Richard Feynman), it is both interesting and humbling to think about our limitations.Schrödinger also extends his discussion by including biology, and a comparison between quantum jumps (sudden leaps by sub-atomic particles between discrete energy-levels of an atom) with random mutations in the genome. (At this point, I'm not sure if he means that the former is a likely cause for genetic mutations, of it's merely an analogy).Another comparison he makes, is likening aperiodic crystals with chromosomes, both being of an asymmetrical form. I think the intention here is to point to the 'uniqueness' of the fundamental parts that make up a live organism; if we were made from periodic crystals, there would be no basis for diversity on which natural selection could work.But there is also another part of this discussion which, somewhat ironically concerns the stability of the hereditary substance. Despite changing through evolutionary time, the material of our genomes is relatively stable (undergoes only small changes in each generation). On this matter, the author insinuates a physical explanation based on discrete energy levels of molecules, to account for their relatively stable nature.After taking the reader through a rather lengthy discussion (which the previous passages of this review attempted to outline), Shrödinger states his main reason for writing this piece. By merging concepts from his formal occupation, physics, with biochemistry, he leaves open the possibility that yet unknown ""laws of nature"" exist on the biological level.I am not at all clear with what he meant by that, but my speculation is that he was (like many others) puzzled by the apparent fact that living organisms evade the second law of thermodynamics.But the confusion is likely a remnant of a simplistic view without considerations that bodies indeed do produce a net increase in entropy by emitting heat to their environment. Another point he leaves as food for thought, is that ""no detailed information about the functioning of the genetic mechanism can emerge from a description of its structure"". Maybe the laws of physics and chemistry leave something unexplained after all?What follows next is a sketch of opinions on issues that philosophers have been trying to answer for centuries. Although Schrödinger approaches these from his own standpoint, not biased be an occupational background in philosophy or heavy jargon. Central to the questions pondered is that of free will vs. determinism, where the author tries to draw a conclusion from the premises that;i) every living body is subject to the laws of nature, andii) one has the experience of being in control and responsible for one's actions.With inspiration from Schopenhauer and the Upanishads, he describes the ""singularity of consciousness"", which probably seems quite self-evident to any reader of his words, yet still manages to serve as reminder that you are alive and able to interact with the world (at least that's the feeling i got when reading it).It is important to note that the ""singularity of consciousness"" does not mean that there exists only one mind, and that everyone else are only ideas within that mind (solipsism). What Schrödinger meant (if i've read him correctly) is that [i]experience[/i] is always singular, i.s no one has exactly the same experience as someone else, even if the situation in which they find themselves is identical.Through further philosophical rambling, the author reaches the conclusion that the ""barrier"" between a perceiving subject and the object being perceived is and illusion. Although his writing cannot be blamed for being obscure, every time i close the book, my sense of understanding of this seems to disappear. However, there is a strong parallel to the idea that a scientist (by conducting experiments, measuring things, etc.) assumes the hypothesis of an objective world, independent of observation.This may not seem very shocking, but contemporary discoveries and theoretical advances in physics (in which Schrödinger played an important art), introduced a paradox to this fundamental assumption. The implications were basically that features of subatomic particles were dependent on measurement in such a way that if one thing was known, another was by default uncertain.This could possibly be what led Schrödinger to say that the boundary between subject and object is illusory.The last part of the book contains brief autobiographical notes of Schrödinger's life at university, the people he met, and some friendly comments toward family members, especially apologetic to his deceased parents. A little surprising, yet understandable, was the exclusion of personal achievements, (such as the wave-equation and further work on quantum mechanics) and anecdotes about experiences for which he is well-known.I have to conclude with the confession that my mpression of this influential character has shifted after reading What is Life?. Mostly, i think, because of his highly polite and formal attitude, which is quite a rare feature among physicist-authors."
166,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2708448-thomas-herzog,4,"What is Life? ★★★★★Based on a series of lectures Schrödinger gave at a point in time when much was already known about the hereditary substance (i.e.: it is the carrier of hereditary information; it is contained in the chromosomes; it is extremely durable and can be copied perfectly, yet allows for mutations to occur; etc.), but what physical form this substance actually takes was still unknown. Many years before the encoding of DNA and its double-helix structure were eventually discovered, Schrödinger muses on a possible physical structure for encoding the hereditary information, this, he speculates, aperiodic crystal. His analogy with morse code (how ""simple"" codes can encode tremendous amounts of information; see also, obviously: binary coding and the digital age) nicely anticipates the rather simple four-base encoding of DNA, and his remarks on the importance of quantum mechanical rules at the scale of the hereditary substance (whose approximate size was already known) were illuminating, as was his summary of life being something that feeds on low entropy to keep its own entropy from constantly increasing (as things are wont to do).Mind and Matter ★★★Schrödinger's speculations about the interplay of mind and matter. Some interesting thoughts, but all in all too unfocused and unconvincing.But some of you, I am sure, will call this mysticism.As, indeed, do I."

169,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75706676-steve-abreu,5,"Very impressed with Schrödinger’s writing, so scientific, clear and yet easy to understand - my new personal standard for popular science writing. I think ""what is life"" should be separate from ""mind and matter"" as they are largely complete each on their own. While ""what is life"", containing a theoretical account - or prediction - of what is to be expected as the fundamental building blocks of life, is fascinating, I found the ideas in ""mind and matter"" even more thought-provoking and relevant (unsurprisingly so given that DNA has been discovering shortly after the initial publishing and found its way into common knowledge). "
170,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,5,"On ""What is Life?"":One of the most thought-provoking books I've read on the physiochemical basis of life. The book's based on a series of lectures Shrodinger delivered at the Institute for Advance Studies at Trinity College, Dublin in 1943. Shrodinger was writing before the discovery of the structure of DNA ten years later by Watson and Crick, so he is unaware of the gene-bearing nature of DNA. Nevertheless, he is able to deduce with near-perfect precision the kind of molecule that the ""heredity substance"" must be. Above all, it must be a large ""aperiodic solid"" or molecule, capable of an almost miraculous stability, yet also susceptible to small-scale mutations. The virtual permanence of the molecule (the fact that DNA is copied from generation to generation with near-perfect accuracy accounts for the sameness uniting parental organisms with their offspring; the fact that mutations can occur accounts for the difference between living organisms. Such is the DNA molecule. What is it, ultimately, that separates life from inanimate matter? For Shrodinger, it's life's ability to evade the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all closed systems tend toward the disorder and diffusion of energy (i.e., the entropy law). Life feeds on orderly structures, exporting disorderliness out into the universe. Life is that which works against entropy.Shrodinger was a quantum physicist. He was intensely aware of the disturbingly haphazard and random (within circumscribed limits) movement of atomic and subatomic particles. He helped develop the quantum mechanics atomic physicists still use to understand the nature of matter and reality and the very smallest scales. And it's the following paradox that motivated him to write this book: If individual atoms are subject to the haphazard laws of quantum mechanics, and if the heredity substance (the genetic ""code-script,"" as he says) is made up of a tiny number of these atoms, why isn't its molecular structure (a structure that must be EXTREMELY well-ordered in order to preserve genetic information across time) subject to the destructive randomness of quantum forces? In other words, given the randomness of individual atoms, why isn't the hereditary molecule (constituted entirely of atoms) subject to potentially destructive quantum randomness. What initially makes this especially baffling to Shrodinger is the fact that the smaller in scale you go (the more you narrow in on matter), the more disorderly atomic interactions become. If the heredity substance is necessarily tiny, in other words, shouldn't it theoretically be subject to the haphazard movements of quantum physics?It turns our that it shouldn't. Shrodinger resolves his paradox by pointing out that the individual atoms in larger molecules are bound by intensely powerful co-valent bonds, so that, even if atomic activity is disorderly, molecules bind disorderly atoms into orderly conglomerates, which are almost solid-like in their regularity. (Quantum randomness DOES affect the molecular structure, in Shrodinger's view, but only extremely rarely when an ""isomeric transition threshold"" is crossed); it's this stability at the molecular level that makes heredity information or trait-encoding genes possible, which in turn makes life possible. In sum: Shrodinger's main purpose in writing this book is to reconcile the randomness of quantum mechanics with the orderliness of biology. I'm not qualified to comment on the originality of this book, or its effectiveness in legitimizing or ""quantizing"" biology. But he certainly helped bring ""biophysics"" to the fore in the early '50s, inspiring a new generation of scientists, including but not limited to Watson and Crick.""We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it. I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true who aim be lost for ever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them - and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.""- Shrodinger, ""What is Life?"" On ""Mind and Matter"":On ""Autobiographical Sketches"":Told in the manner of an elderly man who sets out to write his life story only to stop midway, realizing that he didn't have the narrative capacities to do it justice or the boldness to reveal some of its more private phases (his ""relations with women""). This, I suppose, will always remain behind the curtain more or less. Though the sketches are dry and incomplete, I appreciate Shrodinger's mustering the wherewithal to follow through on at least a brief picture of his life. He hates chronological biographical accounts but is unable to offer anything more innovative or subtle. No worries, Shrodinger! These were still a pleasure to read."
171,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,5,"I've come across this essay multiple times in the past couple months and each time I'd resolved to read it. 3 months+ isn't so bad. This is the sort of work I wish I had the ambition and seriousness to pick over all the popular nonfiction garbage I stuff my brain with. An actual genius with original ideas communicating them beautifully in the sort of science-loving idea-centric natural-poeticism that we seem to have lost after Feynman. It's not easy to read, the ideas are in their nascent stages and still speculative, the codescript for the idea of a codescript, incomplete, in many places incorrect, and without the closure of a well-planned structural flow that today's nonfiction book would lay out in its development of a topic. In that sense it's more like high quality fiction, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or the sci-fi greats, it demands effort and it rewards attention with layers upon layers of truth, not simply facts but truth, insight into not just reality but the nature of our insight into reality, not just about scientific concepts but the concept of a scientific concept. It's only fitting therefore that it ends with the most meta concept we know, consciousness, itself an infinite recursion since the word itself automatically means the consciousness of consciousness, and so on. The density of ideas and the brevity of their exposition is breathtaking. The epilogue on consciousness alone says everything it needs to say, a book's worth of words in the hands of a less intelligent or more egoistic author, in the space of a few paragraphs. It is possible that's what sets lectures apart from books, they are condensed versions of books worth of learning, a dense representation of the knowledge on offer, to be looked up in detail later. It is more likely that's what sets apart old school geniuses like Schrodinger. I got to the end of the book and was convinced I'd received some spurious abridged cliffnotes copy, I'm so used to ideas being overexplained and developed far beyond the point of maximal marginal returns on exposition. I'm so used to a certain trajectory of information and a certain average ex post facto recce of the total new knowledge received over the hours spent, that when a piece of work like this shows up that totally trounces all benchmarks on these variables, I'm convinced that I've missed a whole lot of empty hours that contribute nothing other than bring down the trajectory to acceptable levels. NotesAnswering deep questions with simple examples (size of atoms and problem of relativity: king who made his arm-length the official distance). As complex as periodic crystals are, aperiodic crystals are that much more, like a patterned wallpaper vs a Raphael tapestry with a divine order unifying zero repetition. Hence organic chemistry (aperiodic crystals) has contributed more to the problem of life than physics (periodic crystals)Atom is 1/5000-1/2000 wavelength of yellow light. Significant because grain of light is smallest thing visible in microscope, so even this has millions of atoms. Trapped by our frame of reference: ‘why are atoms so small’ is really asking ‘why is ratio of us to atoms so large’. What we call thought needs a) orderliness b) interactions with external world (perception) that are also orderly. Need to follow physical laws. But atoms are probabilistic and chaotic, it is from this need for statistical order out of chaos that our order of reality is so vastly above atomic sizeParamagnetism: Boltzmann/Gibb showed Oxygen dipoles get magnetized by field, but why does magnetization double when field is doubled? It is a statistical phenomenon, countered by heat-motion that randomizes atoms and field creating just a slight tendency to prefer acute angle towards field such that over statistical sample, there is alignment. Langevin’s idea of heat entropy vs order, so if temperature is reduced, then magnetization is higher. When temp is close to minimum, then increasing field doesn’t have as high impact on magnetization, close to saturation. Brownian motion: upper layer of droplets slowly sinks with mathematical precision of specific gravity, viscosity, but individual droplets are totally unpredictable, small enough to be impacted by molecular impacts. Bacteria similarly are at the mercy of heat-motion etc. Diffusion: While concentration of 2 substances equalize (movement of molecules from high to low conc) by exact partial differential equation, this is just an approximation. In reality, individual molecules are engaging in random walk, and since in high-conc more are randomly walking, it will follow that in general there is a flow towards the low-conc. Maxwell’s Demon.Square root law of standard error: Error is proportional to inverse square root of sample size N. So sample 100 has 1/10 error, 10%. Sample 1000000 has 1/1000 error. Power of exponential growth of mitosis: Current me is only the 50/60th descendent of single cell egg-me! Mitosis creates 2 copies of each set of chromosomes. But some cells are set aside, reserved to become sex-cells, don’t mitosis much, and just before they’re needed, undergo meiosis, where daughter cells get only 1 copy of chromosomes (haploid), fusing during sex to create a diploid zygote. How my father’s spermatozoa split chromosome during meiosis will define my paternal inheritance of either grandmother or grandfather. But not that simple, because there is frequent crossover. Genes that are far from each other on the strand have higher chance of being crossed over because intersection point lies between them. Studying difference between haploid/diploid can tell us relative positioning of genes coding for a property.How big is a gene? Take physical size of chromosome, establish how many features it codes for, divide, get maximum size of gene (because keep discovering new features, it’s a start point). Turns out to be a cube with edge ~300Angstrom. So a gene is not more than a million or so genes. Not large enough to entail lawful behavior. How marvelous that in a genome you get a 4-dimensional picture not just of an individual, but the development/permanence of that individual in time, across generations!Dangerous mutations usually lurk in background as recessive because don’t do too much damage this way, if dominant they get selected out. That’s why the argument ‘our blood is awesome, we should interbreed’ doesn’t work, the good traits are on the surface and the bad ones are lurking.Need ceteris-paribus conditions to allow good mutations to prove themselves and take root, that’s why mutations are so rare.Most things follow diminishing return curves, true proportionality is rare and remarkable. Radiation causing mutation is proportional, ie first dose and 2nd dose are totally independent. Exact condition is that an ionization just 10 atoms away from the gamete can cause a mutation. It can be passed on to next generation without affecting current individualEnergy states are quantum, not continuous. Start at lowest energy state, absolute zero. Supply heat, increase probability that it jumps. Measured by ‘time of expectation’, how long it takes to jump. This is defined by W/kT (W=energy gap, kT is heat energy of temp T). Strangely exponential relationship. W/kT=30, time is 1/10s. At 60, it is 30,000 years!Statistical theories of heat are full of exponential function, because so highly improbable for certain energy state to be attained randomly. Nernst’s Heat Theorem, 3rd law of thermodynamics, that entropy tends to zero as temperature reaches absolute zero. Remove heat from system and reduce randomness effect. Even at room temperature, the effect of entropy is minimal on chemical reactions. If physics underlies biological phenomena, how to account for free will? One inference is to say I control the physics. I am God. Atman, Brahman.It neatly solves problem of plurality of consciousness that Western philosophy has been trying. Descartes - I exist, single consciousness. Same of everyone else. How to reconcile? 1. It dies with the body, this is intolerable. 2. There is an indivisible eternal soul, in realm of forms. Same as saying plurality is different aspects of single, Maya. "

For it is in relation to the statistical point of view that the structure of the vital parts of living organisms differs so entirely from that of any piece of matter that we physicists and chemists have ever handled physically in our laboratories or mentally at our writing desks the most essential part of a living cell the chromosome fibre may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. In physics we have dealt hitherto only with periodic crystals. To a humble physicist's mind, these are very interesting and complicated objects; they constitute one of the most fascinating and complex material structures by which inanimate nature puzzles his wits. Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal, they are rather plain and dull. Organic chemistry, indeed, in investigating more and more complicated molecules, has come very much nearer to that 'aperiodic crystal' which, in my opinion, is the material carrier of life. And therefore it is small wonder that the organic chemist has already made large and important contributions to the problem of life, whereas the physicist has made next to noneWe now recognize this fundamental law of physics to be just the natural tendency of things to approach the chaotic state (the same tendency that the books of a library or the piles of papers and manuscripts on a writing desk display) unless we obviate it. Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness ( = fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment. that we give off heat is not accidental, but essential. For this is precisely the manner in which we dispose of the surplus entropy we continually produce in our physical life process MIGUEL DE UNAMUNO (quoted from conversation) If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually never says anything at all. from all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics. all physical laws are based on statistics. the interesting statistical type of law, controlling large-scale events, is constituted from the 'dynamical' laws supposed to govern the small-scale events, the interaction of the single atoms and molecules. Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Even in the pathological cases of split consciousness or double personality the two persons alternate, they are never manifest simultaneously Yet each of us has the indisputable impression that the sum total of his own experience and memory forms a unit, quite distinct from that of any other person. He refers to it as 'I'. What is this 'I'? If you analyse it closely you will, I think, find that it is just a little bit more than a collection of single data (experiences and memories), namely the canvas upon which they are collected. And you will, on close introspection, find that what you really mean by 'I' is that ground-stuff upon which they are collected"""

174,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25570776-pi,4,"Reading some of the great minds of the 20th century, of whom Erwin Schrodinger is without a doubt one, is such a treat! You feel getting to know the author personally, with all his kinks and quirks; and Schrodinger has those aplenty: from his excessively high self-esteem, to his not-so-scientific mysticism regarding consciousness. But although this little book has been immensely prescient in predicting the discovery and structure of DNA, referred to by Schrodinger as a type of aperiodic crystal, it has also paved the way for what has been called the central dogma of molecular biology: the idea that information can only pass from DNA to RNA to proteins - never the other way around. This idea, however, has been discredited in recent decades by the amassed evidence to the contrary. Basically, Schrodinger is wrong in saying that physics is ""order from disorder"", but life is somehow different in that it is ""order from order"". Actually, according to our most recent scientific theories, life should also be viewed as (mostly) order from disorder, for it is driven by stochasticity on the micro level all the same. (Anyone interested in reading more on these and similar issues with the gene-centered Neo-Darwinian view on evolution, and the essence of life, I refer to the following recent books: Dance to the Tune of Life: Biological Relativity and The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.)What really makes What is Life?, as well as other writings from science and philosophy, worth a read, however, is not their impact on science and philosophy per se, but their influence on popular culture and literature. For instance, when I was recently reading Wetware by Rudy Rucker, I couldn't fail to notice some of the parallels with Schrodinger's work; especially Rucker's character Berenice discussing the difference in entropy production between different 'bopper' bodies. I might be wrong with this parallel, but I'm pretty sure many sci-fi authors, including Rudy Rucker, have read What is life? and it has influenced their thinking a great deal. In any case, I truly believe reading science and philosophy can significantly bolster your experience when reading anything else, especially sci-fi. So why not go for it?"

176,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"What I expected:Source, CC-BY-NC 2.5What I got:""What is Life?"" is a surprisingly humble take on the problems biology had in the 1940s. Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology)."
177,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"Schrödinger was a very well respected physicist, who gave us a new language to describe the behaviour of the quantum realm. It is thus with skepticism that one might approach a book (essay?) like this, applying quantum theory to biology. But throughout the book what comes through heavily is Schrödinger’s humility – which is a rare character for physicists when discussing biology. Nevertheless, his application of physics-based reasoning manages to justify some facts of biology and populate new ones. As an example, he starts with the somewhat odd question “why is the human body so much bigger than an atom” to expound core points such as whether physics can hope to quantify the behaviour of living systems.Perhaps the most surprising thing is that he actually does provide an answer to the book’s eponymous question: what is life? It is something that consumes negative entropy (i.e order) to stave off it’s own inevitable decay into disorder. In his words, all living things have: an astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos by 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environmentThat is basically saying that we consume food (highly ordered arrangements of molecules) and output it as heat (disorder), in the mean time maintaining our relatively ordered state. This is a wonderfully original perspective, but one that anyone can see to be sensible and according with the facts. On a side note, after reading this I had to read Asimov’s The Last Question again… The second law of thermodynamics is haunting."
178,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10663319-michael-kenning,4,"One thing that I did not realise about this book is that it actually contains three different books: What is Life?, Mind and Matter, and Autobiographical sketches. The first book, What is Life?, gives the reader a very basic understanding of genetics. It is precisely the hereditary substance and the nature of mutation in the genetic substance that encouraged the discovery of the double helix in DNA. It is a most essential read; and despite the fact that it was written by a physicist, it portrays Schrödinger's keen interest and understanding of biological functions—and the incorporation of his own physical knowledge.The second book goes through the consideration of mind and its role in evolution—how the mind may contribute to our (what I consider) continual progression as a species. Although, it is suggested that, like crocodiles and many insects, we have reached, not the peak of evolution (which would imply that we are the best kind of thing—not true), but a sort of plateau which means that we no longer require adjustment; mutations still occur, however. It considers the effects of mind on our various sensual apparatus, and how the memes which are passed down from generation to generation will reflect our capability to survive—what he called a 'feigned Lamarckism'. The considerations are truly inspiring.The autobiographical sketches, although somewhat insightful, contain nothing of interest. It shall only reveal to the reader the process by which Erwin Schrödinger became a scientist, which isn't very interesting; as Schrödinger said himself: 'I am not good at telling stories'."

That extrapolation to human senses also intesting.I did not get everything on the genetics chapters, as I have not studied it in a long time, and did not bother to look it up.Very interesting idea about how life has to ""feed"" on ""negative entropy"" as he calls it, because life is constantly producing entropy (disorder) in the processes to keep it alive (metabolism) and this excess entropy has to be shed or transferred into matter or enegy (it is not that well explained) that is in a state of lower entropy. There is a necessary correlation between the ingested energy and ingested negative entropy that is not explained in the book. I need to look deeper into this.The chapters on deducing the nature of the genetic material I mostly glanced over though he seems to have made pivotal statements which somewhat led to the discovery of the DNA structure. The epilogue on consciousness, the actual reason I read this book, is much less precise logically. I came onto this book because it was stated somewhere else something along the lines of: ""One of the fathers of quantum physics tries to reduce the last bastions of human ignorance to physics, suggests it to be possible for the mechanisms of life, but claims it impossible in the case of consciousnees"".Did not add much to my understanding of the Philosophy of Mind.All in all an interesting read."

Life, for all of our understanding is a square peg in a round hole, it don't make no damn sense essentially. But we try valiantly to make sense of it... for reasons. SO after all the science stuff (which is actually nice refresher on the basics of human chemistry (the notable absence of DNA notwithstanding) we are given a short treatise on how this all affects us as conscious beings. Well my ears perked up at that. Could science be the path I need to follow to kill my arch nemesis the ego? Mr. Schrödinger seems to say to me the same thing a lot of authors have been saying to me lately...namely consciousness, the ego, is a diffusive thing not to be pinned down. He does however tease some theories on the fact that if we do have free will, that means we can manipulate individual atoms, making us walking gods when we make even the tiniest of decisions. But that's countered by the possibility that life is somewhat mechanical in nature and determinism rears its ugly head.I just don't know my dudes. But I will continue the noble pursuit."

What I found most interesting in this book is that shrodinger would repeatedly say stange things such as: The scientific approach does not reveal the human soul, collective consciousness is due to the existence of god, plato was a genius for having invented the theory of forms and even going so far as to quote from Jung and some persian mystics! And my first reaction is to shrug it off as pseudoscience or fiction but then I'd remember im reading a book to the greatest scientists in the modern age! If anyone has the right to declare the scientific approach inadequate it's him. I also find it admirable that although famous as physicist schrodinger was much more.

Complex ideas are explained in very simple manner, by using great analogies in various cases.

192,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3070035-clio,3,"All I knew about Schrodinger before reading this was about his paradoxical cat.I found his writing style a little clunky - I kept getting thrown off when he'd introduce an idea, then say ""and now we can prove that is all haberdash and silly hats"" and then go on to say something that didn't sound any more provable to me than the idea he'd just dismissed. But he did reference a lot of other books that influenced his thoughts that I hadn't read. I think if I go back and read a bunch of that, then come back and read this again, I'd follow him better. He's part of a whole tradition of ideas so it's hard to just take out his ideas and read them out of context (at least if you aren't super comfortable with quantum physics and thinking in paradoxes).In What is Life?, Schrodinger discussed the type of physical laws that he thinks govern life and the difference between statistical laws that produce order from disorder and clockwork/pure mechanical laws that produced order from order. He referenced Max Planck a bunch in that section. He also starts to talk about the Upanishads (and Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy) and the weird paradoxes of consciousness as something like a soul that is tied to one body, a thing that you identify as your Self and think is an individual, thereby distinguishing yourself from other Selves in other bodies - from what I understood in this piece and Mind and Matter, he thinks consciousness can only be one thing and the multiplicity of consciousness we see in Western thought is sort of alike a mirage that arises from our inability to see where our own mind fits into our view of the world since we are using it (or pieces of it) to interpret the world. It has to simplify our world-view by taking itself out of the picture, so our picture is not complete. Schrodinger says ""consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing, produced by a deception (the Indian Maya); the same illusation is produced in a gallery of mirrors, and in the same way Gaurisankar and Mt Everest turned out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" So in the hall of mirrors, we don't know exactly what we are looking at and think we are looking at many different images when really we are seeing one image. From different viewpoints, we may see the same thing and imagine it is different things since it may look slightly different. Although his example here is actually wrong; per the American Geological Society, Gaurisankar and Mt Everest are ""different peaks, thirty-six miles apart,"" as determined in a 1903 survey (ending an approximately 50-year argument about whether they were the same peak). In the same vein, I'm not convinced Schrodinger is right about many of his opinions here, but I think the most interesting part is not necessarily the points he puts forward as solutions but the questions he is trying to answer.He says that we may see the ""I"" within ourselves as distinct and made up of our own individual experiences and memories, but he believes the part that is really ""I"" or the consciousness is not the set of experiences but the ""canvas upon which they are collected"" - if we view consciousness in this way, it is much easier to believe it could all be of one piece. He may not be entirely convincing on any of his points in this book, but I do think he did a good job of dismissing some of the logic that would certainly bar his ideas from being true, so that you can see the things he purports could be true.Schrodinger's ideas on ethics are interesting too; he believes man is subject to a constant ethical evolution along with biological evolution, and that for Man (and each man) there is sort of a battle between the primitive will and our evolving ethical ideals, so that to be ethical we have to be ""self-conquering,"" ""chisel and statue, conquerors and conquered at the same time."" Back on the subject of the mind not really being able to see itself in its concept of the world, he quotes the hell out of Sir Charles Sherrington's Man on His Nature, which he is in love with. ""The mind per se cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand. Then the impasse meets us, the blank of the 'how' of mind, leverage on matter."" - he wonders whether we are the truly the ""doers"" of the deeds for which we feel responsible. Then he goes off on a bunch of tangents about how you can't ""see"" the mind anywhere but that we often think we see it behind someone's eyes, that we often see eyes as more active than the passive sense organs they truly are. Last night I fell asleep wondering if blind people think their minds live behind their eyes, so I guess it is an interesting question. People with different senses may use different symbols. The mind is not truly there in our heads, he reminds us: ""Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held against the life and the emotions of the soul.""He goes on another interesting tangent about how our senses work and how our brain sort of has sub-brains and their data is somehow integrated which is another source of those dang duality mirages he is always thinking about. And I started thinking about split-brain patient studies and what those and similar psychological studies say about consciousness - are we describing the inputs and behavior of the body after the fact? I remember learning in high school that researches could manipulate people's behavior and then they would try to convince themselves they had done things for certain reasons after the fact. I think I could easily fall into an internet black hole on those topics, whoa nelly. Then he starts talking about whether time and space dimensions are a property our mind applies to the world so that we can understand it or whether they are an innate property of the world - but to Schrodinger, what is the difference between what our mind tells us it sees of the world and the world itself? So for him, it doesn't matter whether the self applies these dimensions or not, but he thinks the interesting idea is that there are aspects of the ""one thing - mind or world -"" that ""may well be capable of other forms of appearance that we cannot grasp and that do not imply the notions of space and time"" - this makes a bit more space for the idea that there can be some aspect of consciousness that is not tied down by problems of ""before"" and ""after"" for its containing body. It doesn't make it any easier to conceptualize, since we can't really understand what something like that would look like, but it takes some of the finality out of the conclusions I always find myself trapped in. What is certainty when we take out dimensions, after all? (Oof I don't take enough drugs for this book.)Anyway, the questions he's thought through in this book (these lectures, I suppose) are interesting and worth thinking about if you don't mind lying awake in the dark at night. I think sometimes I have so much I want to read that I get afraid of this ambiguous thing called ""wasting time"" and so sometimes I read when I should be taking a thinking break instead. If you're always on intake mode you're never stirring those ideas around. This book made me want to stop and think, even if I didn't see where he was coming from with some of his answers.The short autobiographical section at the end was interesting to me for his description of a time of upheaval in Austria (the end of an empire, the entrance of cars, Nazis), and also for his light touches on seeing St Elmo's Fire, the phosphorescence of the sea, and jellyfish. Ah, the mysteries of the world! He also points out that the way his school did half-days gave him a lot of time to think and to study further the things he was really interested in (and to learn from his father, who he got to spend a lot of time with)."
193,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"This book was written by Schrödinger, one of the most influential physicists to ever live, making important contributions to quantum theory. His equation (Schrödinger equation), calculates the wave function of a system and how it changes across time. This work was based on public lectures from Trinity College in 1943. It's mostly concerned with biology, although it has considerable tangents. he wanted to know how life related to physics and chemistry. It starts by showing why life seems to be so big when compared to atoms. We have around 30 trillion cells. And each cell has an average of 100 trillion atoms. He argues that at small scales, reality is too chaotic to have order. Quantum chaos fluctuations prevent steady natural laws. As a system gets better, such noise gets smaller and smaller. In further chapters, he touches on hereditary, evolution, molecules, entropy and more.Some of it was truly groundbreaking. At the time, how hereditary information was passed was unknown. He made a theoretical prediction that an ""aperiodic crystal"" would store the information required for living things to pass their ""blueprint"" of how the molecules should be organized. This inspired the later discovery of DNA. He was truly a brilliant mind and it was very enjoyable to read his work. I particularly enjoyed his humility and willingness to describe his thought process. The book was written for the layman audience, and he succeeded in doing so. You don't need any background to read, although at times it was nevertheless difficult. Luckily regarding biology and hereditary, I had some previous knowledge that helped, but the few times that he went into mathematical theorems, I was completely lost. The latter part of the book was my favorite. While I enjoyed the rest, it was a times too sciency for my taste. Towards the end it left more technical subjects related to biology and physics and was more concerned with philosophy, especially as it relates to consciousness. What strikes me the most is how well aware he was of the body/mind problem, despite him a physicist. He certainly wasn't blind to a materialistic worldview, and he easily articulates many of its problems when trying to account for consciousness. Some of it I found not the best argued super well, for example when he touched on free will. But his description of qualia, for example, was incredibly well written. He even got a bit mystical at times, which took me completely by surprise, and mentioned the Upanishads (a religious/philosophical text from Hinduism) influenced by Schopenhauer and Huxley's perennial philosophy. He considered a possible ""unified consciousness"", in which each individual experience was only a fraction of the conscious universe, but nevertheless united. It's a brilliant book. The title of it couldn't be more fitting. If you wonder what life is, how can it persist through the marching and endless entropy, or what distinguishes something living from something that is dead, then Schrödinger will walk you through his genius and explain it. A journey through biology, physics, and philosophy from one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century."

It’s a beautiful walk, especially during autumn, when the golden leaves envelop the black tar of the road. At the junction, stands a tall brick coloured building with Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath written in bold, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies - DIAS. The Irish home of the Nobel prize winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger.Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies was established by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, in 1940 to “provide facilities for the furtherance of advanced study and the conduct of research in specialised branches of knowledge”. There are three schools that form the institute - School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic studies. DIAS is arguably best known for hosting the lecture series “What is Life?”, delivered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1943.Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939, Schrödinger had been invited by Éamon de Valera, to help establish the institute. He moved to Clontarf and he lived there until 1955. The lectures were converted into a book titled ‘What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell’ for the layperson.Erwin Schrödinger was a theoretical physicist whose contributions to quantum theory were unparalleled at the time. He is best known for his rather paradoxical thought experiment, involving a cat that is dead and alive at the same time. Famously known as Schrödinger’s cat, this continues to be featured in discussions regarding application of quantum mechanics to everyday objects.But what is little known about Schrödinger is his interest and knowledge of genetics and biology. He was curious about the nature of the cell and what constituted life. In the public lecture series, What is Life, Schrödinger explores these concepts and does so in the language of the lay person. The book was published based on the lecture series in 1944.Schrödinger explores the idea of the cell and of life from the perspective of a physicist. He modestly apologizes to the biologists, time and again, for not considering the biological aspects or constraints while presenting a few of his ideas.What is Life: The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell reads like a science textbook. It begins with a detailed explanation about the significance of large number of atoms coming together and how they form working components in our bodies. He enunciates the idea of cell division better than how I can remember from high school biology. The book then takes on how the concepts of thermodynamics and crystal structures shape cell behavior. And he ends it with his own musings on determinism and free will. If free will exists. What does one mean by ‘I’ and the philosophy of identity.The lecture and the subsequent publication of the book had tremendous impact on understanding the genetic aspects of the DNA. "
195,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8122302-neko,4,"(Quite a lengthy review i wrote in English class) This book has served as a source of inspiration for many scientists, especially biologists converted from the field of physics. Despite being written in the 1940's, before the discovery of DNA, it isn't hard to understand why this piece was influential. Shrödinger's modest perspective, philosophical insights and a tone so humble as making every sentence appear meticulously crafted, is not something found in typical popular-science literature. Known for being his only publication for a lay audience, ""What is Life?"" is an attempt by Schrödinger, not mainly to educate; but to inspire. It is divided into 3 parts, the first containing descriptions of basic physical principles as well as the foundation of living organisms. The second part is a more speculative and abstract presentation of the author's views of life, reality and epistemology. This edition of the book finishes with a 3:rd part entitled ""autobiographical sketches"", which -as suggested by its title- contains information about Schrödinger's own life.Let me begin by discussing the first part by briefly stating that the scope of this review is far too limited to expand on all the interesting tangential thoughts raised be the book. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to pick out some of the most pertinent topics.To emphasize the modesty of his approach, Shrödinger calls himself a naive physicist and starts by challenging the anthropocentric nature of both scientific and philosphical questions. An example is the question ""why are atoms so small?"", which can be contrasted with ""why are human sensory organs not re fined enough to perceive them?"". The latter question is both easier to explain by science (evolutionary adaptation and structure of bio-molecules etc.) and less naive. Indeed, the first question seems rather meaningless and impossible to answer with a scientific approach (as ""why?"" questions in general tend to be). An important point to consider (one that is often overlooked) is the limits of science. Schrödinger addresses this by pointing out the approximate, statistical nature of physical laws; they may be accurate enough to measure the distance to the sun, but the more decimal-places you have, the more uncertain the numbers become. On the smallest of scales, our measurements become inaccurate. But we can nevertheless determine the statistically significant outcomes by testing multiple times. Yet, since our time is also limited (death, more important occupations etc.), the constrains are at both ends of the spectrum; the infinitesimally small and the infinitely large.Although a more pragmatic approach is adopted by physicists (""what matters is what works"", to paraphrase Richard Feynman), it is both interesting and humbling to think about our limitations.Schrödinger also extends his discussion by including biology, and a comparison between quantum jumps (sudden leaps by sub-atomic particles between discrete energy-levels of an atom) with random mutations in the genome. (At this point, I'm not sure if he means that the former is a likely cause for genetic mutations, of it's merely an analogy).Another comparison he makes, is likening aperiodic crystals with chromosomes, both being of an asymmetrical form. I think the intention here is to point to the 'uniqueness' of the fundamental parts that make up a live organism; if we were made from periodic crystals, there would be no basis for diversity on which natural selection could work.But there is also another part of this discussion which, somewhat ironically concerns the stability of the hereditary substance. Despite changing through evolutionary time, the material of our genomes is relatively stable (undergoes only small changes in each generation). On this matter, the author insinuates a physical explanation based on discrete energy levels of molecules, to account for their relatively stable nature.After taking the reader through a rather lengthy discussion (which the previous passages of this review attempted to outline), Shrödinger states his main reason for writing this piece. By merging concepts from his formal occupation, physics, with biochemistry, he leaves open the possibility that yet unknown ""laws of nature"" exist on the biological level.I am not at all clear with what he meant by that, but my speculation is that he was (like many others) puzzled by the apparent fact that living organisms evade the second law of thermodynamics.But the confusion is likely a remnant of a simplistic view without considerations that bodies indeed do produce a net increase in entropy by emitting heat to their environment. Another point he leaves as food for thought, is that ""no detailed information about the functioning of the genetic mechanism can emerge from a description of its structure"". Maybe the laws of physics and chemistry leave something unexplained after all?What follows next is a sketch of opinions on issues that philosophers have been trying to answer for centuries. Although Schrödinger approaches these from his own standpoint, not biased be an occupational background in philosophy or heavy jargon. Central to the questions pondered is that of free will vs. determinism, where the author tries to draw a conclusion from the premises that;i) every living body is subject to the laws of nature, andii) one has the experience of being in control and responsible for one's actions.With inspiration from Schopenhauer and the Upanishads, he describes the ""singularity of consciousness"", which probably seems quite self-evident to any reader of his words, yet still manages to serve as reminder that you are alive and able to interact with the world (at least that's the feeling i got when reading it).It is important to note that the ""singularity of consciousness"" does not mean that there exists only one mind, and that everyone else are only ideas within that mind (solipsism). What Schrödinger meant (if i've read him correctly) is that [i]experience[/i] is always singular, i.s no one has exactly the same experience as someone else, even if the situation in which they find themselves is identical.Through further philosophical rambling, the author reaches the conclusion that the ""barrier"" between a perceiving subject and the object being perceived is and illusion. Although his writing cannot be blamed for being obscure, every time i close the book, my sense of understanding of this seems to disappear. However, there is a strong parallel to the idea that a scientist (by conducting experiments, measuring things, etc.) assumes the hypothesis of an objective world, independent of observation.This may not seem very shocking, but contemporary discoveries and theoretical advances in physics (in which Schrödinger played an important art), introduced a paradox to this fundamental assumption. The implications were basically that features of subatomic particles were dependent on measurement in such a way that if one thing was known, another was by default uncertain.This could possibly be what led Schrödinger to say that the boundary between subject and object is illusory.The last part of the book contains brief autobiographical notes of Schrödinger's life at university, the people he met, and some friendly comments toward family members, especially apologetic to his deceased parents. A little surprising, yet understandable, was the exclusion of personal achievements, (such as the wave-equation and further work on quantum mechanics) and anecdotes about experiences for which he is well-known.I have to conclude with the confession that my mpression of this influential character has shifted after reading What is Life?. Mostly, i think, because of his highly polite and formal attitude, which is quite a rare feature among physicist-authors."
196,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2708448-thomas-herzog,4,"What is Life? ★★★★★Based on a series of lectures Schrödinger gave at a point in time when much was already known about the hereditary substance (i.e.: it is the carrier of hereditary information; it is contained in the chromosomes; it is extremely durable and can be copied perfectly, yet allows for mutations to occur; etc.), but what physical form this substance actually takes was still unknown. Many years before the encoding of DNA and its double-helix structure were eventually discovered, Schrödinger muses on a possible physical structure for encoding the hereditary information, this, he speculates, aperiodic crystal. His analogy with morse code (how ""simple"" codes can encode tremendous amounts of information; see also, obviously: binary coding and the digital age) nicely anticipates the rather simple four-base encoding of DNA, and his remarks on the importance of quantum mechanical rules at the scale of the hereditary substance (whose approximate size was already known) were illuminating, as was his summary of life being something that feeds on low entropy to keep its own entropy from constantly increasing (as things are wont to do).Mind and Matter ★★★Schrödinger's speculations about the interplay of mind and matter.

Shrodinger was writing before the discovery of the structure of DNA ten years later by Watson and Crick, so he is unaware of the gene-bearing nature of DNA. Nevertheless, he is able to deduce with near-perfect precision the kind of molecule that the ""heredity substance"" must be. Above all, it must be a large ""aperiodic solid"" or molecule, capable of an almost miraculous stability, yet also susceptible to small-scale mutations. The virtual permanence of the molecule (the fact that DNA is copied from generation to generation with near-perfect accuracy accounts for the sameness uniting parental organisms with their offspring; the fact that mutations can occur accounts for the difference between living organisms. Such is the DNA molecule. What is it, ultimately, that separates life from inanimate matter? For Shrodinger, it's life's ability to evade the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all closed systems tend toward the disorder and diffusion of energy (i.e., the entropy law). Life feeds on orderly structures, exporting disorderliness out into the universe. Life is that which works against entropy.Shrodinger was a quantum physicist. He was intensely aware of the disturbingly haphazard and random (within circumscribed limits) movement of atomic and subatomic particles. He helped develop the quantum mechanics atomic physicists still use to understand the nature of matter and reality and the very smallest scales. And it's the following paradox that motivated him to write this book: If individual atoms are subject to the haphazard laws of quantum mechanics, and if the heredity substance (the genetic ""code-script,"" as he says) is made up of a tiny number of these atoms, why isn't its molecular structure (a structure that must be EXTREMELY well-ordered in order to preserve genetic information across time) subject to the destructive randomness of quantum forces? In other words, given the randomness of individual atoms, why isn't the hereditary molecule (constituted entirely of atoms) subject to potentially destructive quantum randomness. What initially makes this especially baffling to Shrodinger is the fact that the smaller in scale you go (the more you narrow in on matter), the more disorderly atomic interactions become. If the heredity substance is necessarily tiny, in other words, shouldn't it theoretically be subject to the haphazard movements of quantum physics?It turns our that it shouldn't. Shrodinger resolves his paradox by pointing out that the individual atoms in larger molecules are bound by intensely powerful co-valent bonds, so that, even if atomic activity is disorderly, molecules bind disorderly atoms into orderly conglomerates, which are almost solid-like in their regularity. (Quantum randomness DOES affect the molecular structure, in Shrodinger's view, but only extremely rarely when an ""isomeric transition threshold"" is crossed); it's this stability at the molecular level that makes heredity information or trait-encoding genes possible, which in turn makes life possible. In sum: Shrodinger's main purpose in writing this book is to reconcile the randomness of quantum mechanics with the orderliness of biology. I'm not qualified to comment on the originality of this book, or its effectiveness in legitimizing or ""quantizing"" biology. But he certainly helped bring ""biophysics"" to the fore in the early '50s, inspiring a new generation of scientists, including but not limited to Watson and Crick.""We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it. I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true who aim be lost for ever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them - and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.""- Shrodinger, ""What is Life?"" On ""Mind and Matter"":On ""Autobiographical Sketches"":Told in the manner of an elderly man who sets out to write his life story only to stop midway, realizing that he didn't have the narrative capacities to do it justice or the boldness to reveal some of its more private phases (his ""relations with women""). This, I suppose, will always remain behind the curtain more or less. Though the sketches are dry and incomplete, I appreciate Shrodinger's mustering the wherewithal to follow through on at least a brief picture of his life. He hates chronological biographical accounts but is unable to offer anything more innovative or subtle. No worries, Shrodinger! These were still a pleasure to read."
201,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,5,"I've come across this essay multiple times in the past couple months and each time I'd resolved to read it. 3 months+ isn't so bad. This is the sort of work I wish I had the ambition and seriousness to pick over all the popular nonfiction garbage I stuff my brain with. An actual genius with original ideas communicating them beautifully in the sort of science-loving idea-centric natural-poeticism that we seem to have lost after Feynman. It's not easy to read, the ideas are in their nascent stages and still speculative, the codescript for the idea of a codescript, incomplete, in many places incorrect, and without the closure of a well-planned structural flow that today's nonfiction book would lay out in its development of a topic. In that sense it's more like high quality fiction, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or the sci-fi greats, it demands effort and it rewards attention with layers upon layers of truth, not simply facts but truth, insight into not just reality but the nature of our insight into reality, not just about scientific concepts but the concept of a scientific concept. It's only fitting therefore that it ends with the most meta concept we know, consciousness, itself an infinite recursion since the word itself automatically means the consciousness of consciousness, and so on. The density of ideas and the brevity of their exposition is breathtaking. The epilogue on consciousness alone says everything it needs to say, a book's worth of words in the hands of a less intelligent or more egoistic author, in the space of a few paragraphs. It is possible that's what sets lectures apart from books, they are condensed versions of books worth of learning, a dense representation of the knowledge on offer, to be looked up in detail later. It is more likely that's what sets apart old school geniuses like Schrodinger. I got to the end of the book and was convinced I'd received some spurious abridged cliffnotes copy, I'm so used to ideas being overexplained and developed far beyond the point of maximal marginal returns on exposition. I'm so used to a certain trajectory of information and a certain average ex post facto recce of the total new knowledge received over the hours spent, that when a piece of work like this shows up that totally trounces all benchmarks on these variables, I'm convinced that I've missed a whole lot of empty hours that contribute nothing other than bring down the trajectory to acceptable levels. NotesAnswering deep questions with simple examples (size of atoms and problem of relativity: king who made his arm-length the official distance). As complex as periodic crystals are, aperiodic crystals are that much more, like a patterned wallpaper vs a Raphael tapestry with a divine order unifying zero repetition. Hence organic chemistry (aperiodic crystals) has contributed more to the problem of life than physics (periodic crystals)Atom is 1/5000-1/2000 wavelength of yellow light. Significant because grain of light is smallest thing visible in microscope, so even this has millions of atoms. Trapped by our frame of reference: ‘why are atoms so small’ is really asking ‘why is ratio of us to atoms so large’. What we call thought needs a) orderliness b) interactions with external world (perception) that are also orderly. Need to follow physical laws. But atoms are probabilistic and chaotic, it is from this need for statistical order out of chaos that our order of reality is so vastly above atomic sizeParamagnetism: Boltzmann/Gibb showed Oxygen dipoles get magnetized by field, but why does magnetization double when field is doubled? It is a statistical phenomenon, countered by heat-motion that randomizes atoms and field creating just a slight tendency to prefer acute angle towards field such that over statistical sample, there is alignment. Langevin’s idea of heat entropy vs order, so if temperature is reduced, then magnetization is higher. When temp is close to minimum, then increasing field doesn’t have as high impact on magnetization, close to saturation. Brownian motion: upper layer of droplets slowly sinks with mathematical precision of specific gravity, viscosity, but individual droplets are totally unpredictable, small enough to be impacted by molecular impacts. Bacteria similarly are at the mercy of heat-motion etc. Diffusion: While concentration of 2 substances equalize (movement of molecules from high to low conc) by exact partial differential equation, this is just an approximation. In reality, individual molecules are engaging in random walk, and since in high-conc more are randomly walking, it will follow that in general there is a flow towards the low-conc. Maxwell’s Demon.Square root law of standard error: Error is proportional to inverse square root of sample size N. So sample 100 has 1/10 error, 10%. Sample 1000000 has 1/1000 error. Power of exponential growth of mitosis: Current me is only the 50/60th descendent of single cell egg-me! Mitosis creates 2 copies of each set of chromosomes. But some cells are set aside, reserved to become sex-cells, don’t mitosis much, and just before they’re needed, undergo meiosis, where daughter cells get only 1 copy of chromosomes (haploid), fusing during sex to create a diploid zygote. How my father’s spermatozoa split chromosome during meiosis will define my paternal inheritance of either grandmother or grandfather. But not that simple, because there is frequent crossover. Genes that are far from each other on the strand have higher chance of being crossed over because intersection point lies between them. Studying difference between haploid/diploid can tell us relative positioning of genes coding for a property.How big is a gene? Take physical size of chromosome, establish how many features it codes for, divide, get maximum size of gene (because keep discovering new features, it’s a start point). Turns out to be a cube with edge ~300Angstrom. So a gene is not more than a million or so genes. Not large enough to entail lawful behavior. How marvelous that in a genome you get a 4-dimensional picture not just of an individual, but the development/permanence of that individual in time, across generations!Dangerous mutations usually lurk in background as recessive because don’t do too much damage this way, if dominant they get selected out. That’s why the argument ‘our blood is awesome, we should interbreed’ doesn’t work, the good traits are on the surface and the bad ones are lurking.Need ceteris-paribus conditions to allow good mutations to prove themselves and take root, that’s why mutations are so rare.Most things follow diminishing return curves, true proportionality is rare and remarkable. Radiation causing mutation is proportional, ie first dose and 2nd dose are totally independent. Exact condition is that an ionization just 10 atoms away from the gamete can cause a mutation. It can be passed on to next generation without affecting current individualEnergy states are quantum, not continuous. Start at lowest energy state, absolute zero. Supply heat, increase probability that it jumps. Measured by ‘time of expectation’, how long it takes to jump. This is defined by W/kT (W=energy gap, kT is heat energy of temp T). Strangely exponential relationship. W/kT=30, time is 1/10s. At 60, it is 30,000 years!Statistical theories of heat are full of exponential function, because so highly improbable for certain energy state to be attained randomly. Nernst’s Heat Theorem, 3rd law of thermodynamics, that entropy tends to zero as temperature reaches absolute zero. Remove heat from system and reduce randomness effect. Even at room temperature, the effect of entropy is minimal on chemical reactions. If physics underlies biological phenomena, how to account for free will? One inference is to say I control the physics. I am God. Atman, Brahman.It neatly solves problem of plurality of consciousness that Western philosophy has been trying. Descartes - I exist, single consciousness. Same of everyone else. How to reconcile? 1. It dies with the body, this is intolerable. 2. There is an indivisible eternal soul, in realm of forms. Same as saying plurality is different aspects of single, Maya. "
202,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18775997-lucas,4,"A collection of quotes and sections from the book that I enjoyed:""The laws of physics and chemistry are statistical throughout. For it is in relation to the statistical point of view that the structure of the vital parts of living organisms differs so entirely from that of any piece of matter that we physicists and chemists have ever handled physically in our laboratories or mentally at our writing desks the most essential part of a living cell the chromosome fibre may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. In physics we have dealt hitherto only with periodic crystals. To a humble physicist's mind, these are very interesting and complicated objects; they constitute one of the most fascinating and complex material structures by which inanimate nature puzzles his wits. Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal, they are rather plain and dull. Organic chemistry, indeed, in investigating more and more complicated molecules, has come very much nearer to that 'aperiodic crystal' which, in my opinion, is the material carrier of life. And therefore it is small wonder that the organic chemist has already made large and important contributions to the problem of life, whereas the physicist has made next to noneWe now recognize this fundamental law of physics to be just the natural tendency of things to approach the chaotic state (the same tendency that the books of a library or the piles of papers and manuscripts on a writing desk display) unless we obviate it. Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness ( = fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment. that we give off heat is not accidental, but essential. For this is precisely the manner in which we dispose of the surplus entropy we continually produce in our physical life process MIGUEL DE UNAMUNO (quoted from conversation) If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually never says anything at all. from all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics. all physical laws are based on statistics. the interesting statistical type of law, controlling large-scale events, is constituted from the 'dynamical' laws supposed to govern the small-scale events, the interaction of the single atoms and molecules. Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Even in the pathological cases of split consciousness or double personality the two persons alternate, they are never manifest simultaneously Yet each of us has the indisputable impression that the sum total of his own experience and memory forms a unit, quite distinct from that of any other person. He refers to it as 'I'. What is this 'I'? If you analyse it closely you will, I think, find that it is just a little bit more than a collection of single data (experiences and memories), namely the canvas upon which they are collected. And you will, on close introspection, find that what you really mean by 'I' is that ground-stuff upon which they are collected"""
203,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26686799-joel-croteau,4,"An excellent book that does not require any particular scientific background, and quite insightful if you can decipher Schrödinger's chronic run-on sentences."
204,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25570776-pi,4,"Reading some of the great minds of the 20th century, of whom Erwin Schrodinger is without a doubt one, is such a treat! You feel getting to know the author personally, with all his kinks and quirks; and Schrodinger has those aplenty: from his excessively high self-esteem, to his not-so-scientific mysticism regarding consciousness. But although this little book has been immensely prescient in predicting the discovery and structure of DNA, referred to by Schrodinger as a type of aperiodic crystal, it has also paved the way for what has been called the central dogma of molecular biology: the idea that information can only pass from DNA to RNA to proteins - never the other way around. This idea, however, has been discredited in recent decades by the amassed evidence to the contrary. Basically, Schrodinger is wrong in saying that physics is ""order from disorder"", but life is somehow different in that it is ""order from order"". Actually, according to our most recent scientific theories, life should also be viewed as (mostly) order from disorder, for it is driven by stochasticity on the micro level all the same. (Anyone interested in reading more on these and similar issues with the gene-centered Neo-Darwinian view on evolution, and the essence of life, I refer to the following recent books: Dance to the Tune of Life: Biological Relativity and The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.)What really makes What is Life?, as well as other writings from science and philosophy, worth a read, however, is not their impact on science and philosophy per se, but their influence on popular culture and literature. For instance, when I was recently reading Wetware by Rudy Rucker, I couldn't fail to notice some of the parallels with Schrodinger's work; especially Rucker's character Berenice discussing the difference in entropy production between different 'bopper' bodies. I might be wrong with this parallel, but I'm pretty sure many sci-fi authors, including Rudy Rucker, have read What is life? and it has influenced their thinking a great deal. In any case, I truly believe reading science and philosophy can significantly bolster your experience when reading anything else, especially sci-fi. So why not go for it?"
205,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65278991-aadeshnpn,4,Not easy to read but totally worth it. Found new perspective about what is life.
206,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"What I expected:Source, CC-BY-NC 2.5What I got:""What is Life?"" is a surprisingly humble take on the problems biology had in the 1940s. Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology)."
207,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"Schrödinger was a very well respected physicist, who gave us a new language to describe the behaviour of the quantum realm. It is thus with skepticism that one might approach a book (essay?) like this, applying quantum theory to biology. But throughout the book what comes through heavily is Schrödinger’s humility – which is a rare character for physicists when discussing biology. Nevertheless, his application of physics-based reasoning manages to justify some facts of biology and populate new ones. As an example, he starts with the somewhat odd question “why is the human body so much bigger than an atom” to expound core points such as whether physics can hope to quantify the behaviour of living systems.Perhaps the most surprising thing is that he actually does provide an answer to the book’s eponymous question: what is life? It is something that consumes negative entropy (i.e order) to stave off it’s own inevitable decay into disorder. In his words, all living things have: an astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos by 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environmentThat is basically saying that we consume food (highly ordered arrangements of molecules) and output it as heat (disorder), in the mean time maintaining our relatively ordered state. This is a wonderfully original perspective, but one that anyone can see to be sensible and according with the facts. On a side note, after reading this I had to read Asimov’s The Last Question again… The second law of thermodynamics is haunting."
208,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10663319-michael-kenning,4,"One thing that I did not realise about this book is that it actually contains three different books: What is Life?, Mind and Matter, and Autobiographical sketches. The first book, What is Life?, gives the reader a very basic understanding of genetics. It is precisely the hereditary substance and the nature of mutation in the genetic substance that encouraged the discovery of the double helix in DNA. It is a most essential read; and despite the fact that it was written by a physicist, it portrays Schrödinger's keen interest and understanding of biological functions—and the incorporation of his own physical knowledge.The second book goes through the consideration of mind and its role in evolution—how the mind may contribute to our (what I consider) continual progression as a species. Although, it is suggested that, like crocodiles and many insects, we have reached, not the peak of evolution (which would imply that we are the best kind of thing—not true), but a sort of plateau which means that we no longer require adjustment; mutations still occur, however. It considers the effects of mind on our various sensual apparatus, and how the memes which are passed down from generation to generation will reflect our capability to survive—what he called a 'feigned Lamarckism'. The considerations are truly inspiring.The autobiographical sketches, although somewhat insightful, contain nothing of interest. It shall only reveal to the reader the process by which Erwin Schrödinger became a scientist, which isn't very interesting; as Schrödinger said himself: 'I am not good at telling stories'."
209,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31677006-kaio,4,"These are personal notes that did not fit into the appropriate section.Interesting initial chapters on why most laws are only statistical in nature and describe things in good approximation only because of the sheer number of single ""things"" that behave according to exact laws. That extrapolation to human senses also intesting.I did not get everything on the genetics chapters, as I have not studied it in a long time, and did not bother to look it up.Very interesting idea about how life has to ""feed"" on ""negative entropy"" as he calls it, because life is constantly producing entropy (disorder) in the processes to keep it alive (metabolism) and this excess entropy has to be shed or transferred into matter or enegy (it is not that well explained) that is in a state of lower entropy. There is a necessary correlation between the ingested energy and ingested negative entropy that is not explained in the book. I need to look deeper into this.The chapters on deducing the nature of the genetic material I mostly glanced over though he seems to have made pivotal statements which somewhat led to the discovery of the DNA structure. The epilogue on consciousness, the actual reason I read this book, is much less precise logically. I came onto this book because it was stated somewhere else something along the lines of: ""One of the fathers of quantum physics tries to reduce the last bastions of human ignorance to physics, suggests it to be possible for the mechanisms of life, but claims it impossible in the case of consciousnees"".Did not add much to my understanding of the Philosophy of Mind.All in all an interesting read."
210,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77151581-shawn,3,"Definitely dated but obviously on the right path, this book combines biology, physics, and chemistry to try an answer the question of how if it's so small our genetic molecules defy natural law and act in a uniform manor. So step by step the the reader is hand held with all the complicated maths tucked away and only brought out when absolutely necessary to avoid that awfulness until at the end one is left with an interesting proposition: what kind of weird law defying miracle are made of? Life, for all of our understanding is a square peg in a round hole, it don't make no damn sense essentially. But we try valiantly to make sense of it... for reasons. SO after all the science stuff (which is actually nice refresher on the basics of human chemistry (the notable absence of DNA notwithstanding) we are given a short treatise on how this all affects us as conscious beings. Well my ears perked up at that. Could science be the path I need to follow to kill my arch nemesis the ego? Mr. Schrödinger seems to say to me the same thing a lot of authors have been saying to me lately...namely consciousness, the ego, is a diffusive thing not to be pinned down. He does however tease some theories on the fact that if we do have free will, that means we can manipulate individual atoms, making us walking gods when we make even the tiniest of decisions. But that's countered by the possibility that life is somewhat mechanical in nature and determinism rears its ugly head.I just don't know my dudes. But I will continue the noble pursuit."

I found ot very enlightening as shrodinger repeatedly approached mainstream issues with an unusual method. How do you distinguish life from death? Easy just use the second law of thermodynamics! What I found most interesting in this book is that shrodinger would repeatedly say stange things such as: The scientific approach does not reveal the human soul, collective consciousness is due to the existence of god, plato was a genius for having invented the theory of forms and even going so far as to quote from Jung and some persian mystics! And my first reaction is to shrug it off as pseudoscience or fiction but then I'd remember im reading a book to the greatest scientists in the modern age! If anyone has the right to declare the scientific approach inadequate it's him. I also find it admirable that although famous as physicist schrodinger was much more. He is a chemist, biologists, playboy and philosopher. A truly admirable man."

I can see why the field of molecular biology would be so fascinating to those who would come after, using Schrodinger's ""aperiodic crystal"" as their template for what to seek in their eventual discovery of DNA (another win for the predictive power of science).

Even then, I found some portions of the book a little difficult to comprehend. I think it is more to do with the sentence construction used in the book and not actually because of the complexity of the ideas conveyed. Complex ideas are explained in very simple manner, by using great analogies in various cases. In all, it is a great book which, I believe, should be made available to high school students when they actually learn these topics, albeit as different subjects.

But then, he argues that things are really not so different. I think this book, short though it is, may take another read before I can fully grasp what he was getting at.

222,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3070035-clio,3,"All I knew about Schrodinger before reading this was about his paradoxical cat.I found his writing style a little clunky - I kept getting thrown off when he'd introduce an idea, then say ""and now we can prove that is all haberdash and silly hats"" and then go on to say something that didn't sound any more provable to me than the idea he'd just dismissed. But he did reference a lot of other books that influenced his thoughts that I hadn't read. I think if I go back and read a bunch of that, then come back and read this again, I'd follow him better. He's part of a whole tradition of ideas so it's hard to just take out his ideas and read them out of context (at least if you aren't super comfortable with quantum physics and thinking in paradoxes).In What is Life?, Schrodinger discussed the type of physical laws that he thinks govern life and the difference between statistical laws that produce order from disorder and clockwork/pure mechanical laws that produced order from order. He referenced Max Planck a bunch in that section. He also starts to talk about the Upanishads (and Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy) and the weird paradoxes of consciousness as something like a soul that is tied to one body, a thing that you identify as your Self and think is an individual, thereby distinguishing yourself from other Selves in other bodies - from what I understood in this piece and Mind and Matter, he thinks consciousness can only be one thing and the multiplicity of consciousness we see in Western thought is sort of alike a mirage that arises from our inability to see where our own mind fits into our view of the world since we are using it (or pieces of it) to interpret the world. It has to simplify our world-view by taking itself out of the picture, so our picture is not complete. Schrodinger says ""consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing, produced by a deception (the Indian Maya); the same illusation is produced in a gallery of mirrors, and in the same way Gaurisankar and Mt Everest turned out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" So in the hall of mirrors, we don't know exactly what we are looking at and think we are looking at many different images when really we are seeing one image. From different viewpoints, we may see the same thing and imagine it is different things since it may look slightly different. Although his example here is actually wrong; per the American Geological Society, Gaurisankar and Mt Everest are ""different peaks, thirty-six miles apart,"" as determined in a 1903 survey (ending an approximately 50-year argument about whether they were the same peak). In the same vein, I'm not convinced Schrodinger is right about many of his opinions here, but I think the most interesting part is not necessarily the points he puts forward as solutions but the questions he is trying to answer.He says that we may see the ""I"" within ourselves as distinct and made up of our own individual experiences and memories, but he believes the part that is really ""I"" or the consciousness is not the set of experiences but the ""canvas upon which they are collected"" - if we view consciousness in this way, it is much easier to believe it could all be of one piece. He may not be entirely convincing on any of his points in this book, but I do think he did a good job of dismissing some of the logic that would certainly bar his ideas from being true, so that you can see the things he purports could be true.Schrodinger's ideas on ethics are interesting too; he believes man is subject to a constant ethical evolution along with biological evolution, and that for Man (and each man) there is sort of a battle between the primitive will and our evolving ethical ideals, so that to be ethical we have to be ""self-conquering,"" ""chisel and statue, conquerors and conquered at the same time."" Back on the subject of the mind not really being able to see itself in its concept of the world, he quotes the hell out of Sir Charles Sherrington's Man on His Nature, which he is in love with. ""The mind per se cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand. Then the impasse meets us, the blank of the 'how' of mind, leverage on matter."" - he wonders whether we are the truly the ""doers"" of the deeds for which we feel responsible. Then he goes off on a bunch of tangents about how you can't ""see"" the mind anywhere but that we often think we see it behind someone's eyes, that we often see eyes as more active than the passive sense organs they truly are. Last night I fell asleep wondering if blind people think their minds live behind their eyes, so I guess it is an interesting question. People with different senses may use different symbols. The mind is not truly there in our heads, he reminds us: ""Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held against the life and the emotions of the soul.""He goes on another interesting tangent about how our senses work and how our brain sort of has sub-brains and their data is somehow integrated which is another source of those dang duality mirages he is always thinking about. And I started thinking about split-brain patient studies and what those and similar psychological studies say about consciousness - are we describing the inputs and behavior of the body after the fact? I remember learning in high school that researches could manipulate people's behavior and then they would try to convince themselves they had done things for certain reasons after the fact. I think I could easily fall into an internet black hole on those topics, whoa nelly. Then he starts talking about whether time and space dimensions are a property our mind applies to the world so that we can understand it or whether they are an innate property of the world - but to Schrodinger, what is the difference between what our mind tells us it sees of the world and the world itself? So for him, it doesn't matter whether the self applies these dimensions or not, but he thinks the interesting idea is that there are aspects of the ""one thing - mind or world -"" that ""may well be capable of other forms of appearance that we cannot grasp and that do not imply the notions of space and time"" - this makes a bit more space for the idea that there can be some aspect of consciousness that is not tied down by problems of ""before"" and ""after"" for its containing body. It doesn't make it any easier to conceptualize, since we can't really understand what something like that would look like, but it takes some of the finality out of the conclusions I always find myself trapped in. What is certainty when we take out dimensions, after all? (Oof I don't take enough drugs for this book.)Anyway, the questions he's thought through in this book (these lectures, I suppose) are interesting and worth thinking about if you don't mind lying awake in the dark at night. I think sometimes I have so much I want to read that I get afraid of this ambiguous thing called ""wasting time"" and so sometimes I read when I should be taking a thinking break instead. If you're always on intake mode you're never stirring those ideas around. This book made me want to stop and think, even if I didn't see where he was coming from with some of his answers.The short autobiographical section at the end was interesting to me for his description of a time of upheaval in Austria (the end of an empire, the entrance of cars, Nazis), and also for his light touches on seeing St Elmo's Fire, the phosphorescence of the sea, and jellyfish. Ah, the mysteries of the world! He also points out that the way his school did half-days gave him a lot of time to think and to study further the things he was really interested in (and to learn from his father, who he got to spend a lot of time with)."
223,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"This book was written by Schrödinger, one of the most influential physicists to ever live, making important contributions to quantum theory. His equation (Schrödinger equation), calculates the wave function of a system and how it changes across time. This work was based on public lectures from Trinity College in 1943. It's mostly concerned with biology, although it has considerable tangents. he wanted to know how life related to physics and chemistry. It starts by showing why life seems to be so big when compared to atoms. We have around 30 trillion cells. And each cell has an average of 100 trillion atoms. He argues that at small scales, reality is too chaotic to have order. Quantum chaos fluctuations prevent steady natural laws. As a system gets better, such noise gets smaller and smaller. In further chapters, he touches on hereditary, evolution, molecules, entropy and more.Some of it was truly groundbreaking. At the time, how hereditary information was passed was unknown. He made a theoretical prediction that an ""aperiodic crystal"" would store the information required for living things to pass their ""blueprint"" of how the molecules should be organized. This inspired the later discovery of DNA. He was truly a brilliant mind and it was very enjoyable to read his work. I particularly enjoyed his humility and willingness to describe his thought process. The book was written for the layman audience, and he succeeded in doing so. You don't need any background to read, although at times it was nevertheless difficult. Luckily regarding biology and hereditary, I had some previous knowledge that helped, but the few times that he went into mathematical theorems, I was completely lost. The latter part of the book was my favorite. While I enjoyed the rest, it was a times too sciency for my taste. Towards the end it left more technical subjects related to biology and physics and was more concerned with philosophy, especially as it relates to consciousness. What strikes me the most is how well aware he was of the body/mind problem, despite him a physicist. He certainly wasn't blind to a materialistic worldview, and he easily articulates many of its problems when trying to account for consciousness. Some of it I found not the best argued super well, for example when he touched on free will. But his description of qualia, for example, was incredibly well written. He even got a bit mystical at times, which took me completely by surprise, and mentioned the Upanishads (a religious/philosophical text from Hinduism) influenced by Schopenhauer and Huxley's perennial philosophy. He considered a possible ""unified consciousness"", in which each individual experience was only a fraction of the conscious universe, but nevertheless united. It's a brilliant book. The title of it couldn't be more fitting. If you wonder what life is, how can it persist through the marching and endless entropy, or what distinguishes something living from something that is dead, then Schrödinger will walk you through his genius and explain it. A journey through biology, physics, and philosophy from one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century."

It’s a beautiful walk, especially during autumn, when the golden leaves envelop the black tar of the road. At the junction, stands a tall brick coloured building with Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath written in bold, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies - DIAS. The Irish home of the Nobel prize winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger.Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies was established by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, in 1940 to “provide facilities for the furtherance of advanced study and the conduct of research in specialised branches of knowledge”. There are three schools that form the institute - School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic studies. DIAS is arguably best known for hosting the lecture series “What is Life?”, delivered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1943.Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939, Schrödinger had been invited by Éamon de Valera, to help establish the institute. He moved to Clontarf and he lived there until 1955. The lectures were converted into a book titled ‘What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell’ for the layperson.Erwin Schrödinger was a theoretical physicist whose contributions to quantum theory were unparalleled at the time. He is best known for his rather paradoxical thought experiment, involving a cat that is dead and alive at the same time. Famously known as Schrödinger’s cat, this continues to be featured in discussions regarding application of quantum mechanics to everyday objects.But what is little known about Schrödinger is his interest and knowledge of genetics and biology. He was curious about the nature of the cell and what constituted life. In the public lecture series, What is Life, Schrödinger explores these concepts and does so in the language of the lay person. The book was published based on the lecture series in 1944.Schrödinger explores the idea of the cell and of life from the perspective of a physicist. He modestly apologizes to the biologists, time and again, for not considering the biological aspects or constraints while presenting a few of his ideas.What is Life: The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell reads like a science textbook. It begins with a detailed explanation about the significance of large number of atoms coming together and how they form working components in our bodies. He enunciates the idea of cell division better than how I can remember from high school biology. The book then takes on how the concepts of thermodynamics and crystal structures shape cell behavior. And he ends it with his own musings on determinism and free will. If free will exists. What does one mean by ‘I’ and the philosophy of identity.The lecture and the subsequent publication of the book had tremendous impact on understanding the genetic aspects of the DNA. "
225,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8122302-neko,4,"(Quite a lengthy review i wrote in English class) This book has served as a source of inspiration for many scientists, especially biologists converted from the field of physics. Despite being written in the 1940's, before the discovery of DNA, it isn't hard to understand why this piece was influential. Shrödinger's modest perspective, philosophical insights and a tone so humble as making every sentence appear meticulously crafted, is not something found in typical popular-science literature. Known for being his only publication for a lay audience, ""What is Life?"" is an attempt by Schrödinger, not mainly to educate; but to inspire. It is divided into 3 parts, the first containing descriptions of basic physical principles as well as the foundation of living organisms. The second part is a more speculative and abstract presentation of the author's views of life, reality and epistemology. This edition of the book finishes with a 3:rd part entitled ""autobiographical sketches"", which -as suggested by its title- contains information about Schrödinger's own life.Let me begin by discussing the first part by briefly stating that the scope of this review is far too limited to expand on all the interesting tangential thoughts raised be the book. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to pick out some of the most pertinent topics.To emphasize the modesty of his approach, Shrödinger calls himself a naive physicist and starts by challenging the anthropocentric nature of both scientific and philosphical questions. An example is the question ""why are atoms so small?"", which can be contrasted with ""why are human sensory organs not re fined enough to perceive them?"". The latter question is both easier to explain by science (evolutionary adaptation and structure of bio-molecules etc.) and less naive. Indeed, the first question seems rather meaningless and impossible to answer with a scientific approach (as ""why?"" questions in general tend to be). An important point to consider (one that is often overlooked) is the limits of science. Schrödinger addresses this by pointing out the approximate, statistical nature of physical laws; they may be accurate enough to measure the distance to the sun, but the more decimal-places you have, the more uncertain the numbers become. On the smallest of scales, our measurements become inaccurate. But we can nevertheless determine the statistically significant outcomes by testing multiple times. Yet, since our time is also limited (death, more important occupations etc.), the constrains are at both ends of the spectrum; the infinitesimally small and the infinitely large.Although a more pragmatic approach is adopted by physicists (""what matters is what works"", to paraphrase Richard Feynman), it is both interesting and humbling to think about our limitations.Schrödinger also extends his discussion by including biology, and a comparison between quantum jumps (sudden leaps by sub-atomic particles between discrete energy-levels of an atom) with random mutations in the genome. (At this point, I'm not sure if he means that the former is a likely cause for genetic mutations, of it's merely an analogy).Another comparison he makes, is likening aperiodic crystals with chromosomes, both being of an asymmetrical form. I think the intention here is to point to the 'uniqueness' of the fundamental parts that make up a live organism; if we were made from periodic crystals, there would be no basis for diversity on which natural selection could work.But there is also another part of this discussion which, somewhat ironically concerns the stability of the hereditary substance. Despite changing through evolutionary time, the material of our genomes is relatively stable (undergoes only small changes in each generation). On this matter, the author insinuates a physical explanation based on discrete energy levels of molecules, to account for their relatively stable nature.After taking the reader through a rather lengthy discussion (which the previous passages of this review attempted to outline), Shrödinger states his main reason for writing this piece. By merging concepts from his formal occupation, physics, with biochemistry, he leaves open the possibility that yet unknown ""laws of nature"" exist on the biological level.I am not at all clear with what he meant by that, but my speculation is that he was (like many others) puzzled by the apparent fact that living organisms evade the second law of thermodynamics.But the confusion is likely a remnant of a simplistic view without considerations that bodies indeed do produce a net increase in entropy by emitting heat to their environment. Another point he leaves as food for thought, is that ""no detailed information about the functioning of the genetic mechanism can emerge from a description of its structure"". Maybe the laws of physics and chemistry leave something unexplained after all?What follows next is a sketch of opinions on issues that philosophers have been trying to answer for centuries. Although Schrödinger approaches these from his own standpoint, not biased be an occupational background in philosophy or heavy jargon. Central to the questions pondered is that of free will vs. determinism, where the author tries to draw a conclusion from the premises that;i) every living body is subject to the laws of nature, andii) one has the experience of being in control and responsible for one's actions.With inspiration from Schopenhauer and the Upanishads, he describes the ""singularity of consciousness"", which probably seems quite self-evident to any reader of his words, yet still manages to serve as reminder that you are alive and able to interact with the world (at least that's the feeling i got when reading it).It is important to note that the ""singularity of consciousness"" does not mean that there exists only one mind, and that everyone else are only ideas within that mind (solipsism). What Schrödinger meant (if i've read him correctly) is that [i]experience[/i] is always singular, i.s no one has exactly the same experience as someone else, even if the situation in which they find themselves is identical.Through further philosophical rambling, the author reaches the conclusion that the ""barrier"" between a perceiving subject and the object being perceived is and illusion. Although his writing cannot be blamed for being obscure, every time i close the book, my sense of understanding of this seems to disappear. However, there is a strong parallel to the idea that a scientist (by conducting experiments, measuring things, etc.) assumes the hypothesis of an objective world, independent of observation.This may not seem very shocking, but contemporary discoveries and theoretical advances in physics (in which Schrödinger played an important art), introduced a paradox to this fundamental assumption. The implications were basically that features of subatomic particles were dependent on measurement in such a way that if one thing was known, another was by default uncertain.This could possibly be what led Schrödinger to say that the boundary between subject and object is illusory.The last part of the book contains brief autobiographical notes of Schrödinger's life at university, the people he met, and some friendly comments toward family members, especially apologetic to his deceased parents. A little surprising, yet understandable, was the exclusion of personal achievements, (such as the wave-equation and further work on quantum mechanics) and anecdotes about experiences for which he is well-known.I have to conclude with the confession that my mpression of this influential character has shifted after reading What is Life?. Mostly, i think, because of his highly polite and formal attitude, which is quite a rare feature among physicist-authors."
226,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2708448-thomas-herzog,4,"What is Life? ★★★★★Based on a series of lectures Schrödinger gave at a point in time when much was already known about the hereditary substance (i.e.: it is the carrier of hereditary information; it is contained in the chromosomes; it is extremely durable and can be copied perfectly, yet allows for mutations to occur; etc.), but what physical form this substance actually takes was still unknown. Many years before the encoding of DNA and its double-helix structure were eventually discovered, Schrödinger muses on a possible physical structure for encoding the hereditary information, this, he speculates, aperiodic crystal. His analogy with morse code (how ""simple"" codes can encode tremendous amounts of information; see also, obviously: binary coding and the digital age) nicely anticipates the rather simple four-base encoding of DNA, and his remarks on the importance of quantum mechanical rules at the scale of the hereditary substance (whose approximate size was already known) were illuminating, as was his summary of life being something that feeds on low entropy to keep its own entropy from constantly increasing (as things are wont to do).Mind and Matter ★★★Schrödinger's speculations about the interplay of mind and matter. Some interesting thoughts, but all in all too unfocused and unconvincing.But some of you, I am sure, will call this mysticism.As, indeed, do I."

While ""what is life"", containing a theoretical account - or prediction - of what is to be expected as the fundamental building blocks of life, is fascinating, I found the ideas in ""mind and matter"" even more thought-provoking and relevant (unsurprisingly so given that DNA has been discovering shortly after the initial publishing and found its way into common knowledge). "
230,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,5,"On ""What is Life?"":One of the most thought-provoking books I've read on the physiochemical basis of life. The book's based on a series of lectures Shrodinger delivered at the Institute for Advance Studies at Trinity College, Dublin in 1943. Shrodinger was writing before the discovery of the structure of DNA ten years later by Watson and Crick, so he is unaware of the gene-bearing nature of DNA. Nevertheless, he is able to deduce with near-perfect precision the kind of molecule that the ""heredity substance"" must be. Above all, it must be a large ""aperiodic solid"" or molecule, capable of an almost miraculous stability, yet also susceptible to small-scale mutations. The virtual permanence of the molecule (the fact that DNA is copied from generation to generation with near-perfect accuracy accounts for the sameness uniting parental organisms with their offspring; the fact that mutations can occur accounts for the difference between living organisms. Such is the DNA molecule. What is it, ultimately, that separates life from inanimate matter? For Shrodinger, it's life's ability to evade the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all closed systems tend toward the disorder and diffusion of energy (i.e., the entropy law). Life feeds on orderly structures, exporting disorderliness out into the universe. Life is that which works against entropy.Shrodinger was a quantum physicist. He was intensely aware of the disturbingly haphazard and random (within circumscribed limits) movement of atomic and subatomic particles. He helped develop the quantum mechanics atomic physicists still use to understand the nature of matter and reality and the very smallest scales. And it's the following paradox that motivated him to write this book: If individual atoms are subject to the haphazard laws of quantum mechanics, and if the heredity substance (the genetic ""code-script,"" as he says) is made up of a tiny number of these atoms, why isn't its molecular structure (a structure that must be EXTREMELY well-ordered in order to preserve genetic information across time) subject to the destructive randomness of quantum forces? In other words, given the randomness of individual atoms, why isn't the hereditary molecule (constituted entirely of atoms) subject to potentially destructive quantum randomness. What initially makes this especially baffling to Shrodinger is the fact that the smaller in scale you go (the more you narrow in on matter), the more disorderly atomic interactions become. If the heredity substance is necessarily tiny, in other words, shouldn't it theoretically be subject to the haphazard movements of quantum physics?It turns our that it shouldn't. Shrodinger resolves his paradox by pointing out that the individual atoms in larger molecules are bound by intensely powerful co-valent bonds, so that, even if atomic activity is disorderly, molecules bind disorderly atoms into orderly conglomerates, which are almost solid-like in their regularity. (Quantum randomness DOES affect the molecular structure, in Shrodinger's view, but only extremely rarely when an ""isomeric transition threshold"" is crossed); it's this stability at the molecular level that makes heredity information or trait-encoding genes possible, which in turn makes life possible. In sum: Shrodinger's main purpose in writing this book is to reconcile the randomness of quantum mechanics with the orderliness of biology. I'm not qualified to comment on the originality of this book, or its effectiveness in legitimizing or ""quantizing"" biology. But he certainly helped bring ""biophysics"" to the fore in the early '50s, inspiring a new generation of scientists, including but not limited to Watson and Crick.""We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it. I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true who aim be lost for ever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them - and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.""- Shrodinger, ""What is Life?"" On ""Mind and Matter"":On ""Autobiographical Sketches"":Told in the manner of an elderly man who sets out to write his life story only to stop midway, realizing that he didn't have the narrative capacities to do it justice or the boldness to reveal some of its more private phases (his ""relations with women""). This, I suppose, will always remain behind the curtain more or less. Though the sketches are dry and incomplete, I appreciate Shrodinger's mustering the wherewithal to follow through on at least a brief picture of his life. He hates chronological biographical accounts but is unable to offer anything more innovative or subtle. No worries, Shrodinger! These were still a pleasure to read."
231,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,5,"I've come across this essay multiple times in the past couple months and each time I'd resolved to read it. 3 months+ isn't so bad. This is the sort of work I wish I had the ambition and seriousness to pick over all the popular nonfiction garbage I stuff my brain with. An actual genius with original ideas communicating them beautifully in the sort of science-loving idea-centric natural-poeticism that we seem to have lost after Feynman. It's not easy to read, the ideas are in their nascent stages and still speculative, the codescript for the idea of a codescript, incomplete, in many places incorrect, and without the closure of a well-planned structural flow that today's nonfiction book would lay out in its development of a topic. In that sense it's more like high quality fiction, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or the sci-fi greats, it demands effort and it rewards attention with layers upon layers of truth, not simply facts but truth, insight into not just reality but the nature of our insight into reality, not just about scientific concepts but the concept of a scientific concept. It's only fitting therefore that it ends with the most meta concept we know, consciousness, itself an infinite recursion since the word itself automatically means the consciousness of consciousness, and so on. The density of ideas and the brevity of their exposition is breathtaking. The epilogue on consciousness alone says everything it needs to say, a book's worth of words in the hands of a less intelligent or more egoistic author, in the space of a few paragraphs. It is possible that's what sets lectures apart from books, they are condensed versions of books worth of learning, a dense representation of the knowledge on offer, to be looked up in detail later. It is more likely that's what sets apart old school geniuses like Schrodinger. I got to the end of the book and was convinced I'd received some spurious abridged cliffnotes copy, I'm so used to ideas being overexplained and developed far beyond the point of maximal marginal returns on exposition. I'm so used to a certain trajectory of information and a certain average ex post facto recce of the total new knowledge received over the hours spent, that when a piece of work like this shows up that totally trounces all benchmarks on these variables, I'm convinced that I've missed a whole lot of empty hours that contribute nothing other than bring down the trajectory to acceptable levels. NotesAnswering deep questions with simple examples (size of atoms and problem of relativity: king who made his arm-length the official distance). As complex as periodic crystals are, aperiodic crystals are that much more, like a patterned wallpaper vs a Raphael tapestry with a divine order unifying zero repetition. Hence organic chemistry (aperiodic crystals) has contributed more to the problem of life than physics (periodic crystals)Atom is 1/5000-1/2000 wavelength of yellow light. Significant because grain of light is smallest thing visible in microscope, so even this has millions of atoms. Trapped by our frame of reference: ‘why are atoms so small’ is really asking ‘why is ratio of us to atoms so large’. What we call thought needs a) orderliness b) interactions with external world (perception) that are also orderly. Need to follow physical laws. But atoms are probabilistic and chaotic, it is from this need for statistical order out of chaos that our order of reality is so vastly above atomic sizeParamagnetism: Boltzmann/Gibb showed Oxygen dipoles get magnetized by field, but why does magnetization double when field is doubled? It is a statistical phenomenon, countered by heat-motion that randomizes atoms and field creating just a slight tendency to prefer acute angle towards field such that over statistical sample, there is alignment. Langevin’s idea of heat entropy vs order, so if temperature is reduced, then magnetization is higher. When temp is close to minimum, then increasing field doesn’t have as high impact on magnetization, close to saturation. Brownian motion: upper layer of droplets slowly sinks with mathematical precision of specific gravity, viscosity, but individual droplets are totally unpredictable, small enough to be impacted by molecular impacts. Bacteria similarly are at the mercy of heat-motion etc. Diffusion: While concentration of 2 substances equalize (movement of molecules from high to low conc) by exact partial differential equation, this is just an approximation. In reality, individual molecules are engaging in random walk, and since in high-conc more are randomly walking, it will follow that in general there is a flow towards the low-conc. Maxwell’s Demon.Square root law of standard error: Error is proportional to inverse square root of sample size N. So sample 100 has 1/10 error, 10%. Sample 1000000 has 1/1000 error. Power of exponential growth of mitosis: Current me is only the 50/60th descendent of single cell egg-me! Mitosis creates 2 copies of each set of chromosomes. But some cells are set aside, reserved to become sex-cells, don’t mitosis much, and just before they’re needed, undergo meiosis, where daughter cells get only 1 copy of chromosomes (haploid), fusing during sex to create a diploid zygote. How my father’s spermatozoa split chromosome during meiosis will define my paternal inheritance of either grandmother or grandfather. But not that simple, because there is frequent crossover. Genes that are far from each other on the strand have higher chance of being crossed over because intersection point lies between them. Studying difference between haploid/diploid can tell us relative positioning of genes coding for a property.How big is a gene? Take physical size of chromosome, establish how many features it codes for, divide, get maximum size of gene (because keep discovering new features, it’s a start point). Turns out to be a cube with edge ~300Angstrom. So a gene is not more than a million or so genes. Not large enough to entail lawful behavior. How marvelous that in a genome you get a 4-dimensional picture not just of an individual, but the development/permanence of that individual in time, across generations!Dangerous mutations usually lurk in background as recessive because don’t do too much damage this way, if dominant they get selected out. That’s why the argument ‘our blood is awesome, we should interbreed’ doesn’t work, the good traits are on the surface and the bad ones are lurking.Need ceteris-paribus conditions to allow good mutations to prove themselves and take root, that’s why mutations are so rare.Most things follow diminishing return curves, true proportionality is rare and remarkable. Radiation causing mutation is proportional, ie first dose and 2nd dose are totally independent. Exact condition is that an ionization just 10 atoms away from the gamete can cause a mutation. It can be passed on to next generation without affecting current individualEnergy states are quantum, not continuous. Start at lowest energy state, absolute zero. Supply heat, increase probability that it jumps. Measured by ‘time of expectation’, how long it takes to jump. This is defined by W/kT (W=energy gap, kT is heat energy of temp T). Strangely exponential relationship. W/kT=30, time is 1/10s. At 60, it is 30,000 years!Statistical theories of heat are full of exponential function, because so highly improbable for certain energy state to be attained randomly. Nernst’s Heat Theorem, 3rd law of thermodynamics, that entropy tends to zero as temperature reaches absolute zero. Remove heat from system and reduce randomness effect. Even at room temperature, the effect of entropy is minimal on chemical reactions. If physics underlies biological phenomena, how to account for free will? One inference is to say I control the physics. I am God. Atman, Brahman.It neatly solves problem of plurality of consciousness that Western philosophy has been trying. Descartes - I exist, single consciousness. Same of everyone else. How to reconcile? 1. It dies with the body, this is intolerable. 2. There is an indivisible eternal soul, in realm of forms. Same as saying plurality is different aspects of single, Maya. "

For it is in relation to the statistical point of view that the structure of the vital parts of living organisms differs so entirely from that of any piece of matter that we physicists and chemists have ever handled physically in our laboratories or mentally at our writing desks the most essential part of a living cell the chromosome fibre may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. In physics we have dealt hitherto only with periodic crystals. To a humble physicist's mind, these are very interesting and complicated objects; they constitute one of the most fascinating and complex material structures by which inanimate nature puzzles his wits. Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal, they are rather plain and dull. Organic chemistry, indeed, in investigating more and more complicated molecules, has come very much nearer to that 'aperiodic crystal' which, in my opinion, is the material carrier of life. And therefore it is small wonder that the organic chemist has already made large and important contributions to the problem of life, whereas the physicist has made next to noneWe now recognize this fundamental law of physics to be just the natural tendency of things to approach the chaotic state (the same tendency that the books of a library or the piles of papers and manuscripts on a writing desk display) unless we obviate it. Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness ( = fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment. that we give off heat is not accidental, but essential. For this is precisely the manner in which we dispose of the surplus entropy we continually produce in our physical life process MIGUEL DE UNAMUNO (quoted from conversation) If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually never says anything at all. from all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics. all physical laws are based on statistics. the interesting statistical type of law, controlling large-scale events, is constituted from the 'dynamical' laws supposed to govern the small-scale events, the interaction of the single atoms and molecules. Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Even in the pathological cases of split consciousness or double personality the two persons alternate, they are never manifest simultaneously Yet each of us has the indisputable impression that the sum total of his own experience and memory forms a unit, quite distinct from that of any other person. He refers to it as 'I'. What is this 'I'? If you analyse it closely you will, I think, find that it is just a little bit more than a collection of single data (experiences and memories), namely the canvas upon which they are collected. And you will, on close introspection, find that what you really mean by 'I' is that ground-stuff upon which they are collected"""
233,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26686799-joel-croteau,4,"An excellent book that does not require any particular scientific background, and quite insightful if you can decipher Schrödinger's chronic run-on sentences."
234,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25570776-pi,4,"Reading some of the great minds of the 20th century, of whom Erwin Schrodinger is without a doubt one, is such a treat! You feel getting to know the author personally, with all his kinks and quirks; and Schrodinger has those aplenty: from his excessively high self-esteem, to his not-so-scientific mysticism regarding consciousness. But although this little book has been immensely prescient in predicting the discovery and structure of DNA, referred to by Schrodinger as a type of aperiodic crystal, it has also paved the way for what has been called the central dogma of molecular biology: the idea that information can only pass from DNA to RNA to proteins - never the other way around. This idea, however, has been discredited in recent decades by the amassed evidence to the contrary. Basically, Schrodinger is wrong in saying that physics is ""order from disorder"", but life is somehow different in that it is ""order from order"". Actually, according to our most recent scientific theories, life should also be viewed as (mostly) order from disorder, for it is driven by stochasticity on the micro level all the same. (Anyone interested in reading more on these and similar issues with the gene-centered Neo-Darwinian view on evolution, and the essence of life, I refer to the following recent books: Dance to the Tune of Life: Biological Relativity and The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.)What really makes What is Life?, as well as other writings from science and philosophy, worth a read, however, is not their impact on science and philosophy per se, but their influence on popular culture and literature. For instance, when I was recently reading Wetware by Rudy Rucker, I couldn't fail to notice some of the parallels with Schrodinger's work; especially Rucker's character Berenice discussing the difference in entropy production between different 'bopper' bodies. I might be wrong with this parallel, but I'm pretty sure many sci-fi authors, including Rudy Rucker, have read What is life? and it has influenced their thinking a great deal. In any case, I truly believe reading science and philosophy can significantly bolster your experience when reading anything else, especially sci-fi. So why not go for it?"

236,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"What I expected:Source, CC-BY-NC 2.5What I got:""What is Life?"" is a surprisingly humble take on the problems biology had in the 1940s. Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology)."
237,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"Schrödinger was a very well respected physicist, who gave us a new language to describe the behaviour of the quantum realm. It is thus with skepticism that one might approach a book (essay?) like this, applying quantum theory to biology. But throughout the book what comes through heavily is Schrödinger’s humility – which is a rare character for physicists when discussing biology. Nevertheless, his application of physics-based reasoning manages to justify some facts of biology and populate new ones. As an example, he starts with the somewhat odd question “why is the human body so much bigger than an atom” to expound core points such as whether physics can hope to quantify the behaviour of living systems.Perhaps the most surprising thing is that he actually does provide an answer to the book’s eponymous question: what is life? It is something that consumes negative entropy (i.e order) to stave off it’s own inevitable decay into disorder. In his words, all living things have: an astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos by 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environmentThat is basically saying that we consume food (highly ordered arrangements of molecules) and output it as heat (disorder), in the mean time maintaining our relatively ordered state. This is a wonderfully original perspective, but one that anyone can see to be sensible and according with the facts. On a side note, after reading this I had to read Asimov’s The Last Question again… The second law of thermodynamics is haunting."
238,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10663319-michael-kenning,4,"One thing that I did not realise about this book is that it actually contains three different books: What is Life?, Mind and Matter, and Autobiographical sketches. The first book, What is Life?, gives the reader a very basic understanding of genetics. It is precisely the hereditary substance and the nature of mutation in the genetic substance that encouraged the discovery of the double helix in DNA. It is a most essential read; and despite the fact that it was written by a physicist, it portrays Schrödinger's keen interest and understanding of biological functions—and the incorporation of his own physical knowledge.The second book goes through the consideration of mind and its role in evolution—how the mind may contribute to our (what I consider) continual progression as a species. Although, it is suggested that, like crocodiles and many insects, we have reached, not the peak of evolution (which would imply that we are the best kind of thing—not true), but a sort of plateau which means that we no longer require adjustment; mutations still occur, however. It considers the effects of mind on our various sensual apparatus, and how the memes which are passed down from generation to generation will reflect our capability to survive—what he called a 'feigned Lamarckism'. The considerations are truly inspiring.The autobiographical sketches, although somewhat insightful, contain nothing of interest. It shall only reveal to the reader the process by which Erwin Schrödinger became a scientist, which isn't very interesting; as Schrödinger said himself: 'I am not good at telling stories'."
239,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31677006-kaio,4,"These are personal notes that did not fit into the appropriate section.Interesting initial chapters on why most laws are only statistical in nature and describe things in good approximation only because of the sheer number of single ""things"" that behave according to exact laws. That extrapolation to human senses also intesting.I did not get everything on the genetics chapters, as I have not studied it in a long time, and did not bother to look it up.Very interesting idea about how life has to ""feed"" on ""negative entropy"" as he calls it, because life is constantly producing entropy (disorder) in the processes to keep it alive (metabolism) and this excess entropy has to be shed or transferred into matter or enegy (it is not that well explained) that is in a state of lower entropy. There is a necessary correlation between the ingested energy and ingested negative entropy that is not explained in the book. I need to look deeper into this.The chapters on deducing the nature of the genetic material I mostly glanced over though he seems to have made pivotal statements which somewhat led to the discovery of the DNA structure. The epilogue on consciousness, the actual reason I read this book, is much less precise logically. I came onto this book because it was stated somewhere else something along the lines of: ""One of the fathers of quantum physics tries to reduce the last bastions of human ignorance to physics, suggests it to be possible for the mechanisms of life, but claims it impossible in the case of consciousnees"".Did not add much to my understanding of the Philosophy of Mind.All in all an interesting read."
240,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77151581-shawn,3,"Definitely dated but obviously on the right path, this book combines biology, physics, and chemistry to try an answer the question of how if it's so small our genetic molecules defy natural law and act in a uniform manor. So step by step the the reader is hand held with all the complicated maths tucked away and only brought out when absolutely necessary to avoid that awfulness until at the end one is left with an interesting proposition: what kind of weird law defying miracle are made of? Life, for all of our understanding is a square peg in a round hole, it don't make no damn sense essentially. But we try valiantly to make sense of it... for reasons. SO after all the science stuff (which is actually nice refresher on the basics of human chemistry (the notable absence of DNA notwithstanding) we are given a short treatise on how this all affects us as conscious beings. Well my ears perked up at that. Could science be the path I need to follow to kill my arch nemesis the ego? Mr. Schrödinger seems to say to me the same thing a lot of authors have been saying to me lately...namely consciousness, the ego, is a diffusive thing not to be pinned down. He does however tease some theories on the fact that if we do have free will, that means we can manipulate individual atoms, making us walking gods when we make even the tiniest of decisions. But that's countered by the possibility that life is somewhat mechanical in nature and determinism rears its ugly head.I just don't know my dudes. But I will continue the noble pursuit."

I found ot very enlightening as shrodinger repeatedly approached mainstream issues with an unusual method. How do you distinguish life from death? Easy just use the second law of thermodynamics! What I found most interesting in this book is that shrodinger would repeatedly say stange things such as: The scientific approach does not reveal the human soul, collective consciousness is due to the existence of god, plato was a genius for having invented the theory of forms and even going so far as to quote from Jung and some persian mystics! And my first reaction is to shrug it off as pseudoscience or fiction but then I'd remember im reading a book to the greatest scientists in the modern age! If anyone has the right to declare the scientific approach inadequate it's him. I also find it admirable that although famous as physicist schrodinger was much more.

I can see why the field of molecular biology would be so fascinating to those who would come after, using Schrodinger's ""aperiodic crystal"" as their template for what to seek in their eventual discovery of DNA (another win for the predictive power of science).

Even then, I found some portions of the book a little difficult to comprehend. I think it is more to do with the sentence construction used in the book and not actually because of the complexity of the ideas conveyed. Complex ideas are explained in very simple manner, by using great analogies in various cases. In all, it is a great book which, I believe, should be made available to high school students when they actually learn these topics, albeit as different subjects. It will give them a perspective of how these subjects gel together in the real world to form science as we know it. "

But then, he argues that things are really not so different. I think this book, short though it is, may take another read before I can fully grasp what he was getting at.

252,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3070035-clio,3,"All I knew about Schrodinger before reading this was about his paradoxical cat.I found his writing style a little clunky - I kept getting thrown off when he'd introduce an idea, then say ""and now we can prove that is all haberdash and silly hats"" and then go on to say something that didn't sound any more provable to me than the idea he'd just dismissed. But he did reference a lot of other books that influenced his thoughts that I hadn't read. I think if I go back and read a bunch of that, then come back and read this again, I'd follow him better. He's part of a whole tradition of ideas so it's hard to just take out his ideas and read them out of context (at least if you aren't super comfortable with quantum physics and thinking in paradoxes).In What is Life?, Schrodinger discussed the type of physical laws that he thinks govern life and the difference between statistical laws that produce order from disorder and clockwork/pure mechanical laws that produced order from order. He referenced Max Planck a bunch in that section. He also starts to talk about the Upanishads (and Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy) and the weird paradoxes of consciousness as something like a soul that is tied to one body, a thing that you identify as your Self and think is an individual, thereby distinguishing yourself from other Selves in other bodies - from what I understood in this piece and Mind and Matter, he thinks consciousness can only be one thing and the multiplicity of consciousness we see in Western thought is sort of alike a mirage that arises from our inability to see where our own mind fits into our view of the world since we are using it (or pieces of it) to interpret the world. It has to simplify our world-view by taking itself out of the picture, so our picture is not complete. Schrodinger says ""consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing, produced by a deception (the Indian Maya); the same illusation is produced in a gallery of mirrors, and in the same way Gaurisankar and Mt Everest turned out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" So in the hall of mirrors, we don't know exactly what we are looking at and think we are looking at many different images when really we are seeing one image. From different viewpoints, we may see the same thing and imagine it is different things since it may look slightly different. Although his example here is actually wrong; per the American Geological Society, Gaurisankar and Mt Everest are ""different peaks, thirty-six miles apart,"" as determined in a 1903 survey (ending an approximately 50-year argument about whether they were the same peak). In the same vein, I'm not convinced Schrodinger is right about many of his opinions here, but I think the most interesting part is not necessarily the points he puts forward as solutions but the questions he is trying to answer.He says that we may see the ""I"" within ourselves as distinct and made up of our own individual experiences and memories, but he believes the part that is really ""I"" or the consciousness is not the set of experiences but the ""canvas upon which they are collected"" - if we view consciousness in this way, it is much easier to believe it could all be of one piece. He may not be entirely convincing on any of his points in this book, but I do think he did a good job of dismissing some of the logic that would certainly bar his ideas from being true, so that you can see the things he purports could be true.Schrodinger's ideas on ethics are interesting too; he believes man is subject to a constant ethical evolution along with biological evolution, and that for Man (and each man) there is sort of a battle between the primitive will and our evolving ethical ideals, so that to be ethical we have to be ""self-conquering,"" ""chisel and statue, conquerors and conquered at the same time."" Back on the subject of the mind not really being able to see itself in its concept of the world, he quotes the hell out of Sir Charles Sherrington's Man on His Nature, which he is in love with. ""The mind per se cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand. Then the impasse meets us, the blank of the 'how' of mind, leverage on matter."" - he wonders whether we are the truly the ""doers"" of the deeds for which we feel responsible. Then he goes off on a bunch of tangents about how you can't ""see"" the mind anywhere but that we often think we see it behind someone's eyes, that we often see eyes as more active than the passive sense organs they truly are. Last night I fell asleep wondering if blind people think their minds live behind their eyes, so I guess it is an interesting question. People with different senses may use different symbols. The mind is not truly there in our heads, he reminds us: ""Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held against the life and the emotions of the soul.""He goes on another interesting tangent about how our senses work and how our brain sort of has sub-brains and their data is somehow integrated which is another source of those dang duality mirages he is always thinking about. And I started thinking about split-brain patient studies and what those and similar psychological studies say about consciousness - are we describing the inputs and behavior of the body after the fact? I remember learning in high school that researches could manipulate people's behavior and then they would try to convince themselves they had done things for certain reasons after the fact. I think I could easily fall into an internet black hole on those topics, whoa nelly. Then he starts talking about whether time and space dimensions are a property our mind applies to the world so that we can understand it or whether they are an innate property of the world - but to Schrodinger, what is the difference between what our mind tells us it sees of the world and the world itself? So for him, it doesn't matter whether the self applies these dimensions or not, but he thinks the interesting idea is that there are aspects of the ""one thing - mind or world -"" that ""may well be capable of other forms of appearance that we cannot grasp and that do not imply the notions of space and time"" - this makes a bit more space for the idea that there can be some aspect of consciousness that is not tied down by problems of ""before"" and ""after"" for its containing body. It doesn't make it any easier to conceptualize, since we can't really understand what something like that would look like, but it takes some of the finality out of the conclusions I always find myself trapped in. What is certainty when we take out dimensions, after all? (Oof I don't take enough drugs for this book.)Anyway, the questions he's thought through in this book (these lectures, I suppose) are interesting and worth thinking about if you don't mind lying awake in the dark at night. I think sometimes I have so much I want to read that I get afraid of this ambiguous thing called ""wasting time"" and so sometimes I read when I should be taking a thinking break instead. If you're always on intake mode you're never stirring those ideas around. This book made me want to stop and think, even if I didn't see where he was coming from with some of his answers.The short autobiographical section at the end was interesting to me for his description of a time of upheaval in Austria (the end of an empire, the entrance of cars, Nazis), and also for his light touches on seeing St Elmo's Fire, the phosphorescence of the sea, and jellyfish. Ah, the mysteries of the world! He also points out that the way his school did half-days gave him a lot of time to think and to study further the things he was really interested in (and to learn from his father, who he got to spend a lot of time with)."
253,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"This book was written by Schrödinger, one of the most influential physicists to ever live, making important contributions to quantum theory. His equation (Schrödinger equation), calculates the wave function of a system and how it changes across time. This work was based on public lectures from Trinity College in 1943. It's mostly concerned with biology, although it has considerable tangents. he wanted to know how life related to physics and chemistry. It starts by showing why life seems to be so big when compared to atoms. We have around 30 trillion cells. And each cell has an average of 100 trillion atoms. He argues that at small scales, reality is too chaotic to have order. Quantum chaos fluctuations prevent steady natural laws. As a system gets better, such noise gets smaller and smaller. In further chapters, he touches on hereditary, evolution, molecules, entropy and more.Some of it was truly groundbreaking. At the time, how hereditary information was passed was unknown. He made a theoretical prediction that an ""aperiodic crystal"" would store the information required for living things to pass their ""blueprint"" of how the molecules should be organized. This inspired the later discovery of DNA. He was truly a brilliant mind and it was very enjoyable to read his work. I particularly enjoyed his humility and willingness to describe his thought process. The book was written for the layman audience, and he succeeded in doing so. You don't need any background to read, although at times it was nevertheless difficult. Luckily regarding biology and hereditary, I had some previous knowledge that helped, but the few times that he went into mathematical theorems, I was completely lost. The latter part of the book was my favorite. While I enjoyed the rest, it was a times too sciency for my taste. Towards the end it left more technical subjects related to biology and physics and was more concerned with philosophy, especially as it relates to consciousness. What strikes me the most is how well aware he was of the body/mind problem, despite him a physicist. He certainly wasn't blind to a materialistic worldview, and he easily articulates many of its problems when trying to account for consciousness. Some of it I found not the best argued super well, for example when he touched on free will. But his description of qualia, for example, was incredibly well written. He even got a bit mystical at times, which took me completely by surprise, and mentioned the Upanishads (a religious/philosophical text from Hinduism) influenced by Schopenhauer and Huxley's perennial philosophy. He considered a possible ""unified consciousness"", in which each individual experience was only a fraction of the conscious universe, but nevertheless united. It's a brilliant book. The title of it couldn't be more fitting. If you wonder what life is, how can it persist through the marching and endless entropy, or what distinguishes something living from something that is dead, then Schrödinger will walk you through his genius and explain it. A journey through biology, physics, and philosophy from one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century."

It’s a beautiful walk, especially during autumn, when the golden leaves envelop the black tar of the road. At the junction, stands a tall brick coloured building with Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath written in bold, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies - DIAS. The Irish home of the Nobel prize winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger.Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies was established by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, in 1940 to “provide facilities for the furtherance of advanced study and the conduct of research in specialised branches of knowledge”. There are three schools that form the institute - School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic studies. DIAS is arguably best known for hosting the lecture series “What is Life?”, delivered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1943.Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939, Schrödinger had been invited by Éamon de Valera, to help establish the institute. He moved to Clontarf and he lived there until 1955. The lectures were converted into a book titled ‘What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell’ for the layperson.Erwin Schrödinger was a theoretical physicist whose contributions to quantum theory were unparalleled at the time. He is best known for his rather paradoxical thought experiment, involving a cat that is dead and alive at the same time. Famously known as Schrödinger’s cat, this continues to be featured in discussions regarding application of quantum mechanics to everyday objects.But what is little known about Schrödinger is his interest and knowledge of genetics and biology. He was curious about the nature of the cell and what constituted life. In the public lecture series, What is Life, Schrödinger explores these concepts and does so in the language of the lay person. The book was published based on the lecture series in 1944.Schrödinger explores the idea of the cell and of life from the perspective of a physicist. He modestly apologizes to the biologists, time and again, for not considering the biological aspects or constraints while presenting a few of his ideas.What is Life: The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell reads like a science textbook. It begins with a detailed explanation about the significance of large number of atoms coming together and how they form working components in our bodies. He enunciates the idea of cell division better than how I can remember from high school biology. The book then takes on how the concepts of thermodynamics and crystal structures shape cell behavior. And he ends it with his own musings on determinism and free will. If free will exists. What does one mean by ‘I’ and the philosophy of identity.The lecture and the subsequent publication of the book had tremendous impact on understanding the genetic aspects of the DNA. "
255,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8122302-neko,4,"(Quite a lengthy review i wrote in English class) This book has served as a source of inspiration for many scientists, especially biologists converted from the field of physics. Despite being written in the 1940's, before the discovery of DNA, it isn't hard to understand why this piece was influential. Shrödinger's modest perspective, philosophical insights and a tone so humble as making every sentence appear meticulously crafted, is not something found in typical popular-science literature. Known for being his only publication for a lay audience, ""What is Life?"" is an attempt by Schrödinger, not mainly to educate; but to inspire. It is divided into 3 parts, the first containing descriptions of basic physical principles as well as the foundation of living organisms. The second part is a more speculative and abstract presentation of the author's views of life, reality and epistemology. This edition of the book finishes with a 3:rd part entitled ""autobiographical sketches"", which -as suggested by its title- contains information about Schrödinger's own life.Let me begin by discussing the first part by briefly stating that the scope of this review is far too limited to expand on all the interesting tangential thoughts raised be the book. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to pick out some of the most pertinent topics.To emphasize the modesty of his approach, Shrödinger calls himself a naive physicist and starts by challenging the anthropocentric nature of both scientific and philosphical questions. An example is the question ""why are atoms so small?"", which can be contrasted with ""why are human sensory organs not re fined enough to perceive them?"". The latter question is both easier to explain by science (evolutionary adaptation and structure of bio-molecules etc.) and less naive. Indeed, the first question seems rather meaningless and impossible to answer with a scientific approach (as ""why?"" questions in general tend to be). An important point to consider (one that is often overlooked) is the limits of science. Schrödinger addresses this by pointing out the approximate, statistical nature of physical laws; they may be accurate enough to measure the distance to the sun, but the more decimal-places you have, the more uncertain the numbers become. On the smallest of scales, our measurements become inaccurate. But we can nevertheless determine the statistically significant outcomes by testing multiple times. Yet, since our time is also limited (death, more important occupations etc.), the constrains are at both ends of the spectrum; the infinitesimally small and the infinitely large.Although a more pragmatic approach is adopted by physicists (""what matters is what works"", to paraphrase Richard Feynman), it is both interesting and humbling to think about our limitations.Schrödinger also extends his discussion by including biology, and a comparison between quantum jumps (sudden leaps by sub-atomic particles between discrete energy-levels of an atom) with random mutations in the genome. (At this point, I'm not sure if he means that the former is a likely cause for genetic mutations, of it's merely an analogy).Another comparison he makes, is likening aperiodic crystals with chromosomes, both being of an asymmetrical form. I think the intention here is to point to the 'uniqueness' of the fundamental parts that make up a live organism; if we were made from periodic crystals, there would be no basis for diversity on which natural selection could work.But there is also another part of this discussion which, somewhat ironically concerns the stability of the hereditary substance. Despite changing through evolutionary time, the material of our genomes is relatively stable (undergoes only small changes in each generation). On this matter, the author insinuates a physical explanation based on discrete energy levels of molecules, to account for their relatively stable nature.After taking the reader through a rather lengthy discussion (which the previous passages of this review attempted to outline), Shrödinger states his main reason for writing this piece. By merging concepts from his formal occupation, physics, with biochemistry, he leaves open the possibility that yet unknown ""laws of nature"" exist on the biological level.I am not at all clear with what he meant by that, but my speculation is that he was (like many others) puzzled by the apparent fact that living organisms evade the second law of thermodynamics.But the confusion is likely a remnant of a simplistic view without considerations that bodies indeed do produce a net increase in entropy by emitting heat to their environment. Another point he leaves as food for thought, is that ""no detailed information about the functioning of the genetic mechanism can emerge from a description of its structure"". Maybe the laws of physics and chemistry leave something unexplained after all?What follows next is a sketch of opinions on issues that philosophers have been trying to answer for centuries. Although Schrödinger approaches these from his own standpoint, not biased be an occupational background in philosophy or heavy jargon. Central to the questions pondered is that of free will vs. determinism, where the author tries to draw a conclusion from the premises that;i) every living body is subject to the laws of nature, andii) one has the experience of being in control and responsible for one's actions.With inspiration from Schopenhauer and the Upanishads, he describes the ""singularity of consciousness"", which probably seems quite self-evident to any reader of his words, yet still manages to serve as reminder that you are alive and able to interact with the world (at least that's the feeling i got when reading it).It is important to note that the ""singularity of consciousness"" does not mean that there exists only one mind, and that everyone else are only ideas within that mind (solipsism). What Schrödinger meant (if i've read him correctly) is that [i]experience[/i] is always singular, i.s no one has exactly the same experience as someone else, even if the situation in which they find themselves is identical.Through further philosophical rambling, the author reaches the conclusion that the ""barrier"" between a perceiving subject and the object being perceived is and illusion. Although his writing cannot be blamed for being obscure, every time i close the book, my sense of understanding of this seems to disappear. However, there is a strong parallel to the idea that a scientist (by conducting experiments, measuring things, etc.) assumes the hypothesis of an objective world, independent of observation.This may not seem very shocking, but contemporary discoveries and theoretical advances in physics (in which Schrödinger played an important art), introduced a paradox to this fundamental assumption. The implications were basically that features of subatomic particles were dependent on measurement in such a way that if one thing was known, another was by default uncertain.This could possibly be what led Schrödinger to say that the boundary between subject and object is illusory.The last part of the book contains brief autobiographical notes of Schrödinger's life at university, the people he met, and some friendly comments toward family members, especially apologetic to his deceased parents. A little surprising, yet understandable, was the exclusion of personal achievements, (such as the wave-equation and further work on quantum mechanics) and anecdotes about experiences for which he is well-known.I have to conclude with the confession that my mpression of this influential character has shifted after reading What is Life?. Mostly, i think, because of his highly polite and formal attitude, which is quite a rare feature among physicist-authors."
256,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2708448-thomas-herzog,4,"What is Life? ★★★★★Based on a series of lectures Schrödinger gave at a point in time when much was already known about the hereditary substance (i.e.: it is the carrier of hereditary information; it is contained in the chromosomes; it is extremely durable and can be copied perfectly, yet allows for mutations to occur; etc.), but what physical form this substance actually takes was still unknown. Many years before the encoding of DNA and its double-helix structure were eventually discovered, Schrödinger muses on a possible physical structure for encoding the hereditary information, this, he speculates, aperiodic crystal. His analogy with morse code (how ""simple"" codes can encode tremendous amounts of information; see also, obviously: binary coding and the digital age) nicely anticipates the rather simple four-base encoding of DNA, and his remarks on the importance of quantum mechanical rules at the scale of the hereditary substance (whose approximate size was already known) were illuminating, as was his summary of life being something that feeds on low entropy to keep its own entropy from constantly increasing (as things are wont to do).Mind and Matter ★★★Schrödinger's speculations about the interplay of mind and matter.

I think ""what is life"" should be separate from ""mind and matter"" as they are largely complete each on their own. While ""what is life"", containing a theoretical account - or prediction - of what is to be expected as the fundamental building blocks of life, is fascinating, I found the ideas in ""mind and matter"" even more thought-provoking and relevant (unsurprisingly so given that DNA has been discovering shortly after the initial publishing and found its way into common knowledge). "
260,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,5,"On ""What is Life?"":One of the most thought-provoking books I've read on the physiochemical basis of life. The book's based on a series of lectures Shrodinger delivered at the Institute for Advance Studies at Trinity College, Dublin in 1943. Shrodinger was writing before the discovery of the structure of DNA ten years later by Watson and Crick, so he is unaware of the gene-bearing nature of DNA. Nevertheless, he is able to deduce with near-perfect precision the kind of molecule that the ""heredity substance"" must be. Above all, it must be a large ""aperiodic solid"" or molecule, capable of an almost miraculous stability, yet also susceptible to small-scale mutations. The virtual permanence of the molecule (the fact that DNA is copied from generation to generation with near-perfect accuracy accounts for the sameness uniting parental organisms with their offspring; the fact that mutations can occur accounts for the difference between living organisms. Such is the DNA molecule. What is it, ultimately, that separates life from inanimate matter? For Shrodinger, it's life's ability to evade the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all closed systems tend toward the disorder and diffusion of energy (i.e., the entropy law). Life feeds on orderly structures, exporting disorderliness out into the universe. Life is that which works against entropy.Shrodinger was a quantum physicist. He was intensely aware of the disturbingly haphazard and random (within circumscribed limits) movement of atomic and subatomic particles. He helped develop the quantum mechanics atomic physicists still use to understand the nature of matter and reality and the very smallest scales. And it's the following paradox that motivated him to write this book: If individual atoms are subject to the haphazard laws of quantum mechanics, and if the heredity substance (the genetic ""code-script,"" as he says) is made up of a tiny number of these atoms, why isn't its molecular structure (a structure that must be EXTREMELY well-ordered in order to preserve genetic information across time) subject to the destructive randomness of quantum forces? In other words, given the randomness of individual atoms, why isn't the hereditary molecule (constituted entirely of atoms) subject to potentially destructive quantum randomness. What initially makes this especially baffling to Shrodinger is the fact that the smaller in scale you go (the more you narrow in on matter), the more disorderly atomic interactions become. If the heredity substance is necessarily tiny, in other words, shouldn't it theoretically be subject to the haphazard movements of quantum physics?It turns our that it shouldn't. Shrodinger resolves his paradox by pointing out that the individual atoms in larger molecules are bound by intensely powerful co-valent bonds, so that, even if atomic activity is disorderly, molecules bind disorderly atoms into orderly conglomerates, which are almost solid-like in their regularity. (Quantum randomness DOES affect the molecular structure, in Shrodinger's view, but only extremely rarely when an ""isomeric transition threshold"" is crossed); it's this stability at the molecular level that makes heredity information or trait-encoding genes possible, which in turn makes life possible. In sum: Shrodinger's main purpose in writing this book is to reconcile the randomness of quantum mechanics with the orderliness of biology. I'm not qualified to comment on the originality of this book, or its effectiveness in legitimizing or ""quantizing"" biology. But he certainly helped bring ""biophysics"" to the fore in the early '50s, inspiring a new generation of scientists, including but not limited to Watson and Crick.""We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it. I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true who aim be lost for ever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them - and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.""- Shrodinger, ""What is Life?"" On ""Mind and Matter"":On ""Autobiographical Sketches"":Told in the manner of an elderly man who sets out to write his life story only to stop midway, realizing that he didn't have the narrative capacities to do it justice or the boldness to reveal some of its more private phases (his ""relations with women""). This, I suppose, will always remain behind the curtain more or less. Though the sketches are dry and incomplete, I appreciate Shrodinger's mustering the wherewithal to follow through on at least a brief picture of his life. He hates chronological biographical accounts but is unable to offer anything more innovative or subtle. No worries, Shrodinger! These were still a pleasure to read."
261,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,5,"I've come across this essay multiple times in the past couple months and each time I'd resolved to read it. 3 months+ isn't so bad. This is the sort of work I wish I had the ambition and seriousness to pick over all the popular nonfiction garbage I stuff my brain with. An actual genius with original ideas communicating them beautifully in the sort of science-loving idea-centric natural-poeticism that we seem to have lost after Feynman. It's not easy to read, the ideas are in their nascent stages and still speculative, the codescript for the idea of a codescript, incomplete, in many places incorrect, and without the closure of a well-planned structural flow that today's nonfiction book would lay out in its development of a topic. In that sense it's more like high quality fiction, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or the sci-fi greats, it demands effort and it rewards attention with layers upon layers of truth, not simply facts but truth, insight into not just reality but the nature of our insight into reality, not just about scientific concepts but the concept of a scientific concept. It's only fitting therefore that it ends with the most meta concept we know, consciousness, itself an infinite recursion since the word itself automatically means the consciousness of consciousness, and so on. The density of ideas and the brevity of their exposition is breathtaking. The epilogue on consciousness alone says everything it needs to say, a book's worth of words in the hands of a less intelligent or more egoistic author, in the space of a few paragraphs. It is possible that's what sets lectures apart from books, they are condensed versions of books worth of learning, a dense representation of the knowledge on offer, to be looked up in detail later. It is more likely that's what sets apart old school geniuses like Schrodinger. I got to the end of the book and was convinced I'd received some spurious abridged cliffnotes copy, I'm so used to ideas being overexplained and developed far beyond the point of maximal marginal returns on exposition. I'm so used to a certain trajectory of information and a certain average ex post facto recce of the total new knowledge received over the hours spent, that when a piece of work like this shows up that totally trounces all benchmarks on these variables, I'm convinced that I've missed a whole lot of empty hours that contribute nothing other than bring down the trajectory to acceptable levels. NotesAnswering deep questions with simple examples (size of atoms and problem of relativity: king who made his arm-length the official distance). As complex as periodic crystals are, aperiodic crystals are that much more, like a patterned wallpaper vs a Raphael tapestry with a divine order unifying zero repetition. Hence organic chemistry (aperiodic crystals) has contributed more to the problem of life than physics (periodic crystals)Atom is 1/5000-1/2000 wavelength of yellow light. Significant because grain of light is smallest thing visible in microscope, so even this has millions of atoms. Trapped by our frame of reference: ‘why are atoms so small’ is really asking ‘why is ratio of us to atoms so large’. What we call thought needs a) orderliness b) interactions with external world (perception) that are also orderly. Need to follow physical laws. But atoms are probabilistic and chaotic, it is from this need for statistical order out of chaos that our order of reality is so vastly above atomic sizeParamagnetism: Boltzmann/Gibb showed Oxygen dipoles get magnetized by field, but why does magnetization double when field is doubled? It is a statistical phenomenon, countered by heat-motion that randomizes atoms and field creating just a slight tendency to prefer acute angle towards field such that over statistical sample, there is alignment. Langevin’s idea of heat entropy vs order, so if temperature is reduced, then magnetization is higher. When temp is close to minimum, then increasing field doesn’t have as high impact on magnetization, close to saturation. Brownian motion: upper layer of droplets slowly sinks with mathematical precision of specific gravity, viscosity, but individual droplets are totally unpredictable, small enough to be impacted by molecular impacts. Bacteria similarly are at the mercy of heat-motion etc. Diffusion: While concentration of 2 substances equalize (movement of molecules from high to low conc) by exact partial differential equation, this is just an approximation. In reality, individual molecules are engaging in random walk, and since in high-conc more are randomly walking, it will follow that in general there is a flow towards the low-conc. Maxwell’s Demon.Square root law of standard error: Error is proportional to inverse square root of sample size N. So sample 100 has 1/10 error, 10%. Sample 1000000 has 1/1000 error. Power of exponential growth of mitosis: Current me is only the 50/60th descendent of single cell egg-me! Mitosis creates 2 copies of each set of chromosomes. But some cells are set aside, reserved to become sex-cells, don’t mitosis much, and just before they’re needed, undergo meiosis, where daughter cells get only 1 copy of chromosomes (haploid), fusing during sex to create a diploid zygote. How my father’s spermatozoa split chromosome during meiosis will define my paternal inheritance of either grandmother or grandfather. But not that simple, because there is frequent crossover. Genes that are far from each other on the strand have higher chance of being crossed over because intersection point lies between them. Studying difference between haploid/diploid can tell us relative positioning of genes coding for a property.How big is a gene? Take physical size of chromosome, establish how many features it codes for, divide, get maximum size of gene (because keep discovering new features, it’s a start point). Turns out to be a cube with edge ~300Angstrom. So a gene is not more than a million or so genes. Not large enough to entail lawful behavior. How marvelous that in a genome you get a 4-dimensional picture not just of an individual, but the development/permanence of that individual in time, across generations!Dangerous mutations usually lurk in background as recessive because don’t do too much damage this way, if dominant they get selected out. That’s why the argument ‘our blood is awesome, we should interbreed’ doesn’t work, the good traits are on the surface and the bad ones are lurking.Need ceteris-paribus conditions to allow good mutations to prove themselves and take root, that’s why mutations are so rare.Most things follow diminishing return curves, true proportionality is rare and remarkable. Radiation causing mutation is proportional, ie first dose and 2nd dose are totally independent. Exact condition is that an ionization just 10 atoms away from the gamete can cause a mutation. It can be passed on to next generation without affecting current individualEnergy states are quantum, not continuous. Start at lowest energy state, absolute zero. Supply heat, increase probability that it jumps. Measured by ‘time of expectation’, how long it takes to jump. This is defined by W/kT (W=energy gap, kT is heat energy of temp T). Strangely exponential relationship. W/kT=30, time is 1/10s. At 60, it is 30,000 years!Statistical theories of heat are full of exponential function, because so highly improbable for certain energy state to be attained randomly. Nernst’s Heat Theorem, 3rd law of thermodynamics, that entropy tends to zero as temperature reaches absolute zero. Remove heat from system and reduce randomness effect. Even at room temperature, the effect of entropy is minimal on chemical reactions. If physics underlies biological phenomena, how to account for free will? One inference is to say I control the physics. I am God. Atman, Brahman.It neatly solves problem of plurality of consciousness that Western philosophy has been trying. Descartes - I exist, single consciousness. Same of everyone else. How to reconcile? 1. It dies with the body, this is intolerable. 2. There is an indivisible eternal soul, in realm of forms. Same as saying plurality is different aspects of single, Maya. "

For it is in relation to the statistical point of view that the structure of the vital parts of living organisms differs so entirely from that of any piece of matter that we physicists and chemists have ever handled physically in our laboratories or mentally at our writing desks the most essential part of a living cell the chromosome fibre may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. In physics we have dealt hitherto only with periodic crystals. To a humble physicist's mind, these are very interesting and complicated objects; they constitute one of the most fascinating and complex material structures by which inanimate nature puzzles his wits. Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal, they are rather plain and dull. Organic chemistry, indeed, in investigating more and more complicated molecules, has come very much nearer to that 'aperiodic crystal' which, in my opinion, is the material carrier of life. And therefore it is small wonder that the organic chemist has already made large and important contributions to the problem of life, whereas the physicist has made next to noneWe now recognize this fundamental law of physics to be just the natural tendency of things to approach the chaotic state (the same tendency that the books of a library or the piles of papers and manuscripts on a writing desk display) unless we obviate it. Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness ( = fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment. that we give off heat is not accidental, but essential. For this is precisely the manner in which we dispose of the surplus entropy we continually produce in our physical life process MIGUEL DE UNAMUNO (quoted from conversation) If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually never says anything at all. from all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics. all physical laws are based on statistics. the interesting statistical type of law, controlling large-scale events, is constituted from the 'dynamical' laws supposed to govern the small-scale events, the interaction of the single atoms and molecules. Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Even in the pathological cases of split consciousness or double personality the two persons alternate, they are never manifest simultaneously Yet each of us has the indisputable impression that the sum total of his own experience and memory forms a unit, quite distinct from that of any other person. He refers to it as 'I'. What is this 'I'? If you analyse it closely you will, I think, find that it is just a little bit more than a collection of single data (experiences and memories), namely the canvas upon which they are collected. And you will, on close introspection, find that what you really mean by 'I' is that ground-stuff upon which they are collected"""

264,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25570776-pi,4,"Reading some of the great minds of the 20th century, of whom Erwin Schrodinger is without a doubt one, is such a treat! You feel getting to know the author personally, with all his kinks and quirks; and Schrodinger has those aplenty: from his excessively high self-esteem, to his not-so-scientific mysticism regarding consciousness. But although this little book has been immensely prescient in predicting the discovery and structure of DNA, referred to by Schrodinger as a type of aperiodic crystal, it has also paved the way for what has been called the central dogma of molecular biology: the idea that information can only pass from DNA to RNA to proteins - never the other way around. This idea, however, has been discredited in recent decades by the amassed evidence to the contrary. Basically, Schrodinger is wrong in saying that physics is ""order from disorder"", but life is somehow different in that it is ""order from order"". Actually, according to our most recent scientific theories, life should also be viewed as (mostly) order from disorder, for it is driven by stochasticity on the micro level all the same. (Anyone interested in reading more on these and similar issues with the gene-centered Neo-Darwinian view on evolution, and the essence of life, I refer to the following recent books: Dance to the Tune of Life: Biological Relativity and The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.)What really makes What is Life?, as well as other writings from science and philosophy, worth a read, however, is not their impact on science and philosophy per se, but their influence on popular culture and literature. For instance, when I was recently reading Wetware by Rudy Rucker, I couldn't fail to notice some of the parallels with Schrodinger's work; especially Rucker's character Berenice discussing the difference in entropy production between different 'bopper' bodies. I might be wrong with this parallel, but I'm pretty sure many sci-fi authors, including Rudy Rucker, have read What is life? and it has influenced their thinking a great deal. In any case, I truly believe reading science and philosophy can significantly bolster your experience when reading anything else, especially sci-fi. So why not go for it?"

Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology)."
267,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"Schrödinger was a very well respected physicist, who gave us a new language to describe the behaviour of the quantum realm. It is thus with skepticism that one might approach a book (essay?) like this, applying quantum theory to biology. But throughout the book what comes through heavily is Schrödinger’s humility – which is a rare character for physicists when discussing biology. Nevertheless, his application of physics-based reasoning manages to justify some facts of biology and populate new ones. As an example, he starts with the somewhat odd question “why is the human body so much bigger than an atom” to expound core points such as whether physics can hope to quantify the behaviour of living systems.Perhaps the most surprising thing is that he actually does provide an answer to the book’s eponymous question: what is life? It is something that consumes negative entropy (i.e order) to stave off it’s own inevitable decay into disorder. In his words, all living things have: an astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos by 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environmentThat is basically saying that we consume food (highly ordered arrangements of molecules) and output it as heat (disorder), in the mean time maintaining our relatively ordered state. This is a wonderfully original perspective, but one that anyone can see to be sensible and according with the facts. On a side note, after reading this I had to read Asimov’s The Last Question again… The second law of thermodynamics is haunting."

The first book, What is Life?, gives the reader a very basic understanding of genetics. It is precisely the hereditary substance and the nature of mutation in the genetic substance that encouraged the discovery of the double helix in DNA. It is a most essential read; and despite the fact that it was written by a physicist, it portrays Schrödinger's keen interest and understanding of biological functions—and the incorporation of his own physical knowledge.The second book goes through the consideration of mind and its role in evolution—how the mind may contribute to our (what I consider) continual progression as a species. Although, it is suggested that, like crocodiles and many insects, we have reached, not the peak of evolution (which would imply that we are the best kind of thing—not true), but a sort of plateau which means that we no longer require adjustment; mutations still occur, however. It considers the effects of mind on our various sensual apparatus, and how the memes which are passed down from generation to generation will reflect our capability to survive—what he called a 'feigned Lamarckism'. The considerations are truly inspiring.The autobiographical sketches, although somewhat insightful, contain nothing of interest. It shall only reveal to the reader the process by which Erwin Schrödinger became a scientist, which isn't very interesting; as Schrödinger said himself: 'I am not good at telling stories'."
269,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31677006-kaio,4,"These are personal notes that did not fit into the appropriate section.Interesting initial chapters on why most laws are only statistical in nature and describe things in good approximation only because of the sheer number of single ""things"" that behave according to exact laws. That extrapolation to human senses also intesting.I did not get everything on the genetics chapters, as I have not studied it in a long time, and did not bother to look it up.Very interesting idea about how life has to ""feed"" on ""negative entropy"" as he calls it, because life is constantly producing entropy (disorder) in the processes to keep it alive (metabolism) and this excess entropy has to be shed or transferred into matter or enegy (it is not that well explained) that is in a state of lower entropy. There is a necessary correlation between the ingested energy and ingested negative entropy that is not explained in the book. I need to look deeper into this.The chapters on deducing the nature of the genetic material I mostly glanced over though he seems to have made pivotal statements which somewhat led to the discovery of the DNA structure. The epilogue on consciousness, the actual reason I read this book, is much less precise logically. I came onto this book because it was stated somewhere else something along the lines of: ""One of the fathers of quantum physics tries to reduce the last bastions of human ignorance to physics, suggests it to be possible for the mechanisms of life, but claims it impossible in the case of consciousnees"".Did not add much to my understanding of the Philosophy of Mind.All in all an interesting read."

So step by step the the reader is hand held with all the complicated maths tucked away and only brought out when absolutely necessary to avoid that awfulness until at the end one is left with an interesting proposition: what kind of weird law defying miracle are made of? Life, for all of our understanding is a square peg in a round hole, it don't make no damn sense essentially. But we try valiantly to make sense of it... for reasons. SO after all the science stuff (which is actually nice refresher on the basics of human chemistry (the notable absence of DNA notwithstanding) we are given a short treatise on how this all affects us as conscious beings. Well my ears perked up at that. Could science be the path I need to follow to kill my arch nemesis the ego? Mr. Schrödinger seems to say to me the same thing a lot of authors have been saying to me lately...namely consciousness, the ego, is a diffusive thing not to be pinned down. He does however tease some theories on the fact that if we do have free will, that means we can manipulate individual atoms, making us walking gods when we make even the tiniest of decisions. But that's countered by the possibility that life is somewhat mechanical in nature and determinism rears its ugly head.I just don't know my dudes. But I will continue the noble pursuit."

I found ot very enlightening as shrodinger repeatedly approached mainstream issues with an unusual method. How do you distinguish life from death? Easy just use the second law of thermodynamics! What I found most interesting in this book is that shrodinger would repeatedly say stange things such as: The scientific approach does not reveal the human soul, collective consciousness is due to the existence of god, plato was a genius for having invented the theory of forms and even going so far as to quote from Jung and some persian mystics! And my first reaction is to shrug it off as pseudoscience or fiction but then I'd remember im reading a book to the greatest scientists in the modern age! If anyone has the right to declare the scientific approach inadequate it's him. I also find it admirable that although famous as physicist schrodinger was much more.

I can see why the field of molecular biology would be so fascinating to those who would come after, using Schrodinger's ""aperiodic crystal"" as their template for what to seek in their eventual discovery of DNA (another win for the predictive power of science).

Complex ideas are explained in very simple manner, by using great analogies in various cases. In all, it is a great book which, I believe, should be made available to high school students when they actually learn these topics, albeit as different subjects. It will give them a perspective of how these subjects gel together in the real world to form science as we know it. "

But then, he argues that things are really not so different. I think this book, short though it is, may take another read before I can fully grasp what he was getting at.

281,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74129681-nemantro,5,"When a physicist talks about biology , the DNA becomes a ""aperiodic crystal"", mutation is all about Quantum leaps, evolution is a bunch of isomers,.. and Life is a matter of entropy and order."
282,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3070035-clio,3,"All I knew about Schrodinger before reading this was about his paradoxical cat.I found his writing style a little clunky - I kept getting thrown off when he'd introduce an idea, then say ""and now we can prove that is all haberdash and silly hats"" and then go on to say something that didn't sound any more provable to me than the idea he'd just dismissed. But he did reference a lot of other books that influenced his thoughts that I hadn't read. I think if I go back and read a bunch of that, then come back and read this again, I'd follow him better. He's part of a whole tradition of ideas so it's hard to just take out his ideas and read them out of context (at least if you aren't super comfortable with quantum physics and thinking in paradoxes).In What is Life?, Schrodinger discussed the type of physical laws that he thinks govern life and the difference between statistical laws that produce order from disorder and clockwork/pure mechanical laws that produced order from order. He referenced Max Planck a bunch in that section. He also starts to talk about the Upanishads (and Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy) and the weird paradoxes of consciousness as something like a soul that is tied to one body, a thing that you identify as your Self and think is an individual, thereby distinguishing yourself from other Selves in other bodies - from what I understood in this piece and Mind and Matter, he thinks consciousness can only be one thing and the multiplicity of consciousness we see in Western thought is sort of alike a mirage that arises from our inability to see where our own mind fits into our view of the world since we are using it (or pieces of it) to interpret the world. It has to simplify our world-view by taking itself out of the picture, so our picture is not complete. Schrodinger says ""consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing, produced by a deception (the Indian Maya); the same illusation is produced in a gallery of mirrors, and in the same way Gaurisankar and Mt Everest turned out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" So in the hall of mirrors, we don't know exactly what we are looking at and think we are looking at many different images when really we are seeing one image. From different viewpoints, we may see the same thing and imagine it is different things since it may look slightly different. Although his example here is actually wrong; per the American Geological Society, Gaurisankar and Mt Everest are ""different peaks, thirty-six miles apart,"" as determined in a 1903 survey (ending an approximately 50-year argument about whether they were the same peak). In the same vein, I'm not convinced Schrodinger is right about many of his opinions here, but I think the most interesting part is not necessarily the points he puts forward as solutions but the questions he is trying to answer.He says that we may see the ""I"" within ourselves as distinct and made up of our own individual experiences and memories, but he believes the part that is really ""I"" or the consciousness is not the set of experiences but the ""canvas upon which they are collected"" - if we view consciousness in this way, it is much easier to believe it could all be of one piece. He may not be entirely convincing on any of his points in this book, but I do think he did a good job of dismissing some of the logic that would certainly bar his ideas from being true, so that you can see the things he purports could be true.Schrodinger's ideas on ethics are interesting too; he believes man is subject to a constant ethical evolution along with biological evolution, and that for Man (and each man) there is sort of a battle between the primitive will and our evolving ethical ideals, so that to be ethical we have to be ""self-conquering,"" ""chisel and statue, conquerors and conquered at the same time."" Back on the subject of the mind not really being able to see itself in its concept of the world, he quotes the hell out of Sir Charles Sherrington's Man on His Nature, which he is in love with. ""The mind per se cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand. Then the impasse meets us, the blank of the 'how' of mind, leverage on matter."" - he wonders whether we are the truly the ""doers"" of the deeds for which we feel responsible. Then he goes off on a bunch of tangents about how you can't ""see"" the mind anywhere but that we often think we see it behind someone's eyes, that we often see eyes as more active than the passive sense organs they truly are. Last night I fell asleep wondering if blind people think their minds live behind their eyes, so I guess it is an interesting question. People with different senses may use different symbols. The mind is not truly there in our heads, he reminds us: ""Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held against the life and the emotions of the soul.""He goes on another interesting tangent about how our senses work and how our brain sort of has sub-brains and their data is somehow integrated which is another source of those dang duality mirages he is always thinking about. And I started thinking about split-brain patient studies and what those and similar psychological studies say about consciousness - are we describing the inputs and behavior of the body after the fact? I remember learning in high school that researches could manipulate people's behavior and then they would try to convince themselves they had done things for certain reasons after the fact. I think I could easily fall into an internet black hole on those topics, whoa nelly. Then he starts talking about whether time and space dimensions are a property our mind applies to the world so that we can understand it or whether they are an innate property of the world - but to Schrodinger, what is the difference between what our mind tells us it sees of the world and the world itself? So for him, it doesn't matter whether the self applies these dimensions or not, but he thinks the interesting idea is that there are aspects of the ""one thing - mind or world -"" that ""may well be capable of other forms of appearance that we cannot grasp and that do not imply the notions of space and time"" - this makes a bit more space for the idea that there can be some aspect of consciousness that is not tied down by problems of ""before"" and ""after"" for its containing body. It doesn't make it any easier to conceptualize, since we can't really understand what something like that would look like, but it takes some of the finality out of the conclusions I always find myself trapped in. What is certainty when we take out dimensions, after all? (Oof I don't take enough drugs for this book.)Anyway, the questions he's thought through in this book (these lectures, I suppose) are interesting and worth thinking about if you don't mind lying awake in the dark at night. I think sometimes I have so much I want to read that I get afraid of this ambiguous thing called ""wasting time"" and so sometimes I read when I should be taking a thinking break instead. If you're always on intake mode you're never stirring those ideas around. This book made me want to stop and think, even if I didn't see where he was coming from with some of his answers.The short autobiographical section at the end was interesting to me for his description of a time of upheaval in Austria (the end of an empire, the entrance of cars, Nazis), and also for his light touches on seeing St Elmo's Fire, the phosphorescence of the sea, and jellyfish. Ah, the mysteries of the world! He also points out that the way his school did half-days gave him a lot of time to think and to study further the things he was really interested in (and to learn from his father, who he got to spend a lot of time with)."
283,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"This book was written by Schrödinger, one of the most influential physicists to ever live, making important contributions to quantum theory. His equation (Schrödinger equation), calculates the wave function of a system and how it changes across time. This work was based on public lectures from Trinity College in 1943. It's mostly concerned with biology, although it has considerable tangents. he wanted to know how life related to physics and chemistry. It starts by showing why life seems to be so big when compared to atoms. We have around 30 trillion cells. And each cell has an average of 100 trillion atoms. He argues that at small scales, reality is too chaotic to have order. Quantum chaos fluctuations prevent steady natural laws. As a system gets better, such noise gets smaller and smaller. In further chapters, he touches on hereditary, evolution, molecules, entropy and more.Some of it was truly groundbreaking. At the time, how hereditary information was passed was unknown. He made a theoretical prediction that an ""aperiodic crystal"" would store the information required for living things to pass their ""blueprint"" of how the molecules should be organized. This inspired the later discovery of DNA. He was truly a brilliant mind and it was very enjoyable to read his work. I particularly enjoyed his humility and willingness to describe his thought process. The book was written for the layman audience, and he succeeded in doing so. You don't need any background to read, although at times it was nevertheless difficult. Luckily regarding biology and hereditary, I had some previous knowledge that helped, but the few times that he went into mathematical theorems, I was completely lost. The latter part of the book was my favorite. While I enjoyed the rest, it was a times too sciency for my taste. Towards the end it left more technical subjects related to biology and physics and was more concerned with philosophy, especially as it relates to consciousness. What strikes me the most is how well aware he was of the body/mind problem, despite him a physicist. He certainly wasn't blind to a materialistic worldview, and he easily articulates many of its problems when trying to account for consciousness. Some of it I found not the best argued super well, for example when he touched on free will. But his description of qualia, for example, was incredibly well written. He even got a bit mystical at times, which took me completely by surprise, and mentioned the Upanishads (a religious/philosophical text from Hinduism) influenced by Schopenhauer and Huxley's perennial philosophy. He considered a possible ""unified consciousness"", in which each individual experience was only a fraction of the conscious universe, but nevertheless united. It's a brilliant book. The title of it couldn't be more fitting. If you wonder what life is, how can it persist through the marching and endless entropy, or what distinguishes something living from something that is dead, then Schrödinger will walk you through his genius and explain it. A journey through biology, physics, and philosophy from one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century."

It’s a beautiful walk, especially during autumn, when the golden leaves envelop the black tar of the road. At the junction, stands a tall brick coloured building with Institiúid Ard-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath written in bold, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies - DIAS. The Irish home of the Nobel prize winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger.Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies was established by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, in 1940 to “provide facilities for the furtherance of advanced study and the conduct of research in specialised branches of knowledge”. There are three schools that form the institute - School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic studies. DIAS is arguably best known for hosting the lecture series “What is Life?”, delivered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1943.Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939, Schrödinger had been invited by Éamon de Valera, to help establish the institute. He moved to Clontarf and he lived there until 1955. The lectures were converted into a book titled ‘What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell’ for the layperson.Erwin Schrödinger was a theoretical physicist whose contributions to quantum theory were unparalleled at the time. He is best known for his rather paradoxical thought experiment, involving a cat that is dead and alive at the same time. Famously known as Schrödinger’s cat, this continues to be featured in discussions regarding application of quantum mechanics to everyday objects.But what is little known about Schrödinger is his interest and knowledge of genetics and biology. He was curious about the nature of the cell and what constituted life. In the public lecture series, What is Life, Schrödinger explores these concepts and does so in the language of the lay person. The book was published based on the lecture series in 1944.Schrödinger explores the idea of the cell and of life from the perspective of a physicist. He modestly apologizes to the biologists, time and again, for not considering the biological aspects or constraints while presenting a few of his ideas.What is Life: The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell reads like a science textbook. It begins with a detailed explanation about the significance of large number of atoms coming together and how they form working components in our bodies. He enunciates the idea of cell division better than how I can remember from high school biology. The book then takes on how the concepts of thermodynamics and crystal structures shape cell behavior. And he ends it with his own musings on determinism and free will. If free will exists. What does one mean by ‘I’ and the philosophy of identity.The lecture and the subsequent publication of the book had tremendous impact on understanding the genetic aspects of the DNA. "
285,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8122302-neko,4,"(Quite a lengthy review i wrote in English class) This book has served as a source of inspiration for many scientists, especially biologists converted from the field of physics. Despite being written in the 1940's, before the discovery of DNA, it isn't hard to understand why this piece was influential. Shrödinger's modest perspective, philosophical insights and a tone so humble as making every sentence appear meticulously crafted, is not something found in typical popular-science literature. Known for being his only publication for a lay audience, ""What is Life?"" is an attempt by Schrödinger, not mainly to educate; but to inspire. It is divided into 3 parts, the first containing descriptions of basic physical principles as well as the foundation of living organisms. The second part is a more speculative and abstract presentation of the author's views of life, reality and epistemology. This edition of the book finishes with a 3:rd part entitled ""autobiographical sketches"", which -as suggested by its title- contains information about Schrödinger's own life.Let me begin by discussing the first part by briefly stating that the scope of this review is far too limited to expand on all the interesting tangential thoughts raised be the book. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to pick out some of the most pertinent topics.To emphasize the modesty of his approach, Shrödinger calls himself a naive physicist and starts by challenging the anthropocentric nature of both scientific and philosphical questions. An example is the question ""why are atoms so small?"", which can be contrasted with ""why are human sensory organs not re fined enough to perceive them?"". The latter question is both easier to explain by science (evolutionary adaptation and structure of bio-molecules etc.) and less naive. Indeed, the first question seems rather meaningless and impossible to answer with a scientific approach (as ""why?"" questions in general tend to be). An important point to consider (one that is often overlooked) is the limits of science. Schrödinger addresses this by pointing out the approximate, statistical nature of physical laws; they may be accurate enough to measure the distance to the sun, but the more decimal-places you have, the more uncertain the numbers become. On the smallest of scales, our measurements become inaccurate. But we can nevertheless determine the statistically significant outcomes by testing multiple times. Yet, since our time is also limited (death, more important occupations etc.), the constrains are at both ends of the spectrum; the infinitesimally small and the infinitely large.Although a more pragmatic approach is adopted by physicists (""what matters is what works"", to paraphrase Richard Feynman), it is both interesting and humbling to think about our limitations.Schrödinger also extends his discussion by including biology, and a comparison between quantum jumps (sudden leaps by sub-atomic particles between discrete energy-levels of an atom) with random mutations in the genome. (At this point, I'm not sure if he means that the former is a likely cause for genetic mutations, of it's merely an analogy).Another comparison he makes, is likening aperiodic crystals with chromosomes, both being of an asymmetrical form. I think the intention here is to point to the 'uniqueness' of the fundamental parts that make up a live organism; if we were made from periodic crystals, there would be no basis for diversity on which natural selection could work.But there is also another part of this discussion which, somewhat ironically concerns the stability of the hereditary substance. Despite changing through evolutionary time, the material of our genomes is relatively stable (undergoes only small changes in each generation). On this matter, the author insinuates a physical explanation based on discrete energy levels of molecules, to account for their relatively stable nature.After taking the reader through a rather lengthy discussion (which the previous passages of this review attempted to outline), Shrödinger states his main reason for writing this piece. By merging concepts from his formal occupation, physics, with biochemistry, he leaves open the possibility that yet unknown ""laws of nature"" exist on the biological level.I am not at all clear with what he meant by that, but my speculation is that he was (like many others) puzzled by the apparent fact that living organisms evade the second law of thermodynamics.But the confusion is likely a remnant of a simplistic view without considerations that bodies indeed do produce a net increase in entropy by emitting heat to their environment. Another point he leaves as food for thought, is that ""no detailed information about the functioning of the genetic mechanism can emerge from a description of its structure"". Maybe the laws of physics and chemistry leave something unexplained after all?What follows next is a sketch of opinions on issues that philosophers have been trying to answer for centuries. Although Schrödinger approaches these from his own standpoint, not biased be an occupational background in philosophy or heavy jargon. Central to the questions pondered is that of free will vs. determinism, where the author tries to draw a conclusion from the premises that;i) every living body is subject to the laws of nature, andii) one has the experience of being in control and responsible for one's actions.With inspiration from Schopenhauer and the Upanishads, he describes the ""singularity of consciousness"", which probably seems quite self-evident to any reader of his words, yet still manages to serve as reminder that you are alive and able to interact with the world (at least that's the feeling i got when reading it).It is important to note that the ""singularity of consciousness"" does not mean that there exists only one mind, and that everyone else are only ideas within that mind (solipsism). What Schrödinger meant (if i've read him correctly) is that [i]experience[/i] is always singular, i.s no one has exactly the same experience as someone else, even if the situation in which they find themselves is identical.Through further philosophical rambling, the author reaches the conclusion that the ""barrier"" between a perceiving subject and the object being perceived is and illusion. Although his writing cannot be blamed for being obscure, every time i close the book, my sense of understanding of this seems to disappear. However, there is a strong parallel to the idea that a scientist (by conducting experiments, measuring things, etc.) assumes the hypothesis of an objective world, independent of observation.This may not seem very shocking, but contemporary discoveries and theoretical advances in physics (in which Schrödinger played an important art), introduced a paradox to this fundamental assumption. The implications were basically that features of subatomic particles were dependent on measurement in such a way that if one thing was known, another was by default uncertain.This could possibly be what led Schrödinger to say that the boundary between subject and object is illusory.The last part of the book contains brief autobiographical notes of Schrödinger's life at university, the people he met, and some friendly comments toward family members, especially apologetic to his deceased parents. A little surprising, yet understandable, was the exclusion of personal achievements, (such as the wave-equation and further work on quantum mechanics) and anecdotes about experiences for which he is well-known.I have to conclude with the confession that my mpression of this influential character has shifted after reading What is Life?. Mostly, i think, because of his highly polite and formal attitude, which is quite a rare feature among physicist-authors."
286,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2708448-thomas-herzog,4,"What is Life? ★★★★★Based on a series of lectures Schrödinger gave at a point in time when much was already known about the hereditary substance (i.e.: it is the carrier of hereditary information; it is contained in the chromosomes; it is extremely durable and can be copied perfectly, yet allows for mutations to occur; etc.), but what physical form this substance actually takes was still unknown. Many years before the encoding of DNA and its double-helix structure were eventually discovered, Schrödinger muses on a possible physical structure for encoding the hereditary information, this, he speculates, aperiodic crystal. His analogy with morse code (how ""simple"" codes can encode tremendous amounts of information; see also, obviously: binary coding and the digital age) nicely anticipates the rather simple four-base encoding of DNA, and his remarks on the importance of quantum mechanical rules at the scale of the hereditary substance (whose approximate size was already known) were illuminating, as was his summary of life being something that feeds on low entropy to keep its own entropy from constantly increasing (as things are wont to do).Mind and Matter ★★★Schrödinger's speculations about the interplay of mind and matter. Some interesting thoughts, but all in all too unfocused and unconvincing.But some of you, I am sure, will call this mysticism.As, indeed, do I."

289,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75706676-steve-abreu,5,"Very impressed with Schrödinger’s writing, so scientific, clear and yet easy to understand - my new personal standard for popular science writing. I think ""what is life"" should be separate from ""mind and matter"" as they are largely complete each on their own. While ""what is life"", containing a theoretical account - or prediction - of what is to be expected as the fundamental building blocks of life, is fascinating, I found the ideas in ""mind and matter"" even more thought-provoking and relevant (unsurprisingly so given that DNA has been discovering shortly after the initial publishing and found its way into common knowledge). "
290,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,5,"On ""What is Life?"":One of the most thought-provoking books I've read on the physiochemical basis of life. The book's based on a series of lectures Shrodinger delivered at the Institute for Advance Studies at Trinity College, Dublin in 1943. Shrodinger was writing before the discovery of the structure of DNA ten years later by Watson and Crick, so he is unaware of the gene-bearing nature of DNA. Nevertheless, he is able to deduce with near-perfect precision the kind of molecule that the ""heredity substance"" must be. Above all, it must be a large ""aperiodic solid"" or molecule, capable of an almost miraculous stability, yet also susceptible to small-scale mutations. The virtual permanence of the molecule (the fact that DNA is copied from generation to generation with near-perfect accuracy accounts for the sameness uniting parental organisms with their offspring; the fact that mutations can occur accounts for the difference between living organisms. Such is the DNA molecule. What is it, ultimately, that separates life from inanimate matter? For Shrodinger, it's life's ability to evade the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all closed systems tend toward the disorder and diffusion of energy (i.e., the entropy law). Life feeds on orderly structures, exporting disorderliness out into the universe. Life is that which works against entropy.Shrodinger was a quantum physicist. He was intensely aware of the disturbingly haphazard and random (within circumscribed limits) movement of atomic and subatomic particles. He helped develop the quantum mechanics atomic physicists still use to understand the nature of matter and reality and the very smallest scales. And it's the following paradox that motivated him to write this book: If individual atoms are subject to the haphazard laws of quantum mechanics, and if the heredity substance (the genetic ""code-script,"" as he says) is made up of a tiny number of these atoms, why isn't its molecular structure (a structure that must be EXTREMELY well-ordered in order to preserve genetic information across time) subject to the destructive randomness of quantum forces? In other words, given the randomness of individual atoms, why isn't the hereditary molecule (constituted entirely of atoms) subject to potentially destructive quantum randomness. What initially makes this especially baffling to Shrodinger is the fact that the smaller in scale you go (the more you narrow in on matter), the more disorderly atomic interactions become. If the heredity substance is necessarily tiny, in other words, shouldn't it theoretically be subject to the haphazard movements of quantum physics?It turns our that it shouldn't. Shrodinger resolves his paradox by pointing out that the individual atoms in larger molecules are bound by intensely powerful co-valent bonds, so that, even if atomic activity is disorderly, molecules bind disorderly atoms into orderly conglomerates, which are almost solid-like in their regularity. (Quantum randomness DOES affect the molecular structure, in Shrodinger's view, but only extremely rarely when an ""isomeric transition threshold"" is crossed); it's this stability at the molecular level that makes heredity information or trait-encoding genes possible, which in turn makes life possible. In sum: Shrodinger's main purpose in writing this book is to reconcile the randomness of quantum mechanics with the orderliness of biology. I'm not qualified to comment on the originality of this book, or its effectiveness in legitimizing or ""quantizing"" biology. But he certainly helped bring ""biophysics"" to the fore in the early '50s, inspiring a new generation of scientists, including but not limited to Watson and Crick.""We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it. I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true who aim be lost for ever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them - and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.""- Shrodinger, ""What is Life?"" On ""Mind and Matter"":On ""Autobiographical Sketches"":Told in the manner of an elderly man who sets out to write his life story only to stop midway, realizing that he didn't have the narrative capacities to do it justice or the boldness to reveal some of its more private phases (his ""relations with women""). This, I suppose, will always remain behind the curtain more or less. Though the sketches are dry and incomplete, I appreciate Shrodinger's mustering the wherewithal to follow through on at least a brief picture of his life. He hates chronological biographical accounts but is unable to offer anything more innovative or subtle. No worries, Shrodinger! These were still a pleasure to read."
291,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,5,"I've come across this essay multiple times in the past couple months and each time I'd resolved to read it. 3 months+ isn't so bad. This is the sort of work I wish I had the ambition and seriousness to pick over all the popular nonfiction garbage I stuff my brain with. An actual genius with original ideas communicating them beautifully in the sort of science-loving idea-centric natural-poeticism that we seem to have lost after Feynman. It's not easy to read, the ideas are in their nascent stages and still speculative, the codescript for the idea of a codescript, incomplete, in many places incorrect, and without the closure of a well-planned structural flow that today's nonfiction book would lay out in its development of a topic. In that sense it's more like high quality fiction, like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or the sci-fi greats, it demands effort and it rewards attention with layers upon layers of truth, not simply facts but truth, insight into not just reality but the nature of our insight into reality, not just about scientific concepts but the concept of a scientific concept. It's only fitting therefore that it ends with the most meta concept we know, consciousness, itself an infinite recursion since the word itself automatically means the consciousness of consciousness, and so on. The density of ideas and the brevity of their exposition is breathtaking. The epilogue on consciousness alone says everything it needs to say, a book's worth of words in the hands of a less intelligent or more egoistic author, in the space of a few paragraphs. It is possible that's what sets lectures apart from books, they are condensed versions of books worth of learning, a dense representation of the knowledge on offer, to be looked up in detail later. It is more likely that's what sets apart old school geniuses like Schrodinger. I got to the end of the book and was convinced I'd received some spurious abridged cliffnotes copy, I'm so used to ideas being overexplained and developed far beyond the point of maximal marginal returns on exposition. I'm so used to a certain trajectory of information and a certain average ex post facto recce of the total new knowledge received over the hours spent, that when a piece of work like this shows up that totally trounces all benchmarks on these variables, I'm convinced that I've missed a whole lot of empty hours that contribute nothing other than bring down the trajectory to acceptable levels. NotesAnswering deep questions with simple examples (size of atoms and problem of relativity: king who made his arm-length the official distance). As complex as periodic crystals are, aperiodic crystals are that much more, like a patterned wallpaper vs a Raphael tapestry with a divine order unifying zero repetition. Hence organic chemistry (aperiodic crystals) has contributed more to the problem of life than physics (periodic crystals)Atom is 1/5000-1/2000 wavelength of yellow light. Significant because grain of light is smallest thing visible in microscope, so even this has millions of atoms. Trapped by our frame of reference: ‘why are atoms so small’ is really asking ‘why is ratio of us to atoms so large’. What we call thought needs a) orderliness b) interactions with external world (perception) that are also orderly. Need to follow physical laws. But atoms are probabilistic and chaotic, it is from this need for statistical order out of chaos that our order of reality is so vastly above atomic sizeParamagnetism: Boltzmann/Gibb showed Oxygen dipoles get magnetized by field, but why does magnetization double when field is doubled? It is a statistical phenomenon, countered by heat-motion that randomizes atoms and field creating just a slight tendency to prefer acute angle towards field such that over statistical sample, there is alignment. Langevin’s idea of heat entropy vs order, so if temperature is reduced, then magnetization is higher. When temp is close to minimum, then increasing field doesn’t have as high impact on magnetization, close to saturation. Brownian motion: upper layer of droplets slowly sinks with mathematical precision of specific gravity, viscosity, but individual droplets are totally unpredictable, small enough to be impacted by molecular impacts. Bacteria similarly are at the mercy of heat-motion etc. Diffusion: While concentration of 2 substances equalize (movement of molecules from high to low conc) by exact partial differential equation, this is just an approximation. In reality, individual molecules are engaging in random walk, and since in high-conc more are randomly walking, it will follow that in general there is a flow towards the low-conc. Maxwell’s Demon.Square root law of standard error: Error is proportional to inverse square root of sample size N. So sample 100 has 1/10 error, 10%. Sample 1000000 has 1/1000 error. Power of exponential growth of mitosis: Current me is only the 50/60th descendent of single cell egg-me! Mitosis creates 2 copies of each set of chromosomes. But some cells are set aside, reserved to become sex-cells, don’t mitosis much, and just before they’re needed, undergo meiosis, where daughter cells get only 1 copy of chromosomes (haploid), fusing during sex to create a diploid zygote. How my father’s spermatozoa split chromosome during meiosis will define my paternal inheritance of either grandmother or grandfather. But not that simple, because there is frequent crossover. Genes that are far from each other on the strand have higher chance of being crossed over because intersection point lies between them. Studying difference between haploid/diploid can tell us relative positioning of genes coding for a property.How big is a gene? Take physical size of chromosome, establish how many features it codes for, divide, get maximum size of gene (because keep discovering new features, it’s a start point). Turns out to be a cube with edge ~300Angstrom. So a gene is not more than a million or so genes. Not large enough to entail lawful behavior. How marvelous that in a genome you get a 4-dimensional picture not just of an individual, but the development/permanence of that individual in time, across generations!Dangerous mutations usually lurk in background as recessive because don’t do too much damage this way, if dominant they get selected out. That’s why the argument ‘our blood is awesome, we should interbreed’ doesn’t work, the good traits are on the surface and the bad ones are lurking.Need ceteris-paribus conditions to allow good mutations to prove themselves and take root, that’s why mutations are so rare.Most things follow diminishing return curves, true proportionality is rare and remarkable. Radiation causing mutation is proportional, ie first dose and 2nd dose are totally independent. Exact condition is that an ionization just 10 atoms away from the gamete can cause a mutation. It can be passed on to next generation without affecting current individualEnergy states are quantum, not continuous. Start at lowest energy state, absolute zero. Supply heat, increase probability that it jumps. Measured by ‘time of expectation’, how long it takes to jump. This is defined by W/kT (W=energy gap, kT is heat energy of temp T). Strangely exponential relationship. W/kT=30, time is 1/10s. At 60, it is 30,000 years!Statistical theories of heat are full of exponential function, because so highly improbable for certain energy state to be attained randomly. Nernst’s Heat Theorem, 3rd law of thermodynamics, that entropy tends to zero as temperature reaches absolute zero. Remove heat from system and reduce randomness effect. Even at room temperature, the effect of entropy is minimal on chemical reactions. If physics underlies biological phenomena, how to account for free will? One inference is to say I control the physics. I am God. Atman, Brahman.It neatly solves problem of plurality of consciousness that Western philosophy has been trying. Descartes - I exist, single consciousness. Same of everyone else. How to reconcile? 1. It dies with the body, this is intolerable. 2. There is an indivisible eternal soul, in realm of forms. Same as saying plurality is different aspects of single, Maya. "
292,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18775997-lucas,4,"A collection of quotes and sections from the book that I enjoyed:""The laws of physics and chemistry are statistical throughout. For it is in relation to the statistical point of view that the structure of the vital parts of living organisms differs so entirely from that of any piece of matter that we physicists and chemists have ever handled physically in our laboratories or mentally at our writing desks the most essential part of a living cell the chromosome fibre may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. In physics we have dealt hitherto only with periodic crystals. To a humble physicist's mind, these are very interesting and complicated objects; they constitute one of the most fascinating and complex material structures by which inanimate nature puzzles his wits. Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal, they are rather plain and dull. Organic chemistry, indeed, in investigating more and more complicated molecules, has come very much nearer to that 'aperiodic crystal' which, in my opinion, is the material carrier of life. And therefore it is small wonder that the organic chemist has already made large and important contributions to the problem of life, whereas the physicist has made next to noneWe now recognize this fundamental law of physics to be just the natural tendency of things to approach the chaotic state (the same tendency that the books of a library or the piles of papers and manuscripts on a writing desk display) unless we obviate it. Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness ( = fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment. that we give off heat is not accidental, but essential. For this is precisely the manner in which we dispose of the surplus entropy we continually produce in our physical life process MIGUEL DE UNAMUNO (quoted from conversation) If a man never contradicts himself, the reason must be that he virtually never says anything at all. from all we have learnt about the structure of living matter, we must be prepared to find it working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the ordinary laws of physics. all physical laws are based on statistics. the interesting statistical type of law, controlling large-scale events, is constituted from the 'dynamical' laws supposed to govern the small-scale events, the interaction of the single atoms and molecules. Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Even in the pathological cases of split consciousness or double personality the two persons alternate, they are never manifest simultaneously Yet each of us has the indisputable impression that the sum total of his own experience and memory forms a unit, quite distinct from that of any other person. He refers to it as 'I'. What is this 'I'? If you analyse it closely you will, I think, find that it is just a little bit more than a collection of single data (experiences and memories), namely the canvas upon which they are collected. And you will, on close introspection, find that what you really mean by 'I' is that ground-stuff upon which they are collected"""
293,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26686799-joel-croteau,4,"An excellent book that does not require any particular scientific background, and quite insightful if you can decipher Schrödinger's chronic run-on sentences."
294,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25570776-pi,4,"Reading some of the great minds of the 20th century, of whom Erwin Schrodinger is without a doubt one, is such a treat! You feel getting to know the author personally, with all his kinks and quirks; and Schrodinger has those aplenty: from his excessively high self-esteem, to his not-so-scientific mysticism regarding consciousness. But although this little book has been immensely prescient in predicting the discovery and structure of DNA, referred to by Schrodinger as a type of aperiodic crystal, it has also paved the way for what has been called the central dogma of molecular biology: the idea that information can only pass from DNA to RNA to proteins - never the other way around. This idea, however, has been discredited in recent decades by the amassed evidence to the contrary. Basically, Schrodinger is wrong in saying that physics is ""order from disorder"", but life is somehow different in that it is ""order from order"". Actually, according to our most recent scientific theories, life should also be viewed as (mostly) order from disorder, for it is driven by stochasticity on the micro level all the same. (Anyone interested in reading more on these and similar issues with the gene-centered Neo-Darwinian view on evolution, and the essence of life, I refer to the following recent books: Dance to the Tune of Life: Biological Relativity and The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.)What really makes What is Life?, as well as other writings from science and philosophy, worth a read, however, is not their impact on science and philosophy per se, but their influence on popular culture and literature. For instance, when I was recently reading Wetware by Rudy Rucker, I couldn't fail to notice some of the parallels with Schrodinger's work; especially Rucker's character Berenice discussing the difference in entropy production between different 'bopper' bodies. I might be wrong with this parallel, but I'm pretty sure many sci-fi authors, including Rudy Rucker, have read What is life? and it has influenced their thinking a great deal. In any case, I truly believe reading science and philosophy can significantly bolster your experience when reading anything else, especially sci-fi. So why not go for it?"
295,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65278991-aadeshnpn,4,Not easy to read but totally worth it. Found new perspective about what is life.
296,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"What I expected:Source, CC-BY-NC 2.5What I got:""What is Life?"" is a surprisingly humble take on the problems biology had in the 1940s. Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology)."
297,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,5,"Schrödinger was a very well respected physicist, who gave us a new language to describe the behaviour of the quantum realm. It is thus with skepticism that one might approach a book (essay?) like this, applying quantum theory to biology. But throughout the book what comes through heavily is Schrödinger’s humility – which is a rare character for physicists when discussing biology. Nevertheless, his application of physics-based reasoning manages to justify some facts of biology and populate new ones. As an example, he starts with the somewhat odd question “why is the human body so much bigger than an atom” to expound core points such as whether physics can hope to quantify the behaviour of living systems.Perhaps the most surprising thing is that he actually does provide an answer to the book’s eponymous question: what is life? It is something that consumes negative entropy (i.e order) to stave off it’s own inevitable decay into disorder. In his words, all living things have: an astonishing gift of concentrating a 'stream of order' on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos by 'drinking orderliness' from a suitable environmentThat is basically saying that we consume food (highly ordered arrangements of molecules) and output it as heat (disorder), in the mean time maintaining our relatively ordered state. This is a wonderfully original perspective, but one that anyone can see to be sensible and according with the facts. On a side note, after reading this I had to read Asimov’s The Last Question again… The second law of thermodynamics is haunting."
298,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10663319-michael-kenning,4,"One thing that I did not realise about this book is that it actually contains three different books: What is Life?, Mind and Matter, and Autobiographical sketches. The first book, What is Life?, gives the reader a very basic understanding of genetics. It is precisely the hereditary substance and the nature of mutation in the genetic substance that encouraged the discovery of the double helix in DNA. It is a most essential read; and despite the fact that it was written by a physicist, it portrays Schrödinger's keen interest and understanding of biological functions—and the incorporation of his own physical knowledge.The second book goes through the consideration of mind and its role in evolution—how the mind may contribute to our (what I consider) continual progression as a species. Although, it is suggested that, like crocodiles and many insects, we have reached, not the peak of evolution (which would imply that we are the best kind of thing—not true), but a sort of plateau which means that we no longer require adjustment; mutations still occur, however. It considers the effects of mind on our various sensual apparatus, and how the memes which are passed down from generation to generation will reflect our capability to survive—what he called a 'feigned Lamarckism'. The considerations are truly inspiring.The autobiographical sketches, although somewhat insightful, contain nothing of interest. It shall only reveal to the reader the process by which Erwin Schrödinger became a scientist, which isn't very interesting; as Schrödinger said himself: 'I am not good at telling stories'."
299,0521427088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31677006-kaio,4,"These are personal notes that did not fit into the appropriate section.Interesting initial chapters on why most laws are only statistical in nature and describe things in good approximation only because of the sheer number of single ""things"" that behave according to exact laws. That extrapolation to human senses also intesting.I did not get everything on the genetics chapters, as I have not studied it in a long time, and did not bother to look it up.Very interesting idea about how life has to ""feed"" on ""negative entropy"" as he calls it, because life is constantly producing entropy (disorder) in the processes to keep it alive (metabolism) and this excess entropy has to be shed or transferred into matter or enegy (it is not that well explained) that is in a state of lower entropy. There is a necessary correlation between the ingested energy and ingested negative entropy that is not explained in the book. I need to look deeper into this.The chapters on deducing the nature of the genetic material I mostly glanced over though he seems to have made pivotal statements which somewhat led to the discovery of the DNA structure. The epilogue on consciousness, the actual reason I read this book, is much less precise logically. I came onto this book because it was stated somewhere else something along the lines of: ""One of the fathers of quantum physics tries to reduce the last bastions of human ignorance to physics, suggests it to be possible for the mechanisms of life, but claims it impossible in the case of consciousnees"".Did not add much to my understanding of the Philosophy of Mind.All in all an interesting read."
