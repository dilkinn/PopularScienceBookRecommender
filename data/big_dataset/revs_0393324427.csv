A good read for someone interested in understanding the logic of organization inherent in network structures and how network properties shape those embedded in them.

Buchanan readily admits that this new science is not reductionist based, but attempts to look at the larger web to truly understand the nature of some networks. What is interesting to me is that physicists through this theory can help explain the nature of money, microbiology, social stratification, or virtually any other discipline. Occasionally, Buchanan condescendingly views long held theories as childish or unimaginative, much to his discredit.

In some of those chapters there were some good topics or subjects particularly when talking about the concepts of the rich getting richer, but in general discussion never really solidified an overall understanding of small worlds and theories of networks that really made you understand why that concept is so important.

A good read for someone interested in understanding the logic of organization inherent in network structures and how network properties shape those embedded in them.

Buchanan readily admits that this new science is not reductionist based, but attempts to look at the larger web to truly understand the nature of some networks. What is interesting to me is that physicists through this theory can help explain the nature of money, microbiology, social stratification, or virtually any other discipline. Occasionally, Buchanan condescendingly views long held theories as childish or unimaginative, much to his discredit.

It's written by a journalist, so like the Shilts book, it reads quick, fun, and interesting. The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is based on small world network theory. This may seem totally uninteresting to many, but will be a basis of my dissertation work looking at word-of-mouth and how health information is spread through small world networks. I suggest reading this book to everyone. It's really really fun!"

Have you ever looked at river beds on Google Earth and marveled at how much they look like fractal patterns? Hidden patterns that connect you, yes you to the Pope. There are connections to to everything conceivable. The emerging field of ""small worlds"" theory gives us a glimpse of how hidden patterns interact and exchange information, and how everything here and in the cosmos can be broken down into a single as yet unidentified unifying mathematical equation.

Albeit, a little complex in between, the author certainly does drive home the point with a lot of interesting examples. However, the examples based on the ""laboratory"" experiments do seem a little waste due to the strict control of conditions and removal of many factors which would in real world situations have far-reaching effects on the outcomes. His reference to Malcolm Gladwell's Tipping Point was also a refresher and made it clear that the author had done his homework well. A good read, but a better applied philosophy."
286,0393324427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2301615-actionscientist,5,It really is a small world. I didn't read the whole book. What got my attention was the idea that the whole 6-degrees system works because of just 4 random social links per tightly-linked groups of 50 (I imagine a roving band of stone age humans traipsing across Earth in search of a better place to hang out and breathe) .. and then something clicked in my mind .. what if most links could be de-randomised. What if ...

And of course, to be filed away for those cocktail conversations about why the study of basic science, math, should be funded."
288,0393324427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930974-nancy,3,"""Nexus"" covers much the same network-science ground as Barabasi's ""Linked"" -- Milgram's ""six degrees"" experiments, the spread of HIV, Granovetter's weak ties -- that reading both is somewhat redundant. That said, Buchanan digs deeper into cumulative advantage (i.e, the rich get richer), an understanding that, IMHO, explains a whole lot."
289,0393324427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/846613-heather,2,"This is a great study of WHY the six degrees of separation theory is not just a theory, but a plausible explanation of how our world works. It's fascinating, but the math bits, get a bit dry and complicated. Again, best as a skimmer... but still worth going through a bit nonetheless if you liked Undercover Economist. But not nearly as entertaining as Tipping Point style. "
290,0393324427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5938533-byron-wright,3,"Overall interesting. Good readability for a science book. I find the style and content similar to Malcolm Gladwell (The Tipping Point and Blink).It's all about why there are only 6 degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon and how that applies to societal wealth, river flows, Internet infrastructure, and disease pandemics."
291,0393324427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1197439-chris,2,The basic idea on this book is understanding how important network is own our society. Yhe writer shares the theory of six degree of separation. How everyone is separated to each other just knowing 6 people or less.
292,0393324427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8286437-theresa,4,Great explanation of complex mathematical phenomenon relating to networks that help explain many things from communities to river systems. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes science for the non-scientist-educated-person.
293,0393324427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602550-ron,4,Buchanan basically reviews the literature to show how physics is beginning to explain how diseases spread and how the economy always makes the rich get richer. Fascinating.

299,0393324427,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17727526-steve-wells,3,"The book started off well, particularly when it was talking about the strength of weak ties or small worlds but as the chapters went on it kind of lost its focus on small worlds and the groundbreaking theory of networks and just seem to talk in the end a lot about different things that were somewhat tangentially related to what was being discussed in the overall framework of the book. In some of those chapters there were some good topics or subjects particularly when talking about the concepts of the rich getting richer, but in general discussion never really solidified an overall understanding of small worlds and theories of networks that really made you understand why that concept is so important. It's like the author had a lot of ideas about a lot of different things and thought they were all in some way connected and made the slightest attempts to relate them, but in the end it didn't show in a way that the connections made absolute sense."
