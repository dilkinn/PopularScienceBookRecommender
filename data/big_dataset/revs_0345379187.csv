0,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,4,"Carl Sagan writes about many topics in this book, but manages to make them all readable and understandable. My favorites are his essays on exponential growth and decay, the universe, and abortion. He really clearly lays out his thoughts and makes hard to understand concepts reachable in science and mathematics. He makes what is probably the most logical argument I have ever read in the abortion debates about our need to decide what makes us human and determine at what point that happens. His short explanation of the history of abortion was enlightening (no, it never used to be a religious issue until recently). His arguments about the need to address global warming and the need to decrease nuclear arms are as timely now as they were 15 years ago. I am sad that our world has lost such a knowledgeable and persuasive man, but I am glad to know he has inspired so many others to follow in his footsteps. The world needs more intellectuals that don't blindly side with party lines, but look at facts and evidence. We need more people to stand up and honestly educate people about what is happening in our world."
1,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9805116-katie,5,"I liken Carl Sagan's explanation of physics, mathematics and astronomy in Billions and Billions and all his books to what Steven Pinker did for the field of linguistics in The Language Instinct: he takes extraordinarily complex phenomena and breaks them down so the intelligent reader fascinated by such quandaries, but who just didn't have the passion to study them academically, can understand and muse upon. I used Pinker's work when teaching linguistics in graduate school, and I could see physics and astronomy faculty using Sagan for the same reason: to bring an inspiring and brilliant introduction to life's largest questions to curious minds. Billions and Billions is for the intelligent person fascinated by space -- on this planet, in this solar system, in this galaxy and beyond. Sagan's explanations, comparisons, analogies, and opinions (personal opinion is something that I've noted is left out in his other works) brought me to tears on more than one occasion. Life is incredibly precious, and we're so insignificant in the scheme of things, and it baffles me that many disregard, or at least have no natural curiosity for, this precious, almost improbable gift of life. Sagan forces me to contemplate human problems of politics, overpopulation, starvation, disease, climate change and pollution on not merely a global, but also universal level by using numbers and logic, elements often attributed to objectivity -- impassivity, even -- that actually are keys that unlock emotion and make us able to truly understand the human plight. Billions and Billions is a beautiful, delightful, aching and depressing, but magnificent and inspiring read. It is my hope that many people pick up Carl Sagan's works -- this is his last work, created in 1996 (he died of cancer in 1997), and I, along with many critics, believe this might be why he brings such a meaningful and personal perspective into his finale. I also hope that if you do have a natural curiosity for physics, quantum physics and mechanics, that you also look into Gary Zukav's Dancing Wu Li Masters and Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics. Physics is not some stale, nerdy numbers game -- it's a an intricate, meaningful, emotional, colorful dance!"
2,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,4,"I am a great fan of Carl Sagan and it is with some sadness that I can recommend this, his last book, only partially. It is a collection of nineteen essays, organized into three mostly unrelated parts. Some items are well worth reading—particularly the last—but some not at all.Part 1, ""The Power and Beauty of Quantification,"" is merely a simple echo of his famous book Cosmos: A Personal Voyage (1980). The first chapter on large numbers, from which the ""Billions and Billions"" of this book's title is taken, is just too basic. Experienced popular science readers should skip this part entirely. Those interested in cosmology, the vastness of space, and the possibility of multiple universes should look instead to Sagan's own classic Cosmos or for the up-to-the minute (and deep) account, see Max Tegmark's Our Mathematical Universe (2014).Part 2, ""What Are Conservatives Conserving,"" is a series of dated essays covering the relatively new (at the time Sagan was engaged with them in the 1980s and early 1990s) environmental concerns of ozone depletion and global warming. Their outdatedness stems not from any later final solutions, but rather because research has progressed substantially in the last few decades. Another problem is that he links these essays politically to the Carter and Reagan eras, which realistically are too distant for most younger readers. Instead, for an insider's view on global warming politics read Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It (2006). For the science, which despite its over-the-top title is definitive, refer to James Hansen's work from 2009 Storms of My Grandchildren: The Truth About The Climate Catastrophe And Our Last Chance To Save Humanity. (Hansen is the NASA climate researcher credited for ""discovering"" global warming.)Happily, in Part 3, ""Where Hearts and Minds Collide,"" Sagan includes more timeless essays covering the politics of abortion, basic morality, a powerful address at the Gettysburg peace memorial rededication, and a useful look back at the accomplishments of the twentieth century. These display Sagan at his best, and are reminiscent of the sustained intellectual wonder that is his best book The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark (1995).Sagan closes with one of the most affecting short essays I have ever read, ""In the Valley of the Shadow,"" where he recounts his battles over the disease that killed him after he finished Billions and Billions but before it was published. He displays ferocious optimism in his own future, and also for humanity. If nothing else, read this eight-page essay at your local bookstore or online. It will move you as it has countless readers and reviewers.With great respect, and with an irresistible fantasy, and indeed hope, that he is now in some way out there among the stars, merged with his beloved cosmos, I leave the last word to Carl:I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But as much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking....The world is so exquisite, with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there is little good evidence. Far better, it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look Death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides."
3,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7006637-santhosh,4,"The core premise of Sagan's final book is, to paraphrase an old Native American saying, ""We have not inherited the Earth from our ancestors, but have borrowed it from our children."" So stop the F screwing it up.Presented as 3 parts of 19 essays in total, some of the essays, especially in the first part, are similar to the material he covered in Cosmos: cosmology and the vastness of space, our history as a species, general physics, life outside Earth. Some of the other essays are about then emerging discoveries of our effect on nature such as global warming, the ozone depletion, deforestation, and fossil fuels. Sagan does what he does best in these pieces: explain in the common tongue how the entire setup is set up, what are the various set pieces in it and their roles, and how what we're doing is causing whatever it is that's happening. Though these essays were written in the 80's and 90's and so might come across as a bit dated, they do cause some serious introspection and a poignant reminder on how much we have actually NOT progressed in dealing with and controlling them.There is an absolutely brilliant essay on the abortion debate between pro-choice and pro-life, which I think covers almost all points on either side while also clinically arriving at a practical and workable answer. A few of the essays do end up being dated, where he exhorts the need to end the cold war between the Soviet and USA, and urges everyone to stop the madness that was the nuclear race. The final essay, ""In the Valley of the Shadow,"" where he recounts his battles over the disease that eventually killed him, is so simple and beautifully written that it is both positive and haunting.Throughout the book, though, as always with Sagan, what does come across is his child-like love and wonder for science and nature, and his enthusiasm in talking about what he loves.In the last words of Sagan himself, I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But as much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking. I want to grow really old with my wife, Annie, whom I dearly love. I want to see my younger children grow up and to play a role in their character and intellectual development. I want to meet still unconceived grandchildren. There are scientific problems whose outcomes I long to witness—such as the exploration of many of the worlds in our Solar System and the search for life elsewhere. I want to learn how major trends in human history, both hopeful and worrisome, work themselves out: the dangers and promise of our technology, say; the emancipation of women; the growing political, economic, and technological ascendancy of China; interstellar flight. If there were life after death, I might, no matter when I die, satisfy most of these deep curiosities and longings. But if death is nothing more than an endless dreamless sleep, this is a forlorn hope. Maybe this perspective has given me a little extra motivation to stay alive. The world is so exquisite, with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far better, it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look Death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides."

We are rare and precious because we are alive, because we can think as well as we can. We are privileged to influence and perhaps control our future. I believe we have an obligation to fight for life on Earth—not just for ourselves, but for all those, humans and others, who came before us, and to whom we are beholden, and for all those who, if we are wise enough, will come after. There is no cause more urgent, no dedication more fitting than to protect the future of our species. Nearly all our problems are made by humans and can be solved by humans. No social convention, no political system, no economic hypothesis, no religious dogma is more important."
6,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Sagan is eloquent as always. It helps even more to read it out loud to yourself, (muttering lest someone observe) and make up a Sagan accent as you go. He takes a gentle hand, which I think bespeaks desperation in his last years, his last chance to nudge the ball forward amidst tangible fear that forceful will be deemed strident, erudite will sound preachy, and warning the bitter rantings of an old Cassandra. Carl knows he's on the losing team, he loves humanity, and deeply fears our suicide by institutional stupidity, the tragedy of the commons, and Tainter's unwindable commitment to technological complexity beyond the point of diminishing returns.Stale stuff, understood by all in my echo chamber, thus barely worth repeating, maybe. But still, he is gone now, the gentle Lorax of our times, replaced by a stronger, similarly poetic champion (Neil) who has taken up the lance, but the windmill doesn't look worried. I am. I am in arguments I can't win. I lose faith. Like Carl, I fear I cannot push on the rudder enough to effect any change in course. Do you know the thing about Cassandra? ...about all her whining doom-laden prognoses?She was right. That's the punch line. Sagan used that and the similar story of Croesus (rich as...) who asked the Oracle at Delphi what would happen if he invaded Persia. He got back the answer: ""you will destroy a great empire."" He did, but it was his own empire that got destroyed. As leaders with an agenda are wont to do, he listened carefully with an ear tuned to hear what he wanted, and he heard it. That's you, Mr. Cruz, unless you subscribe to the yet more devlish code of knowing the truth and nevertheless perverting it to your will. For your sake I hope you're just stupid, not flatly evil.I'm afraid I don't think you're stupid."
7,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751053-bakari,5,"This is I think Carl Sagan's last published book, published in 1996. His chapter/essay, entitled ""The Twentieth Century,"" is one of the most insightful summaries of what the universe is that I ever read. Well, maybe not the most insightful, but surely in the top three:""Perhaps the most wrenching by-product of the scientific revolution has been to render untenable many of our most cherished and most comforting beliefs. The tidy anthropocentric proscenium of our ancestors has been replaced by a cold, immense, indifferent Universe in which humans are relegated to obscurity. But I see the mergence in our consciousness of a Universe of a magnificence, and an intricate, elegant order far beyond anything our ancestors imagined. And if much about the Universe can be understood in terms of a few simple laws of Nature, those wishing to believe in God can certainly ascribe those beautiful laws to a Reason underpinning all of Nature. My own view is that it is far better to understand the Universe as it really is than to pretend to a Universe as we might wish it be.""Just think if this were the type of book students actually studied in school and their parents studied in churches? Nuf said. #end"

Eventually, of course, Death will claim me - as he does each of us. It's only a question of when. And how.I've learned much from our confrontations - especially about the beauty and sweet poignancy of life, about the preciousness of friends and family, and about the transforming power of love. In fact, almost dying is such a positive, character-building experience that I'd recommend it to everybody - except, of course, for the irreducible and essential element of risk.The world is so exquisite , with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence.

9,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie,5,"First it was Ann Druyan’s bittersweet epilogue, and then the very next page Carl’s unfinished acknowledgements began with his words to Annie: “I want to be like you when I grow up.” Every copy of this book, not just mine, must have those pages wrinkled up with water.The rest: everything you would expect from Carl Sagan. Fabulous, even when what should be badly dated by now still sadly applies.Highly recommended to any and all."
10,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27331649-nathan,4,"What a great book. It was well written and really touched on a variety of different topics. Though it is dated now, I still feel that I gained a lot by reading it. And the last two chapters where he talked about his disease and views on death really struck deep with me. "
11,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102977481-wyatt,5,"Wow. That was nothing short of beautiful. Sagan begins with a little introduction about the long misinterpreted understanding of who really said “Billions and Billions” and now he chooses what was a misconception or humorous parody of him to be the title of his last book. This is a way of him ending his legacy on a note of “thank you for remembering me”. Sagan then talks numbers for a little while to really show how small the big things are or how easily and quickly we can reach them. Once we are grounded to the pale blue dot, he begins talking about his journey through life and his humble guide: science. We are given various interesting scientific facts but the majority of his writing is spent discussing his philosophies and political views in regards to popular topics such as: climate change, abortion, religion, ethics and war. I really enjoyed learning about Sagan and his point of view and whilst doing so felt a connection with him. This is the reason that the ending hit me so hard. I would be lying if I said I didn’t shed a few tears in the last couple chapters of this book. All is revealed when he tells you that he is writing from his hospital bed and is essentially not ready but accepting of his fate. He takes death like a true scientific thinker, never wielding to spiritual safety but rather accepting life for what it is. The book ends with a letter from his wife as she recalls the first time she met Carl, the legacy they built together and being by his bedside when he left. I’m still in the process of accepting that he’s really gone, he would’ve been an amazing person to meet but we can keep him alive by reading his books and staying skeptical about the world we live in and never surrendering to an easy answer but rather seeking what is real and what is true. If you choose to read this book (which I hope you do) I want to warn you that the structure might deceive you at first because you might be wondering where he is going with his seemingly random topics and this might push you away in the beginning but if you think of this book not as a science book or book trying to say something in particular but rather a journal of someone who is about to die, it will all read a lot more smoothly. If you’re a science enthusiast I highly recommend checking this out!"
12,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015665-kyle,5,"Written at the end of his life and published with an post script illuminating his unsuccessful battle with myelodysplasia, as well as a touching epilogue by his widow Ann Druyan. The book starts out with a kind of fleshing-out of humanity by its numbers, things like human population and resource usage and the age of the species are all implicitly synthesized into a description of people by very large numbers. It then touches on social and environmental issues, how people react to them, and what kind of things we do right and wrong when faced with science versus our comfortable beliefs about the planet. There's an essay in which Sagan and Druyan lay out a compromise position on abortion which is based in science and objective facts that neither polar side of the debate should reject. Talk is made about the possibility of a catastrophe from space, and what it'd mean for life on Earth. He writes about the richness of human experience through art, religion, and especially science. The costs and causes of war are explored. There's the almost obligatory devotion to one of Sagan's favorite subjects, the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The impression one gets throughout the whole book, no matter the subject of the text or the personal opinion of the reader, is the totally infectious nature of Sagan's awe and curiosity about the world in which we live, and even more about the Universe in which the world turns. His talent for phrasing can take something you thought was mundane and spin it into a profound insight, stirring the mind to make old ideas brand new, or crystallize into everyday life something mentioned in passing during highschool physics. With Carl Sagan's pen guiding the reader, fascination is nearly guaranteed. "
13,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/820032-schuyler,3,"Sagan can be a little repetitive but that doesn't mean his words carry no less value. The chapter on abortion is worth your time if you've ever been even mildly divided on the issue, which you should be. Also, I teared up on the bus reading In The Valley of the Shadow, which documents Sagan's fatal battle with myelodysplastic syndrome."
14,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,As I always think when I finish one of his books; few who have ever put pen to paper have ever been more wise or knowledgeable than Carl Sagan

"
16,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11423376-jacob-williams,4,"Being afraid of quantification is tantamount to disenfranchising yourself, giving up on one of the most potent prospects for understanding and changing the world.What this book offers: thoughtful comments on climate change, abortion, and nuclear arms proliferationMy only previous exposure to Sagan was via his fiction, the novel and movie Contact. Now I have some sense of why he was such a beloved science communicator. Billions & Billions begins with a discussion of big numbers, using multiple approaches to help the reader get a sense both of what those numbers really mean and how, via exponential processes, seemingly small-scale activity can result in effects at drastically larger scales. This is an important foundation for the discussions of climate change that follow.Sagan tells the story of the rise and fall of chlorofluorocarbons to illustrate both that human activity can have disastrous consequences for the environment, and that successful coordinated international action to curtail such harmful activity does have real historical precedent. I wasn’t too familiar with that history, so this was fascinating.Unexpectedly, I also learned a lot about the history of abortion. The book includes a thoughtful essay Sagan co-wrote with his wife Ann Druyan, which makes an effort to present both sides’ arguments honestly and give them serious consideration. They argue that “[b]oth pro-choicers and pro-lifers (at least some of them) are pushed toward absolutist positions by parallel fears of the slippery slope,” but that the scientific realities, and the need to take seriously both women’s rights to control their bodies and the rights of young humans, call for a more nuanced view. One surprising claim to me was that the Catholic Church found abortion acceptable until the late 1800s, though some quick googling suggests the history was more complex than that.Sagan also writes movingly about arms races. For those of us who did not live through the Cold War, it’s easy to forget about nuclear weapons; we learn about nuclear war in history books, as a threat that never came to pass. But the warheads are still around and they could still decimate our civilization in the space of minutes.The book includes an inspiring essay that Sagan published in both the US and the Soviet Union called “The Common Enemy.” A trope in fiction is for two warring sides to come together when they realize they are being threatened by an even more menacing force. As Sagan points out, our own tendencies to destroy ourselves - by pursuing short-term gains that are ultimately disastrous for our environment, or by preparing ever-more-destructive weapons that ensure all our conflicts are increasingly catastrophic - should represent just such an enemy. The question is whether we’ll be able to unify against it before it wipes us out.Sagan died before the publication of Billions & Billions; it concludes with reflections by himself and by Ann on his two-year struggle with illness. These are poignant, and leave one with the sense that they had a truly special relationship."
17,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74305622-rithu-chillal,5,"I first became enthralled by Sagan at age fourteen when I discovered my dad's copy of Cosmos. Eighteen years later, I finally decided to read this one. I can't remember the last time, if ever, I've teared up at the end of a non-fiction book. The more I read of Sagan and his work, the more I'm humbled and impressed by not only his scope of technical knowledge of the Universe (I appreciate his use of capitalization) but his complete reverence for it. In this book, this reverence flows down to the Universe's constituents; he shows such empathy and awareness for women (recognizing the tremendous benefits the world would have if they were equally represented in social and political spheres), the poor and oppressed (who suffer the most when our technological endeavors, however noble and beneficial, go awry), and practically pleads everyone in power (and those who put them there) to consider the long-term picture. Sagan was truly ahead of his time and I wonder what he would make about the state of affairs today, both positive and negative. He would be sorely disappointed by the rampant attack on science and facts, but he would be thrilled at the number of women in the House and Senate compared to the 1990s. He would be horrified over the degradation of our oceans and subsequently our entire ecosystem, but would be excited beyond measure at nanotechnology.In this book Sagan does go into detail about all the implications of climate change - explaining how if the tiniest microorganisms are wiped out, the step-by-step effects would be disastrous. First it's the plankton, then the fish who feed on the plankton, the animals who feed on the fish, and so forth. This section of the book is incredibly informative and encompassing. Yet Sagan (like many of us) is baffled by how unmoved policymakers are by clear facts.His vision, wonder and curiosity about the Universe parallel my own so strongly. In this day and age, diving into his books is comforting - both escapist and inspiring. His wife Ann's emotional epilogue describes the last stages of Carl's life and how they both came to terms with it lovingly and peacefully. I would encourage anyone interested in astronomy/science/technology combined with philosophy/ethics to read this book. Or anyone who has an insatiable sense of wonder about the Universe, or simply needs to feel inspired and hopeful about the world. It's difficult to not feel defeatist with the way our world is heading (and Sagan points this out). The world lost a luminary when Carl Sagan died, but his legacy lives on."
18,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10785790-perry,4,"Thought provoking. And honestly? More than a little disheartening. A big chunk of this book deals with the CFC disaster of the 80's-90's and the parallels to be drawn between that and current climate change...going from the analysis of the threat, to the denial by big business, to the penalties coming to fruition, before FINALLY, some change being made. It was....honestly a little depressing. And I'm not sure that's a situation that'll get better anytime soon. Recommended for food for thought. "

The research and subsequent efforts by different companies, countries and communities have been captured well.The end is heart wrenching when it reads that Carl was writing the last chapter from his hospital bed in Hutch, Seattle. The book is definitely not even close to Cosmos or The Dragons of Eden in a strict literary sense.It contains broken linkages to chapters and sometime overstated facts but on the brighter side,we get to see Carls's inner family life and his brave battle with Myelodysplasia. His literary powers may seem to be on a decline, but his passion and conviction to spread awareness for a cause in undiminished and far from satiation.I would still recommend this book for it contains final thoughts, efforts and emotions of Carl Sagan, a great thinker, explorer and astronomer. He definitely lives on!"

I love the way he reasoned his arguments with simple explanation and eye-opening examples. His enthusiasm makes readers interest and follow what he tried to show with logics and facts. Carl Sagan is lost forever, but his legacies survive within many scientists and other professionals who were inspired by him. Thank you, Carl Sagan."

None of the thoughts and musings he share may sound new to someone reading it two decades later. He wrote this in a distant age when the internet and mobile phone technology were in their infancy, which later grew into proportions that even Sagan who thought in the scales of 'billions and billions' could hardly fathom then. Yet what he had to say is still as relevant."

I am sad that he did not live to see the success of the human race but simultaneously glad he did not see our failures. We should have headed his warnings. The one thing Carl Sagan did not see coming was the power and expansion of the internet. Carl Sagan was an amazing example of a simple human that had heroic qualities. "

But this is exactly what it makes it stand out.Oh, yes. And another thing that makes it stand out: it has been written by a highly competent man of science. More than twenty years ago.

Sagan covered a lot, in his very accessible way, and a reader might get an impression that he ran out of time, which of course, he did. I’ll not summarize here but I will share a few notes I made and observations I flagged... I do want to point out that even good thinkers like Sagan make mistakes; he attributed something to Hitler that Hitler never said. That it was passed around the ether before this book is still no excuse. Because of that, I had to check the Rudolf Hess quote that preceded it, which was more or less the English translation for what Hess did say in 1934. On language and communication Ethnocentrism - the idea that our little group, no matter which one it is, is better than any other - and xenophobia - a “shoot first, ask questions later” fear of strangers -are deeply built into us. They are by no means peculiarly human; all our monkey and ape cousins behave similarly, as do many other mammals. These attitudes are at east aided and abetted by the short distance over which speech is possible.Some humans, and human mimics, have a hard time with that simple fact that we are genetically still rather primitive. Aggression and fear of others is sadly normal.On the environmentThe worse the catastrophe is, the harder it is to keep our balance. We want so badly to either ignore it utterly or to devote all our resources to circumventing it.Hard truth boiled down to a simple dichotomy. And on the predictions of climate change, for the ignorant “ideologically driven radio talk-show hosts [and wrongwing politicians and media] who insist that the greenhouse effect is a ‘hoax.’”To roughly quote Richard Dawkins, it’s science b*itches! He notes “Considering hw contentious the scientific community is, it is notable that not a single paper is offered claiming that depletion of the ozone layer or global warming are snares and delusions or that global warming is considerably less than the estimated 1 to 4 C for a doubling in the carbon dioxide abundance.” Well, no legitimate scientific peer-reviewed paper - there is a host of cottage industry trolls masquerading as scientists that have cropped up since Sagan’s death spewing gibberish that is eaten up by the wrongwing. I’d forgotten that the first truly horrendous president of my adulthood, Reagan, had the solar-thermal converter take off the White House roof. Sagan observes “It was somehow ideologically offensive.” Idiot (not Sagan, of course.) And now the administration of 2017 is bent on rolling back all environmental progress of the last 100 years. Ideological offense has something to do with it, as does lining the pockets of the billionaire cronies. An uncomfortable truth, Sagan, after noting the annexations and occupations of the Soviet Union, turned to the United StatesExcluding World Wars and expeditions to suppress piracy or the slave trade, the United States has made [as of 1996] armed invasions and interventions in other countries on more than 130 separate occasions, including China (on 18 separate occasions), Mexico (13), Nicaragua and Panama (9 each), Honduras (7), Columbia and Turkey (6 each), the Dominican Republic, Korea, and Japan (5 each), Argentina, Cuba, Haiti, the Kingdom of Hawaii, and Samoa (4 each), Uruguay and Fiji (3 each), Guatemala, Lebanon, the Soviet Union, and Sumatra (2 each), Grenada, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Chile, Morocco, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Syria, Iraq, Peru, Formosa, the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.Add Iraq again, Afghanistan, Syria again, Somalia, and I don't know how many more. Those data came from records of the House Armed Services Committee. We're not clean and never have been.He talks about abortion and opens ""The issue had been decided years ago. The court had chosen the middle ground, You'd think the fight was over."" ... well, actually... far from. He'd likely not be surprised, and still somehow remain optimistic. Ann wrote a heart-tugging epilogue that if you aren't moved after reading, well, you're not human. I should have read this long ago - I had an unread copy that was lost to a fire. Life's too short to keep making that mistake. I do believe I'll revisit Demon Haunted World this year...we'll see."
26,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101213681-jon-i,4,"Another great book from the late, great Carl Sagan. Though I think The Demon Haunted World is an overall better book, Billions & Billions is no slouch. Focusing on a variety of topics such as environmental protection, climate change, abortion, the moral implications of science, and 20th-century progress, Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan's essays are as vital as ever. Some of the information is outdated -- as to be expected from a book largely written in 1996 -- but the lessons he imparts and the questions he raises transcend time to be damningly relevant in 2020. They are largely well-written and are well argued; even if you don't agree with his conclusions, he makes a compelling case for whatever he is writing about. However, Sagan seemed to repeat himself a lot more here than in The Demon Haunted World, thus can be a little monotonous to read some of the middle chapters. What few quibbles I have with the book are almost overshadowed by the final few chapters. They were just incredible. Written towards the end of his struggle with myelodysplasia, Sagan writes with such empathy and emotion that it's hard not to get teary-eyed at points. He truly practiced what he preached until the very end. Billions & Billions is a touchingly personal and worthy capstone to the storied career of a globally influential advocate for science and reason, as well as a personal hero."
27,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40861614-todd,4,"Good book. First and third segments are more interesting than the middle. In the first segment Sagan quantifies some figures and reminds us how small and almost inconceivable our world is. Out of the countless stars and rocks in the Universe we exist on the perfect rock situated perfectly from our star. Of course, life could exist under different circumstances in other parts of the Universe. He also reminds us that scientific understanding is available to all.The second segment is about the environment and how we have scarred it pretty badly since the Industrial Revolution. Science/tech make life easier, but could destroy life if not used properly. He does miss one simple solution to many environment problems. Less. Want less and use less. Reconsider before purchasing and purchase quality over quantity.Segment three is the most interesting. He is cautiously optimistic for humanities future. Largely based on science/tech to allow more effective communication, education, and cooperation. Though I believe individuals could do more to create a better future than the international organizations he proposes. Individuals are more free and nimble and can effect change (though slower) through individual choice.I look forward to reading his other books."

Because of that some of the science presented in the book has been surpassed in the last 20 years. But most of his conclusions, and fears, have continued along much the same paths as he discussed in the book, global warming, pollution and uncontrolled population growth. As with most books of this type I was totally engrossed by the hard science topics and less so by most of the 'soft science' discussion.

36,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66171578-matt-hertel,4,"Sagan's final book reflects on the things that many of us consider when we know our lives are near their end. The text is both a heartwarming reminder of the eloquent prose that Sagan is capable of, as well as his capacity for addressing some of the most profound questions that humanity must ask itself as we continue to move into the future. Billions and Billions ended up taking a longer period of time for me to read, due to a number of life events getting in the way, but I was able to pick it up after a break and easily climb back into the narrative. I was very happy with the book overall and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sagan or wishes to explore his viewpoints on the topics covered in the book.The book covers a number of topics, and approaches fundamental questions about mortality, morality, and the human experience. Sagan reflects on the awesome scale and possibilities of the universe around us in the first part of the book, probes the reasoning and justification behind a number of social questions in the second part of the book, and digs into some very sensitive subjects and provides profound advice for living a good life in the final part of the book. The text covers an amazing amount of ground, from investigating the justification and practice of abortion, to the question of whether intelligent life exists outside our own planet. Sagan is perhaps the only author that can handle such a variety and differing scale of questions without missing a beat. Sagan's classic conversational style is present, and is refined at this point in his career. The book is an excellent demonstration of work that is approachable without sacrificing academic depth. His dictation is as calm and reasoned as it always has been; I like to imagine him reading the text in an armchair in front of a flickering fireplace, calmly explaining the universe to those of us who are prepared to listen.Sagan's personal story is entwined into the narrative, which both grounds the text in real experience and provides an emotional thread that left me with a lump in my throat and a sense of respect for his enduring perspective and the strength of his family as his life came to an end, near the end of the text. The final chapter is written by his wife, as she reflects on his impact and life of work spent answering questions that have proved to be difficult to approach, even today. It speaks to the gravity of the topics discussed, that we still struggle with many of these in our modern society. Perhaps if we still had Sagan with us, he would be able to help us to further deconstruct these complex questions, but I suspect that him being forced to consider his mortality somehow allowed him to see some of these topics more clearly.The discussion is notably apolitical, something which is both refreshing and discouraging considering how our current politically charged social climate has only gotten more extreme with time. Sagan was interested in finding the truth of the matter, even with questions that many would gladly accept some more comforting narrative as opposed to a more sober, realistic understanding.Considering that Sagan's legacy can be measured by the effect on our modern culture, it is clear that he lives on through his thoughtful words and positions. His cutting observations will shape our dialog for years to come, as a man of his intellect and social statue deserves. We miss you Carl, thank you for all you have done for us."

While some chapters are outdated such as the ones on the ozone layer or on climate change, Carl Sagan's clear writing represents an important voice when fighting mysticism and deep-rooted beliefs with science.

It’s always good to have the perspective of someone who can actually experience the topic being discussed.By and large, these are the musings of one of the most rational, forward-thinking, introspective, and compassionate minds of our generation.

“The hard-liners on each side encourage one another. They owe their credibility and their power to one another. They need one another. They are locked in a deadly embrace.”
Dr. Carl Sagan wrote this in a piece dual-published by prominent magazines in the United States and the then Soviet Union. But it could just as easily describe the current toxicity of American politics, any given regional feud, or even big-box stores competing for sales on a day purportedly dedicated to thanksgiving. The above quote is just one of dozens I underlined, starred, or wrote notes next to in my now beloved copy of Billions and Billions.As with similar books I’ve read by Dr. Sagan, or other scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson, this is more a collection than a single work. It is at once marvelous and troubling to see how relevant this book remains, published in 1997 in the wake of Carl’s death, and including material written during the final stages of the Cold War. Trends come and go. Wisdom proves itself with a longer shelf life. For devotees of Sagan, this book is a must read. It includes highly personal reflections about the illness that was beginning to take his life. Especially in Part III, “Where Hearts and Minds Collide”, it contains some of his most impassioned and courageous statements. I admire the way he takes everyone to task, including scientists. Within the scientific discourse, transcending the facts and figures, can be found Sagan’s deep love for our species, and his abiding hope that we can grow up, can survive, and can improve. A great deal of the material is highly inspirational, but mingled with some healthy scolding of our favored institutions and ourselves. I maintain that the best place to begin an exploration of Carl Sagan’s work is through his TV series Cosmos. However, Billions and Billions is not to be missed. It contains many treasures for the thoughtful reader."

I've gotten more than my money's worth for this one. It's a great book & demonstrates how thoughtful Sagan was. I remember Bill Nye growing up but definitely wished I had been exposed to Carl Sagan as well. It's his memoirs written a little before his death. His thoughts on important issues such as Global Warming (Climate Change), our history as a species, our growth as a species & where we should be headed are thought provoking. It also is a little sad to see how little progress we've made on certain issues, specifically Global Warming (Climate Change), especially with how simply he demonstrates what the problem behind it is. We as a species can not afford to be stubborn. I'm glad I got this book & will likely dig into some of his other work as well. Because I've watched the ""Cosmos"" series, it wasn't hard to imagine the written words in his voice. Awesome book!

Some quotes:On the shrimp in a little glass ecosphere:""All I have to do is make sure that they're not in too much light or too long in the dark and that they're always at temperatures between 40 degrees and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. (Above that, I guess, they make a bisque and not an ecosystem.)""On the need for abortion to spare amother's life:""Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, opposed even this exception: 'If they become tired or even die through bearing children, that does not matter. Let them die through fruitfulness--that is why they are there.'""""Neither St. Augustine or St. Thomas Aquinas considered early-term abortion to be homicide (the latter on the grounds that the embryo doesn't look human). This view was embraced by the Church in the Council of Vienne in 1312, and has never been repudiated. The Catholic Church's first and long-standing collection of canon law (according to the leading historian of the Church's teaching on abortion, John Connery, S.J.) help that abortion was homicide only after the fetus was already 'formed'--roughly, the end of the first trimester.""But when sperm cells were examined in the seventeenth century by the first microscopes, they were thought to show a fully formed human being. An old idea of the homunculus was resuscitated [= sperm contains a full-formed human]. In part through this misinterpretation of scientific data, in 1869 abortion at any time for any reason became grounds for excommunication.

42,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47975-robu-sensei,3,"Carl Sagan's last book, finished shortly before his death, is an interesting and, at times, curious work. Dr. Sagan starts out a bit off form: the first third or so of the book is rather lacking in his signature eloquence, and he makes a couple of uncharacteristic errors. In the chapter ""Monday-night Hunters,"" for example, he overextends our knowledge of the evolution of behavior in making sweeping, unsupported conclusions about our (and here, by ""our"", I mean ""society's"", and not my own) love of violent sports. However, after a couple of rough patches warming up, he finds his voice and delivers several delightful essays on politics, religion and science. In my favorite chapter, he describes an inspirational alliance between the latter two in defense of the environment. (And indeed, one surprising modern-day pro-environment group in America is evangelical Christians.) Another exceptionally powerful read is ""The Rules of the Game"", on the Golden Rule and variations thereon: the Silver Rule (""Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you""), governing the nonviolent resistance movements of Gandhi and King, and the Brass or Tit-for-Tat Rule (""Do unto others as they do unto you""), a heartless but highly effective way of dealing with others who do not have your best interests at heart. The closing chapter, about Dr. Sagan's losing battle with cancer, is a poignant reminder of our frailty and morality. R.I.P. Carl Sagan—you've been an inspiration to an untold number of budding scientists and freethinkers."

It left a poignant sense of life&death for me to think and feel."
44,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1607959-melissa,4,"One of Sagan's best nonfiction works (and his last before his death.) The title of the book does not do justice to the topics he explores, but his main theme centers around global synergy and cooperation to solve the ills of modern society: ozone depletion, global warming, population control, economic parity, etc. The two chapters on the ozone and global warming are the BEST scientific yet approachable renditions on the topics and can be read out of context of the rest of the book for great education. He also officers scientific qualification for when abortion should be illegal: the one human characteristic that differentiates us from all other animals is our ability to think (i.e., brain function). He posits that abortion should be illegal once the fetus develops regular brain wave patterns (around 6-7 mos). This was an intersting departure from the mainstream thought. So many other topics abound in this book that really make you think, but sometimes Sagan gets bogged down in his own intellect. He clearly championed so many ideas ahead of his time (cooperation between communist Soviets and capialist Americans, global treaties on CFC bans, etc.) and used his intellect and notoriety to educate the public.

I was wrong. Billions and Billions, although a softer edged, more humanistic book was still a life-changing read. Loaded with wisdom, wonder, and more critique on critical thinking, I found this last effort by Sagan, to be his most heart-warming. The death of Carl Sagan is a huge loss to the human race. His rare combination of scientific rigor, atheism, and spiritual enlightenment had given me a new outlook on God, Humanity, and myself. It is my firm belief that these two books should be required reading for every high school senior. He is a natural teacher and a permanent student. Humility and genius rarely go hand-in-hand.

Besides Sagan's distinctive blend of stark optimism and stern alarm, and his splendid rationality, one is struck by a kind of anger in his tone, as though he has grown impatient with the stupidities of humankind. Thus one reads in the essay on abortion these bitter words: ""There is no right to life in any society on Earth today... We raise farm animals for slaughter; destroy forests; pollute rivers and lakes until no fish can live there; kill deer and elk for sport, leopards for their pelts, and whales for fertilizer; entrap dolphins, gasping and writhing, in great tuna nets; club seal pups to death... What is (allegedly) protected is not life, but  life."" (p. 166)What he is against in these essays, as his widow, Ann Druyan, notes in her Epilogue on page 228, are ""the forces of superstition and fundamentalism."" Sagan is preeminently the champion of education and reason as the means to better our life, and the implacable enemy of ignorance. (For ""superstition and fundamentalism,"" read ""ignorance,"" plain and simple.) In some respects this book is a continuation of his volume from the year before, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, but the emphasis here is on the problems confronting us and what can be done about them. In particular, Sagan confronts the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, pollution, the threat of nuclear war, overpopulation, etc. He asks the question (the title of Part II), ""What Are Conservatives Conserving?"" and gives the answer, their short-sighted bottom line. His arguments are ingenious and interesting to read as one observes how hard he is working to persuade us to take care of ourselves and our planet home. He compares the warnings of modern science with those of Cassandra who had the gift of prophesy but the curse of never being believed, science becoming in this sense both Cassandra and the Oracle at Delphi, misunderstood and misinterpreted by our policy makers, whom he likens to Croesus, the rich king who salivated at the prospect of a mighty empire being destroyed only to find that it was his own. As Pogo observed, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" One senses too that Sagan is projecting his concern that he himself is in danger of becoming a Cassandra.Certainly, in reading this book, one senses the personality of Carl Sagan come to life. His wide knowledge as a scientist, and his influence as a public spokesperson for science and for the environment and for all the life on this planet, are manifest. His tendency to preach and guide, his absolute desire to use his celebrity for the common good (and to scold) are evident. He mingles hope with despair; he loves humankind, yet despises what humankind does. He sees our capacity to love and help one another as our saving grace, but cannot help but recall and recount the horrors we have visited upon one another and on our fellow creatures. He sees the planet as one, as Gaia (although he does not use that word) with its organisms cooperating with one another for mutual survival. He writes, ""The inclination to cooperate has been painfully extracted through the evolutionary process. Those organisms that did not cooperate, that did not work with one another, died. Cooperation is encoded in the survivors' genes."" (p. 67) (Incidentally, this is a clear statement for the idea of group selection in evolution. Dawkins, et al., take note.) His writing reveals a man who always tried to do his best, and was perhaps his own sternest critic. He recalls for all of us, ""wincing recollections of past faux pas"" in the chapter on the environment where he tries to persuade us to take a stance ""Somewhere between cheerful dolts and nervous worrywarts..."" (p. 75)I hear the man and identify with his concerns, and I know myself that I cannot make up my mind on whether to be cheerful about our prospects or to despair. I ""solve"" this problem by realizing that all species eventually go extinct, and that somebody or something ""better"" than us might follow, or to understand that we are just a tiny phase in the cosmic process of Becoming.More to the point, I would hope to be just one fraction as worthwhile to my fellow humans as was, and is, and will continue to be, Carl Sagan, a brilliant man of great humanity who is sorely missed. To read him is to experience the best of humanity. He, like science, is a candle in the dark. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is"

66,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66171578-matt-hertel,4,"Sagan's final book reflects on the things that many of us consider when we know our lives are near their end. The text is both a heartwarming reminder of the eloquent prose that Sagan is capable of, as well as his capacity for addressing some of the most profound questions that humanity must ask itself as we continue to move into the future. Billions and Billions ended up taking a longer period of time for me to read, due to a number of life events getting in the way, but I was able to pick it up after a break and easily climb back into the narrative. I was very happy with the book overall and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sagan or wishes to explore his viewpoints on the topics covered in the book.The book covers a number of topics, and approaches fundamental questions about mortality, morality, and the human experience. Sagan reflects on the awesome scale and possibilities of the universe around us in the first part of the book, probes the reasoning and justification behind a number of social questions in the second part of the book, and digs into some very sensitive subjects and provides profound advice for living a good life in the final part of the book. The text covers an amazing amount of ground, from investigating the justification and practice of abortion, to the question of whether intelligent life exists outside our own planet. Sagan is perhaps the only author that can handle such a variety and differing scale of questions without missing a beat. Sagan's classic conversational style is present, and is refined at this point in his career. The book is an excellent demonstration of work that is approachable without sacrificing academic depth. His dictation is as calm and reasoned as it always has been; I like to imagine him reading the text in an armchair in front of a flickering fireplace, calmly explaining the universe to those of us who are prepared to listen.Sagan's personal story is entwined into the narrative, which both grounds the text in real experience and provides an emotional thread that left me with a lump in my throat and a sense of respect for his enduring perspective and the strength of his family as his life came to an end, near the end of the text. The final chapter is written by his wife, as she reflects on his impact and life of work spent answering questions that have proved to be difficult to approach, even today. It speaks to the gravity of the topics discussed, that we still struggle with many of these in our modern society. Perhaps if we still had Sagan with us, he would be able to help us to further deconstruct these complex questions, but I suspect that him being forced to consider his mortality somehow allowed him to see some of these topics more clearly.The discussion is notably apolitical, something which is both refreshing and discouraging considering how our current politically charged social climate has only gotten more extreme with time. Sagan was interested in finding the truth of the matter, even with questions that many would gladly accept some more comforting narrative as opposed to a more sober, realistic understanding.Considering that Sagan's legacy can be measured by the effect on our modern culture, it is clear that he lives on through his thoughtful words and positions. His cutting observations will shape our dialog for years to come, as a man of his intellect and social statue deserves. We miss you Carl, thank you for all you have done for us."

While some chapters are outdated such as the ones on the ozone layer or on climate change, Carl Sagan's clear writing represents an important voice when fighting mysticism and deep-rooted beliefs with science. Being the last book he ever wrote, it carries that much more weight as each word represents the final thoughts of one of the great thinkers of the 20th century. One of those books I wish I had read earlier in life. "

It’s always good to have the perspective of someone who can actually experience the topic being discussed.By and large, these are the musings of one of the most rational, forward-thinking, introspective, and compassionate minds of our generation. He’s written other books, all of which I liked, but this is the one that I loved."

“The hard-liners on each side encourage one another. They owe their credibility and their power to one another. They need one another. They are locked in a deadly embrace.”
Dr. Carl Sagan wrote this in a piece dual-published by prominent magazines in the United States and the then Soviet Union. But it could just as easily describe the current toxicity of American politics, any given regional feud, or even big-box stores competing for sales on a day purportedly dedicated to thanksgiving. The above quote is just one of dozens I underlined, starred, or wrote notes next to in my now beloved copy of Billions and Billions.As with similar books I’ve read by Dr. Sagan, or other scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson, this is more a collection than a single work. It is at once marvelous and troubling to see how relevant this book remains, published in 1997 in the wake of Carl’s death, and including material written during the final stages of the Cold War. Trends come and go. Wisdom proves itself with a longer shelf life. For devotees of Sagan, this book is a must read. It includes highly personal reflections about the illness that was beginning to take his life. Especially in Part III, “Where Hearts and Minds Collide”, it contains some of his most impassioned and courageous statements. I admire the way he takes everyone to task, including scientists. Within the scientific discourse, transcending the facts and figures, can be found Sagan’s deep love for our species, and his abiding hope that we can grow up, can survive, and can improve. A great deal of the material is highly inspirational, but mingled with some healthy scolding of our favored institutions and ourselves. I maintain that the best place to begin an exploration of Carl Sagan’s work is through his TV series Cosmos. However, Billions and Billions is not to be missed. It contains many treasures for the thoughtful reader."
70,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6000443-j-p,5,"I bought this book on a whim because I found a cheap, decent & used copy for a price I couldn't pass up. I've gotten more than my money's worth for this one. It's a great book & demonstrates how thoughtful Sagan was. I remember Bill Nye growing up but definitely wished I had been exposed to Carl Sagan as well. It's his memoirs written a little before his death. His thoughts on important issues such as Global Warming (Climate Change), our history as a species, our growth as a species & where we should be headed are thought provoking. It also is a little sad to see how little progress we've made on certain issues, specifically Global Warming (Climate Change), especially with how simply he demonstrates what the problem behind it is. We as a species can not afford to be stubborn. I'm glad I got this book & will likely dig into some of his other work as well. Because I've watched the ""Cosmos"" series, it wasn't hard to imagine the written words in his voice. Awesome book! Wish we had more careful, thoughtful people such as he.""Nature does not always conform to our predispositions & preferences, to what we deem comfortable & easy to understand."" - Carl Sagan, Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life & Death at the Brink of the Milliennium""The world is so exquisite, with so much love & moral depth, that there is no reason to decieve ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far batter, it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look Death in the eye & to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides."" - Carl Sagan, Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life & Death at the Brink of the Milliennium"
71,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5118691-eva,3,"A collection of essays written by Sagan just before he (spoiler alert) died. Some quotes:On the shrimp in a little glass ecosphere:""All I have to do is make sure that they're not in too much light or too long in the dark and that they're always at temperatures between 40 degrees and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. (Above that, I guess, they make a bisque and not an ecosystem.)""On the need for abortion to spare amother's life:""Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, opposed even this exception: 'If they become tired or even die through bearing children, that does not matter. Let them die through fruitfulness--that is why they are there.'""""Neither St. Augustine or St. Thomas Aquinas considered early-term abortion to be homicide (the latter on the grounds that the embryo doesn't look human). This view was embraced by the Church in the Council of Vienne in 1312, and has never been repudiated. The Catholic Church's first and long-standing collection of canon law (according to the leading historian of the Church's teaching on abortion, John Connery, S.J.) help that abortion was homicide only after the fetus was already 'formed'--roughly, the end of the first trimester.""But when sperm cells were examined in the seventeenth century by the first microscopes, they were thought to show a fully formed human being. An old idea of the homunculus was resuscitated [= sperm contains a full-formed human]. In part through this misinterpretation of scientific data, in 1869 abortion at any time for any reason became grounds for excommunication. It is surprising to most Catholics and others to discover tat the date was not much earlier."""
72,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47975-robu-sensei,3,"Carl Sagan's last book, finished shortly before his death, is an interesting and, at times, curious work. Dr. Sagan starts out a bit off form: the first third or so of the book is rather lacking in his signature eloquence, and he makes a couple of uncharacteristic errors. In the chapter ""Monday-night Hunters,"" for example, he overextends our knowledge of the evolution of behavior in making sweeping, unsupported conclusions about our (and here, by ""our"", I mean ""society's"", and not my own) love of violent sports. However, after a couple of rough patches warming up, he finds his voice and delivers several delightful essays on politics, religion and science. In my favorite chapter, he describes an inspirational alliance between the latter two in defense of the environment. (And indeed, one surprising modern-day pro-environment group in America is evangelical Christians.) Another exceptionally powerful read is ""The Rules of the Game"", on the Golden Rule and variations thereon: the Silver Rule (""Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you""), governing the nonviolent resistance movements of Gandhi and King, and the Brass or Tit-for-Tat Rule (""Do unto others as they do unto you""), a heartless but highly effective way of dealing with others who do not have your best interests at heart. The closing chapter, about Dr. Sagan's losing battle with cancer, is a poignant reminder of our frailty and morality. R.I.P. Carl Sagan—you've been an inspiration to an untold number of budding scientists and freethinkers."
73,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"So much beauty, love and rationality originated from Carl Sagan. In this last book of his, he continued to promote science, sustainability and peace. I did really enjoy his thoughts on abortion and rules of morality such as: golden, silver, iron, brazen, bully, nepotism, kin selection rules..In the final chapter in audio version, the departure of Carl from this world was relived and read by his wife Ann. It left a poignant sense of life&death for me to think and feel."
74,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1607959-melissa,4,"One of Sagan's best nonfiction works (and his last before his death.) The title of the book does not do justice to the topics he explores, but his main theme centers around global synergy and cooperation to solve the ills of modern society: ozone depletion, global warming, population control, economic parity, etc. The two chapters on the ozone and global warming are the BEST scientific yet approachable renditions on the topics and can be read out of context of the rest of the book for great education. He also officers scientific qualification for when abortion should be illegal: the one human characteristic that differentiates us from all other animals is our ability to think (i.e., brain function). He posits that abortion should be illegal once the fetus develops regular brain wave patterns (around 6-7 mos). This was an intersting departure from the mainstream thought. So many other topics abound in this book that really make you think, but sometimes Sagan gets bogged down in his own intellect. He clearly championed so many ideas ahead of his time (cooperation between communist Soviets and capialist Americans, global treaties on CFC bans, etc.) and used his intellect and notoriety to educate the public. "
75,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63497622-ioana-ioana,0,"Passionately optimistic Carl Sagan delivers his outlook on human nature - the same human nature seems to be unforgiving to the very greedy creatures that possess it and to the frail ecosistem that encases it.Whatever doubt I might have had that some parts were, by now, severely outdated, quickly vanished as only hours after leaving the book aside an article from Nature appeared out of the blue on my newsfeed- it was about the surprising discovery that the CFC11 emissions were on the rise, despite the good old Montreal protocol of 1987.And Sagan seemed to be so chripy and confident about how nations came together in order to solve a global problem.We still have difficulties transporting Ebola vaccines to the ”third world” countries, the scientist are still tackling the cumbersome task of unpacking global warming to the masses, fertility is still in decline in the U.S., the nukes are less but still there.I want to believe, just like the author does, that this global death drive can be surpassed by enlightened wisdom.

I was wrong. Billions and Billions, although a softer edged, more humanistic book was still a life-changing read. Loaded with wisdom, wonder, and more critique on critical thinking, I found this last effort by Sagan, to be his most heart-warming. The death of Carl Sagan is a huge loss to the human race. His rare combination of scientific rigor, atheism, and spiritual enlightenment had given me a new outlook on God, Humanity, and myself. It is my firm belief that these two books should be required reading for every high school senior. He is a natural teacher and a permanent student. Humility and genius rarely go hand-in-hand. Carl Sagan's message, the theme of these two books, are the most important message about life on our shared planet since The Sermon on the Mount. "

I would have enjoyed Billions much more had I read it closer to when it was released (1997), as opposed to 12 years after Sagan's death. Many of the chapters comprising Billions were written in the 80s and are dated now. There were still some good parts, and obviously the more cosmic ""big picture"" stuff isn't much effected by 10-20 years. In fact, some of Sagan's worries and predictions from the 80s and 90s are coming true now. The chapters I liked best were: ""Billions and Billions,"" ""Monday Night Hunters,"" ""The Environment: Where Does Prudence Lie?"" ""Ambush: The Warming of the World,"" ""Abortion..."" and ""Gettysburg and Now."""

His words come through clear and precise, and I could hear his voice in my head, reintroducing me to all the things that he held dear, or that concerned him, or that he just found interesting.And he found so much interesting, far too much to be covered in just one book. History, astronomy, physics, the environment, religion. These are only a few of the subjects to which he lends his remarkable intellect here.But though it was his last, this book is a good start for anyone who never had the pleasure of seeing him on Cosmos (do those people actually exist?) or who have never read any part of his prodigious work."

Some of which I couldn't completely understand as they refer exclusively to USA and some of which I can completely relate to/agree with. In general, they are not only thoughts, but information - I can honestly say I'd never really understood the ozone and global warming issues til now, for instance.I recommend this book to anyone who would be looking for some real facts based opinions on a few of the issues we're currently facing in our everyday lifes."

Besides Sagan's distinctive blend of stark optimism and stern alarm, and his splendid rationality, one is struck by a kind of anger in his tone, as though he has grown impatient with the stupidities of humankind. Thus one reads in the essay on abortion these bitter words: ""There is no right to life in any society on Earth today... We raise farm animals for slaughter; destroy forests; pollute rivers and lakes until no fish can live there; kill deer and elk for sport, leopards for their pelts, and whales for fertilizer; entrap dolphins, gasping and writhing, in great tuna nets; club seal pups to death... What is (allegedly) protected is not life, but  life."" (p. 166)What he is against in these essays, as his widow, Ann Druyan, notes in her Epilogue on page 228, are ""the forces of superstition and fundamentalism."" Sagan is preeminently the champion of education and reason as the means to better our life, and the implacable enemy of ignorance. (For ""superstition and fundamentalism,"" read ""ignorance,"" plain and simple.) In some respects this book is a continuation of his volume from the year before, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, but the emphasis here is on the problems confronting us and what can be done about them. In particular, Sagan confronts the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, pollution, the threat of nuclear war, overpopulation, etc. He asks the question (the title of Part II), ""What Are Conservatives Conserving?"" and gives the answer, their short-sighted bottom line. His arguments are ingenious and interesting to read as one observes how hard he is working to persuade us to take care of ourselves and our planet home. He compares the warnings of modern science with those of Cassandra who had the gift of prophesy but the curse of never being believed, science becoming in this sense both Cassandra and the Oracle at Delphi, misunderstood and misinterpreted by our policy makers, whom he likens to Croesus, the rich king who salivated at the prospect of a mighty empire being destroyed only to find that it was his own.

His tendency to preach and guide, his absolute desire to use his celebrity for the common good (and to scold) are evident. He mingles hope with despair; he loves humankind, yet despises what humankind does. He sees our capacity to love and help one another as our saving grace, but cannot help but recall and recount the horrors we have visited upon one another and on our fellow creatures. He sees the planet as one, as Gaia (although he does not use that word) with its organisms cooperating with one another for mutual survival. He writes, ""The inclination to cooperate has been painfully extracted through the evolutionary process. Those organisms that did not cooperate, that did not work with one another, died. Cooperation is encoded in the survivors' genes."" (p. 67) (Incidentally, this is a clear statement for the idea of group selection in evolution. Dawkins, et al., take note.) His writing reveals a man who always tried to do his best, and was perhaps his own sternest critic. He recalls for all of us, ""wincing recollections of past faux pas"" in the chapter on the environment where he tries to persuade us to take a stance ""Somewhere between cheerful dolts and nervous worrywarts...""

96,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66171578-matt-hertel,4,"Sagan's final book reflects on the things that many of us consider when we know our lives are near their end. The text is both a heartwarming reminder of the eloquent prose that Sagan is capable of, as well as his capacity for addressing some of the most profound questions that humanity must ask itself as we continue to move into the future. Billions and Billions ended up taking a longer period of time for me to read, due to a number of life events getting in the way, but I was able to pick it up after a break and easily climb back into the narrative. I was very happy with the book overall and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sagan or wishes to explore his viewpoints on the topics covered in the book.The book covers a number of topics, and approaches fundamental questions about mortality, morality, and the human experience. Sagan reflects on the awesome scale and possibilities of the universe around us in the first part of the book, probes the reasoning and justification behind a number of social questions in the second part of the book, and digs into some very sensitive subjects and provides profound advice for living a good life in the final part of the book. The text covers an amazing amount of ground, from investigating the justification and practice of abortion, to the question of whether intelligent life exists outside our own planet. Sagan is perhaps the only author that can handle such a variety and differing scale of questions without missing a beat. Sagan's classic conversational style is present, and is refined at this point in his career. The book is an excellent demonstration of work that is approachable without sacrificing academic depth. His dictation is as calm and reasoned as it always has been; I like to imagine him reading the text in an armchair in front of a flickering fireplace, calmly explaining the universe to those of us who are prepared to listen.Sagan's personal story is entwined into the narrative, which both grounds the text in real experience and provides an emotional thread that left me with a lump in my throat and a sense of respect for his enduring perspective and the strength of his family as his life came to an end, near the end of the text. The final chapter is written by his wife, as she reflects on his impact and life of work spent answering questions that have proved to be difficult to approach, even today. It speaks to the gravity of the topics discussed, that we still struggle with many of these in our modern society. Perhaps if we still had Sagan with us, he would be able to help us to further deconstruct these complex questions, but I suspect that him being forced to consider his mortality somehow allowed him to see some of these topics more clearly.The discussion is notably apolitical, something which is both refreshing and discouraging considering how our current politically charged social climate has only gotten more extreme with time. Sagan was interested in finding the truth of the matter, even with questions that many would gladly accept some more comforting narrative as opposed to a more sober, realistic understanding.Considering that Sagan's legacy can be measured by the effect on our modern culture, it is clear that he lives on through his thoughtful words and positions. His cutting observations will shape our dialog for years to come, as a man of his intellect and social statue deserves. We miss you Carl, thank you for all you have done for us."

While some chapters are outdated such as the ones on the ozone layer or on climate change, Carl Sagan's clear writing represents an important voice when fighting mysticism and deep-rooted beliefs with science. Being the last book he ever wrote, it carries that much more weight as each word represents the final thoughts of one of the great thinkers of the 20th century. One of those books I wish I had read earlier in life. "

It’s always good to have the perspective of someone who can actually experience the topic being discussed.By and large, these are the musings of one of the most rational, forward-thinking, introspective, and compassionate minds of our generation. He’s written other books, all of which I liked, but this is the one that I loved."

“The hard-liners on each side encourage one another. They owe their credibility and their power to one another. They need one another. They are locked in a deadly embrace.”
Dr. Carl Sagan wrote this in a piece dual-published by prominent magazines in the United States and the then Soviet Union. But it could just as easily describe the current toxicity of American politics, any given regional feud, or even big-box stores competing for sales on a day purportedly dedicated to thanksgiving. The above quote is just one of dozens I underlined, starred, or wrote notes next to in my now beloved copy of Billions and Billions.As with similar books I’ve read by Dr. Sagan, or other scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson, this is more a collection than a single work. It is at once marvelous and troubling to see how relevant this book remains, published in 1997 in the wake of Carl’s death, and including material written during the final stages of the Cold War. Trends come and go. Wisdom proves itself with a longer shelf life. For devotees of Sagan, this book is a must read. It includes highly personal reflections about the illness that was beginning to take his life. Especially in Part III, “Where Hearts and Minds Collide”, it contains some of his most impassioned and courageous statements. I admire the way he takes everyone to task, including scientists. Within the scientific discourse, transcending the facts and figures, can be found Sagan’s deep love for our species, and his abiding hope that we can grow up, can survive, and can improve. A great deal of the material is highly inspirational, but mingled with some healthy scolding of our favored institutions and ourselves. I maintain that the best place to begin an exploration of Carl Sagan’s work is through his TV series Cosmos. However, Billions and Billions is not to be missed. It contains many treasures for the thoughtful reader."

I've gotten more than my money's worth for this one. It's a great book & demonstrates how thoughtful Sagan was. I remember Bill Nye growing up but definitely wished I had been exposed to Carl Sagan as well. It's his memoirs written a little before his death. His thoughts on important issues such as Global Warming (Climate Change), our history as a species, our growth as a species & where we should be headed are thought provoking. It also is a little sad to see how little progress we've made on certain issues, specifically Global Warming (Climate Change), especially with how simply he demonstrates what the problem behind it is. We as a species can not afford to be stubborn. I'm glad I got this book & will likely dig into some of his other work as well. Because I've watched the ""Cosmos"" series, it wasn't hard to imagine the written words in his voice. Awesome book! Wish we had more careful, thoughtful people such as he.""Nature does not always conform to our predispositions & preferences, to what we deem comfortable & easy to understand."" - Carl Sagan, Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life & Death at the Brink of the Milliennium""The world is so exquisite, with so much love & moral depth, that there is no reason to decieve ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far batter, it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look Death in the eye & to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides."" - Carl Sagan, Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life & Death at the Brink of the Milliennium"
101,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5118691-eva,3,"A collection of essays written by Sagan just before he (spoiler alert) died. Some quotes:On the shrimp in a little glass ecosphere:""All I have to do is make sure that they're not in too much light or too long in the dark and that they're always at temperatures between 40 degrees and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. (Above that, I guess, they make a bisque and not an ecosystem.)""On the need for abortion to spare amother's life:""Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, opposed even this exception: 'If they become tired or even die through bearing children, that does not matter. Let them die through fruitfulness--that is why they are there.'""""Neither St. Augustine or St. Thomas Aquinas considered early-term abortion to be homicide (the latter on the grounds that the embryo doesn't look human). This view was embraced by the Church in the Council of Vienne in 1312, and has never been repudiated. The Catholic Church's first and long-standing collection of canon law (according to the leading historian of the Church's teaching on abortion, John Connery, S.J.) help that abortion was homicide only after the fetus was already 'formed'--roughly, the end of the first trimester.""But when sperm cells were examined in the seventeenth century by the first microscopes, they were thought to show a fully formed human being. An old idea of the homunculus was resuscitated [= sperm contains a full-formed human]. In part through this misinterpretation of scientific data, in 1869 abortion at any time for any reason became grounds for excommunication. It is surprising to most Catholics and others to discover tat the date was not much earlier."""
102,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47975-robu-sensei,3,"Carl Sagan's last book, finished shortly before his death, is an interesting and, at times, curious work. Dr. Sagan starts out a bit off form: the first third or so of the book is rather lacking in his signature eloquence, and he makes a couple of uncharacteristic errors. In the chapter ""Monday-night Hunters,"" for example, he overextends our knowledge of the evolution of behavior in making sweeping, unsupported conclusions about our (and here, by ""our"", I mean ""society's"", and not my own) love of violent sports. However, after a couple of rough patches warming up, he finds his voice and delivers several delightful essays on politics, religion and science. In my favorite chapter, he describes an inspirational alliance between the latter two in defense of the environment. (And indeed, one surprising modern-day pro-environment group in America is evangelical Christians.) Another exceptionally powerful read is ""The Rules of the Game"", on the Golden Rule and variations thereon: the Silver Rule (""Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you""), governing the nonviolent resistance movements of Gandhi and King, and the Brass or Tit-for-Tat Rule (""Do unto others as they do unto you""), a heartless but highly effective way of dealing with others who do not have your best interests at heart. The closing chapter, about Dr. Sagan's losing battle with cancer, is a poignant reminder of our frailty and morality. R.I.P. Carl Sagan—you've been an inspiration to an untold number of budding scientists and freethinkers."
103,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"So much beauty, love and rationality originated from Carl Sagan. In this last book of his, he continued to promote science, sustainability and peace. I did really enjoy his thoughts on abortion and rules of morality such as: golden, silver, iron, brazen, bully, nepotism, kin selection rules..In the final chapter in audio version, the departure of Carl from this world was relived and read by his wife Ann. It left a poignant sense of life&death for me to think and feel."
104,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1607959-melissa,4,"One of Sagan's best nonfiction works (and his last before his death.) The title of the book does not do justice to the topics he explores, but his main theme centers around global synergy and cooperation to solve the ills of modern society: ozone depletion, global warming, population control, economic parity, etc. The two chapters on the ozone and global warming are the BEST scientific yet approachable renditions on the topics and can be read out of context of the rest of the book for great education. He also officers scientific qualification for when abortion should be illegal: the one human characteristic that differentiates us from all other animals is our ability to think (i.e., brain function). He posits that abortion should be illegal once the fetus develops regular brain wave patterns (around 6-7 mos). This was an intersting departure from the mainstream thought. So many other topics abound in this book that really make you think, but sometimes Sagan gets bogged down in his own intellect. He clearly championed so many ideas ahead of his time (cooperation between communist Soviets and capialist Americans, global treaties on CFC bans, etc.) and used his intellect and notoriety to educate the public. "
105,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63497622-ioana-ioana,0,"Passionately optimistic Carl Sagan delivers his outlook on human nature - the same human nature seems to be unforgiving to the very greedy creatures that possess it and to the frail ecosistem that encases it.Whatever doubt I might have had that some parts were, by now, severely outdated, quickly vanished as only hours after leaving the book aside an article from Nature appeared out of the blue on my newsfeed- it was about the surprising discovery that the CFC11 emissions were on the rise, despite the good old Montreal protocol of 1987.And Sagan seemed to be so chripy and confident about how nations came together in order to solve a global problem.We still have difficulties transporting Ebola vaccines to the ”third world” countries, the scientist are still tackling the cumbersome task of unpacking global warming to the masses, fertility is still in decline in the U.S., the nukes are less but still there.I want to believe, just like the author does, that this global death drive can be surpassed by enlightened wisdom. Since I'm here, I have an optimism bias, just like the rest."
106,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38148349-benjamin-atkinson,5,"After completing ""In a Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark"", I did not think that I would find anything better. I was wrong. Billions and Billions, although a softer edged, more humanistic book was still a life-changing read. Loaded with wisdom, wonder, and more critique on critical thinking, I found this last effort by Sagan, to be his most heart-warming. The death of Carl Sagan is a huge loss to the human race. His rare combination of scientific rigor, atheism, and spiritual enlightenment had given me a new outlook on God, Humanity, and myself. It is my firm belief that these two books should be required reading for every high school senior. He is a natural teacher and a permanent student. Humility and genius rarely go hand-in-hand. Carl Sagan's message, the theme of these two books, are the most important message about life on our shared planet since The Sermon on the Mount. "
107,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37400-justin,2,"I didn't enjoy this as much as Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World, mostly because I read Demon much closer to its 1996 publication date. I would have enjoyed Billions much more had I read it closer to when it was released (1997), as opposed to 12 years after Sagan's death. Many of the chapters comprising Billions were written in the 80s and are dated now. There were still some good parts, and obviously the more cosmic ""big picture"" stuff isn't much effected by 10-20 years. In fact, some of Sagan's worries and predictions from the 80s and 90s are coming true now. The chapters I liked best were: ""Billions and Billions,"" ""Monday Night Hunters,"" ""The Environment: Where Does Prudence Lie?"" ""Ambush: The Warming of the World,"" ""Abortion..."" and ""Gettysburg and Now."""

Rereading it now, it was like meeting up with an old friend who you thought lost. His words come through clear and precise, and I could hear his voice in my head, reintroducing me to all the things that he held dear, or that concerned him, or that he just found interesting.And he found so much interesting, far too much to be covered in just one book. History, astronomy, physics, the environment, religion. These are only a few of the subjects to which he lends his remarkable intellect here.But though it was his last, this book is a good start for anyone who never had the pleasure of seeing him on Cosmos (do those people actually exist?) or who have never read any part of his prodigious work."

Some of which I couldn't completely understand as they refer exclusively to USA and some of which I can completely relate to/agree with. In general, they are not only thoughts, but information - I can honestly say I'd never really understood the ozone and global warming issues til now, for instance.I recommend this book to anyone who would be looking for some real facts based opinions on a few of the issues we're currently facing in our everyday lifes."

119,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Final thoughtsPublished not long after his death, this--Sagan's last book--is a collection of essays on a variety of subjects having in common a palpable urgency traceable to both the state of the planet and the state of Sagan's health, both perceived as perilous. Besides Sagan's distinctive blend of stark optimism and stern alarm, and his splendid rationality, one is struck by a kind of anger in his tone, as though he has grown impatient with the stupidities of humankind. Thus one reads in the essay on abortion these bitter words: ""There is no right to life in any society on Earth today... We raise farm animals for slaughter; destroy forests; pollute rivers and lakes until no fish can live there; kill deer and elk for sport, leopards for their pelts, and whales for fertilizer; entrap dolphins, gasping and writhing, in great tuna nets; club seal pups to death... What is (allegedly) protected is not life, but  life."" (p. 166)What he is against in these essays, as his widow, Ann Druyan, notes in her Epilogue on page 228, are ""the forces of superstition and fundamentalism."" Sagan is preeminently the champion of education and reason as the means to better our life, and the implacable enemy of ignorance. (For ""superstition and fundamentalism,"" read ""ignorance,"" plain and simple.) In some respects this book is a continuation of his volume from the year before, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, but the emphasis here is on the problems confronting us and what can be done about them. In particular, Sagan confronts the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, pollution, the threat of nuclear war, overpopulation, etc. He asks the question (the title of Part II), ""What Are Conservatives Conserving?"" and gives the answer, their short-sighted bottom line. His arguments are ingenious and interesting to read as one observes how hard he is working to persuade us to take care of ourselves and our planet home. He compares the warnings of modern science with those of Cassandra who had the gift of prophesy but the curse of never being believed, science becoming in this sense both Cassandra and the Oracle at Delphi, misunderstood and misinterpreted by our policy makers, whom he likens to Croesus, the rich king who salivated at the prospect of a mighty empire being destroyed only to find that it was his own. As Pogo observed, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" One senses too that Sagan is projecting his concern that he himself is in danger of becoming a Cassandra.Certainly, in reading this book, one senses the personality of Carl Sagan come to life. His wide knowledge as a scientist, and his influence as a public spokesperson for science and for the environment and for all the life on this planet, are manifest. His tendency to preach and guide, his absolute desire to use his celebrity for the common good (and to scold) are evident. He mingles hope with despair; he loves humankind, yet despises what humankind does. He sees our capacity to love and help one another as our saving grace, but cannot help but recall and recount the horrors we have visited upon one another and on our fellow creatures. He sees the planet as one, as Gaia (although he does not use that word) with its organisms cooperating with one another for mutual survival. He writes, ""The inclination to cooperate has been painfully extracted through the evolutionary process. Those organisms that did not cooperate, that did not work with one another, died. Cooperation is encoded in the survivors' genes."" (p. 67) (Incidentally, this is a clear statement for the idea of group selection in evolution. Dawkins, et al., take note.) His writing reveals a man who always tried to do his best, and was perhaps his own sternest critic. He recalls for all of us, ""wincing recollections of past faux pas"" in the chapter on the environment where he tries to persuade us to take a stance ""Somewhere between cheerful dolts and nervous worrywarts..."" (p. 75)I hear the man and identify with his concerns, and I know myself that I cannot make up my mind on whether to be cheerful about our prospects or to despair. I ""solve"" this problem by realizing that all species eventually go extinct, and that somebody or something ""better"" than us might follow, or to understand that we are just a tiny phase in the cosmic process of Becoming.More to the point, I would hope to be just one fraction as worthwhile to my fellow humans as was, and is, and will continue to be, Carl Sagan, a brilliant man of great humanity who is sorely missed. To read him is to experience the best of humanity. He, like science, is a candle in the dark. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is"

“The hard-liners on each side encourage one another. They owe their credibility and their power to one another. They need one another. They are locked in a deadly embrace.”
Dr. Carl Sagan wrote this in a piece dual-published by prominent magazines in the United States and the then Soviet Union. But it could just as easily describe the current toxicity of American politics, any given regional feud, or even big-box stores competing for sales on a day purportedly dedicated to thanksgiving. The above quote is just one of dozens I underlined, starred, or wrote notes next to in my now beloved copy of Billions and Billions.As with similar books I’ve read by Dr. Sagan, or other scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson, this is more a collection than a single work. It is at once marvelous and troubling to see how relevant this book remains, published in 1997 in the wake of Carl’s death, and including material written during the final stages of the Cold War. Trends come and go. Wisdom proves itself with a longer shelf life. For devotees of Sagan, this book is a must read. It includes highly personal reflections about the illness that was beginning to take his life. Especially in Part III, “Where Hearts and Minds Collide”, it contains some of his most impassioned and courageous statements. I admire the way he takes everyone to task, including scientists. Within the scientific discourse, transcending the facts and figures, can be found Sagan’s deep love for our species, and his abiding hope that we can grow up, can survive, and can improve. A great deal of the material is highly inspirational, but mingled with some healthy scolding of our favored institutions and ourselves. I maintain that the best place to begin an exploration of Carl Sagan’s work is through his TV series Cosmos. However, Billions and Billions is not to be missed. It contains many treasures for the thoughtful reader."

I've gotten more than my money's worth for this one. It's a great book & demonstrates how thoughtful Sagan was. I remember Bill Nye growing up but definitely wished I had been exposed to Carl Sagan as well. It's his memoirs written a little before his death. His thoughts on important issues such as Global Warming (Climate Change), our history as a species, our growth as a species & where we should be headed are thought provoking. It also is a little sad to see how little progress we've made on certain issues, specifically Global Warming (Climate Change), especially with how simply he demonstrates what the problem behind it is. We as a species can not afford to be stubborn. I'm glad I got this book & will likely dig into some of his other work as well. Because I've watched the ""Cosmos"" series, it wasn't hard to imagine the written words in his voice. Awesome book!

Far batter, it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look Death in the eye & to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides."" - Carl Sagan, Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life & Death at the Brink of the Milliennium"
131,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5118691-eva,3,"A collection of essays written by Sagan just before he (spoiler alert) died. Some quotes:On the shrimp in a little glass ecosphere:""All I have to do is make sure that they're not in too much light or too long in the dark and that they're always at temperatures between 40 degrees and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. (Above that, I guess, they make a bisque and not an ecosystem.)""On the need for abortion to spare amother's life:""Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, opposed even this exception: 'If they become tired or even die through bearing children, that does not matter. Let them die through fruitfulness--that is why they are there.'""""Neither St. Augustine or St. Thomas Aquinas considered early-term abortion to be homicide (the latter on the grounds that the embryo doesn't look human). This view was embraced by the Church in the Council of Vienne in 1312, and has never been repudiated. The Catholic Church's first and long-standing collection of canon law (according to the leading historian of the Church's teaching on abortion, John Connery, S.J.) help that abortion was homicide only after the fetus was already 'formed'--roughly, the end of the first trimester.""But when sperm cells were examined in the seventeenth century by the first microscopes, they were thought to show a fully formed human being. An old idea of the homunculus was resuscitated [= sperm contains a full-formed human]. In part through this misinterpretation of scientific data, in 1869 abortion at any time for any reason became grounds for excommunication. It is surprising to most Catholics and others to discover tat the date was not much earlier."""
132,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47975-robu-sensei,3,"Carl Sagan's last book, finished shortly before his death, is an interesting and, at times, curious work. Dr. Sagan starts out a bit off form: the first third or so of the book is rather lacking in his signature eloquence, and he makes a couple of uncharacteristic errors. In the chapter ""Monday-night Hunters,"" for example, he overextends our knowledge of the evolution of behavior in making sweeping, unsupported conclusions about our (and here, by ""our"", I mean ""society's"", and not my own) love of violent sports. However, after a couple of rough patches warming up, he finds his voice and delivers several delightful essays on politics, religion and science. In my favorite chapter, he describes an inspirational alliance between the latter two in defense of the environment. (And indeed, one surprising modern-day pro-environment group in America is evangelical Christians.) Another exceptionally powerful read is ""The Rules of the Game"", on the Golden Rule and variations thereon: the Silver Rule (""Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you""), governing the nonviolent resistance movements of Gandhi and King, and the Brass or Tit-for-Tat Rule (""Do unto others as they do unto you""), a heartless but highly effective way of dealing with others who do not have your best interests at heart. The closing chapter, about Dr. Sagan's losing battle with cancer, is a poignant reminder of our frailty and morality. R.I.P. Carl Sagan—you've been an inspiration to an untold number of budding scientists and freethinkers."
133,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"So much beauty, love and rationality originated from Carl Sagan. In this last book of his, he continued to promote science, sustainability and peace. I did really enjoy his thoughts on abortion and rules of morality such as: golden, silver, iron, brazen, bully, nepotism, kin selection rules..In the final chapter in audio version, the departure of Carl from this world was relived and read by his wife Ann. It left a poignant sense of life&death for me to think and feel."
134,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1607959-melissa,4,"One of Sagan's best nonfiction works (and his last before his death.) The title of the book does not do justice to the topics he explores, but his main theme centers around global synergy and cooperation to solve the ills of modern society: ozone depletion, global warming, population control, economic parity, etc. The two chapters on the ozone and global warming are the BEST scientific yet approachable renditions on the topics and can be read out of context of the rest of the book for great education. He also officers scientific qualification for when abortion should be illegal: the one human characteristic that differentiates us from all other animals is our ability to think (i.e., brain function). He posits that abortion should be illegal once the fetus develops regular brain wave patterns (around 6-7 mos). This was an intersting departure from the mainstream thought. So many other topics abound in this book that really make you think, but sometimes Sagan gets bogged down in his own intellect. He clearly championed so many ideas ahead of his time (cooperation between communist Soviets and capialist Americans, global treaties on CFC bans, etc.) and used his intellect and notoriety to educate the public. "
135,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63497622-ioana-ioana,0,"Passionately optimistic Carl Sagan delivers his outlook on human nature - the same human nature seems to be unforgiving to the very greedy creatures that possess it and to the frail ecosistem that encases it.Whatever doubt I might have had that some parts were, by now, severely outdated, quickly vanished as only hours after leaving the book aside an article from Nature appeared out of the blue on my newsfeed- it was about the surprising discovery that the CFC11 emissions were on the rise, despite the good old Montreal protocol of 1987.And Sagan seemed to be so chripy and confident about how nations came together in order to solve a global problem.We still have difficulties transporting Ebola vaccines to the ”third world” countries, the scientist are still tackling the cumbersome task of unpacking global warming to the masses, fertility is still in decline in the U.S., the nukes are less but still there.I want to believe, just like the author does, that this global death drive can be surpassed by enlightened wisdom.

I was wrong. Billions and Billions, although a softer edged, more humanistic book was still a life-changing read. Loaded with wisdom, wonder, and more critique on critical thinking, I found this last effort by Sagan, to be his most heart-warming. The death of Carl Sagan is a huge loss to the human race. His rare combination of scientific rigor, atheism, and spiritual enlightenment had given me a new outlook on God, Humanity, and myself. It is my firm belief that these two books should be required reading for every high school senior. He is a natural teacher and a permanent student. Humility and genius rarely go hand-in-hand. Carl Sagan's message, the theme of these two books, are the most important message about life on our shared planet since The Sermon on the Mount. "

I would have enjoyed Billions much more had I read it closer to when it was released (1997), as opposed to 12 years after Sagan's death. Many of the chapters comprising Billions were written in the 80s and are dated now. There were still some good parts, and obviously the more cosmic ""big picture"" stuff isn't much effected by 10-20 years. In fact, some of Sagan's worries and predictions from the 80s and 90s are coming true now. The chapters I liked best were: ""Billions and Billions,"" ""Monday Night Hunters,"" ""The Environment: Where Does Prudence Lie?"" ""Ambush: The Warming of the World,"" ""Abortion..."" and ""Gettysburg and Now."""

His words come through clear and precise, and I could hear his voice in my head, reintroducing me to all the things that he held dear, or that concerned him, or that he just found interesting.And he found so much interesting, far too much to be covered in just one book. History, astronomy, physics, the environment, religion. These are only a few of the subjects to which he lends his remarkable intellect here.But though it was his last, this book is a good start for anyone who never had the pleasure of seeing him on Cosmos (do those people actually exist?) or who have never read any part of his prodigious work."

In general, they are not only thoughts, but information - I can honestly say I'd never really understood the ozone and global warming issues til now, for instance.I recommend this book to anyone who would be looking for some real facts based opinions on a few of the issues we're currently facing in our everyday lifes."

149,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Final thoughtsPublished not long after his death, this--Sagan's last book--is a collection of essays on a variety of subjects having in common a palpable urgency traceable to both the state of the planet and the state of Sagan's health, both perceived as perilous. Besides Sagan's distinctive blend of stark optimism and stern alarm, and his splendid rationality, one is struck by a kind of anger in his tone, as though he has grown impatient with the stupidities of humankind. Thus one reads in the essay on abortion these bitter words: ""There is no right to life in any society on Earth today... We raise farm animals for slaughter; destroy forests; pollute rivers and lakes until no fish can live there; kill deer and elk for sport, leopards for their pelts, and whales for fertilizer; entrap dolphins, gasping and writhing, in great tuna nets; club seal pups to death... What is (allegedly) protected is not life, but  life."" (p. 166)What he is against in these essays, as his widow, Ann Druyan, notes in her Epilogue on page 228, are ""the forces of superstition and fundamentalism."" Sagan is preeminently the champion of education and reason as the means to better our life, and the implacable enemy of ignorance. (For ""superstition and fundamentalism,"" read ""ignorance,"" plain and simple.) In some respects this book is a continuation of his volume from the year before, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, but the emphasis here is on the problems confronting us and what can be done about them. In particular, Sagan confronts the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, pollution, the threat of nuclear war, overpopulation, etc. He asks the question (the title of Part II), ""What Are Conservatives Conserving?"" and gives the answer, their short-sighted bottom line. His arguments are ingenious and interesting to read as one observes how hard he is working to persuade us to take care of ourselves and our planet home. He compares the warnings of modern science with those of Cassandra who had the gift of prophesy but the curse of never being believed, science becoming in this sense both Cassandra and the Oracle at Delphi, misunderstood and misinterpreted by our policy makers, whom he likens to Croesus, the rich king who salivated at the prospect of a mighty empire being destroyed only to find that it was his own. As Pogo observed, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" One senses too that Sagan is projecting his concern that he himself is in danger of becoming a Cassandra.Certainly, in reading this book, one senses the personality of Carl Sagan come to life. His wide knowledge as a scientist, and his influence as a public spokesperson for science and for the environment and for all the life on this planet, are manifest. His tendency to preach and guide, his absolute desire to use his celebrity for the common good (and to scold) are evident. He mingles hope with despair; he loves humankind, yet despises what humankind does. He sees our capacity to love and help one another as our saving grace, but cannot help but recall and recount the horrors we have visited upon one another and on our fellow creatures. He sees the planet as one, as Gaia (although he does not use that word) with its organisms cooperating with one another for mutual survival. He writes, ""The inclination to cooperate has been painfully extracted through the evolutionary process. Those organisms that did not cooperate, that did not work with one another, died. Cooperation is encoded in the survivors' genes."" (p. 67) (Incidentally, this is a clear statement for the idea of group selection in evolution. Dawkins, et al., take note.) His writing reveals a man who always tried to do his best, and was perhaps his own sternest critic. He recalls for all of us, ""wincing recollections of past faux pas"" in the chapter on the environment where he tries to persuade us to take a stance ""Somewhere between cheerful dolts and nervous worrywarts..."" (p. 75)I hear the man and identify with his concerns, and I know myself that I cannot make up my mind on whether to be cheerful about our prospects or to despair. I ""solve"" this problem by realizing that all species eventually go extinct, and that somebody or something ""better"" than us might follow, or to understand that we are just a tiny phase in the cosmic process of Becoming.More to the point, I would hope to be just one fraction as worthwhile to my fellow humans as was, and is, and will continue to be, Carl Sagan, a brilliant man of great humanity who is sorely missed. To read him is to experience the best of humanity. He, like science, is a candle in the dark. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is"

The text is both a heartwarming reminder of the eloquent prose that Sagan is capable of, as well as his capacity for addressing some of the most profound questions that humanity must ask itself as we continue to move into the future. Billions and Billions ended up taking a longer period of time for me to read, due to a number of life events getting in the way, but I was able to pick it up after a break and easily climb back into the narrative. I was very happy with the book overall and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sagan or wishes to explore his viewpoints on the topics covered in the book.The book covers a number of topics, and approaches fundamental questions about mortality, morality, and the human experience. Sagan reflects on the awesome scale and possibilities of the universe around us in the first part of the book, probes the reasoning and justification behind a number of social questions in the second part of the book, and digs into some very sensitive subjects and provides profound advice for living a good life in the final part of the book. The text covers an amazing amount of ground, from investigating the justification and practice of abortion, to the question of whether intelligent life exists outside our own planet. Sagan is perhaps the only author that can handle such a variety and differing scale of questions without missing a beat. Sagan's classic conversational style is present, and is refined at this point in his career. The book is an excellent demonstration of work that is approachable without sacrificing academic depth. His dictation is as calm and reasoned as it always has been; I like to imagine him reading the text in an armchair in front of a flickering fireplace, calmly explaining the universe to those of us who are prepared to listen.Sagan's personal story is entwined into the narrative, which both grounds the text in real experience and provides an emotional thread that left me with a lump in my throat and a sense of respect for his enduring perspective and the strength of his family as his life came to an end, near the end of the text. The final chapter is written by his wife, as she reflects on his impact and life of work spent answering questions that have proved to be difficult to approach, even today. It speaks to the gravity of the topics discussed, that we still struggle with many of these in our modern society. Perhaps if we still had Sagan with us, he would be able to help us to further deconstruct these complex questions, but I suspect that him being forced to consider his mortality somehow allowed him to see some of these topics more clearly.The discussion is notably apolitical, something which is both refreshing and discouraging considering how our current politically charged social climate has only gotten more extreme with time. Sagan was interested in finding the truth of the matter, even with questions that many would gladly accept some more comforting narrative as opposed to a more sober, realistic understanding.Considering that Sagan's legacy can be measured by the effect on our modern culture, it is clear that he lives on through his thoughtful words and positions. His cutting observations will shape our dialog for years to come, as a man of his intellect and social statue deserves. We miss you Carl, thank you for all you have done for us."

Dr. Sagan starts out a bit off form: the first third or so of the book is rather lacking in his signature eloquence, and he makes a couple of uncharacteristic errors. In the chapter ""Monday-night Hunters,"" for example, he overextends our knowledge of the evolution of behavior in making sweeping, unsupported conclusions about our (and here, by ""our"", I mean ""society's"", and not my own) love of violent sports. However, after a couple of rough patches warming up, he finds his voice and delivers several delightful essays on politics, religion and science. In my favorite chapter, he describes an inspirational alliance between the latter two in defense of the environment. (And indeed, one surprising modern-day pro-environment group in America is evangelical Christians.) Another exceptionally powerful read is ""The Rules of the Game"", on the Golden Rule and variations thereon: the Silver Rule (""Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you""), governing the nonviolent resistance movements of Gandhi and King, and the Brass or Tit-for-Tat Rule (""Do unto others as they do unto you""), a heartless but highly effective way of dealing with others who do not have your best interests at heart. The closing chapter, about Dr. Sagan's losing battle with cancer, is a poignant reminder of our frailty and morality. R.I.P.

I did really enjoy his thoughts on abortion and rules of morality such as: golden, silver, iron, brazen, bully, nepotism, kin selection rules..In the final chapter in audio version, the departure of Carl from this world was relived and read by his wife Ann. It left a poignant sense of life&death for me to think and feel."
164,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1607959-melissa,4,"One of Sagan's best nonfiction works (and his last before his death.) The title of the book does not do justice to the topics he explores, but his main theme centers around global synergy and cooperation to solve the ills of modern society: ozone depletion, global warming, population control, economic parity, etc. The two chapters on the ozone and global warming are the BEST scientific yet approachable renditions on the topics and can be read out of context of the rest of the book for great education. He also officers scientific qualification for when abortion should be illegal: the one human characteristic that differentiates us from all other animals is our ability to think (i.e., brain function). He posits that abortion should be illegal once the fetus develops regular brain wave patterns (around 6-7 mos). This was an intersting departure from the mainstream thought. So many other topics abound in this book that really make you think, but sometimes Sagan gets bogged down in his own intellect. He clearly championed so many ideas ahead of his time (cooperation between communist Soviets and capialist Americans, global treaties on CFC bans, etc.) and used his intellect and notoriety to educate the public. "

I was wrong. Billions and Billions, although a softer edged, more humanistic book was still a life-changing read. Loaded with wisdom, wonder, and more critique on critical thinking, I found this last effort by Sagan, to be his most heart-warming. The death of Carl Sagan is a huge loss to the human race. His rare combination of scientific rigor, atheism, and spiritual enlightenment had given me a new outlook on God, Humanity, and myself. It is my firm belief that these two books should be required reading for every high school senior. He is a natural teacher and a permanent student. Humility and genius rarely go hand-in-hand. Carl Sagan's message, the theme of these two books, are the most important message about life on our shared planet since The Sermon on the Mount. "

I would have enjoyed Billions much more had I read it closer to when it was released (1997), as opposed to 12 years after Sagan's death. Many of the chapters comprising Billions were written in the 80s and are dated now. There were still some good parts, and obviously the more cosmic ""big picture"" stuff isn't much effected by 10-20 years. In fact, some of Sagan's worries and predictions from the 80s and 90s are coming true now. The chapters I liked best were: ""Billions and Billions,"" ""Monday Night Hunters,"" ""The Environment: Where Does Prudence Lie?"" ""Ambush: The Warming of the World,"" ""Abortion..."" and ""Gettysburg and Now."""

His words come through clear and precise, and I could hear his voice in my head, reintroducing me to all the things that he held dear, or that concerned him, or that he just found interesting.And he found so much interesting, far too much to be covered in just one book. History, astronomy, physics, the environment, religion. These are only a few of the subjects to which he lends his remarkable intellect here.But though it was his last, this book is a good start for anyone who never had the pleasure of seeing him on Cosmos (do those people actually exist?) or who have never read any part of his prodigious work."

179,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Final thoughtsPublished not long after his death, this--Sagan's last book--is a collection of essays on a variety of subjects having in common a palpable urgency traceable to both the state of the planet and the state of Sagan's health, both perceived as perilous. Besides Sagan's distinctive blend of stark optimism and stern alarm, and his splendid rationality, one is struck by a kind of anger in his tone, as though he has grown impatient with the stupidities of humankind. Thus one reads in the essay on abortion these bitter words: ""There is no right to life in any society on Earth today... We raise farm animals for slaughter; destroy forests; pollute rivers and lakes until no fish can live there; kill deer and elk for sport, leopards for their pelts, and whales for fertilizer; entrap dolphins, gasping and writhing, in great tuna nets; club seal pups to death... What is (allegedly) protected is not life, but  life."" (p. 166)What he is against in these essays, as his widow, Ann Druyan, notes in her Epilogue on page 228, are ""the forces of superstition and fundamentalism."" Sagan is preeminently the champion of education and reason as the means to better our life, and the implacable enemy of ignorance. (For ""superstition and fundamentalism,"" read ""ignorance,"" plain and simple.) In some respects this book is a continuation of his volume from the year before, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, but the emphasis here is on the problems confronting us and what can be done about them. In particular, Sagan confronts the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, pollution, the threat of nuclear war, overpopulation, etc. He asks the question (the title of Part II), ""What Are Conservatives Conserving?"" and gives the answer, their short-sighted bottom line. His arguments are ingenious and interesting to read as one observes how hard he is working to persuade us to take care of ourselves and our planet home. He compares the warnings of modern science with those of Cassandra who had the gift of prophesy but the curse of never being believed, science becoming in this sense both Cassandra and the Oracle at Delphi, misunderstood and misinterpreted by our policy makers, whom he likens to Croesus, the rich king who salivated at the prospect of a mighty empire being destroyed only to find that it was his own. As Pogo observed, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" One senses too that Sagan is projecting his concern that he himself is in danger of becoming a Cassandra.Certainly, in reading this book, one senses the personality of Carl Sagan come to life. His wide knowledge as a scientist, and his influence as a public spokesperson for science and for the environment and for all the life on this planet, are manifest. His tendency to preach and guide, his absolute desire to use his celebrity for the common good (and to scold) are evident. He mingles hope with despair; he loves humankind, yet despises what humankind does. He sees our capacity to love and help one another as our saving grace, but cannot help but recall and recount the horrors we have visited upon one another and on our fellow creatures. He sees the planet as one, as Gaia (although he does not use that word) with its organisms cooperating with one another for mutual survival. He writes, ""The inclination to cooperate has been painfully extracted through the evolutionary process. Those organisms that did not cooperate, that did not work with one another, died. Cooperation is encoded in the survivors' genes."" (p. 67) (Incidentally, this is a clear statement for the idea of group selection in evolution. Dawkins, et al., take note.) His writing reveals a man who always tried to do his best, and was perhaps his own sternest critic. He recalls for all of us, ""wincing recollections of past faux pas"" in the chapter on the environment where he tries to persuade us to take a stance ""Somewhere between cheerful dolts and nervous worrywarts..."" (p. 75)I hear the man and identify with his concerns, and I know myself that I cannot make up my mind on whether to be cheerful about our prospects or to despair. I ""solve"" this problem by realizing that all species eventually go extinct, and that somebody or something ""better"" than us might follow, or to understand that we are just a tiny phase in the cosmic process of Becoming.More to the point, I would hope to be just one fraction as worthwhile to my fellow humans as was, and is, and will continue to be, Carl Sagan, a brilliant man of great humanity who is sorely missed. To read him is to experience the best of humanity. He, like science, is a candle in the dark. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is"

186,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66171578-matt-hertel,4,"Sagan's final book reflects on the things that many of us consider when we know our lives are near their end. The text is both a heartwarming reminder of the eloquent prose that Sagan is capable of, as well as his capacity for addressing some of the most profound questions that humanity must ask itself as we continue to move into the future. Billions and Billions ended up taking a longer period of time for me to read, due to a number of life events getting in the way, but I was able to pick it up after a break and easily climb back into the narrative. I was very happy with the book overall and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sagan or wishes to explore his viewpoints on the topics covered in the book.The book covers a number of topics, and approaches fundamental questions about mortality, morality, and the human experience. Sagan reflects on the awesome scale and possibilities of the universe around us in the first part of the book, probes the reasoning and justification behind a number of social questions in the second part of the book, and digs into some very sensitive subjects and provides profound advice for living a good life in the final part of the book. The text covers an amazing amount of ground, from investigating the justification and practice of abortion, to the question of whether intelligent life exists outside our own planet. Sagan is perhaps the only author that can handle such a variety and differing scale of questions without missing a beat. Sagan's classic conversational style is present, and is refined at this point in his career. The book is an excellent demonstration of work that is approachable without sacrificing academic depth. His dictation is as calm and reasoned as it always has been; I like to imagine him reading the text in an armchair in front of a flickering fireplace, calmly explaining the universe to those of us who are prepared to listen.Sagan's personal story is entwined into the narrative, which both grounds the text in real experience and provides an emotional thread that left me with a lump in my throat and a sense of respect for his enduring perspective and the strength of his family as his life came to an end, near the end of the text. The final chapter is written by his wife, as she reflects on his impact and life of work spent answering questions that have proved to be difficult to approach, even today. It speaks to the gravity of the topics discussed, that we still struggle with many of these in our modern society. Perhaps if we still had Sagan with us, he would be able to help us to further deconstruct these complex questions, but I suspect that him being forced to consider his mortality somehow allowed him to see some of these topics more clearly.The discussion is notably apolitical, something which is both refreshing and discouraging considering how our current politically charged social climate has only gotten more extreme with time. Sagan was interested in finding the truth of the matter, even with questions that many would gladly accept some more comforting narrative as opposed to a more sober, realistic understanding.Considering that Sagan's legacy can be measured by the effect on our modern culture, it is clear that he lives on through his thoughtful words and positions. His cutting observations will shape our dialog for years to come, as a man of his intellect and social statue deserves. We miss you Carl, thank you for all you have done for us."

It’s always good to have the perspective of someone who can actually experience the topic being discussed.By and large, these are the musings of one of the most rational, forward-thinking, introspective, and compassionate minds of our generation.

“The hard-liners on each side encourage one another. They owe their credibility and their power to one another. They need one another. They are locked in a deadly embrace.”
Dr. Carl Sagan wrote this in a piece dual-published by prominent magazines in the United States and the then Soviet Union. But it could just as easily describe the current toxicity of American politics, any given regional feud, or even big-box stores competing for sales on a day purportedly dedicated to thanksgiving. The above quote is just one of dozens I underlined, starred, or wrote notes next to in my now beloved copy of Billions and Billions.As with similar books I’ve read by Dr. Sagan, or other scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson, this is more a collection than a single work. It is at once marvelous and troubling to see how relevant this book remains, published in 1997 in the wake of Carl’s death, and including material written during the final stages of the Cold War. Trends come and go. Wisdom proves itself with a longer shelf life. For devotees of Sagan, this book is a must read. It includes highly personal reflections about the illness that was beginning to take his life. Especially in Part III, “Where Hearts and Minds Collide”, it contains some of his most impassioned and courageous statements. I admire the way he takes everyone to task, including scientists. Within the scientific discourse, transcending the facts and figures, can be found Sagan’s deep love for our species, and his abiding hope that we can grow up, can survive, and can improve. A great deal of the material is highly inspirational, but mingled with some healthy scolding of our favored institutions and ourselves. I maintain that the best place to begin an exploration of Carl Sagan’s work is through his TV series Cosmos. However, Billions and Billions is not to be missed. It contains many treasures for the thoughtful reader."

It also is a little sad to see how little progress we've made on certain issues, specifically Global Warming (Climate Change), especially with how simply he demonstrates what the problem behind it is.

Loaded with wisdom, wonder, and more critique on critical thinking, I found this last effort by Sagan, to be his most heart-warming. The death of Carl Sagan is a huge loss to the human race. His rare combination of scientific rigor, atheism, and spiritual enlightenment had given me a new outlook on God, Humanity, and myself. It is my firm belief that these two books should be required reading for every high school senior. He is a natural teacher and a permanent student. Humility and genius rarely go hand-in-hand.

209,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Final thoughtsPublished not long after his death, this--Sagan's last book--is a collection of essays on a variety of subjects having in common a palpable urgency traceable to both the state of the planet and the state of Sagan's health, both perceived as perilous. Besides Sagan's distinctive blend of stark optimism and stern alarm, and his splendid rationality, one is struck by a kind of anger in his tone, as though he has grown impatient with the stupidities of humankind. Thus one reads in the essay on abortion these bitter words: ""There is no right to life in any society on Earth today... We raise farm animals for slaughter; destroy forests; pollute rivers and lakes until no fish can live there; kill deer and elk for sport, leopards for their pelts, and whales for fertilizer; entrap dolphins, gasping and writhing, in great tuna nets; club seal pups to death... What is (allegedly) protected is not life, but  life."" (p. 166)What he is against in these essays, as his widow, Ann Druyan, notes in her Epilogue on page 228, are ""the forces of superstition and fundamentalism."" Sagan is preeminently the champion of education and reason as the means to better our life, and the implacable enemy of ignorance. (For ""superstition and fundamentalism,"" read ""ignorance,"" plain and simple.) In some respects this book is a continuation of his volume from the year before, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, but the emphasis here is on the problems confronting us and what can be done about them. In particular, Sagan confronts the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, pollution, the threat of nuclear war, overpopulation, etc. He asks the question (the title of Part II), ""What Are Conservatives Conserving?"" and gives the answer, their short-sighted bottom line. His arguments are ingenious and interesting to read as one observes how hard he is working to persuade us to take care of ourselves and our planet home. He compares the warnings of modern science with those of Cassandra who had the gift of prophesy but the curse of never being believed, science becoming in this sense both Cassandra and the Oracle at Delphi, misunderstood and misinterpreted by our policy makers, whom he likens to Croesus, the rich king who salivated at the prospect of a mighty empire being destroyed only to find that it was his own. As Pogo observed, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" One senses too that Sagan is projecting his concern that he himself is in danger of becoming a Cassandra.Certainly, in reading this book, one senses the personality of Carl Sagan come to life. His wide knowledge as a scientist, and his influence as a public spokesperson for science and for the environment and for all the life on this planet, are manifest. His tendency to preach and guide, his absolute desire to use his celebrity for the common good (and to scold) are evident. He mingles hope with despair; he loves humankind, yet despises what humankind does. He sees our capacity to love and help one another as our saving grace, but cannot help but recall and recount the horrors we have visited upon one another and on our fellow creatures. He sees the planet as one, as Gaia (although he does not use that word) with its organisms cooperating with one another for mutual survival. He writes, ""The inclination to cooperate has been painfully extracted through the evolutionary process. Those organisms that did not cooperate, that did not work with one another, died. Cooperation is encoded in the survivors' genes."" (p. 67) (Incidentally, this is a clear statement for the idea of group selection in evolution. Dawkins, et al., take note.) His writing reveals a man who always tried to do his best, and was perhaps his own sternest critic. He recalls for all of us, ""wincing recollections of past faux pas"" in the chapter on the environment where he tries to persuade us to take a stance ""Somewhere between cheerful dolts and nervous worrywarts..."" (p. 75)I hear the man and identify with his concerns, and I know myself that I cannot make up my mind on whether to be cheerful about our prospects or to despair. I ""solve"" this problem by realizing that all species eventually go extinct, and that somebody or something ""better"" than us might follow, or to understand that we are just a tiny phase in the cosmic process of Becoming.More to the point, I would hope to be just one fraction as worthwhile to my fellow humans as was, and is, and will continue to be, Carl Sagan, a brilliant man of great humanity who is sorely missed. To read him is to experience the best of humanity. He, like science, is a candle in the dark. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is"

216,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66171578-matt-hertel,4,"Sagan's final book reflects on the things that many of us consider when we know our lives are near their end. The text is both a heartwarming reminder of the eloquent prose that Sagan is capable of, as well as his capacity for addressing some of the most profound questions that humanity must ask itself as we continue to move into the future. Billions and Billions ended up taking a longer period of time for me to read, due to a number of life events getting in the way, but I was able to pick it up after a break and easily climb back into the narrative. I was very happy with the book overall and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sagan or wishes to explore his viewpoints on the topics covered in the book.The book covers a number of topics, and approaches fundamental questions about mortality, morality, and the human experience. Sagan reflects on the awesome scale and possibilities of the universe around us in the first part of the book, probes the reasoning and justification behind a number of social questions in the second part of the book, and digs into some very sensitive subjects and provides profound advice for living a good life in the final part of the book. The text covers an amazing amount of ground, from investigating the justification and practice of abortion, to the question of whether intelligent life exists outside our own planet. Sagan is perhaps the only author that can handle such a variety and differing scale of questions without missing a beat. Sagan's classic conversational style is present, and is refined at this point in his career. The book is an excellent demonstration of work that is approachable without sacrificing academic depth. His dictation is as calm and reasoned as it always has been; I like to imagine him reading the text in an armchair in front of a flickering fireplace, calmly explaining the universe to those of us who are prepared to listen.Sagan's personal story is entwined into the narrative, which both grounds the text in real experience and provides an emotional thread that left me with a lump in my throat and a sense of respect for his enduring perspective and the strength of his family as his life came to an end, near the end of the text. The final chapter is written by his wife, as she reflects on his impact and life of work spent answering questions that have proved to be difficult to approach, even today. It speaks to the gravity of the topics discussed, that we still struggle with many of these in our modern society. Perhaps if we still had Sagan with us, he would be able to help us to further deconstruct these complex questions, but I suspect that him being forced to consider his mortality somehow allowed him to see some of these topics more clearly.The discussion is notably apolitical, something which is both refreshing and discouraging considering how our current politically charged social climate has only gotten more extreme with time. Sagan was interested in finding the truth of the matter, even with questions that many would gladly accept some more comforting narrative as opposed to a more sober, realistic understanding.Considering that Sagan's legacy can be measured by the effect on our modern culture, it is clear that he lives on through his thoughtful words and positions. His cutting observations will shape our dialog for years to come, as a man of his intellect and social statue deserves. We miss you Carl, thank you for all you have done for us."

While some chapters are outdated such as the ones on the ozone layer or on climate change, Carl Sagan's clear writing represents an important voice when fighting mysticism and deep-rooted beliefs with science.

It’s always good to have the perspective of someone who can actually experience the topic being discussed.By and large, these are the musings of one of the most rational, forward-thinking, introspective, and compassionate minds of our generation.

“The hard-liners on each side encourage one another. They owe their credibility and their power to one another. They need one another. They are locked in a deadly embrace.”
Dr. Carl Sagan wrote this in a piece dual-published by prominent magazines in the United States and the then Soviet Union. But it could just as easily describe the current toxicity of American politics, any given regional feud, or even big-box stores competing for sales on a day purportedly dedicated to thanksgiving. The above quote is just one of dozens I underlined, starred, or wrote notes next to in my now beloved copy of Billions and Billions.As with similar books I’ve read by Dr. Sagan, or other scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson, this is more a collection than a single work. It is at once marvelous and troubling to see how relevant this book remains, published in 1997 in the wake of Carl’s death, and including material written during the final stages of the Cold War. Trends come and go. Wisdom proves itself with a longer shelf life. For devotees of Sagan, this book is a must read. It includes highly personal reflections about the illness that was beginning to take his life. Especially in Part III, “Where Hearts and Minds Collide”, it contains some of his most impassioned and courageous statements. I admire the way he takes everyone to task, including scientists. Within the scientific discourse, transcending the facts and figures, can be found Sagan’s deep love for our species, and his abiding hope that we can grow up, can survive, and can improve. A great deal of the material is highly inspirational, but mingled with some healthy scolding of our favored institutions and ourselves. I maintain that the best place to begin an exploration of Carl Sagan’s work is through his TV series Cosmos. However, Billions and Billions is not to be missed. It contains many treasures for the thoughtful reader."

I've gotten more than my money's worth for this one. It's a great book & demonstrates how thoughtful Sagan was. I remember Bill Nye growing up but definitely wished I had been exposed to Carl Sagan as well. It's his memoirs written a little before his death. His thoughts on important issues such as Global Warming (Climate Change), our history as a species, our growth as a species & where we should be headed are thought provoking. It also is a little sad to see how little progress we've made on certain issues, specifically Global Warming (Climate Change), especially with how simply he demonstrates what the problem behind it is. We as a species can not afford to be stubborn. I'm glad I got this book & will likely dig into some of his other work as well. Because I've watched the ""Cosmos"" series, it wasn't hard to imagine the written words in his voice. Awesome book!

(Above that, I guess, they make a bisque and not an ecosystem.)""On the need for abortion to spare amother's life:""Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, opposed even this exception: 'If they become tired or even die through bearing children, that does not matter. Let them die through fruitfulness--that is why they are there.'""""Neither St. Augustine or St. Thomas Aquinas considered early-term abortion to be homicide (the latter on the grounds that the embryo doesn't look human). This view was embraced by the Church in the Council of Vienne in 1312, and has never been repudiated. The Catholic Church's first and long-standing collection of canon law (according to the leading historian of the Church's teaching on abortion, John Connery, S.J.) help that abortion was homicide only after the fetus was already 'formed'--roughly, the end of the first trimester.""But when sperm cells were examined in the seventeenth century by the first microscopes, they were thought to show a fully formed human being. An old idea of the homunculus was resuscitated [= sperm contains a full-formed human]. In part through this misinterpretation of scientific data, in 1869 abortion at any time for any reason became grounds for excommunication.

Dr. Sagan starts out a bit off form: the first third or so of the book is rather lacking in his signature eloquence, and he makes a couple of uncharacteristic errors. In the chapter ""Monday-night Hunters,"" for example, he overextends our knowledge of the evolution of behavior in making sweeping, unsupported conclusions about our (and here, by ""our"", I mean ""society's"", and not my own) love of violent sports. However, after a couple of rough patches warming up, he finds his voice and delivers several delightful essays on politics, religion and science. In my favorite chapter, he describes an inspirational alliance between the latter two in defense of the environment. (And indeed, one surprising modern-day pro-environment group in America is evangelical Christians.) Another exceptionally powerful read is ""The Rules of the Game"", on the Golden Rule and variations thereon: the Silver Rule (""Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you""), governing the nonviolent resistance movements of Gandhi and King, and the Brass or Tit-for-Tat Rule (""Do unto others as they do unto you""), a heartless but highly effective way of dealing with others who do not have your best interests at heart. The closing chapter, about Dr. Sagan's losing battle with cancer, is a poignant reminder of our frailty and morality. R.I.P.

239,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Final thoughtsPublished not long after his death, this--Sagan's last book--is a collection of essays on a variety of subjects having in common a palpable urgency traceable to both the state of the planet and the state of Sagan's health, both perceived as perilous. Besides Sagan's distinctive blend of stark optimism and stern alarm, and his splendid rationality, one is struck by a kind of anger in his tone, as though he has grown impatient with the stupidities of humankind. Thus one reads in the essay on abortion these bitter words: ""There is no right to life in any society on Earth today... We raise farm animals for slaughter; destroy forests; pollute rivers and lakes until no fish can live there; kill deer and elk for sport, leopards for their pelts, and whales for fertilizer; entrap dolphins, gasping and writhing, in great tuna nets; club seal pups to death... What is (allegedly) protected is not life, but  life."" (p. 166)What he is against in these essays, as his widow, Ann Druyan, notes in her Epilogue on page 228, are ""the forces of superstition and fundamentalism."" Sagan is preeminently the champion of education and reason as the means to better our life, and the implacable enemy of ignorance. (For ""superstition and fundamentalism,"" read ""ignorance,"" plain and simple.) In some respects this book is a continuation of his volume from the year before, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, but the emphasis here is on the problems confronting us and what can be done about them. In particular, Sagan confronts the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, pollution, the threat of nuclear war, overpopulation, etc. He asks the question (the title of Part II), ""What Are Conservatives Conserving?"" and gives the answer, their short-sighted bottom line. His arguments are ingenious and interesting to read as one observes how hard he is working to persuade us to take care of ourselves and our planet home. He compares the warnings of modern science with those of Cassandra who had the gift of prophesy but the curse of never being believed, science becoming in this sense both Cassandra and the Oracle at Delphi, misunderstood and misinterpreted by our policy makers, whom he likens to Croesus, the rich king who salivated at the prospect of a mighty empire being destroyed only to find that it was his own. As Pogo observed, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" One senses too that Sagan is projecting his concern that he himself is in danger of becoming a Cassandra.Certainly, in reading this book, one senses the personality of Carl Sagan come to life. His wide knowledge as a scientist, and his influence as a public spokesperson for science and for the environment and for all the life on this planet, are manifest. His tendency to preach and guide, his absolute desire to use his celebrity for the common good (and to scold) are evident. He mingles hope with despair; he loves humankind, yet despises what humankind does. He sees our capacity to love and help one another as our saving grace, but cannot help but recall and recount the horrors we have visited upon one another and on our fellow creatures. He sees the planet as one, as Gaia (although he does not use that word) with its organisms cooperating with one another for mutual survival. He writes, ""The inclination to cooperate has been painfully extracted through the evolutionary process. Those organisms that did not cooperate, that did not work with one another, died. Cooperation is encoded in the survivors' genes."" (p. 67) (Incidentally, this is a clear statement for the idea of group selection in evolution. Dawkins, et al., take note.) His writing reveals a man who always tried to do his best, and was perhaps his own sternest critic. He recalls for all of us, ""wincing recollections of past faux pas"" in the chapter on the environment where he tries to persuade us to take a stance ""Somewhere between cheerful dolts and nervous worrywarts..."" (p. 75)I hear the man and identify with his concerns, and I know myself that I cannot make up my mind on whether to be cheerful about our prospects or to despair. I ""solve"" this problem by realizing that all species eventually go extinct, and that somebody or something ""better"" than us might follow, or to understand that we are just a tiny phase in the cosmic process of Becoming.More to the point, I would hope to be just one fraction as worthwhile to my fellow humans as was, and is, and will continue to be, Carl Sagan, a brilliant man of great humanity who is sorely missed. To read him is to experience the best of humanity. He, like science, is a candle in the dark. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is"

246,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66171578-matt-hertel,4,"Sagan's final book reflects on the things that many of us consider when we know our lives are near their end. The text is both a heartwarming reminder of the eloquent prose that Sagan is capable of, as well as his capacity for addressing some of the most profound questions that humanity must ask itself as we continue to move into the future. Billions and Billions ended up taking a longer period of time for me to read, due to a number of life events getting in the way, but I was able to pick it up after a break and easily climb back into the narrative. I was very happy with the book overall and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sagan or wishes to explore his viewpoints on the topics covered in the book.The book covers a number of topics, and approaches fundamental questions about mortality, morality, and the human experience. Sagan reflects on the awesome scale and possibilities of the universe around us in the first part of the book, probes the reasoning and justification behind a number of social questions in the second part of the book, and digs into some very sensitive subjects and provides profound advice for living a good life in the final part of the book. The text covers an amazing amount of ground, from investigating the justification and practice of abortion, to the question of whether intelligent life exists outside our own planet. Sagan is perhaps the only author that can handle such a variety and differing scale of questions without missing a beat. Sagan's classic conversational style is present, and is refined at this point in his career. The book is an excellent demonstration of work that is approachable without sacrificing academic depth. His dictation is as calm and reasoned as it always has been; I like to imagine him reading the text in an armchair in front of a flickering fireplace, calmly explaining the universe to those of us who are prepared to listen.Sagan's personal story is entwined into the narrative, which both grounds the text in real experience and provides an emotional thread that left me with a lump in my throat and a sense of respect for his enduring perspective and the strength of his family as his life came to an end, near the end of the text. The final chapter is written by his wife, as she reflects on his impact and life of work spent answering questions that have proved to be difficult to approach, even today. It speaks to the gravity of the topics discussed, that we still struggle with many of these in our modern society. Perhaps if we still had Sagan with us, he would be able to help us to further deconstruct these complex questions, but I suspect that him being forced to consider his mortality somehow allowed him to see some of these topics more clearly.The discussion is notably apolitical, something which is both refreshing and discouraging considering how our current politically charged social climate has only gotten more extreme with time. Sagan was interested in finding the truth of the matter, even with questions that many would gladly accept some more comforting narrative as opposed to a more sober, realistic understanding.Considering that Sagan's legacy can be measured by the effect on our modern culture, it is clear that he lives on through his thoughtful words and positions. His cutting observations will shape our dialog for years to come, as a man of his intellect and social statue deserves. We miss you Carl, thank you for all you have done for us."

While some chapters are outdated such as the ones on the ozone layer or on climate change, Carl Sagan's clear writing represents an important voice when fighting mysticism and deep-rooted beliefs with science. Being the last book he ever wrote, it carries that much more weight as each word represents the final thoughts of one of the great thinkers of the 20th century. One of those books I wish I had read earlier in life. "

It’s always good to have the perspective of someone who can actually experience the topic being discussed.By and large, these are the musings of one of the most rational, forward-thinking, introspective, and compassionate minds of our generation.

“The hard-liners on each side encourage one another. They owe their credibility and their power to one another. They need one another. They are locked in a deadly embrace.”
Dr. Carl Sagan wrote this in a piece dual-published by prominent magazines in the United States and the then Soviet Union. But it could just as easily describe the current toxicity of American politics, any given regional feud, or even big-box stores competing for sales on a day purportedly dedicated to thanksgiving. The above quote is just one of dozens I underlined, starred, or wrote notes next to in my now beloved copy of Billions and Billions.As with similar books I’ve read by Dr. Sagan, or other scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson, this is more a collection than a single work. It is at once marvelous and troubling to see how relevant this book remains, published in 1997 in the wake of Carl’s death, and including material written during the final stages of the Cold War. Trends come and go. Wisdom proves itself with a longer shelf life. For devotees of Sagan, this book is a must read. It includes highly personal reflections about the illness that was beginning to take his life. Especially in Part III, “Where Hearts and Minds Collide”, it contains some of his most impassioned and courageous statements. I admire the way he takes everyone to task, including scientists. Within the scientific discourse, transcending the facts and figures, can be found Sagan’s deep love for our species, and his abiding hope that we can grow up, can survive, and can improve. A great deal of the material is highly inspirational, but mingled with some healthy scolding of our favored institutions and ourselves. I maintain that the best place to begin an exploration of Carl Sagan’s work is through his TV series Cosmos. However, Billions and Billions is not to be missed. It contains many treasures for the thoughtful reader."
250,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6000443-j-p,5,"I bought this book on a whim because I found a cheap, decent & used copy for a price I couldn't pass up. I've gotten more than my money's worth for this one. It's a great book & demonstrates how thoughtful Sagan was. I remember Bill Nye growing up but definitely wished I had been exposed to Carl Sagan as well. It's his memoirs written a little before his death. His thoughts on important issues such as Global Warming (Climate Change), our history as a species, our growth as a species & where we should be headed are thought provoking. It also is a little sad to see how little progress we've made on certain issues, specifically Global Warming (Climate Change), especially with how simply he demonstrates what the problem behind it is. We as a species can not afford to be stubborn. I'm glad I got this book & will likely dig into some of his other work as well. Because I've watched the ""Cosmos"" series, it wasn't hard to imagine the written words in his voice. Awesome book! Wish we had more careful, thoughtful people such as he.""Nature does not always conform to our predispositions & preferences, to what we deem comfortable & easy to understand."" - Carl Sagan, Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life & Death at the Brink of the Milliennium""The world is so exquisite, with so much love & moral depth, that there is no reason to decieve ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence.

251,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5118691-eva,3,"A collection of essays written by Sagan just before he (spoiler alert) died. Some quotes:On the shrimp in a little glass ecosphere:""All I have to do is make sure that they're not in too much light or too long in the dark and that they're always at temperatures between 40 degrees and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. (Above that, I guess, they make a bisque and not an ecosystem.)""On the need for abortion to spare amother's life:""Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, opposed even this exception: 'If they become tired or even die through bearing children, that does not matter. Let them die through fruitfulness--that is why they are there.'""""Neither St. Augustine or St. Thomas Aquinas considered early-term abortion to be homicide (the latter on the grounds that the embryo doesn't look human). This view was embraced by the Church in the Council of Vienne in 1312, and has never been repudiated. The Catholic Church's first and long-standing collection of canon law (according to the leading historian of the Church's teaching on abortion, John Connery, S.J.) help that abortion was homicide only after the fetus was already 'formed'--roughly, the end of the first trimester.""But when sperm cells were examined in the seventeenth century by the first microscopes, they were thought to show a fully formed human being. An old idea of the homunculus was resuscitated [= sperm contains a full-formed human]. In part through this misinterpretation of scientific data, in 1869 abortion at any time for any reason became grounds for excommunication. It is surprising to most Catholics and others to discover tat the date was not much earlier."""
252,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47975-robu-sensei,3,"Carl Sagan's last book, finished shortly before his death, is an interesting and, at times, curious work. Dr. Sagan starts out a bit off form: the first third or so of the book is rather lacking in his signature eloquence, and he makes a couple of uncharacteristic errors. In the chapter ""Monday-night Hunters,"" for example, he overextends our knowledge of the evolution of behavior in making sweeping, unsupported conclusions about our (and here, by ""our"", I mean ""society's"", and not my own) love of violent sports. However, after a couple of rough patches warming up, he finds his voice and delivers several delightful essays on politics, religion and science. In my favorite chapter, he describes an inspirational alliance between the latter two in defense of the environment. (And indeed, one surprising modern-day pro-environment group in America is evangelical Christians.) Another exceptionally powerful read is ""The Rules of the Game"", on the Golden Rule and variations thereon: the Silver Rule (""Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you""), governing the nonviolent resistance movements of Gandhi and King, and the Brass or Tit-for-Tat Rule (""Do unto others as they do unto you""), a heartless but highly effective way of dealing with others who do not have your best interests at heart. The closing chapter, about Dr. Sagan's losing battle with cancer, is a poignant reminder of our frailty and morality. R.I.P. Carl Sagan—you've been an inspiration to an untold number of budding scientists and freethinkers."
253,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"So much beauty, love and rationality originated from Carl Sagan. In this last book of his, he continued to promote science, sustainability and peace. I did really enjoy his thoughts on abortion and rules of morality such as: golden, silver, iron, brazen, bully, nepotism, kin selection rules..In the final chapter in audio version, the departure of Carl from this world was relived and read by his wife Ann. It left a poignant sense of life&death for me to think and feel."
254,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1607959-melissa,4,"One of Sagan's best nonfiction works (and his last before his death.) The title of the book does not do justice to the topics he explores, but his main theme centers around global synergy and cooperation to solve the ills of modern society: ozone depletion, global warming, population control, economic parity, etc. The two chapters on the ozone and global warming are the BEST scientific yet approachable renditions on the topics and can be read out of context of the rest of the book for great education. He also officers scientific qualification for when abortion should be illegal: the one human characteristic that differentiates us from all other animals is our ability to think (i.e., brain function). He posits that abortion should be illegal once the fetus develops regular brain wave patterns (around 6-7 mos). This was an intersting departure from the mainstream thought. So many other topics abound in this book that really make you think, but sometimes Sagan gets bogged down in his own intellect. He clearly championed so many ideas ahead of his time (cooperation between communist Soviets and capialist Americans, global treaties on CFC bans, etc.) and used his intellect and notoriety to educate the public. "
255,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63497622-ioana-ioana,0,"Passionately optimistic Carl Sagan delivers his outlook on human nature - the same human nature seems to be unforgiving to the very greedy creatures that possess it and to the frail ecosistem that encases it.Whatever doubt I might have had that some parts were, by now, severely outdated, quickly vanished as only hours after leaving the book aside an article from Nature appeared out of the blue on my newsfeed- it was about the surprising discovery that the CFC11 emissions were on the rise, despite the good old Montreal protocol of 1987.And Sagan seemed to be so chripy and confident about how nations came together in order to solve a global problem.We still have difficulties transporting Ebola vaccines to the ”third world” countries, the scientist are still tackling the cumbersome task of unpacking global warming to the masses, fertility is still in decline in the U.S., the nukes are less but still there.I want to believe, just like the author does, that this global death drive can be surpassed by enlightened wisdom.

I was wrong. Billions and Billions, although a softer edged, more humanistic book was still a life-changing read. Loaded with wisdom, wonder, and more critique on critical thinking, I found this last effort by Sagan, to be his most heart-warming. The death of Carl Sagan is a huge loss to the human race. His rare combination of scientific rigor, atheism, and spiritual enlightenment had given me a new outlook on God, Humanity, and myself. It is my firm belief that these two books should be required reading for every high school senior. He is a natural teacher and a permanent student. Humility and genius rarely go hand-in-hand. Carl Sagan's message, the theme of these two books, are the most important message about life on our shared planet since The Sermon on the Mount. "

269,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Final thoughtsPublished not long after his death, this--Sagan's last book--is a collection of essays on a variety of subjects having in common a palpable urgency traceable to both the state of the planet and the state of Sagan's health, both perceived as perilous. Besides Sagan's distinctive blend of stark optimism and stern alarm, and his splendid rationality, one is struck by a kind of anger in his tone, as though he has grown impatient with the stupidities of humankind. Thus one reads in the essay on abortion these bitter words: ""There is no right to life in any society on Earth today... We raise farm animals for slaughter; destroy forests; pollute rivers and lakes until no fish can live there; kill deer and elk for sport, leopards for their pelts, and whales for fertilizer; entrap dolphins, gasping and writhing, in great tuna nets; club seal pups to death... What is (allegedly) protected is not life, but  life."" (p. 166)What he is against in these essays, as his widow, Ann Druyan, notes in her Epilogue on page 228, are ""the forces of superstition and fundamentalism."" Sagan is preeminently the champion of education and reason as the means to better our life, and the implacable enemy of ignorance. (For ""superstition and fundamentalism,"" read ""ignorance,"" plain and simple.) In some respects this book is a continuation of his volume from the year before, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, but the emphasis here is on the problems confronting us and what can be done about them. In particular, Sagan confronts the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, pollution, the threat of nuclear war, overpopulation, etc. He asks the question (the title of Part II), ""What Are Conservatives Conserving?"" and gives the answer, their short-sighted bottom line. His arguments are ingenious and interesting to read as one observes how hard he is working to persuade us to take care of ourselves and our planet home. He compares the warnings of modern science with those of Cassandra who had the gift of prophesy but the curse of never being believed, science becoming in this sense both Cassandra and the Oracle at Delphi, misunderstood and misinterpreted by our policy makers, whom he likens to Croesus, the rich king who salivated at the prospect of a mighty empire being destroyed only to find that it was his own. As Pogo observed, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" One senses too that Sagan is projecting his concern that he himself is in danger of becoming a Cassandra.Certainly, in reading this book, one senses the personality of Carl Sagan come to life. His wide knowledge as a scientist, and his influence as a public spokesperson for science and for the environment and for all the life on this planet, are manifest. His tendency to preach and guide, his absolute desire to use his celebrity for the common good (and to scold) are evident. He mingles hope with despair; he loves humankind, yet despises what humankind does. He sees our capacity to love and help one another as our saving grace, but cannot help but recall and recount the horrors we have visited upon one another and on our fellow creatures. He sees the planet as one, as Gaia (although he does not use that word) with its organisms cooperating with one another for mutual survival. He writes, ""The inclination to cooperate has been painfully extracted through the evolutionary process. Those organisms that did not cooperate, that did not work with one another, died. Cooperation is encoded in the survivors' genes."" (p. 67) (Incidentally, this is a clear statement for the idea of group selection in evolution. Dawkins, et al., take note.) His writing reveals a man who always tried to do his best, and was perhaps his own sternest critic. He recalls for all of us, ""wincing recollections of past faux pas"" in the chapter on the environment where he tries to persuade us to take a stance ""Somewhere between cheerful dolts and nervous worrywarts..."" (p. 75)I hear the man and identify with his concerns, and I know myself that I cannot make up my mind on whether to be cheerful about our prospects or to despair. I ""solve"" this problem by realizing that all species eventually go extinct, and that somebody or something ""better"" than us might follow, or to understand that we are just a tiny phase in the cosmic process of Becoming.More to the point, I would hope to be just one fraction as worthwhile to my fellow humans as was, and is, and will continue to be, Carl Sagan, a brilliant man of great humanity who is sorely missed. To read him is to experience the best of humanity. He, like science, is a candle in the dark. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is"

276,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66171578-matt-hertel,4,"Sagan's final book reflects on the things that many of us consider when we know our lives are near their end. The text is both a heartwarming reminder of the eloquent prose that Sagan is capable of, as well as his capacity for addressing some of the most profound questions that humanity must ask itself as we continue to move into the future. Billions and Billions ended up taking a longer period of time for me to read, due to a number of life events getting in the way, but I was able to pick it up after a break and easily climb back into the narrative. I was very happy with the book overall and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sagan or wishes to explore his viewpoints on the topics covered in the book.The book covers a number of topics, and approaches fundamental questions about mortality, morality, and the human experience. Sagan reflects on the awesome scale and possibilities of the universe around us in the first part of the book, probes the reasoning and justification behind a number of social questions in the second part of the book, and digs into some very sensitive subjects and provides profound advice for living a good life in the final part of the book. The text covers an amazing amount of ground, from investigating the justification and practice of abortion, to the question of whether intelligent life exists outside our own planet. Sagan is perhaps the only author that can handle such a variety and differing scale of questions without missing a beat. Sagan's classic conversational style is present, and is refined at this point in his career. The book is an excellent demonstration of work that is approachable without sacrificing academic depth. His dictation is as calm and reasoned as it always has been; I like to imagine him reading the text in an armchair in front of a flickering fireplace, calmly explaining the universe to those of us who are prepared to listen.Sagan's personal story is entwined into the narrative, which both grounds the text in real experience and provides an emotional thread that left me with a lump in my throat and a sense of respect for his enduring perspective and the strength of his family as his life came to an end, near the end of the text. The final chapter is written by his wife, as she reflects on his impact and life of work spent answering questions that have proved to be difficult to approach, even today. It speaks to the gravity of the topics discussed, that we still struggle with many of these in our modern society. Perhaps if we still had Sagan with us, he would be able to help us to further deconstruct these complex questions, but I suspect that him being forced to consider his mortality somehow allowed him to see some of these topics more clearly.The discussion is notably apolitical, something which is both refreshing and discouraging considering how our current politically charged social climate has only gotten more extreme with time. Sagan was interested in finding the truth of the matter, even with questions that many would gladly accept some more comforting narrative as opposed to a more sober, realistic understanding.Considering that Sagan's legacy can be measured by the effect on our modern culture, it is clear that he lives on through his thoughtful words and positions. His cutting observations will shape our dialog for years to come, as a man of his intellect and social statue deserves. We miss you Carl, thank you for all you have done for us."

While some chapters are outdated such as the ones on the ozone layer or on climate change, Carl Sagan's clear writing represents an important voice when fighting mysticism and deep-rooted beliefs with science. Being the last book he ever wrote, it carries that much more weight as each word represents the final thoughts of one of the great thinkers of the 20th century. One of those books I wish I had read earlier in life. "

It’s always good to have the perspective of someone who can actually experience the topic being discussed.By and large, these are the musings of one of the most rational, forward-thinking, introspective, and compassionate minds of our generation. He’s written other books, all of which I liked, but this is the one that I loved."

“The hard-liners on each side encourage one another. They owe their credibility and their power to one another. They need one another. They are locked in a deadly embrace.”
Dr. Carl Sagan wrote this in a piece dual-published by prominent magazines in the United States and the then Soviet Union. But it could just as easily describe the current toxicity of American politics, any given regional feud, or even big-box stores competing for sales on a day purportedly dedicated to thanksgiving. The above quote is just one of dozens I underlined, starred, or wrote notes next to in my now beloved copy of Billions and Billions.As with similar books I’ve read by Dr. Sagan, or other scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson, this is more a collection than a single work. It is at once marvelous and troubling to see how relevant this book remains, published in 1997 in the wake of Carl’s death, and including material written during the final stages of the Cold War. Trends come and go. Wisdom proves itself with a longer shelf life. For devotees of Sagan, this book is a must read. It includes highly personal reflections about the illness that was beginning to take his life. Especially in Part III, “Where Hearts and Minds Collide”, it contains some of his most impassioned and courageous statements. I admire the way he takes everyone to task, including scientists. Within the scientific discourse, transcending the facts and figures, can be found Sagan’s deep love for our species, and his abiding hope that we can grow up, can survive, and can improve. A great deal of the material is highly inspirational, but mingled with some healthy scolding of our favored institutions and ourselves. I maintain that the best place to begin an exploration of Carl Sagan’s work is through his TV series Cosmos. However, Billions and Billions is not to be missed. It contains many treasures for the thoughtful reader."
280,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6000443-j-p,5,"I bought this book on a whim because I found a cheap, decent & used copy for a price I couldn't pass up. I've gotten more than my money's worth for this one. It's a great book & demonstrates how thoughtful Sagan was. I remember Bill Nye growing up but definitely wished I had been exposed to Carl Sagan as well. It's his memoirs written a little before his death. His thoughts on important issues such as Global Warming (Climate Change), our history as a species, our growth as a species & where we should be headed are thought provoking. It also is a little sad to see how little progress we've made on certain issues, specifically Global Warming (Climate Change), especially with how simply he demonstrates what the problem behind it is. We as a species can not afford to be stubborn. I'm glad I got this book & will likely dig into some of his other work as well. Because I've watched the ""Cosmos"" series, it wasn't hard to imagine the written words in his voice. Awesome book! Wish we had more careful, thoughtful people such as he.""Nature does not always conform to our predispositions & preferences, to what we deem comfortable & easy to understand."" - Carl Sagan, Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life & Death at the Brink of the Milliennium""The world is so exquisite, with so much love & moral depth, that there is no reason to decieve ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far batter, it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look Death in the eye & to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides."" - Carl Sagan, Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life & Death at the Brink of the Milliennium"
281,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5118691-eva,3,"A collection of essays written by Sagan just before he (spoiler alert) died. Some quotes:On the shrimp in a little glass ecosphere:""All I have to do is make sure that they're not in too much light or too long in the dark and that they're always at temperatures between 40 degrees and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. (Above that, I guess, they make a bisque and not an ecosystem.)""On the need for abortion to spare amother's life:""Martin Luther, the founder of Protestantism, opposed even this exception: 'If they become tired or even die through bearing children, that does not matter. Let them die through fruitfulness--that is why they are there.'""""Neither St. Augustine or St. Thomas Aquinas considered early-term abortion to be homicide (the latter on the grounds that the embryo doesn't look human). This view was embraced by the Church in the Council of Vienne in 1312, and has never been repudiated. The Catholic Church's first and long-standing collection of canon law (according to the leading historian of the Church's teaching on abortion, John Connery, S.J.) help that abortion was homicide only after the fetus was already 'formed'--roughly, the end of the first trimester.""But when sperm cells were examined in the seventeenth century by the first microscopes, they were thought to show a fully formed human being. An old idea of the homunculus was resuscitated [= sperm contains a full-formed human]. In part through this misinterpretation of scientific data, in 1869 abortion at any time for any reason became grounds for excommunication. It is surprising to most Catholics and others to discover tat the date was not much earlier."""
282,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47975-robu-sensei,3,"Carl Sagan's last book, finished shortly before his death, is an interesting and, at times, curious work. Dr. Sagan starts out a bit off form: the first third or so of the book is rather lacking in his signature eloquence, and he makes a couple of uncharacteristic errors. In the chapter ""Monday-night Hunters,"" for example, he overextends our knowledge of the evolution of behavior in making sweeping, unsupported conclusions about our (and here, by ""our"", I mean ""society's"", and not my own) love of violent sports. However, after a couple of rough patches warming up, he finds his voice and delivers several delightful essays on politics, religion and science. In my favorite chapter, he describes an inspirational alliance between the latter two in defense of the environment. (And indeed, one surprising modern-day pro-environment group in America is evangelical Christians.) Another exceptionally powerful read is ""The Rules of the Game"", on the Golden Rule and variations thereon: the Silver Rule (""Do not unto others what you would not have them do unto you""), governing the nonviolent resistance movements of Gandhi and King, and the Brass or Tit-for-Tat Rule (""Do unto others as they do unto you""), a heartless but highly effective way of dealing with others who do not have your best interests at heart. The closing chapter, about Dr. Sagan's losing battle with cancer, is a poignant reminder of our frailty and morality. R.I.P. Carl Sagan—you've been an inspiration to an untold number of budding scientists and freethinkers."
283,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"So much beauty, love and rationality originated from Carl Sagan. In this last book of his, he continued to promote science, sustainability and peace. I did really enjoy his thoughts on abortion and rules of morality such as: golden, silver, iron, brazen, bully, nepotism, kin selection rules..In the final chapter in audio version, the departure of Carl from this world was relived and read by his wife Ann. It left a poignant sense of life&death for me to think and feel."
284,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1607959-melissa,4,"One of Sagan's best nonfiction works (and his last before his death.) The title of the book does not do justice to the topics he explores, but his main theme centers around global synergy and cooperation to solve the ills of modern society: ozone depletion, global warming, population control, economic parity, etc. The two chapters on the ozone and global warming are the BEST scientific yet approachable renditions on the topics and can be read out of context of the rest of the book for great education. He also officers scientific qualification for when abortion should be illegal: the one human characteristic that differentiates us from all other animals is our ability to think (i.e., brain function). He posits that abortion should be illegal once the fetus develops regular brain wave patterns (around 6-7 mos). This was an intersting departure from the mainstream thought. So many other topics abound in this book that really make you think, but sometimes Sagan gets bogged down in his own intellect. He clearly championed so many ideas ahead of his time (cooperation between communist Soviets and capialist Americans, global treaties on CFC bans, etc.) and used his intellect and notoriety to educate the public. "
285,0345379187,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63497622-ioana-ioana,0,"Passionately optimistic Carl Sagan delivers his outlook on human nature - the same human nature seems to be unforgiving to the very greedy creatures that possess it and to the frail ecosistem that encases it.Whatever doubt I might have had that some parts were, by now, severely outdated, quickly vanished as only hours after leaving the book aside an article from Nature appeared out of the blue on my newsfeed- it was about the surprising discovery that the CFC11 emissions were on the rise, despite the good old Montreal protocol of 1987.And Sagan seemed to be so chripy and confident about how nations came together in order to solve a global problem.We still have difficulties transporting Ebola vaccines to the ”third world” countries, the scientist are still tackling the cumbersome task of unpacking global warming to the masses, fertility is still in decline in the U.S., the nukes are less but still there.I want to believe, just like the author does, that this global death drive can be surpassed by enlightened wisdom.

I was wrong. Billions and Billions, although a softer edged, more humanistic book was still a life-changing read. Loaded with wisdom, wonder, and more critique on critical thinking, I found this last effort by Sagan, to be his most heart-warming. The death of Carl Sagan is a huge loss to the human race. His rare combination of scientific rigor, atheism, and spiritual enlightenment had given me a new outlook on God, Humanity, and myself. It is my firm belief that these two books should be required reading for every high school senior. He is a natural teacher and a permanent student. Humility and genius rarely go hand-in-hand. Carl Sagan's message, the theme of these two books, are the most important message about life on our shared planet since The Sermon on the Mount. "

I would have enjoyed Billions much more had I read it closer to when it was released (1997), as opposed to 12 years after Sagan's death. Many of the chapters comprising Billions were written in the 80s and are dated now. There were still some good parts, and obviously the more cosmic ""big picture"" stuff isn't much effected by 10-20 years. In fact, some of Sagan's worries and predictions from the 80s and 90s are coming true now. The chapters I liked best were: ""Billions and Billions,"" ""Monday Night Hunters,"" ""The Environment: Where Does Prudence Lie?"" ""Ambush: The Warming of the World,"" ""Abortion..."" and ""Gettysburg and Now."""

His words come through clear and precise, and I could hear his voice in my head, reintroducing me to all the things that he held dear, or that concerned him, or that he just found interesting.And he found so much interesting, far too much to be covered in just one book. History, astronomy, physics, the environment, religion. These are only a few of the subjects to which he lends his remarkable intellect here.But though it was his last, this book is a good start for anyone who never had the pleasure of seeing him on Cosmos (do those people actually exist?) or who have never read any part of his prodigious work."

In general, they are not only thoughts, but information - I can honestly say I'd never really understood the ozone and global warming issues til now, for instance.I recommend this book to anyone who would be looking for some real facts based opinions on a few of the issues we're currently facing in our everyday lifes."

He sees our capacity to love and help one another as our saving grace, but cannot help but recall and recount the horrors we have visited upon one another and on our fellow creatures. He sees the planet as one, as Gaia (although he does not use that word) with its organisms cooperating with one another for mutual survival. He writes, ""The inclination to cooperate has been painfully extracted through the evolutionary process. Those organisms that did not cooperate, that did not work with one another, died. Cooperation is encoded in the survivors' genes."" (p. 67) (Incidentally, this is a clear statement for the idea of group selection in evolution. Dawkins, et al., take note.) His writing reveals a man who always tried to do his best, and was perhaps his own sternest critic. He recalls for all of us, ""wincing recollections of past faux pas"" in the chapter on the environment where he tries to persuade us to take a stance ""Somewhere between cheerful dolts and nervous worrywarts..."" (p. 75)I hear the man and identify with his concerns, and I know myself that I cannot make up my mind on whether to be cheerful about our prospects or to despair. I ""solve"" this problem by realizing that all species eventually go extinct, and that somebody or something ""better"" than us might follow, or to understand that we are just a tiny phase in the cosmic process of Becoming.More to the point, I would hope to be just one fraction as worthwhile to my fellow humans as was, and is, and will continue to be, Carl Sagan, a brilliant man of great humanity who is sorely missed. To read him is to experience the best of humanity. He, like science, is a candle in the dark. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is"
