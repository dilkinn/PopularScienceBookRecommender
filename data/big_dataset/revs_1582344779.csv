0,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616703-mike,1,"This book is not about rats. I learned a few things about them (they can collapse their bodies and can squeeze through any hole as big as their heads; they can take cats in a fight), but this book was mostly about the author's life and interviews of all sorts of terminally dull people intimately or slightly connected to rats. He made extermination boring (impossible!). The author himself was kind of a wuss when it came to both rats (understandable) and his interview subjects (deplorable in a journalist). His investigation of rats was limited to watching them from a chair outside an alley, and I swear an entire chapter was devoted to him trying but failing to gain a private audience with America's foremost rat expert at a rat convention. My search for the perfect rat resource skitters greasily on."
1,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419287-jessica,3,"Yesterday when I came out of my building, I was confronted by a giant rat standing at the bottom of the steps, looking up at me. Yeah, right at me. It was still light out, and the thing just stood there stolidly gazing up, unafraid, just, yeah, looking at me! See, my front yard is infested with large, fearless rats. They live in a hole in the dirt and frolic in the garbage. The hole's recently been plugged up, but the rats don't seem to care; as this book reminds us, they're adaptable animals. I've sat on my stoop on a fine spring day, watching the big rats romp in the yard, climbing into bags of trash and writhing joyously around inside, like the cartoon rat Templeton in that memorable fair scene in the Charlotte's Web movie.Anyway, this rat yesterday clearly wanted something, and I took its keenly intimidating, beady-eyed stare to mean that it was telling me that I'd better review this book. Since I'm currently on the bus to Philadelphia (INTERNET! On the BUS! I'm like a RAT in a FILTHY REEKING GARBAGE BAG!!!), there's no time like the present.Okay, so when I was in the first grade, my across-the-street frenemy Lindsay Kagawa had a pet rat named Twinkie. Twinkie was what this book taught me is called a ""fancy rat."" She was little and delicate and black and white, and she lived in a cage in Lindsay's room. Lindsay and I both loved her rat, and we'd write letters to one another every day, letters that featured drawings of Twinkie engaged in a number of activities (e.g., getting married, doing ballet, holding balloons), letters that were hand delivered into mailboxes and adorned with pencil-drawn stamps featuring portraits of -- who else? -- Twinkie the rat.In the ninth grade, my friend Isabel Douglass had a fancy rat of her own, named Selene (she also had a zine called Selene, after the rat). Isabel was a forward-thinking young lady, and as you might guess based on the silk-screened ""Rent is Theft"" tee shirt she wore every day, Selene had no cage, living instead on Isabel's very lovely, if not totally cleanly, person. I remember this being an issue when we'd go eat hot and sour soup at Long Life Veggie House, because restaurant people tended to become upset when Selene poked out, so it was a constant struggle for Isabel to keep her fancy rat concealed at these times. I think Selene eventually ran away from home (as Isabel herself had) to join her gutterpunk rat boyfriend who lived in a sewer. She was replaced by another pet rat -- I want to say Travis? -- but I'm not sure what happened to him. I think he eventually ran off too, to help build up the rat population of Berkeley. If rats don't have cages, they tend to run off. Also, rats are very sensual creatures, according to this book, anyway. Those rats have needs!Anyway, at the time I looked upon both Twinkie and Selene as adorable little comrades, much to the horror and revulsion of my mother, a woman born and bred -- not incidentally -- on the island of Manhattan. My mother was thoroughly disgusted by the idea of rats as pets, and her hatred of rodents was something I never understood, either as a naive and anthropomorphizing child, or as an annoying anti-anthrocentric teenager. ""Rats are cute, mom!"" I said. ""Rabbits are rodents. What makes rats grosser than rabbits? It doesn't make any sense why you hate them so much!""""Ugh,"" she shuddered, and I rolled my eyes.Then I moved to New York.... and now I get it. Well, I do and I don't. The sight and even the thought of rats is now one of the most disgusting things that I can imagine. When I see them running in the subway tracks or down the street, I watch, transfixed, but I'm also nauseated and repulsed. There is just something so -- revolting, so disturbing about these creatures. Vermin! Ugh!! The larger they are, the more disgusting and scary; the closer they get, the more horrifying, and the idea of large numbers of rats, of bands and tribes, of rats en masse, swarming and scurrying.... UGHH!! Every night when I come home I cross the front yard gingerly, terrified I'll step on one of them. To me rats now represent danger and disease, but there is something more there, deep seated and primal, something Jungian about my feelings towards them that I don't understand. Yeah, rats are gross -- they are filthy animals, they do eat garbage, they do live in sewers, they do bite people, they spread the plague and other diseases (a public health expert in this book calls them ""germ elevators"") -- but their repulsiveness still seems like more than the sum of their parts. I was hoping this book would explain this to me, or even better, that it would demystify my fear and loathing of the rat. I hoped that I could go back to the days of Twinkie and Selene and become, if not open to having them crawl all over my body, at least more comfortable sharing my space with these creatures who are, quite clearly, not going anywhere anytime soon.But this book didn't do that. Let's be clear: Rats is a good book, and I learned a lot from it and found it thoroughly enjoyable. But precisely because it was good, I hold it to a higher standard, and I really think Rats needed one more serious, tough, grueling revision in order to become truly great and do some transcendent form of justice to its fascinating subject. Still, it's a worthwhile read, and contains some great New York City history, as well as interesting information about rats.The premise of the book is that the author decides to spend a year watching rats in an alley in lower Manhattan, while also hanging out with exterminators and researching the history of tenant activism, bubonic plague, Revolutionary War-era Manhattan, and other kinds of obviously and not-so-obviously rat-related information. One thing I loved about this was that both alleys where Sullivan does his rat watching were right around the corner from my office, so I got to check out the locations he was discussing (though I didn't go at night, which is prime rat-watching time). My excitement about the neighborhood sort of made it okay that his rat watching didn't ultimately seem to have much of a point.Sullivan's book isn't bad, but a lot stuff in here, like the rat watching, is interesting but never seems to go anywhere. I did get annoyed because he started with this sort of Transcendentalist, naturalist conceit about his rat-watching, which would've been great except it took him way too long to get over the silliness or oddness of his project. He should've just thrown himself into it and been like, ""I am Thoreau, and this alley is my Walden,"" but he compromises that idea when halfway through the book he's still exclaiming, ""OMG! I can't believe I'm watching rats, this is so crazy!"" I know this seems like a minor complaint, but I wanted him to take it seriously from the beginning, and stop congratulating himself for the quirkiness of his idea. Sullivan does eventually give himself over to his topic, but for me it took him a little too long to do it, and once he got there, he didn't quite go far enough in pulling it all together. I think he was trying to say that people are really a lot like rats, but he didn't make that explicit enough, in a way that explained or illuminated our animosity towards them. He came really close, and started to get there at several points, especially at the end, but the book never quite came together and changed the way I thought about rats in a profound way. That's why I say this book needed one more thorough revision to go from great to good -- the elements were all there, but it didn't ever come together as amazingly as I wanted it to.It did, however, make me think quite a lot about rats, something that's really been a problem because I've recently been running a lot, and seeing things move out of the corner of my eye has led to a lot of embarrassing screeching and sideways leaps into the air (it's always turned out to be a bird or a plastic bag -- knock wood). Rats were always on my mind while I was reading this, and I'm definitely more conscious now of their presence all around me, at all times -- ugh. I've always been grossed out by the heaps of garbage coating New York, especially during the summer, and I'm now even more disturbed by them. Gross! When we surround ourselves with garbage, we get the rats that we deserve....Living in New York does make me feel like a rat, especially when I'm riding the train at rush hour. For years, that old Fear line about ""rats in our cage"" has scurried through my brain as I swarm out through the station and cram myself into packed cars. The problem with this book was that it validated this feeling without adding much to it. There are a few great moments -- as when, at the beginning, Sullivan compares the efficiency of a rat poison bait station to fast food restaurants -- but not much that's revelatory. Still, if you're interested in vermin or in New York City social history, I do recommend reading this book. It took me awhile to get through because I like to read while I'm eating, and that just wasn't an option here.... still, it was great on the subway. Rats is, despite my whining, enjoyable, informative, and not a waste of time at all."
2,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/646347-chris,5,"This book was -- and I am choosing this word carefully, given the title -- delightful. Yes, it's about rats, and not cute rats that become pets. Robert Sullivan writes about the big brown rats with scary teeth that live in the alleys and sewers and garbage of New York City. It is spectacularly interesting, sometimes very funny, and, at times, deeply moving. "
3,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,1,"I found this book both frustrating and pointless. While there were a handful of interesting factoids and anecdotes, I learned next to nothing about rats. About half of the book is him saying ""I was getting ready to go look at rats"" and the last half is his extremely superficial observations of rats in an alley. (They like to eat! They run along walls! He can maybe, MAYBE, recognize a single rat after months and months of observations!) There is a weird part where he gives up on any effort at narrative consistency and just includes a bullet point list of things he did once in Milwaukee. The flow is really disjointed. The worst part of this book, though, is the insufferably pretentious writing style of the author, which periodically builds to a fever pitch. At one point he offers what is purportedly excerpts from the diary he kept while sitting in the alley. Within one hour, he has quoted Confucius, Milton, and a Latin aphorism, all to make weak jokes about rats. It took a supreme effort of will to read past that section without my head exploding in incredulity. It's pretty obvious that the author has some weird inferiority complex regarding writing about such a ""low"" topic and that he's compensating with overblown efforts to show he's ""above"" his subject. There are even cringeworthy sections where he describes himself justifying writing the book to people at cocktail parties. Dude, if you don't think your subject is inherently worthy, DON'T WRITE THE BOOK! The rats deserve better. The cover is the best part about this book, so drink that in and then move on."
4,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1103001-abigail-hilton,2,"This is a rambling and ultimately disappointing book. Rats as a microcosm of human history should make a fascinating study, but...they don't. At least, not here. The author seems unable to decide what his book is really about. Is it about his daily observations of rats in an alley in New York? Is it about New York City itself with rats as a vehicle and focal point? Is it about human history in relation to rats? The author jumps randomly between these lines of thought, giving none of them serious attention. One would think that any of these three subjects could fill 220 pages, but instead, the book contains lots of padding - completely unrelated blow-by-blow descriptions of Sullivan's jaunts to various marginally rat-related places and people.An excerpt:""I was able to stop in the middle of Union Station and lean back against a wall and watch people as they streamed in and out of train-track exits and entrances, in and out of exits to Chicago's streets, of the entrance and exits to a restaurant also marked with signs indicating areas for ordering food to go versus to stay. I smelled food. I grabbed some."" Pages of this stuff, going nowhere, like a poor travel-writer describing his vacation.In addition, the author is at pains to tell us that he does not like rats and thinks they're disgusting. He exhibits a strange squeamishness, even after spending many hours watching rats. As someone who does feel a level of compassion and interest in rats as animals, I found his attitude tiresome. He seemed concerned that the audience might actually think he liked his subjects.If you're interested in rats, give this book a miss. If you're interested in minutia about New York City, you might find some jumping off points for further research."
5,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635851-natalie-kling,5,"Urban nature writing. While researching rats, Sullivan also tells the story of the social history of the New York alley he becomes a fixture in. He becomes this fixture so the rats become comfortable with him there and they go about their business of running through restaurant garbage every night. He also attends exterminator conventions in the mid-west and is given access to the World Trade Center after 9/11 to find the rats are doing well and fine among all the death and destruction.I found this book full of random and interesting information about rats and their place in this world. I was also entertained through the whole book and amazed that this guy's wife let him back in the house every night."
6,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978723-bethany,4,"What a weirdly enjoyable book.If I had to guess why this book was written, I’d say it was to shine light on the real settlers of NYC, the rats and pests that were long before people. Rats are surprisingly important to the city’s history as the author did a good job of explaining. They’re everywhere- in poor, rich, and middle class areas.The great equalizers, rats have played a role in the growth and death of many NYC neighborhoods and beyond. One of the most interesting parts of the book to me was the chapter on the garbage riots of the 1970s and how rats became an important pawn to the union strikers asking for fair wages. Rats were also used as weapons (literally) in the Harlem tenant strikes in the 1960s and helped lead the city towards safer and cleaner housing for immigrant families. There’s a lot of history interwoven in the authors narrative and I liked the way he painted a picture of rats as citizens of the city alongside humans.What I didn’t like was how he went overboard on romanticizing the rats. One of the last chapters is completely devoted to one rat, The Rat King, and the author watches him for days until one day he comes back and the big rat is dead. I’m glad that was one of the last chapters because it started making me question this man’s sanity. It was a really interesting book and it made me curious about the “old history” of New York City and where I live. To paraphrase the rat man, there’s a lot going on under your feet if you’re curious enough to look at it."
7,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33921897-kusaimamekirai,4,"  Rats are pretty gross. Not the pet rats you occasionally see in cages but full on wild, eating garbage, long tailed, with yellow teeth rats. The latter is the subject of Robert Sullivan’s eye opening book about the pest everyone loves to hate.  Sullivan, for reasons not particularly clear to himself, decides to spend four seasons in a New York City alley observing rats in their daily habitat.  Along the way he traces the history of the alley from tenant strikes in the 1960’s to the origins of the American Revolution. These historical vignettes are mostly fairly interesting but the book really shines when it focuses on the rats. For some reason, I share Sullivan’s fascination with universally despised but fascinating creatures. (for a good example of this I highly recommend Kelsi Nagy’s wonderful book “Trash Animals”) Rats in particular are tough (it took double the amount of anesthetic that would have killed a small cat to knock out a 12 inch rat), clever and remarkably adept at surviving and adapting. Rarely straying far from the radius of their nests for food and with seemingly distinct food preferences (apparently peanut butter is universally loved by them while the rats Sullivan observed were often seen fighting of discarded chicken pot pies). Rats are also notoriously difficult to trap in that they are highly sensitive to changes in their environment and are extremely cautious creatures. One such example made me chuckle a bit was some rats nests:“have been found stuffed with the gnawed shavings of the wood-based, spring-loaded snap traps that are used in attempts to kill them.” Yes, rats apparently have a sense of humor as well. Toward the end of the book, Sullivan observes that rats in fact, are not unlike human’s in many ways in that:“We are all a little like rats. We come and go. We are beaten down but we come back again. We live in colonies and we strike out on our own, or get forced out or starved out or are eaten up by our competition, by the biggest rats. We thrive in unlikely places, and devour…We are the rats whose population may boom, whose population may decline, who can survive where no other species could or would want to…With caution, we will flourish; without it we will not; we will starve and die and maybe kill each other, maybe not.” Upon reflection, it’s difficult to argue otherwise.  While Sullivan does go out of his way to emphasize that he doesn’t find rats to be cute or likable in any way, he does grudgingly respect our similarities. “We humans are always looking for a species to despise, especially since we can and do act so despicably ourselves. We shake our heads as rats overpopulate, fight over limited food supplies, and then go to war until the population is killed down, but then we proceed to follow the same battle plan.” In the end, what we hate about rats is perhaps what we secretly despise and admire about ourselves."
8,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73548608-helio,3,"I almost gave this book a DNF after two chapters but it was an easy read with sometimes interesting information peripherally related to rats. There were tidbits about the Bubonic Plague in China, the Battle of Golden Hill, squalor living conditions in San Francisco, mania for native plants in Germany, Audubon, Thoreau's Walden, poisons, when Extermintaors began to be called Pest Control Operators (in 1936), and estimates of rat populations in NewYork City.Sullivan, the author, suggests 250,000 is the reasonable estimate then goes on to mention an authority says there are a million rats on Riker Island. So Manhattan, some 400 time the size of Rikers has 1/4 the rats? I don't think so. Here is an article > https://www.google.com/amp/s/observer...Sullivan notes there are 250 businesses doing rat control in NYC, the largest having 100 employees. Let's say they all did = 25,000 employees, each dispatching a conservative one rat a day (say in a 400 day year) = ten million rats gone - they wouldn't be in business long if there were only 250,000 to deal with.Another thing that bothered me was that right near the beginning (page six) Sullivan advises he wasn't going to talk about fancy rats (pet rats and lab rats). Come-on-now a book about rats and he brings in antecdotes about China, history, Audubon, Walden, various legislations and he is going to leave out lab rats! I would have rather he spent his time comparing maze running times of white lab rats to black sewer rats than sitting in an alley watching rats burrow into garbage.Enough of rats I am moving onto lobsters. "
9,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/268166-miriam,4,"i started reading this book while i was working in the idaho desert without real barrier between myself and the surrounding environment (read:rodents)... after a few nights, i decided that the fact i was trying to avoid acknowledging the rats crawling on and around me as i tried to go to sleep wasn't the best time to be reading this book. this book acheives a laudable success in documenting the amazingly disgusting existence, habits and characteristics of rats, as it sets out to do, perhaps all too well. and the history presented is intriguing. i particularly love the scene, as i've explained to many, many people since reading it, about the underground rat fighting circuits staged in the back of seedy lower eastside taverns at the turn of the century. the image of men chasing and capturing rats in a makeshift ring, then with only their bare hands and bloody cheeks, breaking the rats' necks between their teeth can only be described as ""AWESOME!"" "
10,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798965-jenna-los,2,"Another great idea for a book that fell a bit flat. Sullivan spent a great deal of time sitting in an alley watching rats, but I don't think he really ""discovered"" all that much that wasn't already known. He mentions several scientists whose experiences would have been much more informative and interesting to read than this bit. For instance, one scientists takes rats off a street in Baltimore and then presents them with various bits of garbage to see which they prefer; Sullivan remarks that once the rats are in the garbage bags on his alley, he has no idea what they are doing and can only watch the bag ripple with their movements."
11,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2174497-suzanne,4,"I have two pet rats that I play with and watch endlessly, so I guess I could really identify with the author. They're such cunning, wily little guys. They were""rescued"" from a feeder pet store for snake food. Although mine are the so-called ""fancy"" rats, one is brown and the other is black and look much more like common sewer rats. That being said, I thought it was interesting how much rats have influenced and/or been part of the politics of NYC for many years. Nice, easy read and not too science-y- almost more of an autobiography with rat info thrown in. "

But I would have really loved to read some information from a real expert. I think reading the Wikipedia page would have covered more, to be honest."
13,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,4,"Rats by Robert Sullivan is a fascinating study of rats and their cohabitation with humans. One particularly interesting section was on rats and plague, which, as you may know, is spread to humans by the rat flea. Apparently the Japanese were the first to experiment with the use of plague as a biological weapon during WWII under the direction of General Shiro Ishii. He discovered that the best was to infect a city with plague was to fill clay bombs with infected fleas. An attack was successfully conducted against the Chinese city ofChangde. A clue that the outbreak was caused by humans rather than rats was that the rats began dying of plague weeks after the humans, a reverse of the normal situation.General Ishii also practiced vivisection on live humans. He was never tried for war crimes, apparently having made a deal with the Americans who got copies of his notes and papers which formed the basis for the early American attempts at creating biological weapons. He retired a respected medical man.The United States began experimenting with biological weapons in the early fifties and tested their weapon distribution methods on unsuspecting Americans. In one case, Navy planes sprayed the eastern Virginia coat with microbes similar to Anthrax but ""thought to be harmless,"" and as late as 1966, soldiers dressed in civilian clothes dropped light bulbs filled with the microbes on the tracks in New York subways in order to measure how the microbes dispersed -- all without the knowledge of the public or Congress."
14,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3361474-jennifer,3,"Much like its subject, Sullivan's Rats refuses to be boxed into a single category, preferring to dart back and forth between microhistory, natural history, and personal essay in a charmingly discursive loop. Sullivan's investigations into New York's least-loved inhabitants is part curiosity (an investigation into an Audubon painting of rats uncovers the artist's rat-hunting habits and spurs the author's own quest) and part opportunity (when in NYC...), and the desultory tone of this brief exploration (it tops out at 219 pages before endnotes) never really manages to impute any greater meaning to the venture than that, despite some half-hearted attempts to link the natures and fates of rats and men. Still, Rats is full of fascinating trivia and historical anecdote (rat fighting! Japanese bioweapons! the post 9/11 battle against rats!), if not a depth of scientific information regarding Rattus norvegicus.Sullivan isn't a naturalist, and readers looking for a deep exploration of the biology and habits of rodentia should take a hard pass on Rats, which they would likely find frustratingly incomplete. As a tourguide, however, Sullivan excels, leading the reader through the maze of New York's neighborhoods and introducing their rodent inhabitants, contextualizing each with small bits of history. Should you choose to take the author's bait, Rats offers an entertaining look at ourselves and our rodent neighbors."
15,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/354309-sean,2,"A good book with a great cover by Cooper Grad Peter Sis (also did the Whale seen on the new trains as part of the Arts for Transit program). Ah, if only everyone judged this book by its cover it would have done even better. Unfortunatelyl some smart people (unlike me) read reviews first. The author, a layman takes on studying rats in New York by repeatedly visiting an alley that I myself have previously reported to 311 for Rat issues. There are lots of strange tid bits of information but also lots of dead ends to his tirades. To publish a book the author has added chapters on Plagues and other grotesque things in other cities which don't directly play into his New York theme. This weakens the book and these chapters fall in at strange intervals. I feel the volume could have been published just as easily without them. He has a newer book on the Meadowlands. Although Rats left me a bit disappointed, and the afterword, more annoyed than anything, I'll pick it up mainly because of the subject and also because it doesn't require me to think. This is a good book for reading on a packed subway when you don't have to focus and keeps you from being disgusted by the uglies that surround you. "

The way the city’s geography, alcohol steeped underbelly and tenement past all had distinct rat relationships and were in turn shaped by the existence of the rat populations is awesome. While the overall tone was truly more of an ode to the rat, I was able to glean more about my new home and new epidemiologically relevant books to add to my to reading list not to mention a bunch of neat random facts to add to my trove."

The author talks about ""his"" rats, then jumps around to some other subject, often only tangentially connected to the supposed subject material.

I already know a bit about domestic rats, and like them, so wasn't as surprised (or disturbed) as other people might be, and have probably taken a different view of Sullivan's findings from his studies and experiments. While easy to read, I found this book badly written in some places, with facile descriptions of people and their conversations.

Out of morbid curiosity and the need for some inexpensive escapist airplane reading material, I decided to give this book a try. Face it, rats are disgusting disease ridden vermin so I recognize reading about them can evoke repulsion, fear, and disgust. But rather than focus exclusively on the urban rat life, the author weaves in stories of politics, architecture, labor unions, obscure historical figures, everyday people, and of course rodent control professionals.

They build nests with materials we recognize, plastics and paper, but in their world these things are shredded and filthy. Their world is rife with poison, disease, and sometimes even cannibalism. And where their world rubs up against ours, things turn violent. We have been waging war against rats for the whole of human history, but in his fascinating book Robert Sullivan focuses on one particularly bloody battleground: New York City. He tells us about his own personal observations of rats (he came night after night to watch the rats in one particularly rodent riddled alley) but also tells of many other epic events in history of rats, from the black death to the big garbage strike of 1968. And all of it is interesting."

The buyer of natural history books must be a hippy who smoked way too much Grass in the sixties. All the books have this ""tree hugging"" mentality towards animals. This book is no exception. Like the other books I've recently viewed, the author's observations are based on his own bias towards a particular animal without much fact or science to support it.And that would have been OK if he could have kept my attention. But he didn't. He was a boring hippy or whatever we call people who insist on anthropomorphizing animals."

27,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,3,"Robert Sullivan's ""Rats: Observations of the History & Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitants"" is an examination of rats and their interaction with humans - or the other way around. He spends a year studying one particular alley's rat population, speaks with rat experts of all kinds - people who have studied the species, and people who work to 'control' it; searches through writing on rats and their connection to things like the plague. While this book is labeled as natural history, I personally feel it's better called a history - of big city life in general, as well as a history of New York City in particular. If you're interested in the city, you might find more to love and engage with in 'Rats' than I did. Robert Sullivan writes in a chatty, casual voice which makes for a rather easily digested nonfiction read. In between more serious discussion on plague, increasing rat populations and rat problems as linked with bad housing situation, there's a humorous tone in Sullivan's honest reaction to the species, rats' likeness to humans, or even the interesting facts of rats themselves. The first fifty pages or so are mostly focused on rats as a normal natural history - their food, living, reproduction, and factors that have shaped how we view them. Then there's quite a large part of the book given to discussion surrounding the control of the species through talk with exterminators or pest control operators, trapping or chasing rats, basically dealing with rats through different means - how to get rid of rats, how to minimize their existence, and/or how to kill them. While I wouldn't say this part is less important than the first, I felt the book was too heavily focused on this latter discussion for my taste. I felt there was a missed opportunity of an examination of human's responsibility in the whole rat situation and really - adding a critical discussion of the garbage disposal in big cities like New York would've made this book better, and in my opinion, more valuable. Sullivan repeatedly touches on the garbage problem without really going into any depth, while there's chapter after chapter of the control of rats through poison, traps, etc. I had a few quibbles too with the way Sullivan writes, which basically bottles down to: too much extra information that bears no real importance to the main topic at hand. It's things like giving background information on a rat expert - where he went to school, what his family structure was like, or what kind of clothes an exterminator was wearing. If these details were directly linked to points in the book that would've been a different matter, for example if the clothes were of a specific kind to - let's say, camouflage when trapping a rat - that would've been fine. At least I couldn't see these kind of details' relevance to the book as a whole, and I found it mostly muddled the many interesting facts it actually did contain. It seemed mostly like such details were given as a tribute to each person who has been valuable within the area of rats studies and work - and while I can understand how an author would want to pay tribute to important actors within the area of study, it doesn't do much for the reader. On the whole this was a fun and interesting book with rats at its center but is also in many ways a history of New York City. If that sounds like something you're interested in, it might be worth checking out. "
28,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/168793-kid,2,"Rats is a bald ""book proposal"" project that never transcends the limitations of its genetics. We can imagine Sullivan telling his agent that he wants to spend a year watching rats in NYC while jotting down his thoughts and experiences. The agent sells the project with a phone call to Bloomsbury or something. Sullivan clearly approaches the project as a one year job - which is fine - we all gotta eat. But this could have been an incredible journey into an unknown and fascinating secret world - instead it's a dude who doesn't know shit about rats when he starts the project and at the end, knows a little more about rats and has managed to bore us with the story of how he acquired his limited knowledge. He even includes a chapter straight from his journal and then pads the tale with contemporary history from the time that the rattus norvegicus was introduced to the New World. . .I guess maybe in NYC - though I'm not convinced that anyone really knows. So it's kind of a crock. I think the book succeeds on the thin film of its premise - i.e. this was a book that needed to be written and was written in a passable way. He approaches a subject of which many of us have a morbid curiosity without rigor and without much of a point. He barely attempts to relieve us of our deep ignorance about the animal and chooses to hang brain with exterminators instead of scientists, who all tend to say the same shit about the rat. Like - OK - rats are smart. They have respect for them. What-the-fuck-ever.There are a few anecdotes of mild interest, some half-ass city history - some of which has NOTHING to do with rats. . .even though he's trying to tie the human experience into the experience of rats. Yes we're like rats. . .they are a mirror of sorts into the condition of our world. Quite poetic and pat in its way but super cheap. The ""rat race""? Have you ever heard of it? Oh shit. . .right. This book is overRATed. THAT was cheap of me but I bought this book so go to hell. "
29,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21672825-abigail,2,"I was disappointed in this book. If you're looking for a book about rats, this isn't it. In fact it's a little bit, what's the word... Schizophrenic? It's the story of a forgotten back alley in New York City, the story of a forgotten battle at the beginning of the American Revolution, the story of a forgotten organizer for better housing, a history of pest control and a look at the pest control industry and a nature treatise that is less about nature and more about flowery language and quotes by Emerson and Thoreau. The author spends a lot of time bragging (At least it felt that way to me) about spending a year observing rats in an alley, but honestly most of the book isn't really about his observations. It's about everyone else's and the way that rats have abstractly influenced things. The scientist in me got excited when the early chapters mention rat kings, and how there can be masses of rats whose tails are tangled together. I was like ""wow I want to know more about this."" But that is the only time it is mentioned in the book. (Not even the chapter titled ""Rat King"") mentions it.The most interesting sections didn't happen until toward the end of the book. They were the chapters covering the spread of the bubonic plague in the middle ages and the pest control measures that were taken after 9/11. The latter was particularly interesting because that's not something people really think about. But other than that, meh.I think this book had potential and maybe a certain type of person would find this interesting, but for me, it was mostly fluff. I didn't learn very much from reading this book and I felt like it focused less on rats and more on other things. Perhaps I should check out the book the author mentions by the ""rat expert."" It might be a little less disappointing."

While working with my computer, they would climb in the nearby pile of books. Sometimes a big one would pass right in front of me at my table, perhaps unaware that I'm just there right in front of him. So I read this book.It's not so much about rats, however, than about people who had been, or are, involved with rats. And since rats are known carriers of diseases, plagues were also discussed. Rats, the book said, have , the fear of the new. So what I did when I bought a rat trap [the kind that imprisons a rat uninjured:] was to place it first in one corner for many days, often putting food outside of it. The trick is to remove its newness to the rat. After that, I set it up, put freshly cooked peanuts inside and, bingo, got a very large black rat. Method of execution: pour boiling water upon the shrieking creature while trapped inside the cage.Rats' most favorite garbage food according to the book[the first one being the most favorite:]: scrambled eggs, macaroni and cheese, cooked corn kernels, cooked potatoes, cooked oatmeal, cooked sweet potatoes, white bread, raw corn on the cob, raw beef with bones, raw sweet potatoes, raw beef without bones, corned beef hash, fried chicken, bananas, cooked carrots. Of course, the book discussed rats in New York. So these are New York garbage food. Here in my place, the rats loved peanuts and peanut butter [cheese too!:].Two times already, rats were trapped inside a pail half-filled with water. I left them to drown. Do you know they can last for more than two days swimming in the pail before finally drowning? The book did not mention this, so it got only 3 stars from me."
31,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2263596-alana-trejo,5,"This book is fascinating and surprisingly moving. Basically rats live where people live and eat what people eat, crossing almost all socioeconomic barriers (except for, strangely, Montana). I found the stories about post 9/11 New York rats particularly moving. Even after so much chaos and violence at the site of ground zero a lot of rats managed to survive. I'm not sure exactly how to eloquently express the rats/people metaphor, maybe I need to read the book again, but it was moving. Also moving were the stories of the exterminators that volunteered to go to ground zero to combat the exploding rat population. Is it weird that I'm rooting for and against the rats? This book details the journey of the Norway rat in America as well as the fight against it. I highly recommend this book."
32,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941369-ben,3,"Even though true documentaries are one of my passions, this book comes close enough. Its take as a ""not quite encyclopedic"" book on rats is more of a travelogue that follows a man who spends a year satiating his curiosity for the rats that live so close to all of us, but are mostly hidden from view.The book consistently left me wanting for more in depth findings, and each reference he gave to a more substantial book he had used in his research made me want to abandon his book in search of better facts.This said, the book was still interesting, if for nothing more than it saved me a year of my own life dedicated to rats; a pursuit that I could clearly see myself doing for the same reasons as the author. Curiosity, and a hunger for more hands on information."

35,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,3,"Other reviewers have complained that this book isn't so much about rats as it is about the city of New York itself, and that criticism is very true. This isn't so much about rats as a species, although it does comment a decent amount about their behavior, as it is about the people who deal with rats on a daily basis and how the rat lives alongside us. This is a history of sanitation workers, exterminators, and doctors and how each in turn respond to the invasion of the Norwegian Rat into their cities - this is how the rat is essentially a part of the city itself, a microcosm of human civilization through burrows and rat pits and the perceptions we all hold about the strange species.Go into this book expecting social history more than commentary about rats. Go in expecting a history of extermination, complete with commentary about how it should, but isn't changing. Go in expecting a history of the lower echelon of society, how people live alongside rats, what it means, and how dealing with rats often forces us to deal with the less desirable aspects of our own society. Expect all of this written in a poetic language that wants to be Thoreau but never quite reaches that point. Nonetheless, it makes you think, and that's a good thing, isn't it?I liked reading this book, although it wasn't quite what I was after. Once I settled in to accept it for what it was, however, I was pleasantly surprised. This is a good book that teaches us a different way of looking at things, and it is a book that accepts the rat for what it is: a rat. It doesn't put other expectations upon or it dress it up in hyperbole. This book respects them for what they are, praises them for what they excel at, an marvels at their survival and adaptability. Nevertheless, this book still acknowledges the harm they can do, but does so without prejudice and explains why it is they often do what they do.We can learn a lot from rats when we stop to think about them, and this book encourages us to do just that."

What was funny in a quirky-you're-weird way was when Mr. Sullivan waxed poetic and used fancy schmancy beautiful words to describe these plague spreading vermin. Even his pretty words couldn't suppress my gag reflex while I ate and read over my lunch breaks. That was challenging, but this book was worth the throat massage to relax those barf muscles.I feel like I've been in a dark, dank stinky hole and now I've reached the end of the tunnel and have climbed out into the fresh sunshine.

There's a beautiful joy present on every page. One of my favorite moments was when he attended a pest control conference to meet a famous rat expert and witnessed the absolute joy and excitement of other rat experts in hearing the man speak. What a niche. The book made me love the human spirit!

As the author states, everyone in New York has at least one rat story, and I enjoyed reading about these stories from Manhattan to Bushwick.

I loved his writing style, it read like a light conversation and included some great tangents that somehow always made it back to the topic of rats. The transparency of how strange this whole project was for him was matched with this notion that we are similar to rats in so many ways- and I thoroughly enjoyed this juxtaposition.

He sets out to observe rats in their native alleyways in lower Manhattan and is a determined urban explorer who returns night after night, notebook in hand, sometimes with buddies, to record and share the behavior and lifestyle of our dreaded island mates. He weaves in historical anecdotes and data, interviews with pest exterminators and homeless people, both of whom naturally have a far different relationship with the rat community. We learn that rats never stray more than 60 feet from their nests, each nest boasts about 100 rats and rats only go where there is food. He takes us back to early 19th century New York where rat fighting was common at the pubs and ""rat catchers"" made about ten cents a catch to keep the sport going. The fast facts and interesting sound bites are plenty but what RATS is sorely missing is an anchor, a reason, the main moment. Sullivan never delves into our psychological relationship with rats, the myths, the fears and yet the pets that sit on people's shoulders. He also doesn't travel underground so the rat observations are repetitive and familiar, extended versions of what we see on the subway.All said, Sullivan is worth the read and the subject matter and writing are solid, albeit just wrapped in a big gimmick."

White The first time I discovered the pleasure of sharing saliva with a girl, we were by ourselves inside the shed in my family's suburban back yard. That shed had originally been built as a chicken coop for the bunch I'd incubated, candled, and hatched out as a Scouting project. The chickens had been evicted a couple of years earlier, after one of their nocturnal escapes had occasioned a predawn Sunday morning telephone call to Mom and Dad from an irate neighbor--a disabled W.W.II vet who owned the local (believe-it-or-not)Chicken Delight--upon whose front lawn our rooster was announcing the upcoming solar event. During those years we raised chickens in Commack, I never observed a rat in the neighborhood, no less in my chicken coop. This, despite my using the chickens to compost our food scraps as well as boxes of rotting vegetables I'd be given by the kindly proprietor of the local farm stand who suddenly became the new owner of my wayward chickens, thanks to that telephone call. "" 'AAAAAAAAAH, A RAT! OH MY GOD! DIOS MIO! There's a rat in the bed!'""I'd just fallen asleep when I heard Mami screaming. I jumped up, grabbed the staple gun and a paint roller, and ran to her."" 'Iris, stay back!' Freddy stood in the doorway to the living room with his baseball bat. Mami was hopping around like the floor was on fire. 'It's okay, Ma! Calm down! Relax!' He rushed in and poked the bat into the corners of the pullout sofa. 'Which way'd he go?'"" 'I don't know!' Mami climbed up on a chair. 'All I know, he was huge! He was making the whole bed shake, he was so big.' ""--JUST ASK IRIS by Lucy Frank Back in 1986, when I purchased my farm here in Sebastopol, I inherited dozens and dozens of ""wild"" chickens. Unpenned and multiplying fruitfully, they roosted in the eves of the barn, in the tangled wisteria bushes out front, and on top of my old blue Datsun wagon. For months I crept out at night with a flashlight to grab them, cage them, and sell them to the local farm supply store. I also inherited some rats. When I again kept chickens for a few years, while my children were preschoolers, the rats were constantly making off with the eggs and the chickens' feed. I've forever since needed to be diligent about keeping the goats' grain in tightly covered metal containers. My late golden retriever, Annie Banannie, used to catch and chomp the rats sometimes, but our current canines apparently aren't as talented. "" 'Las ratas, son el pan nuestro de cada dia,' the man said. 'The rats are part of everyday life.' "" I haven't observed any rats out there in a while, but I know from the evidence of chewed up stuff and the old nests I periodically discover that they are still out there. I certainly have yet to see the charm in rats. But I've now acquired an abundance of intriguing, entertaining, and downright scary facts and anecdotes about the history, physiology, and behavior of rats, along with the history and behavior of humans in dealing with these pests. All this, thanks to reading Robert Sullivan's RATS: OBSERVATIONS ON THE HISTORY & HABITAT OF THE CITY'S MOST UNWANTED INHABITANTS. ""Rats succeed while under constant siege because they have an astounding rate of reproduction. If they are not eating, then rats are usually having sex. Most likely, if you are in New York while you are reading this sentence or even in any other major city in America, then you are in proximity of two or more rats having sex. Male and female rats may have sex twenty times a day, and a male rat will have sex with as many female rats as possible--according to one report, a dominant male rat may mate with up to twenty female rats in just six hours."" The author spent many nights over the course of a year closely observing the rat population of a particular alley in lower Manhattan. The alley was named after Medcef Eden, a prosperous Revolutionary-era friend of Aaron Burr whose descendants (Eden's descendants, that is) used to own the farm that was eventually developed into Times Square. From the continual inclusion of detailed tangential information, such as the two hundred year evolution of the cobblestoned, brick-sided, urine-reeking alley that Sullivan chose as his base for nocturnal rat-watching, it is obvious that the author spent his days locating and poring over the thousands of carefully noted references from which he has mined multitudes of fascinating facts and stories that make you constantly want to interrupt the nearest person and share what you've just read. ""One of the most amazing rat skirmishes ever happened downtown in 1979, when a woman was attacked by a large pack of rats.""It happened on a summer night, just after nine o'clock. The woman was described by the witnesses as being in her thirties. She was on Ann Street, right near the entrance to Theater Alley. Judging from the various accounts, she seems to have been approached by the rats as she was walking toward her car. She also seems to have noticed the rats coming near her, their paws skittering on the street. Witnesses said the rats swarmed around the woman. One climbed her leg and appeared to bite her. The woman screamed. A man nearby ran to help the woman, taking off his jacket and waving it in an attempt to scare the rats away. The man told police that the rats appeared undeterred by anything he did, and in a second they began to climb up his coat. Seeing this, the man ran to a phone and called the police. By now, the woman was in a 'state of hysteria' according to another witness. She staggered to her car, which was parked a few yards away. The rats followed her. She got in, closed the door. Now the rats were climbing on her car. She was screaming when she drove away. The woman was gone by the time the police arrived, but the rats were still there, scurrying through the street and into Theater Alley and into their nests in a lot on Ann Street, just around the corner.""

When I see a rat ""in the wild"" scurrying by, my eyes light up, I squeal, and clap my hands. I used to have a pet rat in high school (his name was Tynan) and he was such an incredible little companion. I know, I know, city rats are *not* the same as pet rats. But still...they are smart, cute (yes, they are!), cunning, resourceful, and tenacious. So imagine my excitement when I came across this title, and my surprise at noting that it was a NY times bestseller. Some writer, and obviously his audience, had at least enough curiosity and some amount of respect for the rat to make a best-selling book!I dug into the book with high expectations. I have to say some of those expectations were met, but in the end the book came up short for me. The reader is taken into the personal world of the author who decides to study the rats in a particular alley in New York city. He learns about rat behavior from reading some natural history documentation, by observation, through exterminators, and also through some interesting connections he makes through historical rat populations in New York tenements. I thought the descriptions of rat behavior and rat biology was very interesting and well presented. I am a little sad that upon learning more about city rats I will no longer be quite as thrilled when I come across one. The part that didn't work so well for me was when Sullivan tried to extend the history and population of rats into the civil and territorial history of New York. I think he was going for the approach that Mark Kurlansky (Cod, Salt) is so successful with. He just didn't do it as well. Some parts were interesting. For instance, the history of rat fighting, and the use of rat infestation to protest for tenant rights. But he spends too much time on making these connections and it becomes less and less about the rats, and the connection is stretched thin and loses the thread and momentum. There is also a long part towards the end of the book that tries to tie the rat population he's studying with the historical geography and city layout of the area that is just so boring that I can't even remember what connection was ultimately made.I think if the editor could have culled out some of the last quarter of the book it would have made for a more cohesive picture. I think a reader could get just what they need from reading the book about 3/4 of the way through and then letting it go."
48,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,3,"This mainly feels like a New Yorker article that went on far too long. It meanders and maunders all over the place, and many of the chapters appear to be completely irrelevant filler.Still, the second chapter, simply describing the biology of the city rat, is filled with the kind of fun factoids that I wanted when I picked up the book. Rats usually live about a year, can have sex up to twenty times a day, gestate over just twenty-one days, and their nibbling causes about a fourth of all cable and wire breaks in the city. So far so good. Also, Sullivan explains that the 1 rat per human inhabitant rule so often repeated is a myth emerging out of a 1909 British report that calculated one rat per rural acre (in reality there are probably about 250,000 rats for New York's 8 million inhabitants). Also, apparently the ""Rat King"" myth has some truth to it: rats are hierarchal pack animals, with one rat often getting more rat ladies than others, and some rats do get their tails tangled up together so they can't move (then their rat brethren bring back food to feed them!)Overall, however, most of the stories here have little or nothing to do with New York city rats. Sullivan describes the Harlem rent strikes led by Jesse Gray in the 1960s, and the sanitation workers strike led by John DeLury in the same decade. He then goes on to the Black Death, the 1774 fight against British soldiers in New York led by Isaac Sears, and the San Francisco quarantine scare of 1901. Some of these stories are certainly interesting, but they are better told elsewhere. Also, his personal observations of a series of rats' nests in Eden Alley add almost nothing to the story.So if you want a few weird stories and a couple of rat factoids this should satisfy that craving, but a 20 page New Yorker article could have done the same."
49,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/664866-leesa,5,"I am a rat enthusiast. My pet rats have been the most entertaining friends I've ever had and I always can be coaxed out of a bad mood by their antics. They are smart enough and like people enough that they don't really need to live in cages. They like their people and thus come running for playtime and attention. My rats do live in cages, mainly because I have cats, and while some people have cats and rats that can coexist, I don't tempt that fate.Yes, pet ""fancy"" rats and the rats talked about in this book are the same species. The only thing different is that the ""fancy"" rat has been tamed. They still need to be socialized, but they aren't wild.This book was great. I reference it all the time when I teach volunteers about handling pet rats at our local animal shelter. One of my favorite stories was with the exterminator explaining to a customer that simply getting a cat and locking it downstairs in the basement infested with rats was a really stupid idea. Rats are prey, yes, but oh, they are so very much predators too, and rats in a group are cunning and dangerous when faced with a foe. My other favorite story was when the rats were scurrying about in the alley and suddenly merged into one line down the middle. EERY! And again, shows how little we know about rats and why they do what they do (they make sounds far too high for us to hear, for example).I'm not grossed out by seeing rats or mice in urban settings and never did equate them with disease and filth. I know that rats and mice are actually very fastidious in their grooming (and sometimes their owner's grooming as those of us who have had avid ""rodentists"" will attest), but they can only be as clean as their environment. When their main source of food and habitat are where we throw out our trash, then that's exactly how clean they will be. Loved this book and would read it again."
50,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62643227-laura,5,"I love rats. I have pet rats. I do research with rats, both lab and field studies. I enjoy the topic of ""rats."" That being said, I loved this book probably for the reasons that many people do not. Rats is not a natural historians approach to the study of Rattus, instead it is one journalist's foray into the rat shaped history of New York. This means the bulk of the content is not talking about the specifics of wild rat behavior and habitat, but rather how the interaction of rats with humans was a key component in the political developments of New York. If anything, it is a commentary on the close bond that rats and humans share, and will probably always share. Rats has a lot of interesting stories and tidbits about human-rat run-ins. I found it particularly fascinating that the founder of the SPCA, Henry Bergh, started his journey of protecting animals by attacking and denouncing the practice of ratting. Yes, a lot of the stories are about exterminating (or at least attempting to exterminate) rats, but that unfortunately is the nature of the relationship between city dwelling rats and humans. However, I do not think it takes away from the information provided. Also, Sullivan's occasional stories about his ""own"" alley rats really lends a more personal feel to the book while providing a close-up portrait of the subject. Overall, I really enjoyed this book for the historical stories revolving around rats and would recommend it to others who enjoy the subject of rats but with a human political and historical flare.P.S. Rats are not ""heroes"" in the book, they are presented as important, but slightly disgusting cohabitants. Many people in the book respect rats because of their tenacity, but overall, most people hate rats."
51,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,3,"A fairly interesting account of the problem and history of rats in urban civilization, with a large focus on New York City. Fragments of many interesting topics get presented, but they get well diluted with a focus on the authors own shallow observations of rats through night-time forays and relatively unenlightening conversations with pest control professionals. Yes, they are almost impossible to eradicate given all the access to garbage and the many hiding places available to them. Yes, their association with diseases and danger to children from biting is a public health hazard and a perennial political football. Despite much attention to poisoning and trapping efforts, he notes that they are too smart for most traps, can become immune to poisons, and breed so fast that reductions of their population are typically only short term. He doesn�t really get to the bottom of a solution for co-existence or approach what it would take to achieve the necessary denial of food sources. Most of all, I regret his inadequate of coverage of ethological studies on rats. They have a very complex social life, as revealed in naturalistic studies, albeit in laboratory settings. This includes intricate maternal behaviors, dominance hierarchies, and ritualistic territorial behaviors. So much of psychology and brain science is founded on rats that some respect for them as more than vermin to be controlled would be worth emphasizing."
52,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1457751-jesse,2,"Rats are always interesting. This book, however, was not-- very strangely organized, it obviously lacked a strong editor. There were a lot of portions that seemed entirely out of place, whether barely-connected history or unnecessary personal narrative by the author. The principal organization of the book is the author's remarks on spending a year in an alley watching rats, and at this point, the framing device of ""One Year In..."" has gotten so old by now that it's likely to make you feel tired of the book before you begin. In addition, the problem with this book is that Sullivan doesn't get that I'm reading it because the book is called RATS, not because it's called SULLIVAN ON RATS. Especially egregious was the penultimate chapter which, for some reason I don't understand, is not at all about rats, but rather about some personnage of the American revolution about whom I couldn't care less. Typical and predictable conclusions about rats-are-us, and rats-are-the-USA! follow. Yawn.That said, the chapters that actually taught me stuff about rats were pretty neat. I just wish the whole book had been composed of those, as that's why I took the thing out of the library in the first place."

Go to a fancy rat show & you’ll see what I mean (in England see http://www.nfrs.org/ ).There’s a rational explanation for all of this. The book investigates the life cycle of the urban ‘wild’ rat; every bit as intelligent as it’s more highly bred cousin; but overall possessing problems of image.This ought to be an interesting book. But to me, with my practical experience of well-bred rodents, this book read painfully like a manufactured publication; a ‘what can I write in a book about rats, that it will grab attention and sell well, so turning a useful profit?’ I gave up about half-way through.All I can say is thank goodness for urban rats, black and brown. They do an awful lot of cleaning up after Man. Rats would be considerably worse off if Man lived less wastefully, and cleared up better after himself.All in all, not a book I’d recommend to owners of fancy rats. "
54,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45995-david,2,"There are essentially three threads to this book.The first is about rats, obviously: this is what I was expecting to read about, and it held my interest throughout.Second is a connection Sullivan makes between rats and people, using an allusion to Emerson's essay on ""Representative Men"" to spin histories of what he considers the important ""Unrepresentative Men"" of history connected to rats and rat behavior, sometimes tenuously: this took me a while to get into, but ultimately I was happy to get these profiles of men I would not have otherwise heard of, and in the end these sections do drive home the point he makes that rats are like a shadow species to humans in many ways.The third is the story of Sullivan himself observing rats in New York City: this seems like a compelling idea in theory, but Sullivan proves an insufferable host. Unfortunately, the first thread composes a relatively small part of the book; the second, much more; while the third is frustratingly omnipresent. I would have been thrilled with the book if these proportions were reversed--as is, I'd recommend it with a caveat."

It is written by Robert Sullivan, who decides to observe city rats in their natural habitat. It has several up and downsides.	When given the parts on his actual experiences, the book is quite nice. It talks about their behavior and what he noticed as well. It describes the conversations that he had with exterminators, scientists and everyday people that he meets along his way. It does a great job of describing all the places that he went on his quest to understand rats and explaining why rats and the species that they follow, people, do many things. It is overall a great and thoughtful book.	However, there are quite a few downsides. The parts talking about the history can get quite boring. There also some sections that talk about people that were important to rat studying or had an interesting story that had to do with rats that are slow. However, overall it is a great book."
56,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/157171-christian,4,"I am frankly shocked at many of the user reviews of this book. Many of them seem to think this book was going to be a biology textbook about rats and not a history book. If only there were some clue that it was a history book in the titl-wait a tick...it IS in the title. Frankly, I was not interested in the biology of rats when I picked up this book, and, luckily, there was not too much of it. Sullivan instead, and rightly, focuses on the historical relationship between rats and humans in America and abroad. The parallels he draws between rats and humans continuously building on top of history and the extended metaphor of revolutionary figures persisting in the face of tremendous opposition (much like rats) were particularly enjoyable (and not annoying tangents as some reviewers labeled them.) I don't typically read other reviews for books, but I thought for sure this page would be filled with praise for Mr. Sullivan who was able to write a beautiful tribute to something as icky and gross as rats. "
57,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58498-brook,2,"The author himself gets one star, the subject material helps him out and bumps it up to two. His ""wax poetics"" go nowhere, the narrative follows the storyline structure of a high school short story spread over a couple hundred pages, and he somehow makes the topic of rats (which is a fascinating topic) only ""moderately interesting,"" instead of a can't-put-down-er. The subject matter and asides are all composed of interesting stories (the picture of hundreds of rat traps laid around ground zero after 9/11, and the realization that this would be necessary is fascinating), but the author is just not a great writer. That said, at no point was I ""bored"" with the book. I just realized that a very, very interesting thing (rats and how they relate to cities and their stratification) was reduced to one hipster walking around NYC with his ""poet friend"" (mentioned about 12-15 times) watching rats. Still, read this if the subject of rats and cities intrigues you. "

There's some great anecdotes (historical and recent) as well as profiles of colorful people that travel in rattish circles.Unfortunately, the author has a contrived overexcited attitude he goes on his rat-ventures and it makes the second half of the book a struggle. His observations devolve into a weird fake Victorian romantic praise for rat life (or the simpler life, channeling Thoreau). His writing is fragmented for this reason and for many strange associations that he makes. Sometimes, rats running around in an alley are just rats running around in an alley. I can be convinced if they are more than that, but I certainly wasn't by this book. Still worth picking up for all the rat-facts and especially for the gruesome chapter on rat fighting!"

A line like: ""To stand in an alley is to watch the city from its bowels, to feel life grumbling in its gut"" is what made this book so special. Sullivan's enthusiasm for his subject keeps the reader engaged.

A representative sentence is on page 5: ""The average brown rat is large and stocky; it grows to be approximately sixteen inches long from its nose to its tail--the size of a large adult human male's foot--and weighs about a pound, though brown rats have been measured by scientists and exterminators at twenty inches and up to two pounds."""

Rats
 to the conclusion that our two species are a lot alike. As repugnant as we might find rats and their way of life, they and it are really not all that different from ours. We just have better plumbing.	On p. 34, we find: “(i)n the city, rats and men live in conflict, one side scurrying off from the other or perpetually destroying the other’s habitat or constantly attempting to destroy the other—an unending and brutish war. Rat stories are war stories, and they are told in conversation and on the news, in dispatches from the front that is all around us, though mostly underneath.”And on p. 218, we read: “…we are all a little like rats. We come and go. We are beaten down but we come back again. We live in colonies and we strike out on our own, or get forced out or starved out or are eaten up by our competition, by the biggest rats. We thrive in unlikely places and devour.”And what about that go-between between us and a given rat population, the exterminator? On p. 217, we read: “…there is hope in the life of many exterminators. Life is mean and vile in many ways, but exterminators advance toward society’s depths and meet life there and see it for what it is, in some cases.”Apart from his exemplary research and observation talents, can Robert Sullivan write? You be the judge with this first paragraph of Chapter 10 titled “Garbage”: “(a) late-summer evening, almost fall. A delicious evening that was cool but not cold, an evening of haze-blurred stars beneath which, as I crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, the East River fought the rising tide to rush into the harbor, the bay, the ocean. And then I was down from the bird’s-eye view of the bridge and into the twinkling buildings, then the side streets, then the alley, which is not really light and not really dark but locked in its semi-sickly fluorescence, in the side-street twilight that is its Arctic White Night. The rats were out, grazing peacefully in the two garbage berms, in the Chinese and the Irish trash. So many rats, at least a dozen visible now, some large, some small. Rat life in the alley can be a harried blur, a wash of rodentary citizenry, or it can be a kaleidoscope of the recognizable, a rat-a-tat-tat of what almost immediately becomes a harmonized familiar—and so I consider these questions: Are there more? Is this colony growing? Or am I just noticing rats that I did not notice before?”
Rats
 is a most unusual literary experience. This, because the subject-matter is relatively obscene. Yet Sullivan brings us, as readers, to an appreciation of the rodentary life and of those who live it. I heartily recommend this book, whether or not you live in New York City.RRBBrooklyn, NY25 February 2020"

What reply did the Long Suffering Wife (LSW) make, mildly and not even looking up from her iPad, when I (NOT a teenager) rhetorically asked, after reading information at the top of this Goodreads page, what kind of teenagers would actually read this book? A. No, she deliberately avoids gifting me with books that I have put on my “to-read” list, because, she explains, finding a book which is NOT on the “to-read” list is “more of a challenge”.Q. Does LSW buy you gift books selected from your Goodreads “to-read” list?A. Yes.Q. Did you apologetically inform LSW that you were giving her gift book a lukewarm review and reassure her that your dislike of this book did not reduce the awe in which you hold her massive intellect?When your marriage is in its fourth decade, it seems like all of the gifts you exchange are larded with backstory. In this case, I wrote for a time online about the urban problems of Washington, D.C. Some of the little notice that my scribblings received was because I wrote occasionally about rats, which ranked second only to parking as a topic for getting the comments section of your urban hyper-local news blog chock full of grammar-check-defying commentary. Since then, rats have been a bit of an in-joke.Having made the appropriate apologies, I will now come out and state flatly that this is an uninteresting book. The author spent many months in a lower Manhattan alley observing the behavior of the indigenous rat population, but his prime assumption that such an act could, by itself, hold together a book is just wrong. The dullest part of the book is his rat-observing journal -- I skimmed. It was also a love letter to New York City, so I think that your enjoyment may rise or fall depending on your interest in and fondness for The Big Apple.The better parts of this book were history (of his particular rat-infested alley) and journalism (accompanying exterminators and scientists who study rats). It’s true that the teenaged me would have happily read a book which was completely as good as the best parts of this book. The adult me, though, found it mostly a disappointment. "
79,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14933903-lydia,5,"Shortly after moving to NYC for a new job, I spotted a rat running through my office. I stood on my swivel chair while the rat ran rampant and texted my old boss, semi-seriously asking to come back to Colorado. He overnighted me this book, and while I thought it was a great joke, it was also a great read.Told in the meandering anecdotal style of literary non-fiction, Sullivan is both factual and familiar throughout. I’ve had three pet rats (fancy rats) in my life and therefore came to New York with a somewhat magnanimous attitude toward rats. I quickly learned, and Sullivan makes the point well, that fancy rats and wild rats have very little in common. Fancy rats are wonderful pets. Wild rats, notably the rattus norvegicus, are industrious, intelligent, and yes, very very gross. I can now identify rat holes around the city— they are smaller and more prevalent than I’d imagined. I respect rats much more, knowing now that they are indomitable hustlers who always find a way to survive. I am also much more repulsed by rats than I was before. I respect their hustle, but I’m not looking to befriend them.Most interesting for me, especially as a somewhat new New Yorker, was the great wealth of history interlaced through the narrative. The history of rats and rats in New York, is a history of people and the people of New York: tenant organizer Jesse Gray; Kit Burns and his prolific rat pit; John DeLury, a union organizer for sanitation workers; Joseph Kinyoun’s infectious disease center in Staten Island and attempts to treat plague in San Francisco; and Isaac Sears, who led the Liberty Boys in early colonial uprisings against the British, and whose latent violent folly lost him the position of secretary of the American Navy to everyone’s favorite young whippersnapper, Alexander Hamilton.At its core this is a book of urban nature writing, at times both prosaic and extraordinary. And the cover is just phenomenal. "
80,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19773041-joseph-hirsch,3,"Rats are one of those animals, like cockroaches, that elicit disgust but also a begrudging respect. They're vicious, rapacious, cruelly hierarchical, and obsessed with their own survival above all else. Sort of like us.Robert Sullivan's ""Rats"" is a perfectly serviceable, moderately entertaining book that does the job it promises, introducing the reader in an informal and personal style to his observations of rats through history, anecdotes, and his own rat-watching endeavors. If it sounds like I'm damning the book with faint praise, I gotta say that's what I think it merits. There are some entertaining sections, some cool byways taken about lesser-known figures in history who used rats to all manner of ends, including pitting them in combat and collecting disease from their bodies to create biological weapons. Some of it's nasty, but in the way that a horror movie is nasty, a sort of Grand Guignol gross-out that carries a nice frisson to leaven the repulsion. The book does a good job of getting at this paradox at the heart not just of ratting, but of our relationship with many fascinating-but-nasty things.The work goes off the rails a little when Sullivan tries to channel his literary forebears, including diary entries that were a bit self-indulgent and didn't seem to go anywhere, also putting down the night vision monocular once too often to gaze into the mirror. I like Emerson and Thoreau enough on their own, but I could have done without the by-way-of version, which eventually started to strike the eye like a tyro's transcendentalism. It's hard to achieve the correct balance between informational and informal, and the author, while well-meaning, is a little misguided when he stops doing things like interviewing exterminators or poring through the microfiche, and gets on his essayist kick. No photos or illustrations."

And his writing style was very conversational and easy to read.I was thinking that, if a rat pair can breed 15,000 in a year, as he says, then what good is it to trap or poison them? They would just keep breeding and fill that gap. So far, the best way to limit the population is to limit the food supply -- which is not gonna happen as long as New York leaves its garbage out in plastic bags. So why not try some birth control? Then I saw an article about that very method -- the city government of Washington D.C. is about to try it. We'll see how that goes.I've trapped rats in my attic and garage in live traps, then drown them quickly in cold water in a plastic bin, maybe a total of 10 or so over the years. I put them in a zip-lock baggie in the freezer till trash day. And warn the kids before they open the freezer!Good book. Recommended!"

Which is to say, a book you can put down and walk away from a dozen times before finishing it.Rats is at its best when recounting stories of people who work with/around these animals – biologists and exterminators, fair housing advocates to sanitation workers. It’s still quite good when telling stories of places or historical persons/events – the neighborhood around Wall Street when it was a colonial wheat field, the layers of infrastructure below our feet, the spread of rats through medieval Europe, American political bosses from way back, tavern owners and their rat fighting rings. The characters and places in these chapters jump off the page.What doesn’t jump, but waddles along or just sits there on the page, are the author’s in-person experiences observing rats in a New York City alley for a year. Yes, it’s a skeevy thrill to read about rat behavior while imagining yourself rooted to the spot in his place. And though 9/11 happened during the year our author was “in the field,” that event plays only a minor role – if you never thought about vermin infesting The Pile, it’s because of the extraordinary efforts of the city’s exterminators in the months that followed. But if you’re hoping for major insights or life lessons learned, you’ll come away disappointed."
83,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1854336-rob,3,"An elegantly written 'urban safari' of few people's favourite animal that left me disappointed largely because the analysis pretty much centres upon New York and one alleyway in particular. Sure, there are excursions into the Middle Ages and early Modern period via the Black Death and Daniel Defoe's writings but a more comprehensive, global history and natural study of the rat would have been more welcome (this seems to have been attempted via Morgan Spurlock's documentary based on the book).I once spent time living next to a charming little lass who had three pets of the species and they were both unsurprisingly intelligent and disarmingly friendly and entertaining - far more gregarious than guinea pigs or hamsters or even cats - but Sullivan leaves us in no doubt that the fluffy white and multi-coloured ones are a vastly different kettle of fish from those lurking in your toilet bowl, set as they are to take over the world at some point in the near future. I've recently seen four in Milton Keynes in the space of six months which is alarming while Neil Warnock's description of El-Hadji-Diouf as a 'sewer rat' also spring to mind."

This book is very readable, but as mentioned by other reviewers I did feel that it lacked direction in a number in places. The author was easily distracted from what I felt should have been the main subject matter and seemed more than happy to devote entire chapters to every stray and semi-related thought which entered his head.There were also numerous and annoying instances of words being omitted (when I'm pretty sure they weren't supposed to be), showing up in the wrong place (or just plain repeating themselves), not being completed (I'm pretty sure there were some words which were meant to be plural but were left in the singular for some reason), and just a general feeling of thoughts not being completed. In short, not something you'll want to deal with if you're at all like me-- as in, can't help but notice all of these things, get a headache over said things, and allow their presence to completely ruin entire books for you.Review in brief: This book could have really used an editor. Like, a good editor. Of the caliber which-- sadly for me-- seem to be in short supply these days."
85,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,3,"This book was way more about the author than I expected it to be. This is another author in the William Zinsser school of thought that says that you should put a lot of yourself and your personal story into the book. What that means is that we get maybe 50-100 pages about rats, another 100 pages about the author and how he interacts with various pest control people and scientists, and then another 50-100 pages of various historical anecdotes related to rats. Overall it was pretty good, but I could definitely have used more scientific rat content.One interesting assertion that Sullivan makes that I keep coming back to is that he claims that there are currently more rodents with plague in North America than there were in Europe during the black death, mostly in the deserts in California. He provides no direct citation for this, and I have been able to find no corroboration beyond pretty wide acknowledgement that there are indeed plague-infested rodents in California. It rings true, but if anyone can find some sort of reputable scientific citation for that, it would put my conscience at ease."
86,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595286-james,4,"A quick and pleasant read, contrary to how rats make me feel.This was an unexpectedly delightful read. When I picked up the book I had been expecting a micro-history that was tightly focused on rats with a clinical detachment. What I found instead was a personal narrative that spiraled out from the authors contemplations while observing a colony of rats in a particular alley. The story folds in personalities related to rats in some manner, exterminators and the homeless, both contemporary and historical (by far I love his friends the poet and artist who accompany him on some of his ratting forays). In and around this, the story builds a painting of New York that is impressionist in nature: broad strokes that accentuate the individual bristle. A quick and pleasant read, contrary to how rats make me feel."
87,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81360658-louis,2,"Disappointing. This is firstly a book about New York, secondly about the author, with rats relegated to third place. There are great swathes of the book that aren't about rats. Sometimes there is a tangential connection (renters rights) and sometimes it works (plague). Other times it is nothing at all to do with the supposed subject matter - a chapter about ""the liberty boys"" and the battle of golden hill - and is an unwelcome distraction. It read as if the author had done some research that didn't fit but that he refused to discard. There is also a section where the author abandons his structure entirely and just lists out some bullet points, as if he was writing in an exam and ran out of time.Considering it's a short book, it really dragged. It's light on facts and it's only the pleasant way that the author comes across that rescues it from one star."
88,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610419-rogue-reader,5,"This is a book I've been looking for all my life. It is perhaps, the best book I've ever read in my life. No overstatement. And the dust jacket - take a moment and really look at it. Amazing!Sullivan's Rats has everything - the city I love, the underbelly, an obsessive compulsion to understand one of man's most hated animals. Its got the back alleys of restaurants that draw rats to the table, disease, garbage that is humanized in its power, strikes and unions, and even - how the rats handled 9/11. Written with just the slightest informality and occasional awkwardness of phrase, Sullivan uses language to draw you into the alley with every one of your senses. It is a must read for anyone who loves New York, who wonders about its history and marvels at its might."
89,1582344779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275828-ashe-dryden,2,"In dire need of a good editorI picked up this book as the premise piqued my interest. The premise is the only thing that kept me going to the end. The book is poorly organized and copy edited. The writing oscillated between paragraph-long run on sentences punctuated by too many commas and then sentence fragments that don’t make sense. I expected the author to speak with more authority or at least to consult with more authorities on the subject. I think the author expected his narrative about himself, his friends, and the physical and historical descriptions of exterminators to be far more interesting than they were. While I certainly learned a handful of things, they were hard won. In all, this book could be cut down to half the length or less."
