0,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,1,"Morris makes a great song and dance about the 'outrage' with which his book was first received. Why are people so resistant to contemplating, in the cool light of scientific 'objectivity', their 'animal nature', he asks. However, Morris' claim to neutrality is highly suspect; he urges us to learn from and accept the picture he presents of human beings, sayinghomo sapiens has remained a naked ape... in acquiring lofty new motives, he has lost none of the earthy old ones. This is frequently a cause of embarrassment to him, but his old impulses have been with him for millions of years, his new ones only a few thousand at the most - and there is no hope of shrugging off the accumulated genetic legacy of his evolutionary past. He would be a far less worried and more fulfilled animal if he would face up to this factHe contrasts the biological view with that of anthropologists, whose methods he treats with derision, since they have tended to give attention to exceptional, often fairly isolated societies. His comments on this subject are not encouraging.The simple tribal groups that are living today are not primitive, they are stultified... the naked ape is essentially an exploratory species and any society that has failed to advance has in some sense failedThis amounts to a ringing endorsement for imperialist appropriation and hegemony. He compares such 'biological failures' with 'the ordinary successful members of the major cultures'.As well as anthropologists, he has issues with psychologists who have, laudably(!) stuck to 'mainstream specimens' but these have unfortunately been 'aberrant or failed... in some respect' he quotes an unnamed practitioner from the field in question approvingly 'We have tackled the abnormals and we are only now beginning, a little late in the day, to concentrate on the normals'. Apparently this horrifically ableist language is unproblematic because we are dealing with the human animal as a mere meaty hunk of biological data here, not with personhood.As usual, my heckles are raised by the use of the male pronoun for humans in general, and I usually try hard to make allowances for old-fashioned conventions here, but in this case 'he' is indicative of Morris' stance. His naked ape is a male and his lifestyle is characteristic of the species and shaped its evolution. He describes how males became hunters and thus developed sophisticated cooperative, communicative and planning skills. There must be something missing from this picture, as female humans have equally well-developed abilities in these areas and they are strictly excluded from hunting in Morris' account. Perhaps child-rearing, which they are credited with, made equal demands, but in that case why is hunting the primary influence rather than infantilism and childcare?On the fascinating subject of how homo sapiens became hairless (I prefer this description to Morris' term 'naked' which he claims is neutral, but obviously connotes clothing), he outlines various theories. I'm most interested in the aquatic ape hypothesis, and keen to read about it next, but Morris favours a hunting-related hypothesis, which leaves the hairlessness of female humans unexplained. Morris' fondness for hunting is much in evidence, in the lack of mention afforded to the food gathering practices of our (probably mainly female) ancestors, description of carnivores vs omnivorous primates, his derision for vegetarians, and most importantly in his description of work as the direct modern analogue of hunting. Thus, women ought not to work/hunt; their 'biologically correct' place is at home caring for the young. All-male clubs and sporting activities are obvious extensions of the need to hunt. I'm grateful to Morris for thereby explaining why women have no interest in sports, athletic pursuits or group socialising activities.This book apparently caused much offence with its 'frank' descriptions of sexual activity. Morris admits these are based on studies in North America, but claims this is fine because 'that culture' is 'biologically large and successful' and therefore 'representative of the naked ape' in general. Morris' account of intercourse is clinical and anyone hoping for stimulation had much better check out the erotica section. Most novels are far sexier (and infinitely more enjoyable on every other level too). What offends me is his unabashedly homophobic stance. He explains homosexual behaviour, which must be 'normal' since all mammals engage in it, as adolescent exploration and an inevitable consequence of young people spending time in unisexual groups 'such as boys schools' but long-term homosexuality is an 'aberrant' 'fixation'. Grudgingly he admits that 'permanent homosexuals' are 'valuable non-contributors' in the present context of the current population explosion, which he regards as a serious coming crisis (so yeah, a Malthusian too).These regressive views on sexuality were commonplace when Morris wrote the book in 1967, but when he was invited to update it in 1994, he saw no reason to change anything but the figure he originally gave for the size of the population. Man's [sic] essential biological nature can change only over evolutionary time scales, he might say. And there's the rub. Morris is an essentialist, for whom biology is destiny. However hard we try to 'twist' and 'distort' our true nature, we will keep returning to the animal truth.This position has generally been rejected by philosophers and social scientists, with good reason. Since zoology is a field of study undertaken by socialised humans, its premises are culturally constructed and determined. I am not trying to deny physical reality or suggest that nothing can be learned from research, but we can't seriously talk about 'facts' isolated from culture, as Morris tries to do. The simple example of his account of taste sensation is instructive. He repeats the 'fact' that we detect four tastes and the 'fact' that different parts of the tongue are sensitive to each of them. Both of these 'facts' are wrong - they are mistaken interpretations which other cultures have not shared. This reminds me of a lecture I once heard, in which we were asked to state the number of our senses. Pliny said five, and it's become a cultural commonplace, but that's all it is. Consider the sense of 'touch', in our five-sense framing made to cover hot/cold, pain, proprioception and contact detection...Morris says that as his book is intended for popular consumption it would be silly to include references. Except on the rare occasions when he actually indicates that 'research has shown' etc, I have to assume that this book is educated speculation. His procedure is to reverse-engineer primitive humans based on a white male North American interpretation of what is observed in the species today, supplementing this with our knowledge of prehistoric environmental conditions, the famously patchy fossil record and comparisons with primates and predators. And why not? The effort is worthy and the results interesting, though I believe they have been much-contested since first published. Where Morris oversteps the mark is in attempting to apply his picture of our ancestors, gained from studying modern humans, to show us modern humans where we are going wrong. Call me culturally indoctrinated Morris, but I think that's called circular reasoning.Morris claims that he wants us to embrace our biological nature, and poses the zoological perspective as ideologically neutral, but it's obvious that as well as homophobia, misogyny and racist imperialism, this book is drenched in the ideology of 'biological morality', the agenda of the gene. My genes regard me as an instrument for their replication, and everything else I do (and feel and think) is irrelevant to them. Their motive is identical to the motive of a virus. My glorious birthright, as a human being, is the ability to choose otherwise."
1,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,4,"This was one of the most upsetting books I have ever read. Fifteen years of age, I approached Morris with a vague, general interest in animals, i.e. zoology. His book was popular and available in the Park Ridge public library where I read it.Fifteen and never been kissed. Well, that is not quite true. In first grade I was kissed by Lisa. That happened in her garage up Butte Lane from our house in the Meadowdale development. It was, it is unforgettable. A willowy blonde, she wore a powder blue smock over a white shirt. Between that and her matching white knee socks there was a provocative inch or two of scuffed skin. The kiss was tender, mutual, a bare wisp of a touch--then her little brothers and sisters who had been spying on us started to snigger and it was over. A few days later Lisa and Susan Whitaker got into a fight over me at the Oak Ridge School playground. That was it. I joined George and some other guys in a girl hating organization devoted to such manly pursuits as watching old Three Stooges films on television again and again.Nine years later and I was obsessed with girls, obsessed. Small for my age (4'11"" entering high school), they were all taller and had been taller for quite some time. I had loved one of them, Nancy Stinton, from sixth through eighth grade, carrying half her books home for her daily, but nothing had happened and, indeed, it was probably just enough to see her smile, to have the twenty minute conversation after school.But by fifteen, it was getting to be too much. The girls in junior high had already started, some of them, to date high school guys and some of those guys were six feet tall and proudly stubbled. Now I was in high school, watching couples prominade from class to class, surrounded by beautiful women, most of them older than me. God, I'd never grow up!Yeah, an ""interest in animals, in zoology"" I wrote, hah!, the book said ""Naked"" and it had the silhouette of a nude man on the cover and a chapter entitled ""Sex"" and another entitled ""Comfort""--that's why I read what I hoped would be an informative piece of highbrow pornography.It was indeed informative--horribly so! Morris, as if reflecting my worst fears, seemed to relate everything, everything to sex, to sexual attraction, to reproduction of the species. Women? Everything about women was to attract and mate with men. Everything. Why do women wear high heels? Because it elevates their rumps for penetration. Why do women wear lipstick? To suggest the blood engorgement of labial arousal. And on and on and on. It was terrible. I was doomed."
2,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/967127-becca,2,"People are animals. Our behavior has evolutionary roots-- even many behaviors we define as cultural have their basis in our prehistoric dog-eat-dog, survival-of-the-sexiest past.There, that's the thesis-- perfectly sound and very interesting. The book falls apart in the details though-- sweeping generalizations and odd assumptions about sexual behavior and gender roles and cultural supremacy without any supporting proof. Just ideas and theories that seem almost comically colored by the author's dated biases.His ideas sometimes lean dangerously towards social Darwinism-- minority cultures with ""bizarre"" practices are aberrations in human evolution, and their behaviors can be dismissed as irrelevant to the discussion of human behavior. The majority's (he means White Northern Europeans, not East Asians, of course) cultural practices represent the evolutionarily successful norm. I am intrigued by the mythical, biological and prehistoric roots of human behavior-- like the story that men are silent because their prehistoric ancestors needed to hunt mastadons with stealth, while women are chatty thanks to their communal berry-gathering ancestresses. Maybe that's ridiculous-- I want to read a book that presents and backs up these theories with actual data. So, not this book."

Next time any of you wonder why I don't know what continent Spain is in, or why places that are further away have times that are closer or...keep in mind that my geography text book for the year was The Naked Ape. Well, I say it was that sort of school like it's to blame for my appalling ignorance of geography. If only I'd chosen a normal school instead. But truth be told, the next year I did chose an ordinary school - Methodist Ladies College - and blow me down if the maths teacher didn't turn out to be a girl who made us do things like write poetry. 'Your maths assignment for today is to write a poem in the style of Jabberwocky' It's moot whether my maths is worse than my geography. Sigh. I wouldn't mind so much if my poetry was any good."
4,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4658763-facehannah,5,"The Naked Ape is my favourite book, ever. If The Naked Ape was a person I would marry it in a heartbeat under whatever terms it wished, and I would be more than happy to give my body over to producing as many of its children as I could because a book like this deserves to bear children more than most of us do. Desmond Morris is an Anthropologist, and the person that made me decide that I, too, would like very much to be an Anthropologist, and The Naked Ape is a study of the Human Being as an animal. Morris writes on this topic with the same enthusiasm as anyone who has found a topic that fascinates them would, you can tell that he is intrigued and excited by Humans and all of their bizarre inner workings. Although he is a scientist and this is most easily defined as a scientific study, he writes in common language that is easy to understand, but the best part is that he has a sense of humour about it all. He is amused by people and their strangeness. Through the early stages of mental development, to gaining the ability to coordinate your limbs, power-struggles in the playground and the absolute horror and abysmal joy of adolescence to the violence and illusions of solidarity that is adulthood Desmond (we're on a first name basis because we've been intimate...in my dreams) never fails to make light of the confusion that afflicts us all and this is truly a book that has something for everyone. "
5,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855283-ronald-wise,5,"Reading this book again after 37 years, I was pleasantly surprised at the relevant impact this book still has. Perhaps reading it after nearly four decades of experience as a member of its target species, more points in it seemed to ring true. There are probably some aspects of this book which have been called into question by subsequent research findings, but in general the materials on the human evolutionary biology and psychology I've read in the meantime seem to support Morris's positions.When first published, this book was considered revolutionary because it attempted to describe the species homo sapiens from an objective zoologist's perspective. The chapters on sex and rearing were shocking to some in the way they dispassionately described these aspects of human behavior. There are other sections of the book, however, that begin to spread into the fields of sociology and psychology and therefore involve human interpretation. The discussion of these topics - the evolution of religion in particular - is where this book has become somewhat obsolete, as the recent interest in human evolution has increasingly focused on the development of vastly increased intelligence and the capacity for abstract thinking. This capacity - which allows empathy and the assessment of future outcomes, and yet is limited in the acceptance of eventual non-existence (i.e., death) - has come to be seen as a major factor in human evolution, though is hardly mentioned in this book.It is still well worth reading and shook up my assumptions about human existence once again."
6,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/892816-matthew,2,"Desmond Morris' ""The Naked Ape"" is not a quality book for individuals seeking to understand the nature of modern evolutionary psychology. Morris' work is notable only for being a historical perspective into the origins of a discipline which has (since his book) taken on a dynamic and vibrant academic life. If one can manage to make it past some of the glaring errors in his work (at one point he suggests that women evolved a trait because it was evolutionarily better for men - 'Uh, Desmond? Evolution by natural or sexual selection doesn't work like that...'), the book itself is worth reading to discover just how far the field has come in only a few short decades."
7,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"When I stumbled across this book last week and promptly down-loaded it to my kindle, I did not realize it had been first published in 1967. Some of the views are decidedly antiquated. For example that men go to work in attempt to satisfy the hunting urge together with other men, while women stay at home and take care of the children. In most of the Scandinavian countries, as large a percentage of women as men are now an active part of the work force. The superficial treatment of homosexuality and religion isn't anywhere near satisfying either. However, when this book was written, homosexuality was still considered a disease, so I presume this book calling this ""aberrant"" is the least that can be expected. The theories presented here on why we are naked are exactly the same as I read in a newer publication I read recently: we lost our hair due to parasites (because less hair meant less parasites) or because we were semi-acquatic for a time being. This book draws no final conclusion on this subject. One of the points I liked best in this book was this ""When you put a name on a door, or hang a painting on a wall, you are, in dog or wolf terms, for example, simply cocking your leg on them and leaving your personal mark there"". A few years ago I was feeling insecure at work and I promptly put a painting on the wall and pictures on my desk - very consciously marking my territory. Come to think of it, this is the only office I have ever felt the need to ""own"" in this way.Despite being somewhat old-fashioned I enjoyed this approach to the human animal. It's not completely outdated yet and well worth reading.Another point that made me think was this ""Those members of a community who are either very successfull or socially well adjusted rarely suffer from 'grooming invitation ailments'"". By this the author means minor illnesses that only just require a visit to the doctor and the care of a spouse or friends (colds, laryngitis and such). In my current work where everyone has a rather high socio-economic status, we are all startingly healthy. Before, when I held a job at the bottom-end of the hierarchy, people where ill of little things ALL the time. So maybe there is some truth in the author's statement, however controversial it may be."
8,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51933-reed,2,"This book astonished people 40 years ago and inspired all that psuedo-scientific ""men are hunters, women are gatherers"" crap, or so I'm told. It's aged badly. The author comes across as pretty full of himself -- he thinks his way of analyzing human behavior (from a zoological perspective) raises him above bias, but he's amusingly unaware of his own biases -- misogyny, homophobia, and anti-psychiatry, to name a few.It's still got some interesting parts, I guess, but I could only make it about halfway through before I got too bored. The funny thing is that I really do think he has a good point; humans are animals and we should pay more attention to how our animal nature motivates us and affects our behavior."
9,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,4,"This is one of those iconic books which once read, are never forgotten. I think many of Morris's observations based solely on anthropology have been debunked by scientists in related fields - but after reading this book, I can see mankind only as monkeys without fur!"
10,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/895830-julie,1,"If you like your science with a heaping dose of sexism and homophobia, then this book's for you!This book was so entirely awful that I thought less of the person who recommended it to me. "
11,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18926429-ahmad-hossam,1,"I believe it would be an insult to science if I shelved this book as scientific. Simply put, it is unscientific bullshit that reads like 19th century imperialist anthropology.Not a shred of evidence is there, except vague references to ""research shows"", the ""fossil record proves"". What these evidence are you will never now, he may as well have made them up!Two major issues here: Mr. Morris seem to lack the basic understanding of evolution (though I'm not a big fan, I know how Darwinian evolution is supposed to work and It is a disgrace that a zoologist would twist it like that). Physical traits are not inherited; the change has to take place in the DNA through RANDOM, GRADUAL MUTATION! Randomness means that the creatures needs are irrelevant, the changes occur randomly and only then can it be selected as an evolutionary advantage.Take any page of this book and count how many ""had to"" are there. Humans needed to become better hunters so the developed a thumb, an erect spine and different limb proportions! First: There is no necessity there, nature had made better hunters without these unprecedented tools. Second: you are talking about gradual change, how can a new finger that is useless become an advantage to be inherited. Third: why should nature care what a creature needs? It's like nature is a transcendent being that magically grants what each animal wants. Want a better hunting society while your babies are nurtured? BOOM!! Nature creates faithfulness! Love, for God's sake, is explained in a line!I am also infuriated by his ignorant snobbery and disregard for how elegantly complex Man truly is. My field of expertise is language, I know for a fact that no one is close to explaining how language began and how we developed the necessary organs in the first place. Morris, however, says it's simple: Man needed to communicate better during his hunts so voila .. he develops language! Totally overrated, unscientific, Eurocentric, misogynist garbage. "
12,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016831-isa-lavinia,1,"Very problematic in its views of isolated societies:The simple tribal groups that are living today are not primitive, they are stultified... the naked ape is essentially an exploratory species and any society that has failed to advance has in some sense failed.It's just such an utter failure to admire the complexities of all human societies and, as a scientist, a failure for letting his biases influence his research. Every human society is valid, worthy, and advanced. It's not because the Sentinelese, for example, are hunter-gatherers that they are less successful or fulfilled than an Englishman like Morris, living in so called ""advanced societies"" - I'd wager they're happier than most people living in this late capitalist hell, certainly happier than I am!Anyway, it's just bad science, such as when he claims that humans lost their body hair to attract more sexual partners since naked flesh is more pleasant to the touch, or that humans have earlobes also because it facilitates pair bonding, being an erogenous zone. Basically what you'd expect from something published in 1967, written by a man born in 1928."
13,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21707944-travelin,4,"I don't know what sort of re-packaged edition I read originally, but it was a short, coffee-table sized hardback, with full-sized, four-colour photos of women's pupils dilating. It seems men automatically find the same photo of a woman, but with larger pupils, more attractive. I thought I'd discovered a secret key to measuring womankind, in a kind of Cosmo version of The Naked Ape. A friend in school saw my book and got very excited, but the secret knowledge within, well, that was only for me.Now that I've bought a steeply discounted paperback version, without the photos, Desmond Morris had said a great deal more, in a far better style, but with details which are remarkably less believable. I'd only recently started this book: Brazzaville Beach, about chimpanzee researchers trying to hide growing suspicion of chimp cannibalism, so I was becoming slightly better informed about some of the harrier apes. According to Morris, chimpanzees are our closest genetic relatives. Morris often repeats himself in a leisurely and comforting way, so it's indisbutable that he believes chimpanzees are largely peaceful, whereas mankind is not. Yet I wasn't surprised when, just yesterday, science magazines started discussing very high numbers of chimp-on-chimp killings, and how their fights can no longer be attributed to dwindling habitat.The zoology/sociology in The Naked Ape is already becoming too positivistic, even for my taste. But I have to believe that Morris, as the Zoological Society's Curator of Mammals, should have known a lot more about actual apes before applying his claims to the naked ones.Semi-final update: I'm going to admit that there are details in the chapter about sex, that if true, I did not know. It may even answer a critical question its thinking inspired. There is probably some Bulgarian demolition expert trying to pry the secrets from its shredded remains.Original review:You really do feel like a VIP guest in a glass wall safari of human nature. Hilarious that a man who watched fish fornicate for a year is somehow your guide."
14,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"I think the concept of this approach to humans as an animal like any other is a brilliant one. We are prone to thinking of ourselves as a species apart, when we're not, and even if we were, we could do with putting back in our places sometimes -- being human doesn't mean we're more worthy than any other creature, all of which have their own adaptations to deal with the environment they find themselves in. We're particularly versatile, yes, but because we evolved that way, not because of some special merit.Anyway, while the approach is interesting, and Desmond Morris' writing is engaging, this is definitely out of date. He keeps a few too many of his human expectations kicking around, like expectations of gender roles and sexuality. It is a really old book, which explains it, and it could undoubtedly do with some updating.If you're particularly attached to notions of humans as being sacred, set apart, etc, you won't want to read this. And if you have any sexual hangups, you won't want to read this, either -- there's a whole chapter on sex. Granted, it's a very old view of sex, considering it only in terms of adaptations (dare we whisper to Morris that homosexual behaviour could persist in a population simply because it feels good and only strict monogamy would mean that any 'gay gene' would die out?), but still, it can be fairly explicit.I don't agree with Morris on many aspects, but his attempt to study humans as animals must be commended."
15,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69503741-anukriti,3,"Humans, we the wise ones are so conceited that we love heaping praise on ourselves. No doubt, as a species we have advanced to an unprecedented level. Naked Ape focuses on the 'biological' aspects of human evolution. Although Morris claims it to be strictly a zoological perspective, any study of humankind is incomplete without weighing in factors from sociology to economy. The progress of our species is a complex process driven by a myriad of motives.The book lays bare the homo sapiens as nothing more than an animal, albeit more developed but still an animal. This feature is so striking as it fills the reader with humility. We are so proud of our achievements and we should be but it will be a recklessness on our part if we assume there is no flip side to our progress. Pushing it under the rug does not change reality. Reading this book during COVID 19 pandemic reinforces this for me. Coming to the negatives, the book is outdated. So many theories mentioned in the book have been debunked. There is a strong influence of Freudian psychology, which in itself is outdated today. The book is highly misogynistic in the sense the author is only considering the patriarch societies. Author's presentation of the world as male-dominated doesn't cut the edge for me as a reader.Overall, a good read. Actually, a must-read. Evolution is an enthralling topic and Morris has authored a scientific work in a language that any layman can understand."
16,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"I would have given ""The Naked Ape"" a 4-star rating based on its handling of human evolution and animal behavior, unfortunately 1960's style moralizing creeped in and caused me to lower my rating to a 3. The boomer generation was really annoying in how they viewed themselves as saviors to the planet when they were really just as selfish and materialistic as their parents (and less moral and responsible). Even with those reservations, the descriptions of human and animal behavior and human evolution are very good and fresh even after 40 years on the shelf. Some of the crucial aspects of human evolution and primate behavior have been tweaked since publication. For instance, Chimpanzees do form hunting parties and meat makes up a small but important part of their diet. Also, bi-pedalism and pair-bonding seem to have developed while our primate ancestors still lived in a forest rather than as an adaptation to carnivorous savanna dwelling. "
17,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4825-xio,3,"One doesn't pick up this sort of book looking to 'get off' but let me tell you (!) the opening chapters on sexuality are very arousing. I had to stop reading and satisfy my er, appetite several times before moving on to the next chapters. If only to stimulate yourself without anyone catching on--or while posing as erudite or whatever-- this book is terrific.Otherwise, sure he makes many interesting points about the biological basis for certain of our human tendencies--and I appreciate his attempting to coherently draw a line between the biological and the cultural--but there is this creeping morality underlying much of what he talks about particularly towards the middle and end of the book that is off-putting.Definitely something you can take into the tub and finish in an hour or so (as long as you're not counting the times you'll put it down to masturbate)."
18,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,4,"I find this book fascinating. It seems, from reading the reviews here, that much of what Morris says is rubbish and supposition but it´s pretty interesting rubbish and supposition. I also think that there is something revealing and useful about just observing humans as an animal - a naked ape, as Morris has it."
19,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/674450-brian,4,"I suppose all reviews of this book must open up with the fact that it is dated - considerably. Many of the speculations and theories put forward in the text have since fallen out of favor or been outright dismissed. But as with all science books from an older era, this is not the important part! The questions and insights raised about human nature far outweigh any omissions due to the inadequate science of the times.What one can find fault with is several arguments and generalizations made about culture that the author roots in 'historical' evidence. During the chapter on sexual practices and habits of humans, the author essentially shrugs and assumes that pair bonding, sexual behavior, and all the quirks that we have today has always been practiced the way our parents and their parents had done it. This is untrue, as the family unit and gender roles have changed throughout history. The author ascribes changes in sexual practices and gender roles as something modern - a sign that we have outgrown our biology. This simply is not true. Our environment has changed and our biology is simply shifting into a gear not visited for generations. The idea of family planning and restricted birth is not a product of the industrial revolution, but something that can be traced back (both as a popular and detested idea depending on the environment) all the way back to ancient Egypt.That one gripe aside, the remainder of the book succeeds in keeping major cultural biases out of its attempt to do most of us avoid: viewing human beings as an animal. While certainly not the definitive text on the subject, for someone who wants a quick introduction to a combination of human biology and anthropology, I would highly recommend this book."
20,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,4,"Stephen Hawking’s ‘A Brief History of Time’ revolutionized the genre of popular science in a big way. Even though many people did not understand what was discussed in it, Time became a best seller as Hawking turned out to be a living icon of human intelligence at its best. An invalid on account of the rare motor neuron disease with which he was afflicted, the eminent scientist communicated through artificial means but carried out advanced research programs through sheer intellect and a good measure of steely will. But popular science goes much back in time, to 1967, as claimed in the foreword to this book. ‘The Naked Ape’ was the harbinger of an era in which lofty scientific principles were ladled out to the general populace who was already wonderstruck at the breathtaking progress and innovation science was parading in front of the world. Desmond Morris is a zoologist and worked as the curator of the London Zoo. He wrote extensively on human sociobiology and is the author of many books. This is his first and most successful work, which was translated into 28 languages and brought out in 12 million copies. Morris does not keep readers in suspense for long on what he means by the term ‘naked ape’. The very first sentence of the book runs as “There are 193 living species of monkeys and apes. 192 of them are covered with hair. The exception is a naked ape self-named Homo sapiens”. Perhaps this is the only instance in the entire book in which our own species is clearly spelt out by name. On all other occasions, we have to put up with being called ‘the naked ape’, in a somewhat derogatory style.The genetic-cultural differences that made man distinct from other species of apes are explained by the author. We were once confined to an arboreal habitat of forests. The shrinkage of forest cover through climate change forced this ape to compete with ground-dwellers and adapt to the grasslands. This forced the ape to assume a more upright posture to become fast and better runners. Its hands were freed from locomotion duties and became efficient weapon holders. Brains became more complex which rendered them brighter and quicker decision makers. These changes blossomed together over evolutionary timescales. A hunting ape or a killer ape was thus formed. All other apes are vegetarians who might occasionally munch on insects or beetles. But the naked ape turned carnivorous with longer spaced out meals. From tool-using to tool-making animals, he perfected hunting techniques and social cooperation. It is curious to learn that social organization developed with improvement in killing techniques.Then comes the interesting issue of how we happened to be naked, or how the fur coat was eventually discarded. The hunting ape is said to have become an infantile ape by a process called neoteny. This is an interesting phenomenon by which animals retain certain juvenile or infantile characteristics into adult life. Chimpanzees complete brain growth within twelve months of birth. Humans typically have only a quarter of the adult brain size at birth, and its growth is completed only around 23 years of age, long after the individual has attained sexual maturity. Infantile apes are generally having less hair than adults in their species and we fixed upon this trait throughout the entire life. Playfulness marks adult humans separate from other animals. Inquisitiveness and curiosity are the two other qualities neoteny has bestowed on us. This was essential to such creatures that do not possess a fixed, permanent habitat or diet, that helped him to learn, adjust and adapt quickly to novel challenges. Being a sociobiologist, Morris delves into the development of the traditional role of women as homemakers, without going outside the dwelling place for hunting, or its modern equivalent – working. Because of the extremely long period of dependency of the young and the heavy demands on personal attention made by them, the females found themselves perpetually engaged in childrearing and as a consequence, confined to the home base of the community. This peculiar behaviour also led to monogamy. Males had to leave their mates at home while they went on hunting expeditions. These women were thus vulnerable to advances by other males in the group. This was a recipe for friction among the males, whose complete cooperation was mandated by the laborious hunting process. This situation demanded a major shift in social behaviour. Development of pair-bonding and proto-family was a direct consequence of this and ensured a mate to every member of the group.This book presents a fascinating hypothesis on the origin of the concept of god in primitive human societies, which I cannot help reproducing here. Before evolving into cooperative hunters, humans lived in social groups as seen in other species of apes and monkeys. Each group was dominated by a single, male leader who was active in protecting the group from outside hazards and settling internal squabbles. His stature was all-powerful and hence functionally similar to an omnipotent god. When that community turned to group hunting, the leader lost his god-like status. The cooperative spirit required for a successful communal hunt limited the authority of dominant individuals only to ensure loyalty from other members. In effect, shedding the exclusivity, he became ‘one of them’, as a more tolerant, cooperative leader. This change in order of things left a gap in the social mind and the vacancy was filled by the invention of god as protector of all the members of the group.This book was written at the height of the Cold War, in the midst of the devastating Vietnam War. A nuclear holocaust was more than possible – in fact, it was really probable. Concern at the uncertainty of a bright future is visible in the author’s prognostication about what awaits the human race. He claims that there was a strong chance of extermination by the end of the century, by the year 2000. However, he claims that we have a consolation that we had an exciting term of office. Morris’ arguments are extensive and his reasoning extends its roots into the twin treasure-troves of evolutionary biology and sociology. This makes the book a pleasure to read, which triumphantly defends its position as one among the best titles in popular science books even at the lapse of half a century after its first publication.The book is highly recommended."
21,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,4,"The conceit of this book is to cast a zoologist's eye over the human species, reporting its behaviour as we would any other species. It can be disconcerting in places, but always interesting. The argument is that humans reveal today, irrespective of layers of reason and culture, our inherent natures as a fruit-eating, forest-dwelling social ape turned carnivorous hunter on the savanna.On the other hand, it's not clear how much of this populist treatment is rooted in real science. All too often, there is a speculative turn of phrase: Maybe this behaviour is due to such-and-such; Maybe some other behaviour is because of this-and-that. And it seems anything can be explained when you can pick and choose from our mixed heritage (from forest and savanna). I don't mean to suggest that I necessarily disagree with the hypotheses, just that I would have liked to have seen a more evidence-based treatment. But that would have resulted in a longer and less entertaining treatment.The book's vintage shows through too. The preoccupation with the threat of nuclear warfare, and the absence of any concern with climate change, is one mark of this."

26,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23683935-benjamin-rubenstein,5,"Like ""Sapiens"" and ""Ishmael,"" this book has the potential to alter your paradigm. It's written by a zoologist who isn't bashful about using his expertise to share his perspective. Which is that humans are animals. I think most people get that conceptually, but say it aloud over and over again--humans are animals--and then maybe it'll click that we're like monkeys, lions, ants, black bears, whatever. That concept clicked soon after picking up this book, and once it did I thought of our species differently. Hopefully that perspective stays with me.Until reading this, I hadn't thought of using modern-day people in Western cultures as the subjects when studying people. I always thought it was better to use less advanced people, or people from 10,000 years ago, as models when considering the way people are ""supposed"" to be. Morris blasts that notion. If we were studying any other animal in the world, wouldn't we study the most successful ones first? And if so, shouldn't we also study the most successful humans? ""Success"" is subjective. It could be the most populous group, the most technologically advanced group, whatever. But it definitely doesn't mean the group that is, or nearly is, extinct. So let's say we'd study modern-day Western people and assume they are the animal: that is this book.Morris makes generalizations and reaches far to make some points, and I have no idea if some of the science in this book still holds up, but I don't think that matters. It's a quick read that may change the way you view people, our place in the animal kingdom, and the reasons we do anything, and for that possible perspective-changing ability alone, I'm 5-starring this.Here are a couple of my favorite quotes:If we set aside the secondary functions of these activities (the making of money, gaining of status, and so forth), then they all emerge, biologically, either as the extension into adult life of infantile play-patterns, or as the super-imposition on to adult information-communication systems of 'play-rules'. These rules can be stated as follows: (1) you shall investigate the unfamiliar until it has become familiar; (2) you shall impose rhythmic repetition on the familiar; (3) you shall vary this repetition in as many ways as possible; (4) you shall select the most satisfying of these variations and develop these at the expense of others; (5) you shall combine and recombine these variations one with another; and (6) you shall do all this for its own sake, as an end in itself. ...The last rule is particularly important. ...For many species of animals...this is no exploration for exploration's sake. But, amongst the higher mammals and to a supreme extent in ourselves, it has become emancipated as a distinct, separate drive. Its function is to provide us with as subtle and complex an awareness of the world around us, and of our own capacities in relation to it, as possible.Long before our populations reach the levels envisaged above we shall have broken so many of the rules that govern our biological nature that we shall have collapsed as a dominant species. We tend to suffer from a strange complacency that this can never happen, that there is something special about us, that we are somehow above biological control. But we are not. Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else. If it is to be later rather than sooner, then we must take a long, hard look at ourselves as biological specimens and gain some understanding of our limitations. This is why I have written this book, and why I have deliberately insulted us by referring to us as naked apes ... We must somehow improve in quality rather than in sheer quantity. If we do this, we can continue to progress technologically in a dramatic and exciting way without denying our evolutionary inheritance. If we do not, then our suppressed biological urges will build up and up until the dam bursts and the whole of our elaborate existence is swept away in the flood."
27,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,4,"This is a fascinating read on many levels. The main topic alone - a picture of human mammals from a zoologist's point of view - is a brilliant brain excercise, and an eye-opener too. As the book was first published in the 1960s, it is also very interesting to observe how science progressed since then. Last but not least, this book provides good evidence that science - despite its ambition of objectivity - is subject to trends and fashions of its time. This is not to say that the book is totally outdated; quite the contrary, I think it is still very relevant and everyone would benefit from making an acquaintance with it. A very valid point has been made there - that we are what we are, i.e. animals with animal instincts - but now and then the reader will stumble upon startling remarks or facts which no longer can be taken as evidence as they belong to the realm of history. I don't think there are many researchers today who would dare call modern hunter-gatherers 'societies that went wrong'. No one is able to analyse the nature of corporal punishment of schoolchildren today as it's been largely abandoned. The arguments based on the women's inclination to stay at home are becoming invalid, too. Having all that in mind, the book is still informative, decently argued, and very well written - a real page turner, so it is!"

Even if one fully agrees (which is not the case) to his proposition of women being the care takers and men being the hunters, why did he not explain the evolutionary consequences of the former and just focussed on latter? Talking about female orgasm as pseudo male activity, talking about sexual signalling only in terms of one way road (women need to please men! Ugh) and his important warning of not keeping men sexually frustrated if our species is to survive! All this clears the air about him being neutral! His condescending remarks and sheer insult of professionals from other fields while he proudly refuses to credit them for their valuable work just added the last bit needed to complete his author's arrogant personality.Even though in the end he reminds us to be humble as species but his entire book is a perfect example of anthropocentricism.

31,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112166097-barack-liu,4," 227-The Naked Ape-Desmond Morris-Nature-1967Barack2019/07/082020/06/23 - Biologically, people are divided, Mammal, primates, hominids, human genus Homo sapiens, is the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and gibbon apes belong to the superfamily of primates. ""Naked Ape"" was first published in the UK in 1967. It treats humans as a kind of hairless apes and explores various human behaviors from a biological point of view. Desmond Morris was born in Wiltshire, England in 1928. He studied at the University of Birmingham with a degree in zoology and a Ph.D. from Oxford University. He is a famous zoologist in England. Representative works: ""Naked Ape"", ""Human Zoo"", ""Intimate Behavior"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Origin2. Sex3. Parenting4. Explore5. Fight6. Foraging and eating7. Finishing and comfort8. People and animals ""The Analects"" says, ""A gentleman has three precepts: when he is young, his blood is indeterminate, but he is in color; he is strong, his blood is strong, he is in fighting; he is old, his blood is declining, he is in good faith. ""The need for sex, the desire to hunt, and the unsatisfied desire are the nature of animals. It is extremely difficult to control these three instinctive impulses with reason. Millions of years ago, due to some reason, most likely due to climate change, the arboreal apes that originally lived in the forest had to walk out of the forest and leave the branches to stand on the ground, and became hunting apes in order to get enough food. In the process of evolution of hunting apes, although seemingly distinctive naked apes have gradually formed, naked apes still reflect the characteristics of typical primates and typical carnivores. Naked apes maintain their juvenile development, allowing the development of the brain to continue for a long time. The long developmental process will bring a heavy burden of parenting for females, which requires naked apes to form a more stable spouse relationship to complete the nurturing of the next generation. In order to ensure that this goal can be achieved, nature seems to give the naked ape stronger sexual stimulation as compensation. Even in the social structure of naked apes where multiple spouses are allowed, the vast majority of members still adopt a one-to-one monogamy relationship due to the high cost of parenting . From the perspective of species, reproduction is the biggest mission. In this process, ""sex"" plays an extremely important role. The sexual behavior of naked apes is typically different from other 192 species of apes. The females of other apes do not seem to have an orgasm, and the sexual intercourse process is often extremely short, usually only lasting 15 times. The estrus period of females is also very short, they often leave immediately after the end of sexual intercourse, ready for the next sexual act at any time, so as not to miss the precious opportunity for fertilization. The female of the naked ape will continue to lie down to rest after the sexual intercourse is completed, immersed in the aftermath of a certain orgasm. Not only that, except for a few periods, the sexual activity of naked apes is almost unaffected. This means that even during pregnancy, female naked apes can still meet the sexual needs of male naked apes, thereby enhancing the mate relationship. The strengthening of sexual stimulation will bring about another problem, that is, when the spouses are separated, there must be a mechanism to inhibit the sexual behavior of naked apes, otherwise the social structure of monogamy will be destroyed. This is for raising the next generation. It was almost a devastating blow. The most obvious measure is to cover the fig leaf. The genitals and sexual behavior must be covered up and become a kind of extremely important privacy. The cold protection effect of clothing is not revealed until the naked ape goes out of the tropics. In addition, there are other means, such as to cover secondary sexual characteristics, shaving the child, such as armpit hair shave; remove the smell of the body; prohibition of physical contact. Naked apes need to strengthen the sexual stimulation between their spouses on the one hand, and weaken the sexual stimulation between non-mates on the one hand, so as to maintain the stability of monogamy and ensure that the cooperative relationship of the entire social structure is not destroyed. Some science fiction novels make some bold conjectures, such as: baby farms, social behavior, selective sterilization, and division of labor. For now, these behaviors are contrary to the biological instincts of naked apes. If they are implemented on a large scale one day, it can almost be concluded that the social structure and lifestyle of naked apes will undergo unimaginable changes, and the impact of changes in sexual and parenting behavior will be extremely profound. "" Among the existing 4237 mammals, almost no animal can be found suitable for survival without fur. Mammals are different from their reptile ancestors. They have an unparalleled advantage in their physiological characteristics. They can maintain a constant comparison. High body temperature. This makes the delicate machine with physiological functions suitable for efficient operation. This attribute is neither easily damaged nor easily abandoned. The body's thermostat is extremely important. Thicker, hairy and insulated The epidermis obviously plays an important role in preventing heat loss. Under strong sunlight, it can also prevent high body temperature and prevent direct sun burns to the skin. Therefore, if body hair is to fall off, obviously there must be a very good reason To give it up. Apart from a few rare exceptions, mammals acquired a new medium in evolution after referral to take this drastic step change. Flying mammals, such as bats, were forced to remove their body hair on both wings, but the body hair of other parts was still preserved, so they cannot be included as a nude species. Several burrowing mammals have greatly reduced body hair, such as voles, aardvarks, and armadillos. Aquatic mammals, such as whales, dolphins, mermaids, manatees, and seahorses, also lose their body hair as their bodies become streamlined. However, for all typical mammals that live on the surface, whether it is an animal jumping on the ground or an animal climbing on plants, the densely covered skin is an inevitable law. Except for the unusually large rhinoceros and elephants (which have special problems with their heat preservation and cooling mechanisms), naked apes are unique mammals without body hair . "" If we study humans from a biological point of view , ignore the fact that we are humans, and try our best to adopt a relatively objective attitude to study humans as animals. In fact, many interesting new ideas will be obtained. These biological insights may enable us to better understand many social phenomena. "" We know that the climate has undergone unfavorable changes. By about 15 million years ago, the scale of their forest fortresses dropped sharply. The ancestors of monkeys were forced to do two things. One of the two must be one of them: or they still defend the forest. The dilapidated hometown, or bravely faced the fate of being expelled from the Garden of Eden as the Bible says. Chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons and orangutans remained in the woods, and their numbers have been declining ever since. There is only another kind that exists apes - naked ape ancestors blaze a way out of it. they withdraw into the forest wilderness, engaged in fierce competition, the oath has been highly adaptable animal life on the ground is assessed by this risky step, but it is the outcome of evolution. In short, this adventure has been greatly rewarded. "" Even during the careful evolution of organisms . Also experienced several important adventures . These risky decisions influence so far-reaching, it determines the millions of years later, his race would die out , or will evolve into more advanced species . ""The predatory ancient apes are basically a group of males. Females are busy raising children and cannot take the main role in hunting prey. As the complexity of hunting increases, the time for hunting gradually increases, and it is necessary to abandon ancestors drifting and migrating. Lifestyle. Therefore, a fixed residence is needed to bring the prey back to the fixed base. Females and cubs wait at home for the males to return from hunting and share food. The step of fixing the residence will be seen in later chapters. , And will have a profound impact on all aspects of today’s most perfectly developed apes. "" As early human Australopithecus social division of labor during the formation of straight to this day , still a profound impact on our society. In family life, the man primarily responsible for the provision of social resources , to feed the family. While women are primarily responsible for providing resources , to breed and raise offspring. To this day, our tendency to choose a spouse basically follows this line of thinking. Men are eager to marry young, beautiful women , which implies that she has a strong ability to reproduce. Women desire to marry rich and loyal men, which means that they have the will and ability to provide a favorable living environment for themselves and their offspring. "" Fundamentally, we originated from a carnivore in the primate order. Among the existing monkeys and apes, our evolution is very unique. But this evolutionary change is not uncommon among animals of other subjects. For example, the giant panda is an animal that has completely transformed in evolution. This example is exquisite. We have changed from a vegetarian animal to a carnivore, while the giant panda has changed from a carnivore to a vegetarian animal. Just like us. The giant panda is an incomparable and very unique animal. One important thing is that the animal created by this violent transformation has a dual personality. Once it crosses the threshold between the two species, it plunges into its new role. Moving forward with great evolutionary energy-it has become too fast, so it still carries many original qualities. The time for evolution is not sufficient, it is too late to get rid of all the original features, just put on the surface features in a hurry. When primitive fish have just overcome the water-free obstacles in their terrestrial life, their terrestrial animal qualities have evolved by leaps and bounds, but they still embrace the characteristics of aquatic animals. To complete a perfect and dramatic new species, it will take millions of years. The pioneers who walk in the front are usually bizarre mixed animals. The naked ape is just such a mixed four different elephants. His entire body and the lifestyle of the pond are suitable for arboreal life, but suddenly (the so-called sudden is from the slow evolutionary process), he was thrown into a completely different world. "" "" Carnivores give birth to fleas, but primates do not. Monkeys and apes are plagued by lice and are also infected with some parasitic diseases. However, contrary to popular belief, they are not fleas at all; therefore, there are A very convincing reason. To understand this, we must first examine the life cycle of the flea. When a flea lays eggs, it does not lay on the host, but in the sleeping home of the host. The flea eggs hatch after 3 days. Wriggling little maggots. These larvae do not suck blood, but live on the dust collected in their dens. After another two weeks, the larvae cocoon and pupate. The pupae become adults after resting in the cocoon for about half a month and emerge from the cocoon. Find a suitable host. It can be seen that at least during the first month of its life cycle, the flea is separated from its host. Obviously, mammals that do not settle down, such as monkeys or apes, are not troubled by fleas. This is the reason. Even if one or two fleas accidentally land on a primate and successfully mate, the eggs they lay cannot be taken away by the primate because the primate is constantly migrating. When the flea pupae emerge from the cocoon, there will be no host waiting for them ""at home"", maintaining the host and guest relationship with them. Therefore, fleas are parasites of animals in fixed dwellings. For example, typical carnivores are such animals. "" "" First of all, the naked ape sense organs are not suitable for life on the ground. His sense of smell is too weak, his ears keen enough. His physique is too weak to withstand the grueling endurance test experience, not to break out like thunder lightning sprint, This weakness is irreparable. In terms of personality, he is more competitive, not more cooperative, and he is undoubtedly not good at planning and focusing. Fortunately, his brain is extremely good. In general intelligence, he surpassed his rival carnivore. With the help of walking upright, he has transformed both his hands and feet; through further improvements in his brain and dedicated use of the brain, he may be successful. "" "" If we look at a typical monkey fetus, we will be able to understand the most profoundly why the juvenile persistence mechanism contributes to the development and development of the primate brain. The brain during the fetal period of the monkey develops rapidly, growing up and becoming complex. The baby monkey is born. , Its brain has reached 70% of the mature brain. The remaining 30% are fully developed in the first 6 months after birth. Even chimpanzee babies with higher intelligence have brain development within 12 months after birth Be completed. Our species is in sharp contrast to this. The brain volume of a baby at birth is only 23% of that of an adult. During the 6 years after birth, children’s brains continue to develop rapidly, but the entire developmental period of the human brain can only be completed at about 23 years of age. This shows that for you and me, after sexual maturity, brain development will continue for 10 years. However, for chimpanzees, brain development has been completed for six or seven years before reproductive capacity becomes active. "" "" Infant monkeys and chimpanzees also like to play, explore, and are creative, but they die soon at this stage. However, for naked apes, these infancy characteristics will continue until they mature. In adulthood. He has enough time to imitate and learn all the techniques designed by his ancestors. In terms of physique and instinct, he has many shortcomings as a hunter. However, his intelligence and imitating ability can make up for its shortcomings and More than enough. The way and depth he accepts his parents' teaching is beyond the reach of any other animal. "" In the flesh, humans do not have the advantage of competing with large carnivores. But the reason why we can get to this point. Mainly rely on the wisdom of individuals is superb , and the organization of social groups. "
32,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2094984-weston,5,"""The Naked Ape"" is remarkable. It embodies precisely the type of popular-science literature I love to read: the matter-of-fact pointing out of things which, having been pointed out, seem totally obvious, as if Desmond Morris were just reciting things I already knew but hadn't gotten around to actually realizing yet. His observations run that gamut of what he terms ""typical"" human behavior and physiology. That is, at the time of this book's writing (as now) anthropologists and sociologists commonly made the atypical specimens and their behaviors the focus of their studies. Were other scientists engaged in the study of lifeforms to do similarly they would never get anywhere. Perhaps out of vanity, perhaps out of a lack of self-awareness, science has historically avoided turning its objective eye toward the scientist (obvious and irrelevant exceptions of medical science excluded). Luckily for us, Desmond Morris undertook this endeavor and his findings are not only fascinating but wildly entertaining.A great deal of the pleasure derived from this book is in the way that Morris so ruthlessly picks apart his subject. The book's title itself is a playful and astutely humbling jab at the subject which drives straight to the heart of his message: human beings are first and foremost animals. Apes, to be precise, and our principal distinguishing feature, from a zoological standpoint, from our ape cousins is no more than our lack of a shaggy coat. We may drive around in fancy cars, work in skyscrapers, level mountains, dam rivers, etc. At the end of the day, we're still a bunch of naked apes. Which isn't to say that we aren't members of an incredibly resourceful and clever species, fascinating from all angles and fascinated by all things. Because we are unique, we are remarkable. Still, it is no more than gross vanity that makes us suppose that our manipulation of the external environment or the complexity and ingeniousness of our cultural expression has enabled us to overcome the fact that we are ""still very much a biological phenomenon... subject to all the basic laws of animal behavior.""Morris arms his reader with a new arsenal of cocktail party factoids, some endearing, some disgusting, some depressing, others hilarious, which alone make the read worthwhile. For instance, the size and shape of human breasts suggest that they have developed, through many centuries of sexual selection, as sexual signaling devices rather than merely as organs used to feed infants. That is, human breasts are actually not very good feeding devices when compared to those of other apes. The nipple typically isn't shaped to fit easily into the infant mouth and the excess tissue around it can even obstruct the baby's breathing. And yet breasts are universally used to spectacular success in piquing the interest of potential mates and, it could go without saying, play an enormous secondary role in human intercourse, behavior which is seen nowhere else in the animal kingdom. The evolutionary reasons for this development, believe it or not, are fascinatingly and intimately woven into our ancestors struggle for survival as the first carnivorous apes on the ancient plains of Africa.Having been first published in the 60's, ""Naked Ape"" is somewhat outdated. Morris' characterization of indigenous societies as atypical cultural failures makes sense from the coldly zoological perspective from which he was attempting to write, but fails to take into consideration historical truths which invite explanations beyond a socities' supposed lack of functionality. Modern readers will be equally squeamish by the occasional reference made to the ""negroid race"" and the interpretation of homosexuality as little more than deviant behavior caused by abnormal childhood experiences. Present day sensitivities aside, Morris is nevertheless quite forward-thinking and the intellectual merits of the book by far exceed whatever flags might be raised by your inner-p.c. reactionary.As entertaining a book as it is, Morris' tone and message is ultimately one of apocalyptic foreboding. We naked apes have been so spectacularly successful as a species that we have come to think of ourselves as invincible and we are not. Our success will, sooner rather than later, catch up with us because the global economy of environmental resources is, after all, finite. The modern reader will recognize all too well that the book's imperative rings even truer today, despite Morris' having to sound like a fanatic at the time of its initial publishing. Ironically, Morris suggests, the naked ape's first step toward salvation will be the recognition of his true nature. To go forward we have to take an honest look at where we came from."

Written by a man obviously trying to stroke his own ego by arguing how ""objectively,"" when you look at it from the impartial perspective of a rational (male) scientist, early hominids clearly evolved to walk upright, lose their fur, use tools, develop spoken language, etc. ALL so that males could hunt in groups like wolves or lions. Literally every physiological feature of the modern homo sapien, according to the ""impartial"" male Desmond Morris, was led by ""hot-blooded,"" aggressive alpha males to hunt and kill. The invention of tools being so men could hunt; walking upright so men could see over grass; learning to talk so men could communicate complex hunting strategies; the loss of fur so men wouldn't die of heatstroke running in the hot African climate, etc.And the women? Oh, they just evolved to be child-rearers and home-makers. They sat around in caves suckling their babes like mama wolves in their dens with cubs (never mind that real mother wolves are out of the den in weeks, and often dump their pups on a babysitter as soon as they possibly can) waiting with baited breath for the menfolk to come home and share the spoils of the hunt with them.And all the physical features early female hominids not covered by his ""male hunting"" explanation? Like female hominid larger breasts, wider birthing hips, hominids developing downward facing noses, etc? Oh, they just evolved to ""make sex sexier."" (I'm not kidding. That's what it says in the book.) Female hominids have larger breasts than other greater apes? It's because the males found it sexy. Female hominids have wider hips? Males found it sexy. Downward facing noses? Same thing. Homo sapiens have fuller lips than other greater apes? Because it made kissing sexier, and kissing is a great evolutionary foreplay to sex.The minute I stopped reading was when Desmond Morris claimed that (white) homo sapiens having pink lips because it gave them a pouty kissable look, thus making them look more kissable, thus more desirable as a mate. And what of certain black Africans who tend to have enough melanin in their skin not to have pink lips, and/or have fuller, puffier lips? According to Desmond Morris, it's because they're evolutionary failures who had to evolve fuller lips to make up for not having the desired pink lips that more evolutionary successful (white) homo sapiens possess. (Which, according to him, are like those living in North America. Not the ""obscure"" cultures in Africa that are ""not as evolutionary successful,"" his words. Never mind that white 'North American' culture as we know it has only existed for a few centuries at most, and hasn't withstood the test of time the way the 'obscure' African cultures have, which have stood for centuries, if not millennia.) This book is a transparent straight white male ego stroke, where a guy who fancies himself ""rational"" and ""objective"" breaks his arm patting himself, as a straight white male homo sapien, on the back for being ""an evolutionary success."" According to him, EVERY SINGLE physiological trait of the entire modern homo sapien species came from (presumably white) men of eons past being big strong hunters. Women and people of color were just hanger-ons who reaped the evolutionary benefits of the past (presumably) straight white male hunters' ingenuity. And every trait females have that males (presumably) don't is because the males found it sexy, or it aided in bearing the males' children. And every trait that people of color have that whites don't was formed to compensate the ""evolutionary disadvantage"" of not being white.Also, I took a few anthropology classes in community college. Almost every point he ever made has been largely disproven, or called into serious question. Fuck this guy, fuck this book. The fact that people still read this sexist, racist drivel and see it as anything resembling fact is frankly insulting to the whole homo sapien species."
35,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19627177-n-jr,5,"A fascinating read by a great thinker. Virtually no aspect of human nature and physiognomy escapes his keen zoologist eyes; even responses such as smiling, laughing and crying. However, be warned: not only is this book nearly 50 years old and therefore outdated, but one must ingest his words with a large heaping of salt. As a scientific treatise it fails. The best way to read it is to consider this the personal musings of a biologist/anthropologist, not the findings of an expert researcher. It's greatest value is in instigating thought on the subject. It is the step-back-and look-at-ourselves approach which is of real value here, not his (sometimes hilarious)conclusions.His explanation of the protuberance and shape of female breasts developing as a frontal sexual display resulting from our upright posture, rather than for increased efficiency of nursing, is presented as a credible argument. Mmm, maybe that explains the human male's fascination with them.Most of his observations are comparative, highlighting similarities and differences between other mammals, notably the chimpanzee. In all cases, Morris makes us think about many aspects of ourselves that we normally take for granted.One criticism I have is his over-emphasis on genetic origins - for example, he claims the pair-bond formation between sexes (i.e monogamy) is genetic rather than cultural - afraid I disagree there. Also his treatment of warfare is incomplete and not entirely satisfactory for me.I know others will attack the author as chauvinistic (not only in regards the sexes, but cultures as well), but still, hey, the book can just be considered food for thought.All in all, a stimulating read, one so rich that I have marked it for a second time around in the future. It helped me to come up with my own thoughts on the subject"
36,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4373676-jonathan-david-jackson,5,"Really a very interesting book. It's written as if the author were writing it about any other animal, and hearing myself talked about as if I am a naked mole rat or a chimpanzee is very refreshing (this doesn't give you permission to refer to me as such in polite society, btw). We are animals as much as any other, and we should consider all the things that make us what we are, including our animal instincts and our biological history.There are some ideas I think are odd, for example when he says that adults want to save elephants from extinction mainly because of our own impending individual extinction (death). Some things seem like just his opinion, and don't make sense to me. All the ideas, though - every single one - I found to be interesting. There were plenty of things I'd heard before (after all, it's a 40 year old book), but there were also plenty of things I hadn't heard which were totally new to me, and made me reconsider some of my own ideas. One such idea I have is that clothes are something unnatural, something to be avoided. He puts it to us that humans are a very sexual species, unlike other animals which have a mating season we are ready all the time, and unlike other animals which need to do something special to display their genitals ours are visible all the time, so to avoid making sexual displays to everyone all the time, we cover up. I've thought about most of my opinions long and hard for many years, and reading anything that makes me consider changing them is a rare and wonderful experience which had me turning each page almost in awe at what I had found before and might find after.I have the other two books in this series, and I can't wait to read them next."
37,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180947-j,3,"Desmond Morris raises some interesting points in this book, some more farfetched than others. Honestly, I have problems with a lot of the points he makes in this book. Attempting to explain everything we do by comparing us to our nearest relatives in the animal kingdom is like I said interesting but the truth is many of our behaviors are unique to our species because of our advanced intellect and I think simplifying them by saying they can be explained by looking at the behaviors of other primates is not entirely accurate. Furthermore, he makes a few mistakes I wouldn't expect anyone familiar with biology to make (including the 'tongue-map' for taste recognition) as well as taking a very eurocentric stance on human behavior. His postulations aren't really backed up with anything more than the observation of other primates which by itself can't really be used to explain our behavior. Along with his insistance on using North Americans and Europeans as the model for humanity, I have to say that this book is more rooted in speculation than fact and shouldn't be taken seriously as a work of science. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining read and worthy of the 3 stars I gave it."
38,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027404-david-o-brien,5,"Fascinating reading and life affirming in an unexpected way. The most common complaint about this book is lack of evidence or proof. Morris states clearly that he did not list all the evidence because it would turn the book into an encyclopedia. There is a bibliography at the end for those who want to see where he got his information and inspiration.The style of the book is not purely scientific in so far as he he makes assumptions and draws conclusions from his own experience and his research, which makes for very interesting reading, however can be interpreted as imprecise. Just because something is not 100% proven, that does not mean that it is not interesting, relevant, thought provoking or inspirational. Throughout the book there are segments I might not wholly agree with, however the scope of the book is so vast yet still well tied together and coherent that it deserves 5/5. A brave book that even today is refreshing, educational, inspiring and a break from convention."
39,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763793-jean,3,"I disagree with those who say this book is homophobic and/or misogynistic. Morris says some things that in normal conversational context might be dubbed as such, but his explicit purpose was to view mans behavior from an objective standpoint. He succeeds. Political correctness has no place in (even attempted) scientific writing. He DOES state that gay couples cannot procreate on their own. However he goes on to discuss scenarios where this may be a pro. Don't overreact. When I read this book, I was unaware it was written decades ago. Morris' observations were fairly elementary to me, I assume since I grew up hearing a good deal of them. It is still quite enjoyable to read despite my experience. "
40,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56218095-benehime,2,"In theory a good book, but so Sooooo outdated. The author adopts a super-alpha-male stance and women have only evolved because it served men. Don't you think they did anything other than having children!! Morris thinks that working is today's form of hunting and women obviously have no place there. also, male relaxing can only ever happen with an all male group. There are some interesting parts though, I loved the chapter about grooming and fighting (sad to see that he left out the vastly different way men and women fight, but oh, I forgot, women don't)."
41,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5155466-clare,2,"I found this book to be very disappointing. Morris makes some interesting statements about human behavior, but unfortunately, he has almost nothing that could be called evidence for anything that he poses as fact. Although at first I thought I might be unfairly judging it because his sexual politics differ from mine and his understanding of human sexuality is dated to say the least, his statements on non-sex-related behaviors are equally unsupported."
42,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,4,"Very fun and interesting. The chapter on sex is laugh out loud hilarious at many points. There are a few outdated ideas present which betray the year this was written (1967) but nonetheless Morris displays a fine understanding of evolutionary theory and animal behavior and applies it with wit and clear, concise language to our upright species."
43,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3724839-michael,2,"This book started great and fizzled. Anthropologists unite! If you can force yourself to trudge through to the end, there is interspersed along the way some very interesting segments. Stay the course....mgc"
44,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/889924-kagama-the-literaturevixen,1,I dont contradict the authors statement that humans are animals and that we share some of the same urges. But I question his research and the broad way he makes wild allegations as an effort to shock the reader.
45,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,2,"Unfortunately, this book did not meet my expectations. Written in the 70's of the last century, this book is to technical and science minded. It did not adapt to the highly enjoyable Morris's books of later times."
46,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12353805-carol,5,"An incredible study of man, viewed as an animal. Why we are this way? Why naked? How we mate? How we show fear? How our family structure is set? It's really incredible, and with sound logic."

50,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"Read this when I was 15. At the time it impressed me very much by its broad scope. Since then, I've learned Morris is despised by scientists. I can imagine why, but I really can't Judge."
51,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,3,"Objective SummaryThis book explores the evolution, biology, psychology, and sociology of human beings. Morris refers to humans as the “naked ape” in an attempt to remove his cultural and experiential biases from his analysis, and to remind his readers that they, like all humans, are just evolved animals. Morris attempts to objectively describe human beings’ features, behavior, and the reasons for both in the same way a zoologist would describe any newly discovered species. The defining characteristic about human beings is our intelligence. But that intelligence is mapped crudely onto base animalistic tendencies and necessities. Rather than jumping straight to our intelligence, which may cloud important but elementary observations, Morris refers to us as the “naked ape,” a statement on our physical appearance as nearly hairless primates. Despite any attempts to ignore or transcend our animal roots, they persist. Morris explores human evolution, sex, child rearing, exploration, fighting, feeding, pursuit of comfort, and interaction with other animals. Listed below are some of the main lessons and interesting tidbits.•	Humans evolved from monkeys and apes. We moved from forests to the plains, though one theory suggests we moved from forests to seaside coasts to the plains. •	We moved from a vegetarian to an omnivore diet when we left the forest. This required cooperative hunting and defensive parties of males within the social hierarchy. This cooperation could now be a contributing factor to the development of gangs and wars.•	Neoteny, or extension of childhood development, played a significant role in human evolution. It allowed the human brain to continue to develop and grow for decades after birth, and it required pair-bonding between males and females to support the extended adolescence of their offspring. •	Pair-bonding helped females remain faithful to their mates, it reduced social friction between males over mating access, and it helped in rearing the slow-developing children. Pair-bonding is powerful but imperfect. The female orgasm, which is unusual if not unique to humans, was a contributor to pair-bonding. •	Why humans are relatively hairless isn’t known with certainty. The most popular theory is that it aids cooling during times of extreme exertion, like hunting. •	Much of our appearance is sexual signaling. Relatively large penises and breasts, red lips, and hairlessness all likely have sexual origins. Pubic and armpit hair likely trap pheromones for sexual arousal. •	80% of mothers hold infants in their left arms most likely because their heartbeat soothes their young.•	Animals fight to establish the dominance hierarchy and defend territory. They do not use their weapons to try to kill members of their own species because that would not be evolutionarily advantageous. Successful species establish aggressive and submissive displays that can substitute for actual physical confrontation and reduce physical harm and death. Bowing and avoiding eye contact are submissive signs. Standing tall and direct eye contact are dominant or aggressive signs. •	Human weaponry permits fatal action from afar. Our inability to observe submissive signals may contribute to additional killing and destruction. •	Curiosity serves a vital function to an opportunistic species. It has led humans to discover new lands, invent new tools, and try new foods. Curiosity has expanded into arts, science, and technology. There is a perpetual balance between novelty and familiarity. We want the excitement of the former with the security of the latter. By pushing the boundaries and exploring, we discover new and better ways to feed, protect, and comfort ourselves. •	Human desire for sweet foods can lead to obesity.•	Humans domesticated dozens of species of animals for food (cows, chickens, goats, pigs), companionship (dogs, cats, horses), transportation (horses, camels, elephants), experimentation (mice, rats, guinea pigs), and other tasks like plowing and hauling heavy stuff (horses, donkeys, oxen). •	Dogs were likely domesticated when we took wolf pups to fatten them up for food. Then we realized they could help us hunt and alert us to danger. There are breeds of dogs that are herders, scent-trackers, setters and pointers to prey, retrievers, killers of vermin, and guard dogs.•	Animals have five basic relationships with other animals: prey, symbiont, competitor, parasite, and predator.•	Religion may have roots in the need for an ultimately powerful being at the top of a hierarchy.•	12,000 British kids listed their favorite animals as: 1. Chimpanzee, 2. Monkey, 3. Horse, 4. Bushbaby, 5. Panda, 6. Bear, 7. Elephant, 8. Lion, 9. Dog, 10. Giraffe. They tend to have anthropomorphic features like sitting or moving upright and having highly expressive faces.•	12,000 British kids listed their most hated animals as: 1. Snake, 2. Spider, 3. Crocodile, 4. Lion, 5. Rat, 6. Skunk, 7. Gorilla, 8. Rhinoceros, 9. Hippopotamus, 10. Tiger. These are all dangerous. •	To survive as a civilization and a species, we must recognize and submit to our biological features. They cannot all be overcome through thought, culture, or technology. Subjective ThoughtsI read this book because the dude in the movie “Bring It On” was reading it during a high school football game. It was interesting and thought-provoking, but much of the content seemed familiar. That makes sense since I am a naked ape and have interacted with them all my life. And I think much of this material was covered in my biology textbooks back in the day.It was impossible for me to miss how much a product of its time this book was. Written in 1967, Morris was only five years removed from the Cuban missile crisis, and nuclear annihilation was clearly on his mind. He also harbored Malthusian fears of continued population growth, resource strain, and territorial strife. He anticipated the Ehrlichs’ “Population Bomb,” which would be published one year later. He seemed quite pessimistic on both the nuclear annihilation and overpopulation fronts. If he were to update the book today, he’d no doubt include global cooling, I mean global warming, errr global climate change in his list of calamities. Fortunately, as I type this, nukes haven’t dropped in anger since ’45, Trump may be in the process of solving Korea, reproduction rates have slowed across the developed world and sometimes below replacement levels, and there are alternative albeit expensive energy sources. Not that I’m worried enough about any of this to shut off the air conditioner or my computer. And this Honeycrisp apple from Walmart is amazing. Morris should also update his advice on how to handle being pulled over by police. His suggestion is to immediately leave your car and approach the officer so that you two don’t interact on “your” territory near your car, which will make the officer feel threatened. That shit will get you shot today. Stay in your car with your hands on the wheel, and wait to move until you’re told. You don’t want to suddenly approach someone with a Glock 17 on standby.Memorable Quotes“A solitary monkey or ape is a vulnerable creature. It lacks the powerful natural weapons of the carnivore and in isolation falls easy prey to the stalking killers.”“It is only a wise primate, like our hunting ape, that knows its own father.”“The male reaches the consummatory act of sperm ejaculation within a few minutes in most cases, unless deliberate delaying tactics are employed. . . . Some females may reach this point very quickly, others not at all, but on the average it is attained between ten and twenty minutes after the start of copulation.”“Its normal, average length of nine and a half centimetres is increased by seven to eight centimetres. The diameter is also considerably increased, giving the species the largest erect penis of any living primate.”“After a gestation period of approximately 266 days her uterus begins to contract powerfully and rhythmically.”“The average weight of a baby at birth is just over seven pounds, which is slightly more than one-twentieth of the weight of the average parent.”“Lucky is the society that enjoys the gradual acquisition of a perfect balance between imitation and curiosity, between slavish, unthinking copying and progressive, rational experimentation.”“In all exploratory behaviour, whether artistic or scientific, there is the ever-present battle between the neophilic and neophobic urges. The former drives us on to new experiences, makes us crave for novelty. The latter holds us back, makes us take refuge in the familiar. We are constantly in a state of shifting balance between the conflicting attractions of the exciting new stimulus and the friendly old one. If we lost our neophilia we would stagnate. If we lost our neophobia, we would rush headlong into disaster.”“We are, to put it mildly, in a mess, and there is a strong chance that we shall have exterminated ourselves by the end of the century.”“Animals fight amongst themselves for one of two very good reasons: either to establish their dominance in a social hierarchy, or to establish their territorial rights over a particular piece of ground.” “If a species is to survive, it simply cannot afford to go around slaughtering its own kind. Intra-specific aggression has to be inhibited and controlled, and the more powerful and savage the prey-killing weapons of a particular species are, the stronger must be the inhibitions about using them to settle disputes with rivals.”“To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion. Abortion is a drastic measure and can involve serious emotional disturbance. Furthermore, once a zygote has been formed by the act of fertilization it constitutes a new individual member of society, and its destruction is, in effect, an act of aggression, which is the very pattern of behaviour that we are attempting to control. Contraception is obviously preferable, and any religious or other ‘moralizing’ factions that oppose it must face the fact that they are engaged in dangerous war-mongering.”“We each possess about 10,000 of these taste buds, but in old age they deteriorate and decrease in number, hence the jaded palate of the elderly gastronome. Surprisingly, we can only respond to four basic tastes. They are: sour, salt, bitter, and sweet.”“Domestication of livestock, involving the organized control and selective breeding of prey, is known to have been practised for at least ten thousand years and, in certain cases, probably much longer. Goats, sheep and reindeer appear to have been the earliest prey species dealt with in this way.”“It is probable that [an interspecific bond between humans and dogs] began as a result of young puppies being brought in to the tribal home base to be fattened as food.”“Unless we can colonize other planets on a massive scale and spread the load, or seriously check our population increase in some way, we shall, in the not-too-far distant future, have to remove all other forms of life from the earth. . . . We need not dwell on this nightmare: the possibility of its becoming a reality is remote.”"
52,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62596158-n-g-habsburg,3,"I enjoyed reading this (it's written in quite an amusing style) but I was hoping for something more heavy on the primatology. While it's a good review of instinctive human behaviour it is expectionally light into actual comparisons to other primates.He does make interesting points, e.g. noting that when the forests started to disappear we converged towards carnivore traits but by using artificial weapons rather than natural ones we did not need to move towards becoming like cats/dogs (though he doesn't note that other plains primates probably did so more than us). He notes the importance of us acquiring home bases where the females were left, and hence the need to develop more clear territories, pair bonds and ability to share food with family/tribe.He talks about how adolescents acquite the need to go off and develop their own home. But here he doesn't spend any time discussing what's actually known about how humans do this. It's actually remarkable how variable this is across different societies (albeit it generally has fixed form within a society). Sometimes it it the male, sometimes the female. These are generally species fixed traits, and yet he doesn't cover this.He talks about how the development of a pair bond meant that we needed to start hiding our sexual features in public. He notes that other species generally sustain the pair bond through aggression, but we do it instead by wearing clothes and avoiding touching each other.It's quite an old book and features some exceptional examples of envirionmentalist (e.g. blank slate) thinking from the era it was written, which is somewhat startling in a book which otherwise fully acknowledges that we are creatures driven by innate behaviours. For instance, he talks about how if a mother is tense and smiles to conceil it, the baby will detect it and mistake the function of a smile... he then warns that this could be permanently damaging and cause the child serious social difficulties... nuttier environmentalist claptrap than that is only spewed forth by modern SJWs but I guess it was par for the course back then. The section on music and it's relation to mothers heart beat is similarly whacko.A section of the book deals with our innate sounds/actions, e.g. laughter and smiling. Discussion about how they evolved is perhaps questionable. Notes things like when a baby smiles it waves it's arms and legs around, and suggests this is the vestigial primate clinging response. There's also curious little factoids, like our 'sweet tooth' being a distinct primate thing that other carnivores don't generally have.An interesting section is when he talks about how men go along to trade unions, social clubs , learned societies etc as an equivilent of the hunting pack. They do so to experience our built in bond from male togetherness. Interestingly, this was written before it became taboo to go to male only societies. One suspects that the author would not thus be suprised that membership of all voluntary societies has utterly collapsed since women were permitted to join them (see Putnam's 'Bowling Alone'). He also describes how work is probably a poor substitute for hunting for the working classes in a manner that it is not for the middle class. Expresses it in a manner that is probably illegal these days.A key point the author wants to get across in the book is that we're going through a population boom and being forced into living in environments increasingly more crowded and distrinct from what we evolved for. He talks about how the modern usage of soulless featureless architecture where everything looks the same flys against our built in desire to mark territory as our own through personalisation (declaring quite rightly that modern architects are terrorists). He is sceptical about the ability of us to adapt our innate behaviour. On that, he is probably correct. He could have argued his case better (and I believe that in his next book he went on to do so). "
53,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13626166-siddarth-gore,5,"So there he stands, our vertical, hunting, weapon-toting, territorial, neotenous, brainy, Naked Ape, a primate by ancestry and a carnivore by adoption, ready to conquer the world.We evolved from apes. But exactly how far did we get? Your guesses might be way off the mark. This book says that under the surface we are ruled mostly by our inner primates. Things just look different on us. Evolution is too slow a process for us to have shed our animal past.In our species there is, as we have seen, a strong tendency to ‘fall in love’—to develop a powerful bond with the object of our sexual attentions.No primates are monogamous so why are we? The answer comes from our adaptation to life on the plains of Africa once we were thrown out of the jungle perhaps due to environmental changes. Hint, pack hunters need cooperation from all males.They occur with particularly high frequency during the initial stages of social encounters, where hidden fears and aggressions are lurking just below the surface. At a dinner party, or any small social gathering, as soon as the mutual appeasement ceremonies of hand-shaking and smiling are over, displacement cigarettes, displacement drinks and displacement food-snacks are immediately offered.This was the most fascinating part. Monkeys and apes are very much social animals with hierarchy being most crucial thing on their minds. How did we get rid of that, or did we? Even the most innocuous conversations and meetings are anything but that for your social relations obsessed brain. To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion.His argument is that cramming animals in compact spaces invariably leads to aggression. We might think we are special but think again. Only way to make sure we do not turn against each other is to give everyone enough space. Debatable, but interesting viewpoint none the less.Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else.One can only hope ;-)"
54,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98103014-jonas,4,"This book was first published in 1967 and I found it to be somewhat of a foreboding book.I was first introduced into many of these concepts regarding “the naked ape’s” ecological role and behaviour from other books, such as Ishmael by Daniel Quinn and The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. Though those books are written about something else, I found myself thinking of those books while I was reading this one. Many of the arguments presented in those books could be paralleled with the comparative elements between the human and ape presented throughout this book.Each chapter though succinct, presents an interesting perspective on the anatomy of the human body, as well as our behavioural aspects against the bodies and social practices of other ape species. I thought many of the ideas were very inventive, but the chapter on sex comes across as crass and salacious, but otherwise, the book presents itself in a very tame manner.Whilst the book contains many fantastic ideas, I can see why this book created controversy within the feminist/homosexual communities. The book even manages to squeeze in a supporting message for contraceptives and population control. Overall, I think the book makes for an interesting read, but is by no means the best book regarding the topic especially in modern day, due to changing of the zeitgeist from the late 1960’s to the prevalence of technology today (even though some of the fears might still be present today). Despite that, I still think it’s worth a read to understand how it was relevant at that time, and how it has paved a way and introduced the idea of comparative ethology to the general public."
55,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705775-gerardo-alonso,4,"The Naked Ape is a mirror. While reading it, one sees a reflection of oneself. But unlike many other reflections, this one is raw and based on our biological characteristics. This reflection breaks down our egos and social constructs to their bare bones. Desmond Morris attempts to show humanity that we are merely a species of the Animal KingdomI found the book inspiring, and highly effective to understand characteristic behaviours we may have. It feels as if someone is saying what one has already known but could not figure out the words to explain it.While this book is very powerful philosophically, I think it lacks thoroughness in logic. One of the things that concerns me is that it seems to me that Morris takes a one-sided view of several arguments sometimes based on factoids/opinions that may debatable. Another difficulty I find is the ease of comparison between the Homo Sapiens and the apes. While true that we share a very similar DNA structure, I think that Morris not only tries to link biological similarities (which he does in a great way in the beginning of the book), but also behavioural similarities.I get that in some cases or themes, the behaviour among species will be the same. The fight or flight response, for example. But when highly specific social interactions are compared between species, Morris should have analysed the Naked Ape by itself.It may be the case that some of the science behind the book is outdated, since this was published in the 60s. Regardless of the leaps Morris takes, this book is worth reading as a biology, anthropology and history lesson of our species. "
56,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"I had a great time reading this book. Despite coming out almost fifty years ago when I found it, much of what it says is still thought provoking and relevant. The book owes a little bit to psychoanalysis which was more dominant at the time. Which is good since Morris uses it to good effect to tie together physiological and behavioral facts into a general theory of human nature. What is that theory of human nature? Well, that we are the way we are because our ancestors were forced to become a predator species/hunting-ape and couldn't stay in and around trees picking fruits. Millions of years ago in Africa, during the Miocene, the forests started to disappear, and the apes could either cling onto whatever was left, or leave the ""garden of Eden"" and enter into competition with the predators on the ground. Ape populations have dwindled since, and we have emerged the apex predator. To get to that point we had to overcome the other predators, but with inferior equipment so to speak; no fangs or claws. So we made use of two things carried over to a certain degree from our ape past; intelligence and social communication. ""His whole body, his way of life, was geared to a forest existence, and then suddenly he was jettisoned into a world where he could survive only if he began to live like a brainy, weapon toting wolf."" Our social lives are to this day built on a sort of tension between social communication and intellect (from ape life) and group loyalty and hunting from our predator existence. Vestiges of our ape life are our greater reliance on sight at the expense of smell and a more various taste palate. Our predator life involves traveling greater distances to find game, rather than remaining close to the trees, having a home base to protect and return to, and having regular meals rather than momentary snacking. Being a predatory ape means developing ways to facilitate male cooperation, to hunt together with dangerous weapons, and to guarantee a share of the kills and a female for the effort. Monogamy and private property likely arise from a need to secure the loyalty of males to females and children while they hunted and prevent conflict among the males. This isn't all bad, as the predator life means some degree of male solidarity. We can't have a single alpha male who gets exclusive access to women and food. The ability to cooperate and use weapon technology means the lesser males can gang up and resist, limit, or kill the alpha male. Thus some satisfactory distribution of females and resources becomes necessary for social order, and this is likely where marriage and property and even government developed from. Morris channels Sigmund Freud and argues that religion emerges from the guilt of (symbolically) killing the alpha ape. Even with all his faults, an all powerful male does instill some sort of order and security which is socially useful. You knew where you stood, and the alpha ape in a way encouraged exogamous mating, preventing incest by kicking the sons out of the harem. So religion projects the seemingly omnipotent alpha ape onto the cosmos, extending its influence to our personal lives without actually being here. There are several downsides that ape life has: lack of cooperation (among males), a pecking order with one individual on top, and less incentive to control nature. Ape and monkey society is more about competition and dominance, and dependent on nature providing food for the picking. Depending on the environment means not traveling too far and remaining close, thus reducing the need for defense of home as well as needing to know what others are up to as they aren't far. If we just forage for food, there isn't a need to cooperate. It's ""finders keepers"", and so dominance becomes more important. The alpha male gets the first pick, and so long as everybody abides conflict can be avoided, with little need to work together other than staying out of the big guy's way. Despite all these downsides, we are still closest to the apes. We haven't evolved to be complete predators, just enough behaviors to utilize our intelligence and social cooperation to survive and thrive. And we only evolved that way because the environment made us, forced us out east of Eden. It seems that much of our aesthetics, tastes, curiosity, and enjoyment of life are owed to our more ape aspects. A pure predator kind of society would resemble the Spartans I think. What we do in leisure however reflects both aspects of our nature, in varying degrees. The popularity of sports and online first person shooter video games reflects the more predator side. More relaxing and solitary activities like cooking or painting reflect the ape side. As for the title, the naked ape, the reason why we don't have a full coat of fur is to aid us in hunting; cooling us down by chasing animals. Other predators can make fast dashes after prey, but our bipedal stature and the occupation of our hands makes this difficult. ""By losing the heavy coat of hair and by increasing the number of sweat glands all over the body surface, considerable cooling could be achieved- not for minute by minute living, but for the supreme moments of the chase."" Our subcutaneous fat and ability to fashion clothes help keep us warm without fur. With the help of neoteny, the retaining of youthful traits into adulthood, all this explains our appearance as the naked ape. Younger chimps have flatter faces, a long slender neck, smaller teeth, absence of heavy brow ridges, non-rotating big toe, and more hair on the head than the rest of the body. Our extended childhood also allows us to develop our powerful brains. A desire to explore and learn new things are also associated with youth, and so we are the young ape as well as the naked ape. Though of course neoteny is selective, as we aren't attracted to infant genitals, infantile emotions, or infantile strength. The book is full of interesting speculations about behavior, always trying to link us to our animal nature. The message of the book is that we are still operating with an animal mindset no matter how developed we are. Even the most complex behaviors like pacing back and forth and the conduct of war harken back to our more modest origins."

Grazie, Mr. Gabbani (you were my personal winner anyways... and that is kind of all I know in Italian).Thus study was such a positive disappointment! I was afraid it would be too academical for my humanities-oriented brain... but guys, if you want to read a study on how humans evolved from apes and ""the missing links"" and how certains traditions and habits of ours formed, that is really interesting and really easy to read, it is for you. I read that Desmond Morris said he wanted to de-mistify science... and I could not put it better. The explanation is really clear, easy to understand and there were some really interesting and cool facts about certain human behaviour that we still practice... it was really interesting to see where they could come from.Also: if you are a really devout creatonist, I'd recommend you only read the book if you do not get triggered by reading full-on declared truths about evolution (as I believe in evolution and the scientific research that are supposed to prove it, I did not have any issues)."

We mustn't forget when was developed this essay, as well as the possible intentions of the author.The last chapter of the book is just... funny. Suddenly, Morris seems to see sex in the explanations about why we like some animals instead of others (maybe he was possessed by Freud when he wrote the last pages) and the justifications about animal exploitation are, some of them, just ridiculous. But I'm totally agree with one of the ideas in this book, and is that the world is overpopulated by the human beings and that it would be necessary to reduce the population (not killing people!), promoting and facilitating the use of contraceptive measures.In summary: to be careful with some of the contents in the book, but is a really interesting reading in my opinion."
59,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58948646-hendrik-borginon,5,"When starting to read The Naked Ape, I expected it to be severely outdated (it was published in '67 after all). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book aged as well as can be expected. Desmond Morris writes from a zoologist's perspective and tries to describe man as if he were an external observer of our species. He analyses us and our behaviours from a very functional point of view. In the first chapters he mostly explores our physiological characteristics (and the differences between us and our closest animal relatives) and offers various evolutionary explanations for how they could have come to be. The zoologist's perspective proves to be very insightful for this purpose and I learned a great deal. In later chapters he starts to focus more on our behaviour. Though still thought-provoking, much of what he says is very speculative and his views on women and homosexuality are strongly influenced by the era in which the book was written.Despite some of these outdated speculations, it is still extremely interesting and insightful. I would recommend it to anyone who's fascinated by human evolution. "

Apart from these points, and the fact that it feels a bit old-fashioned in many of it's statements, there is something extremely fascinating in the approach this book has to offer. I have learned a lot by reading it, and I have gained a huge amount of thought provoking material throughout the book. The two longest chapters - Sex and Fighting - were the most interesting in my opinion. "
61,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112166097-barack-liu,4," 227-The Naked Ape-Desmond Morris-Nature-1967Barack2019/07/082020/06/23 - Biologically, people are divided, Mammal, primates, hominids, human genus Homo sapiens, is the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and gibbon apes belong to the superfamily of primates. ""Naked Ape"" was first published in the UK in 1967. It treats humans as a kind of hairless apes and explores various human behaviors from a biological point of view. Desmond Morris was born in Wiltshire, England in 1928. He studied at the University of Birmingham with a degree in zoology and a Ph.D. from Oxford University. He is a famous zoologist in England. Representative works: ""Naked Ape"", ""Human Zoo"", ""Intimate Behavior"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Origin2. Sex3. Parenting4. Explore5. Fight6. Foraging and eating7. Finishing and comfort8. People and animals ""The Analects"" says, ""A gentleman has three precepts: when he is young, his blood is indeterminate, but he is in color; he is strong, his blood is strong, he is in fighting; he is old, his blood is declining, he is in good faith. ""The need for sex, the desire to hunt, and the unsatisfied desire are the nature of animals. It is extremely difficult to control these three instinctive impulses with reason. Millions of years ago, due to some reason, most likely due to climate change, the arboreal apes that originally lived in the forest had to walk out of the forest and leave the branches to stand on the ground, and became hunting apes in order to get enough food. In the process of evolution of hunting apes, although seemingly distinctive naked apes have gradually formed, naked apes still reflect the characteristics of typical primates and typical carnivores. Naked apes maintain their juvenile development, allowing the development of the brain to continue for a long time. The long developmental process will bring a heavy burden of parenting for females, which requires naked apes to form a more stable spouse relationship to complete the nurturing of the next generation. In order to ensure that this goal can be achieved, nature seems to give the naked ape stronger sexual stimulation as compensation. Even in the social structure of naked apes where multiple spouses are allowed, the vast majority of members still adopt a one-to-one monogamy relationship due to the high cost of parenting . From the perspective of species, reproduction is the biggest mission. In this process, ""sex"" plays an extremely important role. The sexual behavior of naked apes is typically different from other 192 species of apes. The females of other apes do not seem to have an orgasm, and the sexual intercourse process is often extremely short, usually only lasting 15 times. The estrus period of females is also very short, they often leave immediately after the end of sexual intercourse, ready for the next sexual act at any time, so as not to miss the precious opportunity for fertilization. The female of the naked ape will continue to lie down to rest after the sexual intercourse is completed, immersed in the aftermath of a certain orgasm. Not only that, except for a few periods, the sexual activity of naked apes is almost unaffected. This means that even during pregnancy, female naked apes can still meet the sexual needs of male naked apes, thereby enhancing the mate relationship. The strengthening of sexual stimulation will bring about another problem, that is, when the spouses are separated, there must be a mechanism to inhibit the sexual behavior of naked apes, otherwise the social structure of monogamy will be destroyed. This is for raising the next generation. It was almost a devastating blow. The most obvious measure is to cover the fig leaf. The genitals and sexual behavior must be covered up and become a kind of extremely important privacy. The cold protection effect of clothing is not revealed until the naked ape goes out of the tropics. In addition, there are other means, such as to cover secondary sexual characteristics, shaving the child, such as armpit hair shave; remove the smell of the body; prohibition of physical contact. Naked apes need to strengthen the sexual stimulation between their spouses on the one hand, and weaken the sexual stimulation between non-mates on the one hand, so as to maintain the stability of monogamy and ensure that the cooperative relationship of the entire social structure is not destroyed. Some science fiction novels make some bold conjectures, such as: baby farms, social behavior, selective sterilization, and division of labor. For now, these behaviors are contrary to the biological instincts of naked apes. If they are implemented on a large scale one day, it can almost be concluded that the social structure and lifestyle of naked apes will undergo unimaginable changes, and the impact of changes in sexual and parenting behavior will be extremely profound. "" Among the existing 4237 mammals, almost no animal can be found suitable for survival without fur. Mammals are different from their reptile ancestors. They have an unparalleled advantage in their physiological characteristics. They can maintain a constant comparison. High body temperature. This makes the delicate machine with physiological functions suitable for efficient operation. This attribute is neither easily damaged nor easily abandoned. The body's thermostat is extremely important. Thicker, hairy and insulated The epidermis obviously plays an important role in preventing heat loss. Under strong sunlight, it can also prevent high body temperature and prevent direct sun burns to the skin. Therefore, if body hair is to fall off, obviously there must be a very good reason To give it up. Apart from a few rare exceptions, mammals acquired a new medium in evolution after referral to take this drastic step change. Flying mammals, such as bats, were forced to remove their body hair on both wings, but the body hair of other parts was still preserved, so they cannot be included as a nude species. Several burrowing mammals have greatly reduced body hair, such as voles, aardvarks, and armadillos. Aquatic mammals, such as whales, dolphins, mermaids, manatees, and seahorses, also lose their body hair as their bodies become streamlined. However, for all typical mammals that live on the surface, whether it is an animal jumping on the ground or an animal climbing on plants, the densely covered skin is an inevitable law. Except for the unusually large rhinoceros and elephants (which have special problems with their heat preservation and cooling mechanisms), naked apes are unique mammals without body hair . "" If we study humans from a biological point of view , ignore the fact that we are humans, and try our best to adopt a relatively objective attitude to study humans as animals. In fact, many interesting new ideas will be obtained. These biological insights may enable us to better understand many social phenomena. "" We know that the climate has undergone unfavorable changes. By about 15 million years ago, the scale of their forest fortresses dropped sharply. The ancestors of monkeys were forced to do two things. One of the two must be one of them: or they still defend the forest. The dilapidated hometown, or bravely faced the fate of being expelled from the Garden of Eden as the Bible says. Chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons and orangutans remained in the woods, and their numbers have been declining ever since. There is only another kind that exists apes - naked ape ancestors blaze a way out of it. they withdraw into the forest wilderness, engaged in fierce competition, the oath has been highly adaptable animal life on the ground is assessed by this risky step, but it is the outcome of evolution. In short, this adventure has been greatly rewarded. "" Even during the careful evolution of organisms . Also experienced several important adventures . These risky decisions influence so far-reaching, it determines the millions of years later, his race would die out , or will evolve into more advanced species . ""The predatory ancient apes are basically a group of males. Females are busy raising children and cannot take the main role in hunting prey. As the complexity of hunting increases, the time for hunting gradually increases, and it is necessary to abandon ancestors drifting and migrating. Lifestyle. Therefore, a fixed residence is needed to bring the prey back to the fixed base. Females and cubs wait at home for the males to return from hunting and share food. The step of fixing the residence will be seen in later chapters. , And will have a profound impact on all aspects of today’s most perfectly developed apes. "" As early human Australopithecus social division of labor during the formation of straight to this day , still a profound impact on our society. In family life, the man primarily responsible for the provision of social resources , to feed the family. While women are primarily responsible for providing resources , to breed and raise offspring. To this day, our tendency to choose a spouse basically follows this line of thinking. Men are eager to marry young, beautiful women , which implies that she has a strong ability to reproduce. Women desire to marry rich and loyal men, which means that they have the will and ability to provide a favorable living environment for themselves and their offspring. "" Fundamentally, we originated from a carnivore in the primate order. Among the existing monkeys and apes, our evolution is very unique. But this evolutionary change is not uncommon among animals of other subjects. For example, the giant panda is an animal that has completely transformed in evolution. This example is exquisite. We have changed from a vegetarian animal to a carnivore, while the giant panda has changed from a carnivore to a vegetarian animal. Just like us. The giant panda is an incomparable and very unique animal. One important thing is that the animal created by this violent transformation has a dual personality. Once it crosses the threshold between the two species, it plunges into its new role. Moving forward with great evolutionary energy-it has become too fast, so it still carries many original qualities. The time for evolution is not sufficient, it is too late to get rid of all the original features, just put on the surface features in a hurry. When primitive fish have just overcome the water-free obstacles in their terrestrial life, their terrestrial animal qualities have evolved by leaps and bounds, but they still embrace the characteristics of aquatic animals. To complete a perfect and dramatic new species, it will take millions of years. The pioneers who walk in the front are usually bizarre mixed animals. The naked ape is just such a mixed four different elephants. His entire body and the lifestyle of the pond are suitable for arboreal life, but suddenly (the so-called sudden is from the slow evolutionary process), he was thrown into a completely different world. "" "" Carnivores give birth to fleas, but primates do not. Monkeys and apes are plagued by lice and are also infected with some parasitic diseases. However, contrary to popular belief, they are not fleas at all; therefore, there are A very convincing reason. To understand this, we must first examine the life cycle of the flea. When a flea lays eggs, it does not lay on the host, but in the sleeping home of the host. The flea eggs hatch after 3 days. Wriggling little maggots. These larvae do not suck blood, but live on the dust collected in their dens. After another two weeks, the larvae cocoon and pupate. The pupae become adults after resting in the cocoon for about half a month and emerge from the cocoon. Find a suitable host. It can be seen that at least during the first month of its life cycle, the flea is separated from its host. Obviously, mammals that do not settle down, such as monkeys or apes, are not troubled by fleas. This is the reason. Even if one or two fleas accidentally land on a primate and successfully mate, the eggs they lay cannot be taken away by the primate because the primate is constantly migrating. When the flea pupae emerge from the cocoon, there will be no host waiting for them ""at home"", maintaining the host and guest relationship with them. Therefore, fleas are parasites of animals in fixed dwellings. For example, typical carnivores are such animals. "" "" First of all, the naked ape sense organs are not suitable for life on the ground. His sense of smell is too weak, his ears keen enough. His physique is too weak to withstand the grueling endurance test experience, not to break out like thunder lightning sprint, This weakness is irreparable. In terms of personality, he is more competitive, not more cooperative, and he is undoubtedly not good at planning and focusing. Fortunately, his brain is extremely good. In general intelligence, he surpassed his rival carnivore. With the help of walking upright, he has transformed both his hands and feet; through further improvements in his brain and dedicated use of the brain, he may be successful. "" "" If we look at a typical monkey fetus, we will be able to understand the most profoundly why the juvenile persistence mechanism contributes to the development and development of the primate brain. The brain during the fetal period of the monkey develops rapidly, growing up and becoming complex. The baby monkey is born. , Its brain has reached 70% of the mature brain. The remaining 30% are fully developed in the first 6 months after birth. Even chimpanzee babies with higher intelligence have brain development within 12 months after birth Be completed. Our species is in sharp contrast to this. The brain volume of a baby at birth is only 23% of that of an adult. During the 6 years after birth, children’s brains continue to develop rapidly, but the entire developmental period of the human brain can only be completed at about 23 years of age. This shows that for you and me, after sexual maturity, brain development will continue for 10 years. However, for chimpanzees, brain development has been completed for six or seven years before reproductive capacity becomes active. "" "" Infant monkeys and chimpanzees also like to play, explore, and are creative, but they die soon at this stage. However, for naked apes, these infancy characteristics will continue until they mature. In adulthood. He has enough time to imitate and learn all the techniques designed by his ancestors. In terms of physique and instinct, he has many shortcomings as a hunter. However, his intelligence and imitating ability can make up for its shortcomings and More than enough. The way and depth he accepts his parents' teaching is beyond the reach of any other animal. "" In the flesh, humans do not have the advantage of competing with large carnivores. But the reason why we can get to this point. Mainly rely on the wisdom of individuals is superb , and the organization of social groups. "
62,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2094984-weston,5,"""The Naked Ape"" is remarkable. It embodies precisely the type of popular-science literature I love to read: the matter-of-fact pointing out of things which, having been pointed out, seem totally obvious, as if Desmond Morris were just reciting things I already knew but hadn't gotten around to actually realizing yet. His observations run that gamut of what he terms ""typical"" human behavior and physiology. That is, at the time of this book's writing (as now) anthropologists and sociologists commonly made the atypical specimens and their behaviors the focus of their studies. Were other scientists engaged in the study of lifeforms to do similarly they would never get anywhere. Perhaps out of vanity, perhaps out of a lack of self-awareness, science has historically avoided turning its objective eye toward the scientist (obvious and irrelevant exceptions of medical science excluded). Luckily for us, Desmond Morris undertook this endeavor and his findings are not only fascinating but wildly entertaining.A great deal of the pleasure derived from this book is in the way that Morris so ruthlessly picks apart his subject. The book's title itself is a playful and astutely humbling jab at the subject which drives straight to the heart of his message: human beings are first and foremost animals. Apes, to be precise, and our principal distinguishing feature, from a zoological standpoint, from our ape cousins is no more than our lack of a shaggy coat. We may drive around in fancy cars, work in skyscrapers, level mountains, dam rivers, etc. At the end of the day, we're still a bunch of naked apes. Which isn't to say that we aren't members of an incredibly resourceful and clever species, fascinating from all angles and fascinated by all things. Because we are unique, we are remarkable. Still, it is no more than gross vanity that makes us suppose that our manipulation of the external environment or the complexity and ingeniousness of our cultural expression has enabled us to overcome the fact that we are ""still very much a biological phenomenon... subject to all the basic laws of animal behavior.""Morris arms his reader with a new arsenal of cocktail party factoids, some endearing, some disgusting, some depressing, others hilarious, which alone make the read worthwhile. For instance, the size and shape of human breasts suggest that they have developed, through many centuries of sexual selection, as sexual signaling devices rather than merely as organs used to feed infants. That is, human breasts are actually not very good feeding devices when compared to those of other apes. The nipple typically isn't shaped to fit easily into the infant mouth and the excess tissue around it can even obstruct the baby's breathing. And yet breasts are universally used to spectacular success in piquing the interest of potential mates and, it could go without saying, play an enormous secondary role in human intercourse, behavior which is seen nowhere else in the animal kingdom. The evolutionary reasons for this development, believe it or not, are fascinatingly and intimately woven into our ancestors struggle for survival as the first carnivorous apes on the ancient plains of Africa.Having been first published in the 60's, ""Naked Ape"" is somewhat outdated. Morris' characterization of indigenous societies as atypical cultural failures makes sense from the coldly zoological perspective from which he was attempting to write, but fails to take into consideration historical truths which invite explanations beyond a socities' supposed lack of functionality. Modern readers will be equally squeamish by the occasional reference made to the ""negroid race"" and the interpretation of homosexuality as little more than deviant behavior caused by abnormal childhood experiences. Present day sensitivities aside, Morris is nevertheless quite forward-thinking and the intellectual merits of the book by far exceed whatever flags might be raised by your inner-p.c. reactionary.As entertaining a book as it is, Morris' tone and message is ultimately one of apocalyptic foreboding. We naked apes have been so spectacularly successful as a species that we have come to think of ourselves as invincible and we are not. Our success will, sooner rather than later, catch up with us because the global economy of environmental resources is, after all, finite. The modern reader will recognize all too well that the book's imperative rings even truer today, despite Morris' having to sound like a fanatic at the time of its initial publishing. Ironically, Morris suggests, the naked ape's first step toward salvation will be the recognition of his true nature. To go forward we have to take an honest look at where we came from."

64,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21322837-heather-mcalister,1,"Backwards, sexist, racist drivel. Written by a man obviously trying to stroke his own ego by arguing how ""objectively,"" when you look at it from the impartial perspective of a rational (male) scientist, early hominids clearly evolved to walk upright, lose their fur, use tools, develop spoken language, etc. ALL so that males could hunt in groups like wolves or lions. Literally every physiological feature of the modern homo sapien, according to the ""impartial"" male Desmond Morris, was led by ""hot-blooded,"" aggressive alpha males to hunt and kill. The invention of tools being so men could hunt; walking upright so men could see over grass; learning to talk so men could communicate complex hunting strategies; the loss of fur so men wouldn't die of heatstroke running in the hot African climate, etc.And the women? Oh, they just evolved to be child-rearers and home-makers. They sat around in caves suckling their babes like mama wolves in their dens with cubs (never mind that real mother wolves are out of the den in weeks, and often dump their pups on a babysitter as soon as they possibly can) waiting with baited breath for the menfolk to come home and share the spoils of the hunt with them.And all the physical features early female hominids not covered by his ""male hunting"" explanation? Like female hominid larger breasts, wider birthing hips, hominids developing downward facing noses, etc? Oh, they just evolved to ""make sex sexier."" (I'm not kidding. That's what it says in the book.) Female hominids have larger breasts than other greater apes? It's because the males found it sexy. Female hominids have wider hips? Males found it sexy. Downward facing noses? Same thing. Homo sapiens have fuller lips than other greater apes? Because it made kissing sexier, and kissing is a great evolutionary foreplay to sex.The minute I stopped reading was when Desmond Morris claimed that (white) homo sapiens having pink lips because it gave them a pouty kissable look, thus making them look more kissable, thus more desirable as a mate. And what of certain black Africans who tend to have enough melanin in their skin not to have pink lips, and/or have fuller, puffier lips? According to Desmond Morris, it's because they're evolutionary failures who had to evolve fuller lips to make up for not having the desired pink lips that more evolutionary successful (white) homo sapiens possess. (Which, according to him, are like those living in North America. Not the ""obscure"" cultures in Africa that are ""not as evolutionary successful,"" his words. Never mind that white 'North American' culture as we know it has only existed for a few centuries at most, and hasn't withstood the test of time the way the 'obscure' African cultures have, which have stood for centuries, if not millennia.) This book is a transparent straight white male ego stroke, where a guy who fancies himself ""rational"" and ""objective"" breaks his arm patting himself, as a straight white male homo sapien, on the back for being ""an evolutionary success."" According to him, EVERY SINGLE physiological trait of the entire modern homo sapien species came from (presumably white) men of eons past being big strong hunters. Women and people of color were just hanger-ons who reaped the evolutionary benefits of the past (presumably) straight white male hunters' ingenuity. And every trait females have that males (presumably) don't is because the males found it sexy, or it aided in bearing the males' children. And every trait that people of color have that whites don't was formed to compensate the ""evolutionary disadvantage"" of not being white.Also, I took a few anthropology classes in community college. Almost every point he ever made has been largely disproven, or called into serious question. Fuck this guy, fuck this book. The fact that people still read this sexist, racist drivel and see it as anything resembling fact is frankly insulting to the whole homo sapien species."
65,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19627177-n-jr,5,"A fascinating read by a great thinker. Virtually no aspect of human nature and physiognomy escapes his keen zoologist eyes; even responses such as smiling, laughing and crying. However, be warned: not only is this book nearly 50 years old and therefore outdated, but one must ingest his words with a large heaping of salt. As a scientific treatise it fails. The best way to read it is to consider this the personal musings of a biologist/anthropologist, not the findings of an expert researcher. It's greatest value is in instigating thought on the subject. It is the step-back-and look-at-ourselves approach which is of real value here, not his (sometimes hilarious)conclusions.His explanation of the protuberance and shape of female breasts developing as a frontal sexual display resulting from our upright posture, rather than for increased efficiency of nursing, is presented as a credible argument. Mmm, maybe that explains the human male's fascination with them.Most of his observations are comparative, highlighting similarities and differences between other mammals, notably the chimpanzee. In all cases, Morris makes us think about many aspects of ourselves that we normally take for granted.One criticism I have is his over-emphasis on genetic origins - for example, he claims the pair-bond formation between sexes (i.e monogamy) is genetic rather than cultural - afraid I disagree there. Also his treatment of warfare is incomplete and not entirely satisfactory for me.I know others will attack the author as chauvinistic (not only in regards the sexes, but cultures as well), but still, hey, the book can just be considered food for thought.All in all, a stimulating read, one so rich that I have marked it for a second time around in the future. It helped me to come up with my own thoughts on the subject"

It's written as if the author were writing it about any other animal, and hearing myself talked about as if I am a naked mole rat or a chimpanzee is very refreshing (this doesn't give you permission to refer to me as such in polite society, btw). We are animals as much as any other, and we should consider all the things that make us what we are, including our animal instincts and our biological history.There are some ideas I think are odd, for example when he says that adults want to save elephants from extinction mainly because of our own impending individual extinction (death). Some things seem like just his opinion, and don't make sense to me. All the ideas, though - every single one - I found to be interesting. There were plenty of things I'd heard before (after all, it's a 40 year old book), but there were also plenty of things I hadn't heard which were totally new to me, and made me reconsider some of my own ideas. One such idea I have is that clothes are something unnatural, something to be avoided. He puts it to us that humans are a very sexual species, unlike other animals which have a mating season we are ready all the time, and unlike other animals which need to do something special to display their genitals ours are visible all the time, so to avoid making sexual displays to everyone all the time, we cover up. I've thought about most of my opinions long and hard for many years, and reading anything that makes me consider changing them is a rare and wonderful experience which had me turning each page almost in awe at what I had found before and might find after.I have the other two books in this series, and I can't wait to read them next."
67,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180947-j,3,"Desmond Morris raises some interesting points in this book, some more farfetched than others. Honestly, I have problems with a lot of the points he makes in this book. Attempting to explain everything we do by comparing us to our nearest relatives in the animal kingdom is like I said interesting but the truth is many of our behaviors are unique to our species because of our advanced intellect and I think simplifying them by saying they can be explained by looking at the behaviors of other primates is not entirely accurate. Furthermore, he makes a few mistakes I wouldn't expect anyone familiar with biology to make (including the 'tongue-map' for taste recognition) as well as taking a very eurocentric stance on human behavior. His postulations aren't really backed up with anything more than the observation of other primates which by itself can't really be used to explain our behavior. Along with his insistance on using North Americans and Europeans as the model for humanity, I have to say that this book is more rooted in speculation than fact and shouldn't be taken seriously as a work of science. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining read and worthy of the 3 stars I gave it."
68,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027404-david-o-brien,5,"Fascinating reading and life affirming in an unexpected way. The most common complaint about this book is lack of evidence or proof. Morris states clearly that he did not list all the evidence because it would turn the book into an encyclopedia. There is a bibliography at the end for those who want to see where he got his information and inspiration.The style of the book is not purely scientific in so far as he he makes assumptions and draws conclusions from his own experience and his research, which makes for very interesting reading, however can be interpreted as imprecise. Just because something is not 100% proven, that does not mean that it is not interesting, relevant, thought provoking or inspirational. Throughout the book there are segments I might not wholly agree with, however the scope of the book is so vast yet still well tied together and coherent that it deserves 5/5. A brave book that even today is refreshing, educational, inspiring and a break from convention."
69,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763793-jean,3,"I disagree with those who say this book is homophobic and/or misogynistic. Morris says some things that in normal conversational context might be dubbed as such, but his explicit purpose was to view mans behavior from an objective standpoint. He succeeds. Political correctness has no place in (even attempted) scientific writing. He DOES state that gay couples cannot procreate on their own. However he goes on to discuss scenarios where this may be a pro. Don't overreact. When I read this book, I was unaware it was written decades ago. Morris' observations were fairly elementary to me, I assume since I grew up hearing a good deal of them. It is still quite enjoyable to read despite my experience. "
70,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56218095-benehime,2,"In theory a good book, but so Sooooo outdated. The author adopts a super-alpha-male stance and women have only evolved because it served men. Don't you think they did anything other than having children!! Morris thinks that working is today's form of hunting and women obviously have no place there. also, male relaxing can only ever happen with an all male group. There are some interesting parts though, I loved the chapter about grooming and fighting (sad to see that he left out the vastly different way men and women fight, but oh, I forgot, women don't)."
71,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5155466-clare,2,"I found this book to be very disappointing. Morris makes some interesting statements about human behavior, but unfortunately, he has almost nothing that could be called evidence for anything that he poses as fact. Although at first I thought I might be unfairly judging it because his sexual politics differ from mine and his understanding of human sexuality is dated to say the least, his statements on non-sex-related behaviors are equally unsupported."
72,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,4,"Very fun and interesting. The chapter on sex is laugh out loud hilarious at many points. There are a few outdated ideas present which betray the year this was written (1967) but nonetheless Morris displays a fine understanding of evolutionary theory and animal behavior and applies it with wit and clear, concise language to our upright species."

80,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"Read this when I was 15. At the time it impressed me very much by its broad scope. Since then, I've learned Morris is despised by scientists. I can imagine why, but I really can't Judge."
81,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,3,"Objective SummaryThis book explores the evolution, biology, psychology, and sociology of human beings. Morris refers to humans as the “naked ape” in an attempt to remove his cultural and experiential biases from his analysis, and to remind his readers that they, like all humans, are just evolved animals. Morris attempts to objectively describe human beings’ features, behavior, and the reasons for both in the same way a zoologist would describe any newly discovered species. The defining characteristic about human beings is our intelligence. But that intelligence is mapped crudely onto base animalistic tendencies and necessities. Rather than jumping straight to our intelligence, which may cloud important but elementary observations, Morris refers to us as the “naked ape,” a statement on our physical appearance as nearly hairless primates. Despite any attempts to ignore or transcend our animal roots, they persist. Morris explores human evolution, sex, child rearing, exploration, fighting, feeding, pursuit of comfort, and interaction with other animals. Listed below are some of the main lessons and interesting tidbits.•	Humans evolved from monkeys and apes. We moved from forests to the plains, though one theory suggests we moved from forests to seaside coasts to the plains. •	We moved from a vegetarian to an omnivore diet when we left the forest. This required cooperative hunting and defensive parties of males within the social hierarchy. This cooperation could now be a contributing factor to the development of gangs and wars.•	Neoteny, or extension of childhood development, played a significant role in human evolution. It allowed the human brain to continue to develop and grow for decades after birth, and it required pair-bonding between males and females to support the extended adolescence of their offspring. •	Pair-bonding helped females remain faithful to their mates, it reduced social friction between males over mating access, and it helped in rearing the slow-developing children. Pair-bonding is powerful but imperfect. The female orgasm, which is unusual if not unique to humans, was a contributor to pair-bonding. •	Why humans are relatively hairless isn’t known with certainty. The most popular theory is that it aids cooling during times of extreme exertion, like hunting. •	Much of our appearance is sexual signaling. Relatively large penises and breasts, red lips, and hairlessness all likely have sexual origins. Pubic and armpit hair likely trap pheromones for sexual arousal. •	80% of mothers hold infants in their left arms most likely because their heartbeat soothes their young.•	Animals fight to establish the dominance hierarchy and defend territory. They do not use their weapons to try to kill members of their own species because that would not be evolutionarily advantageous. Successful species establish aggressive and submissive displays that can substitute for actual physical confrontation and reduce physical harm and death. Bowing and avoiding eye contact are submissive signs. Standing tall and direct eye contact are dominant or aggressive signs. •	Human weaponry permits fatal action from afar. Our inability to observe submissive signals may contribute to additional killing and destruction. •	Curiosity serves a vital function to an opportunistic species. It has led humans to discover new lands, invent new tools, and try new foods. Curiosity has expanded into arts, science, and technology. There is a perpetual balance between novelty and familiarity. We want the excitement of the former with the security of the latter. By pushing the boundaries and exploring, we discover new and better ways to feed, protect, and comfort ourselves. •	Human desire for sweet foods can lead to obesity.•	Humans domesticated dozens of species of animals for food (cows, chickens, goats, pigs), companionship (dogs, cats, horses), transportation (horses, camels, elephants), experimentation (mice, rats, guinea pigs), and other tasks like plowing and hauling heavy stuff (horses, donkeys, oxen). •	Dogs were likely domesticated when we took wolf pups to fatten them up for food. Then we realized they could help us hunt and alert us to danger. There are breeds of dogs that are herders, scent-trackers, setters and pointers to prey, retrievers, killers of vermin, and guard dogs.•	Animals have five basic relationships with other animals: prey, symbiont, competitor, parasite, and predator.•	Religion may have roots in the need for an ultimately powerful being at the top of a hierarchy.•	12,000 British kids listed their favorite animals as: 1. Chimpanzee, 2. Monkey, 3. Horse, 4. Bushbaby, 5. Panda, 6. Bear, 7. Elephant, 8. Lion, 9. Dog, 10. Giraffe. They tend to have anthropomorphic features like sitting or moving upright and having highly expressive faces.•	12,000 British kids listed their most hated animals as: 1. Snake, 2. Spider, 3. Crocodile, 4. Lion, 5. Rat, 6. Skunk, 7. Gorilla, 8. Rhinoceros, 9. Hippopotamus, 10. Tiger. These are all dangerous. •	To survive as a civilization and a species, we must recognize and submit to our biological features. They cannot all be overcome through thought, culture, or technology. Subjective ThoughtsI read this book because the dude in the movie “Bring It On” was reading it during a high school football game. It was interesting and thought-provoking, but much of the content seemed familiar. That makes sense since I am a naked ape and have interacted with them all my life. And I think much of this material was covered in my biology textbooks back in the day.It was impossible for me to miss how much a product of its time this book was. Written in 1967, Morris was only five years removed from the Cuban missile crisis, and nuclear annihilation was clearly on his mind. He also harbored Malthusian fears of continued population growth, resource strain, and territorial strife. He anticipated the Ehrlichs’ “Population Bomb,” which would be published one year later. He seemed quite pessimistic on both the nuclear annihilation and overpopulation fronts. If he were to update the book today, he’d no doubt include global cooling, I mean global warming, errr global climate change in his list of calamities. Fortunately, as I type this, nukes haven’t dropped in anger since ’45, Trump may be in the process of solving Korea, reproduction rates have slowed across the developed world and sometimes below replacement levels, and there are alternative albeit expensive energy sources. Not that I’m worried enough about any of this to shut off the air conditioner or my computer. And this Honeycrisp apple from Walmart is amazing. Morris should also update his advice on how to handle being pulled over by police. His suggestion is to immediately leave your car and approach the officer so that you two don’t interact on “your” territory near your car, which will make the officer feel threatened. That shit will get you shot today. Stay in your car with your hands on the wheel, and wait to move until you’re told. You don’t want to suddenly approach someone with a Glock 17 on standby.Memorable Quotes“A solitary monkey or ape is a vulnerable creature. It lacks the powerful natural weapons of the carnivore and in isolation falls easy prey to the stalking killers.”“It is only a wise primate, like our hunting ape, that knows its own father.”“The male reaches the consummatory act of sperm ejaculation within a few minutes in most cases, unless deliberate delaying tactics are employed. . . . Some females may reach this point very quickly, others not at all, but on the average it is attained between ten and twenty minutes after the start of copulation.”“Its normal, average length of nine and a half centimetres is increased by seven to eight centimetres. The diameter is also considerably increased, giving the species the largest erect penis of any living primate.”“After a gestation period of approximately 266 days her uterus begins to contract powerfully and rhythmically.”“The average weight of a baby at birth is just over seven pounds, which is slightly more than one-twentieth of the weight of the average parent.”“Lucky is the society that enjoys the gradual acquisition of a perfect balance between imitation and curiosity, between slavish, unthinking copying and progressive, rational experimentation.”“In all exploratory behaviour, whether artistic or scientific, there is the ever-present battle between the neophilic and neophobic urges. The former drives us on to new experiences, makes us crave for novelty. The latter holds us back, makes us take refuge in the familiar. We are constantly in a state of shifting balance between the conflicting attractions of the exciting new stimulus and the friendly old one. If we lost our neophilia we would stagnate. If we lost our neophobia, we would rush headlong into disaster.”“We are, to put it mildly, in a mess, and there is a strong chance that we shall have exterminated ourselves by the end of the century.”“Animals fight amongst themselves for one of two very good reasons: either to establish their dominance in a social hierarchy, or to establish their territorial rights over a particular piece of ground.” “If a species is to survive, it simply cannot afford to go around slaughtering its own kind. Intra-specific aggression has to be inhibited and controlled, and the more powerful and savage the prey-killing weapons of a particular species are, the stronger must be the inhibitions about using them to settle disputes with rivals.”“To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion. Abortion is a drastic measure and can involve serious emotional disturbance. Furthermore, once a zygote has been formed by the act of fertilization it constitutes a new individual member of society, and its destruction is, in effect, an act of aggression, which is the very pattern of behaviour that we are attempting to control. Contraception is obviously preferable, and any religious or other ‘moralizing’ factions that oppose it must face the fact that they are engaged in dangerous war-mongering.”“We each possess about 10,000 of these taste buds, but in old age they deteriorate and decrease in number, hence the jaded palate of the elderly gastronome. Surprisingly, we can only respond to four basic tastes. They are: sour, salt, bitter, and sweet.”“Domestication of livestock, involving the organized control and selective breeding of prey, is known to have been practised for at least ten thousand years and, in certain cases, probably much longer. Goats, sheep and reindeer appear to have been the earliest prey species dealt with in this way.”“It is probable that [an interspecific bond between humans and dogs] began as a result of young puppies being brought in to the tribal home base to be fattened as food.”“Unless we can colonize other planets on a massive scale and spread the load, or seriously check our population increase in some way, we shall, in the not-too-far distant future, have to remove all other forms of life from the earth. . . . We need not dwell on this nightmare: the possibility of its becoming a reality is remote.”"
82,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62596158-n-g-habsburg,3,"I enjoyed reading this (it's written in quite an amusing style) but I was hoping for something more heavy on the primatology. While it's a good review of instinctive human behaviour it is expectionally light into actual comparisons to other primates.He does make interesting points, e.g. noting that when the forests started to disappear we converged towards carnivore traits but by using artificial weapons rather than natural ones we did not need to move towards becoming like cats/dogs (though he doesn't note that other plains primates probably did so more than us). He notes the importance of us acquiring home bases where the females were left, and hence the need to develop more clear territories, pair bonds and ability to share food with family/tribe.He talks about how adolescents acquite the need to go off and develop their own home. But here he doesn't spend any time discussing what's actually known about how humans do this. It's actually remarkable how variable this is across different societies (albeit it generally has fixed form within a society). Sometimes it it the male, sometimes the female. These are generally species fixed traits, and yet he doesn't cover this.He talks about how the development of a pair bond meant that we needed to start hiding our sexual features in public. He notes that other species generally sustain the pair bond through aggression, but we do it instead by wearing clothes and avoiding touching each other.It's quite an old book and features some exceptional examples of envirionmentalist (e.g. blank slate) thinking from the era it was written, which is somewhat startling in a book which otherwise fully acknowledges that we are creatures driven by innate behaviours. For instance, he talks about how if a mother is tense and smiles to conceil it, the baby will detect it and mistake the function of a smile... he then warns that this could be permanently damaging and cause the child serious social difficulties... nuttier environmentalist claptrap than that is only spewed forth by modern SJWs but I guess it was par for the course back then. The section on music and it's relation to mothers heart beat is similarly whacko.A section of the book deals with our innate sounds/actions, e.g. laughter and smiling. Discussion about how they evolved is perhaps questionable. Notes things like when a baby smiles it waves it's arms and legs around, and suggests this is the vestigial primate clinging response. There's also curious little factoids, like our 'sweet tooth' being a distinct primate thing that other carnivores don't generally have.An interesting section is when he talks about how men go along to trade unions, social clubs , learned societies etc as an equivilent of the hunting pack. They do so to experience our built in bond from male togetherness. Interestingly, this was written before it became taboo to go to male only societies. One suspects that the author would not thus be suprised that membership of all voluntary societies has utterly collapsed since women were permitted to join them (see Putnam's 'Bowling Alone'). He also describes how work is probably a poor substitute for hunting for the working classes in a manner that it is not for the middle class. Expresses it in a manner that is probably illegal these days.A key point the author wants to get across in the book is that we're going through a population boom and being forced into living in environments increasingly more crowded and distrinct from what we evolved for. He talks about how the modern usage of soulless featureless architecture where everything looks the same flys against our built in desire to mark territory as our own through personalisation (declaring quite rightly that modern architects are terrorists). He is sceptical about the ability of us to adapt our innate behaviour. On that, he is probably correct. He could have argued his case better (and I believe that in his next book he went on to do so). "
83,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13626166-siddarth-gore,5,"So there he stands, our vertical, hunting, weapon-toting, territorial, neotenous, brainy, Naked Ape, a primate by ancestry and a carnivore by adoption, ready to conquer the world.We evolved from apes. But exactly how far did we get? Your guesses might be way off the mark. This book says that under the surface we are ruled mostly by our inner primates. Things just look different on us. Evolution is too slow a process for us to have shed our animal past.In our species there is, as we have seen, a strong tendency to ‘fall in love’—to develop a powerful bond with the object of our sexual attentions.No primates are monogamous so why are we? The answer comes from our adaptation to life on the plains of Africa once we were thrown out of the jungle perhaps due to environmental changes. Hint, pack hunters need cooperation from all males.They occur with particularly high frequency during the initial stages of social encounters, where hidden fears and aggressions are lurking just below the surface. At a dinner party, or any small social gathering, as soon as the mutual appeasement ceremonies of hand-shaking and smiling are over, displacement cigarettes, displacement drinks and displacement food-snacks are immediately offered.This was the most fascinating part. Monkeys and apes are very much social animals with hierarchy being most crucial thing on their minds. How did we get rid of that, or did we? Even the most innocuous conversations and meetings are anything but that for your social relations obsessed brain. To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion.His argument is that cramming animals in compact spaces invariably leads to aggression. We might think we are special but think again. Only way to make sure we do not turn against each other is to give everyone enough space. Debatable, but interesting viewpoint none the less.Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else.One can only hope ;-)"
84,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98103014-jonas,4,"This book was first published in 1967 and I found it to be somewhat of a foreboding book.I was first introduced into many of these concepts regarding “the naked ape’s” ecological role and behaviour from other books, such as Ishmael by Daniel Quinn and The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. Though those books are written about something else, I found myself thinking of those books while I was reading this one. Many of the arguments presented in those books could be paralleled with the comparative elements between the human and ape presented throughout this book.Each chapter though succinct, presents an interesting perspective on the anatomy of the human body, as well as our behavioural aspects against the bodies and social practices of other ape species. I thought many of the ideas were very inventive, but the chapter on sex comes across as crass and salacious, but otherwise, the book presents itself in a very tame manner.Whilst the book contains many fantastic ideas, I can see why this book created controversy within the feminist/homosexual communities. The book even manages to squeeze in a supporting message for contraceptives and population control. Overall, I think the book makes for an interesting read, but is by no means the best book regarding the topic especially in modern day, due to changing of the zeitgeist from the late 1960’s to the prevalence of technology today (even though some of the fears might still be present today). Despite that, I still think it’s worth a read to understand how it was relevant at that time, and how it has paved a way and introduced the idea of comparative ethology to the general public."
85,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705775-gerardo-alonso,4,"The Naked Ape is a mirror. While reading it, one sees a reflection of oneself. But unlike many other reflections, this one is raw and based on our biological characteristics. This reflection breaks down our egos and social constructs to their bare bones. Desmond Morris attempts to show humanity that we are merely a species of the Animal KingdomI found the book inspiring, and highly effective to understand characteristic behaviours we may have. It feels as if someone is saying what one has already known but could not figure out the words to explain it.While this book is very powerful philosophically, I think it lacks thoroughness in logic. One of the things that concerns me is that it seems to me that Morris takes a one-sided view of several arguments sometimes based on factoids/opinions that may debatable. Another difficulty I find is the ease of comparison between the Homo Sapiens and the apes. While true that we share a very similar DNA structure, I think that Morris not only tries to link biological similarities (which he does in a great way in the beginning of the book), but also behavioural similarities.I get that in some cases or themes, the behaviour among species will be the same. The fight or flight response, for example. But when highly specific social interactions are compared between species, Morris should have analysed the Naked Ape by itself.It may be the case that some of the science behind the book is outdated, since this was published in the 60s. Regardless of the leaps Morris takes, this book is worth reading as a biology, anthropology and history lesson of our species. "
86,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"I had a great time reading this book. Despite coming out almost fifty years ago when I found it, much of what it says is still thought provoking and relevant. The book owes a little bit to psychoanalysis which was more dominant at the time. Which is good since Morris uses it to good effect to tie together physiological and behavioral facts into a general theory of human nature. What is that theory of human nature? Well, that we are the way we are because our ancestors were forced to become a predator species/hunting-ape and couldn't stay in and around trees picking fruits. Millions of years ago in Africa, during the Miocene, the forests started to disappear, and the apes could either cling onto whatever was left, or leave the ""garden of Eden"" and enter into competition with the predators on the ground. Ape populations have dwindled since, and we have emerged the apex predator. To get to that point we had to overcome the other predators, but with inferior equipment so to speak; no fangs or claws. So we made use of two things carried over to a certain degree from our ape past; intelligence and social communication. ""His whole body, his way of life, was geared to a forest existence, and then suddenly he was jettisoned into a world where he could survive only if he began to live like a brainy, weapon toting wolf."" Our social lives are to this day built on a sort of tension between social communication and intellect (from ape life) and group loyalty and hunting from our predator existence. Vestiges of our ape life are our greater reliance on sight at the expense of smell and a more various taste palate. Our predator life involves traveling greater distances to find game, rather than remaining close to the trees, having a home base to protect and return to, and having regular meals rather than momentary snacking. Being a predatory ape means developing ways to facilitate male cooperation, to hunt together with dangerous weapons, and to guarantee a share of the kills and a female for the effort. Monogamy and private property likely arise from a need to secure the loyalty of males to females and children while they hunted and prevent conflict among the males. This isn't all bad, as the predator life means some degree of male solidarity. We can't have a single alpha male who gets exclusive access to women and food. The ability to cooperate and use weapon technology means the lesser males can gang up and resist, limit, or kill the alpha male. Thus some satisfactory distribution of females and resources becomes necessary for social order, and this is likely where marriage and property and even government developed from. Morris channels Sigmund Freud and argues that religion emerges from the guilt of (symbolically) killing the alpha ape. Even with all his faults, an all powerful male does instill some sort of order and security which is socially useful. You knew where you stood, and the alpha ape in a way encouraged exogamous mating, preventing incest by kicking the sons out of the harem. So religion projects the seemingly omnipotent alpha ape onto the cosmos, extending its influence to our personal lives without actually being here. There are several downsides that ape life has: lack of cooperation (among males), a pecking order with one individual on top, and less incentive to control nature. Ape and monkey society is more about competition and dominance, and dependent on nature providing food for the picking. Depending on the environment means not traveling too far and remaining close, thus reducing the need for defense of home as well as needing to know what others are up to as they aren't far. If we just forage for food, there isn't a need to cooperate. It's ""finders keepers"", and so dominance becomes more important. The alpha male gets the first pick, and so long as everybody abides conflict can be avoided, with little need to work together other than staying out of the big guy's way. Despite all these downsides, we are still closest to the apes. We haven't evolved to be complete predators, just enough behaviors to utilize our intelligence and social cooperation to survive and thrive. And we only evolved that way because the environment made us, forced us out east of Eden. It seems that much of our aesthetics, tastes, curiosity, and enjoyment of life are owed to our more ape aspects. A pure predator kind of society would resemble the Spartans I think. What we do in leisure however reflects both aspects of our nature, in varying degrees. The popularity of sports and online first person shooter video games reflects the more predator side. More relaxing and solitary activities like cooking or painting reflect the ape side. As for the title, the naked ape, the reason why we don't have a full coat of fur is to aid us in hunting; cooling us down by chasing animals. Other predators can make fast dashes after prey, but our bipedal stature and the occupation of our hands makes this difficult. ""By losing the heavy coat of hair and by increasing the number of sweat glands all over the body surface, considerable cooling could be achieved- not for minute by minute living, but for the supreme moments of the chase."" Our subcutaneous fat and ability to fashion clothes help keep us warm without fur. With the help of neoteny, the retaining of youthful traits into adulthood, all this explains our appearance as the naked ape. Younger chimps have flatter faces, a long slender neck, smaller teeth, absence of heavy brow ridges, non-rotating big toe, and more hair on the head than the rest of the body. Our extended childhood also allows us to develop our powerful brains. A desire to explore and learn new things are also associated with youth, and so we are the young ape as well as the naked ape. Though of course neoteny is selective, as we aren't attracted to infant genitals, infantile emotions, or infantile strength. The book is full of interesting speculations about behavior, always trying to link us to our animal nature. The message of the book is that we are still operating with an animal mindset no matter how developed we are. Even the most complex behaviors like pacing back and forth and the conduct of war harken back to our more modest origins."

Grazie, Mr. Gabbani (you were my personal winner anyways... and that is kind of all I know in Italian).Thus study was such a positive disappointment! I was afraid it would be too academical for my humanities-oriented brain... but guys, if you want to read a study on how humans evolved from apes and ""the missing links"" and how certains traditions and habits of ours formed, that is really interesting and really easy to read, it is for you. I read that Desmond Morris said he wanted to de-mistify science... and I could not put it better. The explanation is really clear, easy to understand and there were some really interesting and cool facts about certain human behaviour that we still practice... it was really interesting to see where they could come from.Also: if you are a really devout creatonist, I'd recommend you only read the book if you do not get triggered by reading full-on declared truths about evolution (as I believe in evolution and the scientific research that are supposed to prove it, I did not have any issues)."

We mustn't forget when was developed this essay, as well as the possible intentions of the author.The last chapter of the book is just... funny. Suddenly, Morris seems to see sex in the explanations about why we like some animals instead of others (maybe he was possessed by Freud when he wrote the last pages) and the justifications about animal exploitation are, some of them, just ridiculous. But I'm totally agree with one of the ideas in this book, and is that the world is overpopulated by the human beings and that it would be necessary to reduce the population (not killing people!), promoting and facilitating the use of contraceptive measures.In summary: to be careful with some of the contents in the book, but is a really interesting reading in my opinion."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book aged as well as can be expected. Desmond Morris writes from a zoologist's perspective and tries to describe man as if he were an external observer of our species. He analyses us and our behaviours from a very functional point of view. In the first chapters he mostly explores our physiological characteristics (and the differences between us and our closest animal relatives) and offers various evolutionary explanations for how they could have come to be. The zoologist's perspective proves to be very insightful for this purpose and I learned a great deal. In later chapters he starts to focus more on our behaviour. Though still thought-provoking, much of what he says is very speculative and his views on women and homosexuality are strongly influenced by the era in which the book was written.Despite some of these outdated speculations, it is still extremely interesting and insightful. I would recommend it to anyone who's fascinated by human evolution. "

Apart from these points, and the fact that it feels a bit old-fashioned in many of it's statements, there is something extremely fascinating in the approach this book has to offer. I have learned a lot by reading it, and I have gained a huge amount of thought provoking material throughout the book. The two longest chapters - Sex and Fighting - were the most interesting in my opinion. "
91,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112166097-barack-liu,4," 227-The Naked Ape-Desmond Morris-Nature-1967Barack2019/07/082020/06/23 - Biologically, people are divided, Mammal, primates, hominids, human genus Homo sapiens, is the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and gibbon apes belong to the superfamily of primates. ""Naked Ape"" was first published in the UK in 1967. It treats humans as a kind of hairless apes and explores various human behaviors from a biological point of view. Desmond Morris was born in Wiltshire, England in 1928. He studied at the University of Birmingham with a degree in zoology and a Ph.D. from Oxford University. He is a famous zoologist in England. Representative works: ""Naked Ape"", ""Human Zoo"", ""Intimate Behavior"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Origin2. Sex3. Parenting4. Explore5. Fight6. Foraging and eating7. Finishing and comfort8. People and animals ""The Analects"" says, ""A gentleman has three precepts: when he is young, his blood is indeterminate, but he is in color; he is strong, his blood is strong, he is in fighting; he is old, his blood is declining, he is in good faith. ""The need for sex, the desire to hunt, and the unsatisfied desire are the nature of animals. It is extremely difficult to control these three instinctive impulses with reason. Millions of years ago, due to some reason, most likely due to climate change, the arboreal apes that originally lived in the forest had to walk out of the forest and leave the branches to stand on the ground, and became hunting apes in order to get enough food. In the process of evolution of hunting apes, although seemingly distinctive naked apes have gradually formed, naked apes still reflect the characteristics of typical primates and typical carnivores. Naked apes maintain their juvenile development, allowing the development of the brain to continue for a long time. The long developmental process will bring a heavy burden of parenting for females, which requires naked apes to form a more stable spouse relationship to complete the nurturing of the next generation. In order to ensure that this goal can be achieved, nature seems to give the naked ape stronger sexual stimulation as compensation. Even in the social structure of naked apes where multiple spouses are allowed, the vast majority of members still adopt a one-to-one monogamy relationship due to the high cost of parenting . From the perspective of species, reproduction is the biggest mission. In this process, ""sex"" plays an extremely important role. The sexual behavior of naked apes is typically different from other 192 species of apes. The females of other apes do not seem to have an orgasm, and the sexual intercourse process is often extremely short, usually only lasting 15 times. The estrus period of females is also very short, they often leave immediately after the end of sexual intercourse, ready for the next sexual act at any time, so as not to miss the precious opportunity for fertilization. The female of the naked ape will continue to lie down to rest after the sexual intercourse is completed, immersed in the aftermath of a certain orgasm. Not only that, except for a few periods, the sexual activity of naked apes is almost unaffected. This means that even during pregnancy, female naked apes can still meet the sexual needs of male naked apes, thereby enhancing the mate relationship. The strengthening of sexual stimulation will bring about another problem, that is, when the spouses are separated, there must be a mechanism to inhibit the sexual behavior of naked apes, otherwise the social structure of monogamy will be destroyed. This is for raising the next generation. It was almost a devastating blow. The most obvious measure is to cover the fig leaf. The genitals and sexual behavior must be covered up and become a kind of extremely important privacy. The cold protection effect of clothing is not revealed until the naked ape goes out of the tropics. In addition, there are other means, such as to cover secondary sexual characteristics, shaving the child, such as armpit hair shave; remove the smell of the body; prohibition of physical contact. Naked apes need to strengthen the sexual stimulation between their spouses on the one hand, and weaken the sexual stimulation between non-mates on the one hand, so as to maintain the stability of monogamy and ensure that the cooperative relationship of the entire social structure is not destroyed. Some science fiction novels make some bold conjectures, such as: baby farms, social behavior, selective sterilization, and division of labor. For now, these behaviors are contrary to the biological instincts of naked apes. If they are implemented on a large scale one day, it can almost be concluded that the social structure and lifestyle of naked apes will undergo unimaginable changes, and the impact of changes in sexual and parenting behavior will be extremely profound. "" Among the existing 4237 mammals, almost no animal can be found suitable for survival without fur. Mammals are different from their reptile ancestors. They have an unparalleled advantage in their physiological characteristics. They can maintain a constant comparison. High body temperature. This makes the delicate machine with physiological functions suitable for efficient operation. This attribute is neither easily damaged nor easily abandoned. The body's thermostat is extremely important. Thicker, hairy and insulated The epidermis obviously plays an important role in preventing heat loss. Under strong sunlight, it can also prevent high body temperature and prevent direct sun burns to the skin. Therefore, if body hair is to fall off, obviously there must be a very good reason To give it up. Apart from a few rare exceptions, mammals acquired a new medium in evolution after referral to take this drastic step change. Flying mammals, such as bats, were forced to remove their body hair on both wings, but the body hair of other parts was still preserved, so they cannot be included as a nude species. Several burrowing mammals have greatly reduced body hair, such as voles, aardvarks, and armadillos. Aquatic mammals, such as whales, dolphins, mermaids, manatees, and seahorses, also lose their body hair as their bodies become streamlined. However, for all typical mammals that live on the surface, whether it is an animal jumping on the ground or an animal climbing on plants, the densely covered skin is an inevitable law. Except for the unusually large rhinoceros and elephants (which have special problems with their heat preservation and cooling mechanisms), naked apes are unique mammals without body hair . "" If we study humans from a biological point of view , ignore the fact that we are humans, and try our best to adopt a relatively objective attitude to study humans as animals. In fact, many interesting new ideas will be obtained. These biological insights may enable us to better understand many social phenomena. "" We know that the climate has undergone unfavorable changes. By about 15 million years ago, the scale of their forest fortresses dropped sharply. The ancestors of monkeys were forced to do two things. One of the two must be one of them: or they still defend the forest. The dilapidated hometown, or bravely faced the fate of being expelled from the Garden of Eden as the Bible says. Chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons and orangutans remained in the woods, and their numbers have been declining ever since. There is only another kind that exists apes - naked ape ancestors blaze a way out of it. they withdraw into the forest wilderness, engaged in fierce competition, the oath has been highly adaptable animal life on the ground is assessed by this risky step, but it is the outcome of evolution. In short, this adventure has been greatly rewarded. "" Even during the careful evolution of organisms . Also experienced several important adventures . These risky decisions influence so far-reaching, it determines the millions of years later, his race would die out , or will evolve into more advanced species . ""The predatory ancient apes are basically a group of males. Females are busy raising children and cannot take the main role in hunting prey. As the complexity of hunting increases, the time for hunting gradually increases, and it is necessary to abandon ancestors drifting and migrating. Lifestyle. Therefore, a fixed residence is needed to bring the prey back to the fixed base. Females and cubs wait at home for the males to return from hunting and share food. The step of fixing the residence will be seen in later chapters. , And will have a profound impact on all aspects of today’s most perfectly developed apes. "" As early human Australopithecus social division of labor during the formation of straight to this day , still a profound impact on our society. In family life, the man primarily responsible for the provision of social resources , to feed the family. While women are primarily responsible for providing resources , to breed and raise offspring. To this day, our tendency to choose a spouse basically follows this line of thinking. Men are eager to marry young, beautiful women , which implies that she has a strong ability to reproduce. Women desire to marry rich and loyal men, which means that they have the will and ability to provide a favorable living environment for themselves and their offspring. "" Fundamentally, we originated from a carnivore in the primate order. Among the existing monkeys and apes, our evolution is very unique. But this evolutionary change is not uncommon among animals of other subjects. For example, the giant panda is an animal that has completely transformed in evolution. This example is exquisite. We have changed from a vegetarian animal to a carnivore, while the giant panda has changed from a carnivore to a vegetarian animal. Just like us. The giant panda is an incomparable and very unique animal. One important thing is that the animal created by this violent transformation has a dual personality. Once it crosses the threshold between the two species, it plunges into its new role. Moving forward with great evolutionary energy-it has become too fast, so it still carries many original qualities. The time for evolution is not sufficient, it is too late to get rid of all the original features, just put on the surface features in a hurry. When primitive fish have just overcome the water-free obstacles in their terrestrial life, their terrestrial animal qualities have evolved by leaps and bounds, but they still embrace the characteristics of aquatic animals. To complete a perfect and dramatic new species, it will take millions of years. The pioneers who walk in the front are usually bizarre mixed animals. The naked ape is just such a mixed four different elephants. His entire body and the lifestyle of the pond are suitable for arboreal life, but suddenly (the so-called sudden is from the slow evolutionary process), he was thrown into a completely different world. "" "" Carnivores give birth to fleas, but primates do not. Monkeys and apes are plagued by lice and are also infected with some parasitic diseases. However, contrary to popular belief, they are not fleas at all; therefore, there are A very convincing reason. To understand this, we must first examine the life cycle of the flea. When a flea lays eggs, it does not lay on the host, but in the sleeping home of the host. The flea eggs hatch after 3 days. Wriggling little maggots. These larvae do not suck blood, but live on the dust collected in their dens. After another two weeks, the larvae cocoon and pupate. The pupae become adults after resting in the cocoon for about half a month and emerge from the cocoon. Find a suitable host. It can be seen that at least during the first month of its life cycle, the flea is separated from its host. Obviously, mammals that do not settle down, such as monkeys or apes, are not troubled by fleas. This is the reason. Even if one or two fleas accidentally land on a primate and successfully mate, the eggs they lay cannot be taken away by the primate because the primate is constantly migrating. When the flea pupae emerge from the cocoon, there will be no host waiting for them ""at home"", maintaining the host and guest relationship with them. Therefore, fleas are parasites of animals in fixed dwellings. For example, typical carnivores are such animals. "" "" First of all, the naked ape sense organs are not suitable for life on the ground. His sense of smell is too weak, his ears keen enough. His physique is too weak to withstand the grueling endurance test experience, not to break out like thunder lightning sprint, This weakness is irreparable. In terms of personality, he is more competitive, not more cooperative, and he is undoubtedly not good at planning and focusing. Fortunately, his brain is extremely good. In general intelligence, he surpassed his rival carnivore. With the help of walking upright, he has transformed both his hands and feet; through further improvements in his brain and dedicated use of the brain, he may be successful. "" "" If we look at a typical monkey fetus, we will be able to understand the most profoundly why the juvenile persistence mechanism contributes to the development and development of the primate brain. The brain during the fetal period of the monkey develops rapidly, growing up and becoming complex. The baby monkey is born. , Its brain has reached 70% of the mature brain. The remaining 30% are fully developed in the first 6 months after birth. Even chimpanzee babies with higher intelligence have brain development within 12 months after birth Be completed. Our species is in sharp contrast to this. The brain volume of a baby at birth is only 23% of that of an adult. During the 6 years after birth, children’s brains continue to develop rapidly, but the entire developmental period of the human brain can only be completed at about 23 years of age. This shows that for you and me, after sexual maturity, brain development will continue for 10 years. However, for chimpanzees, brain development has been completed for six or seven years before reproductive capacity becomes active. "" "" Infant monkeys and chimpanzees also like to play, explore, and are creative, but they die soon at this stage. However, for naked apes, these infancy characteristics will continue until they mature. In adulthood. He has enough time to imitate and learn all the techniques designed by his ancestors. In terms of physique and instinct, he has many shortcomings as a hunter. However, his intelligence and imitating ability can make up for its shortcomings and More than enough. The way and depth he accepts his parents' teaching is beyond the reach of any other animal. "" In the flesh, humans do not have the advantage of competing with large carnivores. But the reason why we can get to this point. Mainly rely on the wisdom of individuals is superb , and the organization of social groups. "
92,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2094984-weston,5,"""The Naked Ape"" is remarkable. It embodies precisely the type of popular-science literature I love to read: the matter-of-fact pointing out of things which, having been pointed out, seem totally obvious, as if Desmond Morris were just reciting things I already knew but hadn't gotten around to actually realizing yet. His observations run that gamut of what he terms ""typical"" human behavior and physiology. That is, at the time of this book's writing (as now) anthropologists and sociologists commonly made the atypical specimens and their behaviors the focus of their studies. Were other scientists engaged in the study of lifeforms to do similarly they would never get anywhere. Perhaps out of vanity, perhaps out of a lack of self-awareness, science has historically avoided turning its objective eye toward the scientist (obvious and irrelevant exceptions of medical science excluded). Luckily for us, Desmond Morris undertook this endeavor and his findings are not only fascinating but wildly entertaining.A great deal of the pleasure derived from this book is in the way that Morris so ruthlessly picks apart his subject. The book's title itself is a playful and astutely humbling jab at the subject which drives straight to the heart of his message: human beings are first and foremost animals. Apes, to be precise, and our principal distinguishing feature, from a zoological standpoint, from our ape cousins is no more than our lack of a shaggy coat. We may drive around in fancy cars, work in skyscrapers, level mountains, dam rivers, etc. At the end of the day, we're still a bunch of naked apes. Which isn't to say that we aren't members of an incredibly resourceful and clever species, fascinating from all angles and fascinated by all things. Because we are unique, we are remarkable. Still, it is no more than gross vanity that makes us suppose that our manipulation of the external environment or the complexity and ingeniousness of our cultural expression has enabled us to overcome the fact that we are ""still very much a biological phenomenon... subject to all the basic laws of animal behavior.""Morris arms his reader with a new arsenal of cocktail party factoids, some endearing, some disgusting, some depressing, others hilarious, which alone make the read worthwhile. For instance, the size and shape of human breasts suggest that they have developed, through many centuries of sexual selection, as sexual signaling devices rather than merely as organs used to feed infants. That is, human breasts are actually not very good feeding devices when compared to those of other apes. The nipple typically isn't shaped to fit easily into the infant mouth and the excess tissue around it can even obstruct the baby's breathing. And yet breasts are universally used to spectacular success in piquing the interest of potential mates and, it could go without saying, play an enormous secondary role in human intercourse, behavior which is seen nowhere else in the animal kingdom. The evolutionary reasons for this development, believe it or not, are fascinatingly and intimately woven into our ancestors struggle for survival as the first carnivorous apes on the ancient plains of Africa.Having been first published in the 60's, ""Naked Ape"" is somewhat outdated. Morris' characterization of indigenous societies as atypical cultural failures makes sense from the coldly zoological perspective from which he was attempting to write, but fails to take into consideration historical truths which invite explanations beyond a socities' supposed lack of functionality. Modern readers will be equally squeamish by the occasional reference made to the ""negroid race"" and the interpretation of homosexuality as little more than deviant behavior caused by abnormal childhood experiences. Present day sensitivities aside, Morris is nevertheless quite forward-thinking and the intellectual merits of the book by far exceed whatever flags might be raised by your inner-p.c. reactionary.As entertaining a book as it is, Morris' tone and message is ultimately one of apocalyptic foreboding. We naked apes have been so spectacularly successful as a species that we have come to think of ourselves as invincible and we are not. Our success will, sooner rather than later, catch up with us because the global economy of environmental resources is, after all, finite. The modern reader will recognize all too well that the book's imperative rings even truer today, despite Morris' having to sound like a fanatic at the time of its initial publishing. Ironically, Morris suggests, the naked ape's first step toward salvation will be the recognition of his true nature. To go forward we have to take an honest look at where we came from."

94,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21322837-heather-mcalister,1,"Backwards, sexist, racist drivel. Written by a man obviously trying to stroke his own ego by arguing how ""objectively,"" when you look at it from the impartial perspective of a rational (male) scientist, early hominids clearly evolved to walk upright, lose their fur, use tools, develop spoken language, etc. ALL so that males could hunt in groups like wolves or lions. Literally every physiological feature of the modern homo sapien, according to the ""impartial"" male Desmond Morris, was led by ""hot-blooded,"" aggressive alpha males to hunt and kill. The invention of tools being so men could hunt; walking upright so men could see over grass; learning to talk so men could communicate complex hunting strategies; the loss of fur so men wouldn't die of heatstroke running in the hot African climate, etc.And the women? Oh, they just evolved to be child-rearers and home-makers. They sat around in caves suckling their babes like mama wolves in their dens with cubs (never mind that real mother wolves are out of the den in weeks, and often dump their pups on a babysitter as soon as they possibly can) waiting with baited breath for the menfolk to come home and share the spoils of the hunt with them.And all the physical features early female hominids not covered by his ""male hunting"" explanation? Like female hominid larger breasts, wider birthing hips, hominids developing downward facing noses, etc? Oh, they just evolved to ""make sex sexier."" (I'm not kidding. That's what it says in the book.) Female hominids have larger breasts than other greater apes? It's because the males found it sexy. Female hominids have wider hips? Males found it sexy. Downward facing noses? Same thing. Homo sapiens have fuller lips than other greater apes? Because it made kissing sexier, and kissing is a great evolutionary foreplay to sex.The minute I stopped reading was when Desmond Morris claimed that (white) homo sapiens having pink lips because it gave them a pouty kissable look, thus making them look more kissable, thus more desirable as a mate. And what of certain black Africans who tend to have enough melanin in their skin not to have pink lips, and/or have fuller, puffier lips? According to Desmond Morris, it's because they're evolutionary failures who had to evolve fuller lips to make up for not having the desired pink lips that more evolutionary successful (white) homo sapiens possess. (Which, according to him, are like those living in North America. Not the ""obscure"" cultures in Africa that are ""not as evolutionary successful,"" his words. Never mind that white 'North American' culture as we know it has only existed for a few centuries at most, and hasn't withstood the test of time the way the 'obscure' African cultures have, which have stood for centuries, if not millennia.) This book is a transparent straight white male ego stroke, where a guy who fancies himself ""rational"" and ""objective"" breaks his arm patting himself, as a straight white male homo sapien, on the back for being ""an evolutionary success."" According to him, EVERY SINGLE physiological trait of the entire modern homo sapien species came from (presumably white) men of eons past being big strong hunters. Women and people of color were just hanger-ons who reaped the evolutionary benefits of the past (presumably) straight white male hunters' ingenuity. And every trait females have that males (presumably) don't is because the males found it sexy, or it aided in bearing the males' children. And every trait that people of color have that whites don't was formed to compensate the ""evolutionary disadvantage"" of not being white.Also, I took a few anthropology classes in community college. Almost every point he ever made has been largely disproven, or called into serious question. Fuck this guy, fuck this book. The fact that people still read this sexist, racist drivel and see it as anything resembling fact is frankly insulting to the whole homo sapien species."
95,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19627177-n-jr,5,"A fascinating read by a great thinker. Virtually no aspect of human nature and physiognomy escapes his keen zoologist eyes; even responses such as smiling, laughing and crying. However, be warned: not only is this book nearly 50 years old and therefore outdated, but one must ingest his words with a large heaping of salt. As a scientific treatise it fails. The best way to read it is to consider this the personal musings of a biologist/anthropologist, not the findings of an expert researcher. It's greatest value is in instigating thought on the subject. It is the step-back-and look-at-ourselves approach which is of real value here, not his (sometimes hilarious)conclusions.His explanation of the protuberance and shape of female breasts developing as a frontal sexual display resulting from our upright posture, rather than for increased efficiency of nursing, is presented as a credible argument. Mmm, maybe that explains the human male's fascination with them.Most of his observations are comparative, highlighting similarities and differences between other mammals, notably the chimpanzee. In all cases, Morris makes us think about many aspects of ourselves that we normally take for granted.One criticism I have is his over-emphasis on genetic origins - for example, he claims the pair-bond formation between sexes (i.e monogamy) is genetic rather than cultural - afraid I disagree there. Also his treatment of warfare is incomplete and not entirely satisfactory for me.I know others will attack the author as chauvinistic (not only in regards the sexes, but cultures as well), but still, hey, the book can just be considered food for thought.All in all, a stimulating read, one so rich that I have marked it for a second time around in the future. It helped me to come up with my own thoughts on the subject"
96,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4373676-jonathan-david-jackson,5,"Really a very interesting book. It's written as if the author were writing it about any other animal, and hearing myself talked about as if I am a naked mole rat or a chimpanzee is very refreshing (this doesn't give you permission to refer to me as such in polite society, btw). We are animals as much as any other, and we should consider all the things that make us what we are, including our animal instincts and our biological history.There are some ideas I think are odd, for example when he says that adults want to save elephants from extinction mainly because of our own impending individual extinction (death). Some things seem like just his opinion, and don't make sense to me. All the ideas, though - every single one - I found to be interesting. There were plenty of things I'd heard before (after all, it's a 40 year old book), but there were also plenty of things I hadn't heard which were totally new to me, and made me reconsider some of my own ideas. One such idea I have is that clothes are something unnatural, something to be avoided. He puts it to us that humans are a very sexual species, unlike other animals which have a mating season we are ready all the time, and unlike other animals which need to do something special to display their genitals ours are visible all the time, so to avoid making sexual displays to everyone all the time, we cover up. I've thought about most of my opinions long and hard for many years, and reading anything that makes me consider changing them is a rare and wonderful experience which had me turning each page almost in awe at what I had found before and might find after.I have the other two books in this series, and I can't wait to read them next."
97,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180947-j,3,"Desmond Morris raises some interesting points in this book, some more farfetched than others. Honestly, I have problems with a lot of the points he makes in this book. Attempting to explain everything we do by comparing us to our nearest relatives in the animal kingdom is like I said interesting but the truth is many of our behaviors are unique to our species because of our advanced intellect and I think simplifying them by saying they can be explained by looking at the behaviors of other primates is not entirely accurate. Furthermore, he makes a few mistakes I wouldn't expect anyone familiar with biology to make (including the 'tongue-map' for taste recognition) as well as taking a very eurocentric stance on human behavior. His postulations aren't really backed up with anything more than the observation of other primates which by itself can't really be used to explain our behavior. Along with his insistance on using North Americans and Europeans as the model for humanity, I have to say that this book is more rooted in speculation than fact and shouldn't be taken seriously as a work of science. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining read and worthy of the 3 stars I gave it."
98,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027404-david-o-brien,5,"Fascinating reading and life affirming in an unexpected way. The most common complaint about this book is lack of evidence or proof. Morris states clearly that he did not list all the evidence because it would turn the book into an encyclopedia. There is a bibliography at the end for those who want to see where he got his information and inspiration.The style of the book is not purely scientific in so far as he he makes assumptions and draws conclusions from his own experience and his research, which makes for very interesting reading, however can be interpreted as imprecise. Just because something is not 100% proven, that does not mean that it is not interesting, relevant, thought provoking or inspirational. Throughout the book there are segments I might not wholly agree with, however the scope of the book is so vast yet still well tied together and coherent that it deserves 5/5. A brave book that even today is refreshing, educational, inspiring and a break from convention."
99,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763793-jean,3,"I disagree with those who say this book is homophobic and/or misogynistic. Morris says some things that in normal conversational context might be dubbed as such, but his explicit purpose was to view mans behavior from an objective standpoint. He succeeds. Political correctness has no place in (even attempted) scientific writing. He DOES state that gay couples cannot procreate on their own. However he goes on to discuss scenarios where this may be a pro. Don't overreact. When I read this book, I was unaware it was written decades ago. Morris' observations were fairly elementary to me, I assume since I grew up hearing a good deal of them. It is still quite enjoyable to read despite my experience. "
100,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56218095-benehime,2,"In theory a good book, but so Sooooo outdated. The author adopts a super-alpha-male stance and women have only evolved because it served men. Don't you think they did anything other than having children!! Morris thinks that working is today's form of hunting and women obviously have no place there. also, male relaxing can only ever happen with an all male group. There are some interesting parts though, I loved the chapter about grooming and fighting (sad to see that he left out the vastly different way men and women fight, but oh, I forgot, women don't)."
101,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5155466-clare,2,"I found this book to be very disappointing. Morris makes some interesting statements about human behavior, but unfortunately, he has almost nothing that could be called evidence for anything that he poses as fact. Although at first I thought I might be unfairly judging it because his sexual politics differ from mine and his understanding of human sexuality is dated to say the least, his statements on non-sex-related behaviors are equally unsupported."

111,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,3,"Objective SummaryThis book explores the evolution, biology, psychology, and sociology of human beings. Morris refers to humans as the “naked ape” in an attempt to remove his cultural and experiential biases from his analysis, and to remind his readers that they, like all humans, are just evolved animals. Morris attempts to objectively describe human beings’ features, behavior, and the reasons for both in the same way a zoologist would describe any newly discovered species. The defining characteristic about human beings is our intelligence. But that intelligence is mapped crudely onto base animalistic tendencies and necessities. Rather than jumping straight to our intelligence, which may cloud important but elementary observations, Morris refers to us as the “naked ape,” a statement on our physical appearance as nearly hairless primates. Despite any attempts to ignore or transcend our animal roots, they persist. Morris explores human evolution, sex, child rearing, exploration, fighting, feeding, pursuit of comfort, and interaction with other animals. Listed below are some of the main lessons and interesting tidbits.•	Humans evolved from monkeys and apes. We moved from forests to the plains, though one theory suggests we moved from forests to seaside coasts to the plains. •	We moved from a vegetarian to an omnivore diet when we left the forest. This required cooperative hunting and defensive parties of males within the social hierarchy. This cooperation could now be a contributing factor to the development of gangs and wars.•	Neoteny, or extension of childhood development, played a significant role in human evolution. It allowed the human brain to continue to develop and grow for decades after birth, and it required pair-bonding between males and females to support the extended adolescence of their offspring. •	Pair-bonding helped females remain faithful to their mates, it reduced social friction between males over mating access, and it helped in rearing the slow-developing children. Pair-bonding is powerful but imperfect. The female orgasm, which is unusual if not unique to humans, was a contributor to pair-bonding. •	Why humans are relatively hairless isn’t known with certainty. The most popular theory is that it aids cooling during times of extreme exertion, like hunting. •	Much of our appearance is sexual signaling. Relatively large penises and breasts, red lips, and hairlessness all likely have sexual origins. Pubic and armpit hair likely trap pheromones for sexual arousal. •	80% of mothers hold infants in their left arms most likely because their heartbeat soothes their young.•	Animals fight to establish the dominance hierarchy and defend territory. They do not use their weapons to try to kill members of their own species because that would not be evolutionarily advantageous. Successful species establish aggressive and submissive displays that can substitute for actual physical confrontation and reduce physical harm and death. Bowing and avoiding eye contact are submissive signs. Standing tall and direct eye contact are dominant or aggressive signs. •	Human weaponry permits fatal action from afar. Our inability to observe submissive signals may contribute to additional killing and destruction. •	Curiosity serves a vital function to an opportunistic species. It has led humans to discover new lands, invent new tools, and try new foods. Curiosity has expanded into arts, science, and technology. There is a perpetual balance between novelty and familiarity. We want the excitement of the former with the security of the latter. By pushing the boundaries and exploring, we discover new and better ways to feed, protect, and comfort ourselves. •	Human desire for sweet foods can lead to obesity.•	Humans domesticated dozens of species of animals for food (cows, chickens, goats, pigs), companionship (dogs, cats, horses), transportation (horses, camels, elephants), experimentation (mice, rats, guinea pigs), and other tasks like plowing and hauling heavy stuff (horses, donkeys, oxen). •	Dogs were likely domesticated when we took wolf pups to fatten them up for food. Then we realized they could help us hunt and alert us to danger. There are breeds of dogs that are herders, scent-trackers, setters and pointers to prey, retrievers, killers of vermin, and guard dogs.•	Animals have five basic relationships with other animals: prey, symbiont, competitor, parasite, and predator.•	Religion may have roots in the need for an ultimately powerful being at the top of a hierarchy.•	12,000 British kids listed their favorite animals as: 1. Chimpanzee, 2. Monkey, 3. Horse, 4. Bushbaby, 5. Panda, 6. Bear, 7. Elephant, 8. Lion, 9. Dog, 10. Giraffe. They tend to have anthropomorphic features like sitting or moving upright and having highly expressive faces.•	12,000 British kids listed their most hated animals as: 1. Snake, 2. Spider, 3. Crocodile, 4. Lion, 5. Rat, 6. Skunk, 7. Gorilla, 8. Rhinoceros, 9. Hippopotamus, 10. Tiger. These are all dangerous. •	To survive as a civilization and a species, we must recognize and submit to our biological features. They cannot all be overcome through thought, culture, or technology. Subjective ThoughtsI read this book because the dude in the movie “Bring It On” was reading it during a high school football game. It was interesting and thought-provoking, but much of the content seemed familiar. That makes sense since I am a naked ape and have interacted with them all my life. And I think much of this material was covered in my biology textbooks back in the day.It was impossible for me to miss how much a product of its time this book was. Written in 1967, Morris was only five years removed from the Cuban missile crisis, and nuclear annihilation was clearly on his mind. He also harbored Malthusian fears of continued population growth, resource strain, and territorial strife. He anticipated the Ehrlichs’ “Population Bomb,” which would be published one year later. He seemed quite pessimistic on both the nuclear annihilation and overpopulation fronts. If he were to update the book today, he’d no doubt include global cooling, I mean global warming, errr global climate change in his list of calamities. Fortunately, as I type this, nukes haven’t dropped in anger since ’45, Trump may be in the process of solving Korea, reproduction rates have slowed across the developed world and sometimes below replacement levels, and there are alternative albeit expensive energy sources. Not that I’m worried enough about any of this to shut off the air conditioner or my computer. And this Honeycrisp apple from Walmart is amazing. Morris should also update his advice on how to handle being pulled over by police. His suggestion is to immediately leave your car and approach the officer so that you two don’t interact on “your” territory near your car, which will make the officer feel threatened. That shit will get you shot today. Stay in your car with your hands on the wheel, and wait to move until you’re told. You don’t want to suddenly approach someone with a Glock 17 on standby.Memorable Quotes“A solitary monkey or ape is a vulnerable creature. It lacks the powerful natural weapons of the carnivore and in isolation falls easy prey to the stalking killers.”“It is only a wise primate, like our hunting ape, that knows its own father.”“The male reaches the consummatory act of sperm ejaculation within a few minutes in most cases, unless deliberate delaying tactics are employed. . . . Some females may reach this point very quickly, others not at all, but on the average it is attained between ten and twenty minutes after the start of copulation.”“Its normal, average length of nine and a half centimetres is increased by seven to eight centimetres. The diameter is also considerably increased, giving the species the largest erect penis of any living primate.”“After a gestation period of approximately 266 days her uterus begins to contract powerfully and rhythmically.”“The average weight of a baby at birth is just over seven pounds, which is slightly more than one-twentieth of the weight of the average parent.”“Lucky is the society that enjoys the gradual acquisition of a perfect balance between imitation and curiosity, between slavish, unthinking copying and progressive, rational experimentation.”“In all exploratory behaviour, whether artistic or scientific, there is the ever-present battle between the neophilic and neophobic urges. The former drives us on to new experiences, makes us crave for novelty. The latter holds us back, makes us take refuge in the familiar. We are constantly in a state of shifting balance between the conflicting attractions of the exciting new stimulus and the friendly old one. If we lost our neophilia we would stagnate. If we lost our neophobia, we would rush headlong into disaster.”“We are, to put it mildly, in a mess, and there is a strong chance that we shall have exterminated ourselves by the end of the century.”“Animals fight amongst themselves for one of two very good reasons: either to establish their dominance in a social hierarchy, or to establish their territorial rights over a particular piece of ground.” “If a species is to survive, it simply cannot afford to go around slaughtering its own kind. Intra-specific aggression has to be inhibited and controlled, and the more powerful and savage the prey-killing weapons of a particular species are, the stronger must be the inhibitions about using them to settle disputes with rivals.”“To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion. Abortion is a drastic measure and can involve serious emotional disturbance. Furthermore, once a zygote has been formed by the act of fertilization it constitutes a new individual member of society, and its destruction is, in effect, an act of aggression, which is the very pattern of behaviour that we are attempting to control. Contraception is obviously preferable, and any religious or other ‘moralizing’ factions that oppose it must face the fact that they are engaged in dangerous war-mongering.”“We each possess about 10,000 of these taste buds, but in old age they deteriorate and decrease in number, hence the jaded palate of the elderly gastronome. Surprisingly, we can only respond to four basic tastes. They are: sour, salt, bitter, and sweet.”“Domestication of livestock, involving the organized control and selective breeding of prey, is known to have been practised for at least ten thousand years and, in certain cases, probably much longer. Goats, sheep and reindeer appear to have been the earliest prey species dealt with in this way.”“It is probable that [an interspecific bond between humans and dogs] began as a result of young puppies being brought in to the tribal home base to be fattened as food.”“Unless we can colonize other planets on a massive scale and spread the load, or seriously check our population increase in some way, we shall, in the not-too-far distant future, have to remove all other forms of life from the earth. . . . We need not dwell on this nightmare: the possibility of its becoming a reality is remote.”"

While it's a good review of instinctive human behaviour it is expectionally light into actual comparisons to other primates.He does make interesting points, e.g. noting that when the forests started to disappear we converged towards carnivore traits but by using artificial weapons rather than natural ones we did not need to move towards becoming like cats/dogs (though he doesn't note that other plains primates probably did so more than us). He notes the importance of us acquiring home bases where the females were left, and hence the need to develop more clear territories, pair bonds and ability to share food with family/tribe.He talks about how adolescents acquite the need to go off and develop their own home. But here he doesn't spend any time discussing what's actually known about how humans do this. It's actually remarkable how variable this is across different societies (albeit it generally has fixed form within a society). Sometimes it it the male, sometimes the female. These are generally species fixed traits, and yet he doesn't cover this.He talks about how the development of a pair bond meant that we needed to start hiding our sexual features in public. He notes that other species generally sustain the pair bond through aggression, but we do it instead by wearing clothes and avoiding touching each other.It's quite an old book and features some exceptional examples of envirionmentalist (e.g. blank slate) thinking from the era it was written, which is somewhat startling in a book which otherwise fully acknowledges that we are creatures driven by innate behaviours. For instance, he talks about how if a mother is tense and smiles to conceil it, the baby will detect it and mistake the function of a smile... he then warns that this could be permanently damaging and cause the child serious social difficulties... nuttier environmentalist claptrap than that is only spewed forth by modern SJWs but I guess it was par for the course back then. The section on music and it's relation to mothers heart beat is similarly whacko.A section of the book deals with our innate sounds/actions, e.g. laughter and smiling. Discussion about how they evolved is perhaps questionable. Notes things like when a baby smiles it waves it's arms and legs around, and suggests this is the vestigial primate clinging response. There's also curious little factoids, like our 'sweet tooth' being a distinct primate thing that other carnivores don't generally have.An interesting section is when he talks about how men go along to trade unions, social clubs , learned societies etc as an equivilent of the hunting pack. They do so to experience our built in bond from male togetherness. Interestingly, this was written before it became taboo to go to male only societies. One suspects that the author would not thus be suprised that membership of all voluntary societies has utterly collapsed since women were permitted to join them (see Putnam's 'Bowling Alone'). He also describes how work is probably a poor substitute for hunting for the working classes in a manner that it is not for the middle class. Expresses it in a manner that is probably illegal these days.A key point the author wants to get across in the book is that we're going through a population boom and being forced into living in environments increasingly more crowded and distrinct from what we evolved for. He talks about how the modern usage of soulless featureless architecture where everything looks the same flys against our built in desire to mark territory as our own through personalisation (declaring quite rightly that modern architects are terrorists). He is sceptical about the ability of us to adapt our innate behaviour. On that, he is probably correct. He could have argued his case better (and I believe that in his next book he went on to do so). "
113,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13626166-siddarth-gore,5,"So there he stands, our vertical, hunting, weapon-toting, territorial, neotenous, brainy, Naked Ape, a primate by ancestry and a carnivore by adoption, ready to conquer the world.We evolved from apes. But exactly how far did we get? Your guesses might be way off the mark. This book says that under the surface we are ruled mostly by our inner primates. Things just look different on us. Evolution is too slow a process for us to have shed our animal past.In our species there is, as we have seen, a strong tendency to ‘fall in love’—to develop a powerful bond with the object of our sexual attentions.No primates are monogamous so why are we? The answer comes from our adaptation to life on the plains of Africa once we were thrown out of the jungle perhaps due to environmental changes. Hint, pack hunters need cooperation from all males.They occur with particularly high frequency during the initial stages of social encounters, where hidden fears and aggressions are lurking just below the surface. At a dinner party, or any small social gathering, as soon as the mutual appeasement ceremonies of hand-shaking and smiling are over, displacement cigarettes, displacement drinks and displacement food-snacks are immediately offered.This was the most fascinating part. Monkeys and apes are very much social animals with hierarchy being most crucial thing on their minds. How did we get rid of that, or did we? Even the most innocuous conversations and meetings are anything but that for your social relations obsessed brain. To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion.His argument is that cramming animals in compact spaces invariably leads to aggression. We might think we are special but think again. Only way to make sure we do not turn against each other is to give everyone enough space. Debatable, but interesting viewpoint none the less.Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else.One can only hope ;-)"
114,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98103014-jonas,4,"This book was first published in 1967 and I found it to be somewhat of a foreboding book.I was first introduced into many of these concepts regarding “the naked ape’s” ecological role and behaviour from other books, such as Ishmael by Daniel Quinn and The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. Though those books are written about something else, I found myself thinking of those books while I was reading this one. Many of the arguments presented in those books could be paralleled with the comparative elements between the human and ape presented throughout this book.Each chapter though succinct, presents an interesting perspective on the anatomy of the human body, as well as our behavioural aspects against the bodies and social practices of other ape species. I thought many of the ideas were very inventive, but the chapter on sex comes across as crass and salacious, but otherwise, the book presents itself in a very tame manner.Whilst the book contains many fantastic ideas, I can see why this book created controversy within the feminist/homosexual communities. The book even manages to squeeze in a supporting message for contraceptives and population control. Overall, I think the book makes for an interesting read, but is by no means the best book regarding the topic especially in modern day, due to changing of the zeitgeist from the late 1960’s to the prevalence of technology today (even though some of the fears might still be present today). Despite that, I still think it’s worth a read to understand how it was relevant at that time, and how it has paved a way and introduced the idea of comparative ethology to the general public."
115,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705775-gerardo-alonso,4,"The Naked Ape is a mirror. While reading it, one sees a reflection of oneself. But unlike many other reflections, this one is raw and based on our biological characteristics. This reflection breaks down our egos and social constructs to their bare bones. Desmond Morris attempts to show humanity that we are merely a species of the Animal KingdomI found the book inspiring, and highly effective to understand characteristic behaviours we may have. It feels as if someone is saying what one has already known but could not figure out the words to explain it.While this book is very powerful philosophically, I think it lacks thoroughness in logic. One of the things that concerns me is that it seems to me that Morris takes a one-sided view of several arguments sometimes based on factoids/opinions that may debatable. Another difficulty I find is the ease of comparison between the Homo Sapiens and the apes. While true that we share a very similar DNA structure, I think that Morris not only tries to link biological similarities (which he does in a great way in the beginning of the book), but also behavioural similarities.I get that in some cases or themes, the behaviour among species will be the same. The fight or flight response, for example. But when highly specific social interactions are compared between species, Morris should have analysed the Naked Ape by itself.It may be the case that some of the science behind the book is outdated, since this was published in the 60s. Regardless of the leaps Morris takes, this book is worth reading as a biology, anthropology and history lesson of our species. "
116,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"I had a great time reading this book. Despite coming out almost fifty years ago when I found it, much of what it says is still thought provoking and relevant. The book owes a little bit to psychoanalysis which was more dominant at the time. Which is good since Morris uses it to good effect to tie together physiological and behavioral facts into a general theory of human nature. What is that theory of human nature? Well, that we are the way we are because our ancestors were forced to become a predator species/hunting-ape and couldn't stay in and around trees picking fruits. Millions of years ago in Africa, during the Miocene, the forests started to disappear, and the apes could either cling onto whatever was left, or leave the ""garden of Eden"" and enter into competition with the predators on the ground. Ape populations have dwindled since, and we have emerged the apex predator. To get to that point we had to overcome the other predators, but with inferior equipment so to speak; no fangs or claws. So we made use of two things carried over to a certain degree from our ape past; intelligence and social communication. ""His whole body, his way of life, was geared to a forest existence, and then suddenly he was jettisoned into a world where he could survive only if he began to live like a brainy, weapon toting wolf."" Our social lives are to this day built on a sort of tension between social communication and intellect (from ape life) and group loyalty and hunting from our predator existence. Vestiges of our ape life are our greater reliance on sight at the expense of smell and a more various taste palate. Our predator life involves traveling greater distances to find game, rather than remaining close to the trees, having a home base to protect and return to, and having regular meals rather than momentary snacking. Being a predatory ape means developing ways to facilitate male cooperation, to hunt together with dangerous weapons, and to guarantee a share of the kills and a female for the effort. Monogamy and private property likely arise from a need to secure the loyalty of males to females and children while they hunted and prevent conflict among the males. This isn't all bad, as the predator life means some degree of male solidarity. We can't have a single alpha male who gets exclusive access to women and food. The ability to cooperate and use weapon technology means the lesser males can gang up and resist, limit, or kill the alpha male. Thus some satisfactory distribution of females and resources becomes necessary for social order, and this is likely where marriage and property and even government developed from. Morris channels Sigmund Freud and argues that religion emerges from the guilt of (symbolically) killing the alpha ape. Even with all his faults, an all powerful male does instill some sort of order and security which is socially useful. You knew where you stood, and the alpha ape in a way encouraged exogamous mating, preventing incest by kicking the sons out of the harem. So religion projects the seemingly omnipotent alpha ape onto the cosmos, extending its influence to our personal lives without actually being here. There are several downsides that ape life has: lack of cooperation (among males), a pecking order with one individual on top, and less incentive to control nature. Ape and monkey society is more about competition and dominance, and dependent on nature providing food for the picking. Depending on the environment means not traveling too far and remaining close, thus reducing the need for defense of home as well as needing to know what others are up to as they aren't far. If we just forage for food, there isn't a need to cooperate. It's ""finders keepers"", and so dominance becomes more important. The alpha male gets the first pick, and so long as everybody abides conflict can be avoided, with little need to work together other than staying out of the big guy's way. Despite all these downsides, we are still closest to the apes. We haven't evolved to be complete predators, just enough behaviors to utilize our intelligence and social cooperation to survive and thrive. And we only evolved that way because the environment made us, forced us out east of Eden. It seems that much of our aesthetics, tastes, curiosity, and enjoyment of life are owed to our more ape aspects. A pure predator kind of society would resemble the Spartans I think. What we do in leisure however reflects both aspects of our nature, in varying degrees. The popularity of sports and online first person shooter video games reflects the more predator side. More relaxing and solitary activities like cooking or painting reflect the ape side. As for the title, the naked ape, the reason why we don't have a full coat of fur is to aid us in hunting; cooling us down by chasing animals. Other predators can make fast dashes after prey, but our bipedal stature and the occupation of our hands makes this difficult. ""By losing the heavy coat of hair and by increasing the number of sweat glands all over the body surface, considerable cooling could be achieved- not for minute by minute living, but for the supreme moments of the chase."" Our subcutaneous fat and ability to fashion clothes help keep us warm without fur. With the help of neoteny, the retaining of youthful traits into adulthood, all this explains our appearance as the naked ape. Younger chimps have flatter faces, a long slender neck, smaller teeth, absence of heavy brow ridges, non-rotating big toe, and more hair on the head than the rest of the body. Our extended childhood also allows us to develop our powerful brains. A desire to explore and learn new things are also associated with youth, and so we are the young ape as well as the naked ape. Though of course neoteny is selective, as we aren't attracted to infant genitals, infantile emotions, or infantile strength. The book is full of interesting speculations about behavior, always trying to link us to our animal nature. The message of the book is that we are still operating with an animal mindset no matter how developed we are. Even the most complex behaviors like pacing back and forth and the conduct of war harken back to our more modest origins."

Grazie, Mr. Gabbani (you were my personal winner anyways... and that is kind of all I know in Italian).Thus study was such a positive disappointment! I was afraid it would be too academical for my humanities-oriented brain... but guys, if you want to read a study on how humans evolved from apes and ""the missing links"" and how certains traditions and habits of ours formed, that is really interesting and really easy to read, it is for you. I read that Desmond Morris said he wanted to de-mistify science... and I could not put it better. The explanation is really clear, easy to understand and there were some really interesting and cool facts about certain human behaviour that we still practice... it was really interesting to see where they could come from.Also: if you are a really devout creatonist, I'd recommend you only read the book if you do not get triggered by reading full-on declared truths about evolution (as I believe in evolution and the scientific research that are supposed to prove it, I did not have any issues)."

We mustn't forget when was developed this essay, as well as the possible intentions of the author.The last chapter of the book is just... funny. Suddenly, Morris seems to see sex in the explanations about why we like some animals instead of others (maybe he was possessed by Freud when he wrote the last pages) and the justifications about animal exploitation are, some of them, just ridiculous. But I'm totally agree with one of the ideas in this book, and is that the world is overpopulated by the human beings and that it would be necessary to reduce the population (not killing people!), promoting and facilitating the use of contraceptive measures.In summary: to be careful with some of the contents in the book, but is a really interesting reading in my opinion."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book aged as well as can be expected. Desmond Morris writes from a zoologist's perspective and tries to describe man as if he were an external observer of our species. He analyses us and our behaviours from a very functional point of view. In the first chapters he mostly explores our physiological characteristics (and the differences between us and our closest animal relatives) and offers various evolutionary explanations for how they could have come to be. The zoologist's perspective proves to be very insightful for this purpose and I learned a great deal. In later chapters he starts to focus more on our behaviour. Though still thought-provoking, much of what he says is very speculative and his views on women and homosexuality are strongly influenced by the era in which the book was written.Despite some of these outdated speculations, it is still extremely interesting and insightful. I would recommend it to anyone who's fascinated by human evolution. "

Millions of years ago, due to some reason, most likely due to climate change, the arboreal apes that originally lived in the forest had to walk out of the forest and leave the branches to stand on the ground, and became hunting apes in order to get enough food. In the process of evolution of hunting apes, although seemingly distinctive naked apes have gradually formed, naked apes still reflect the characteristics of typical primates and typical carnivores. Naked apes maintain their juvenile development, allowing the development of the brain to continue for a long time. The long developmental process will bring a heavy burden of parenting for females, which requires naked apes to form a more stable spouse relationship to complete the nurturing of the next generation. In order to ensure that this goal can be achieved, nature seems to give the naked ape stronger sexual stimulation as compensation. Even in the social structure of naked apes where multiple spouses are allowed, the vast majority of members still adopt a one-to-one monogamy relationship due to the high cost of parenting . From the perspective of species, reproduction is the biggest mission. In this process, ""sex"" plays an extremely important role. The sexual behavior of naked apes is typically different from other 192 species of apes. The females of other apes do not seem to have an orgasm, and the sexual intercourse process is often extremely short, usually only lasting 15 times. The estrus period of females is also very short, they often leave immediately after the end of sexual intercourse, ready for the next sexual act at any time, so as not to miss the precious opportunity for fertilization. The female of the naked ape will continue to lie down to rest after the sexual intercourse is completed, immersed in the aftermath of a certain orgasm. Not only that, except for a few periods, the sexual activity of naked apes is almost unaffected. This means that even during pregnancy, female naked apes can still meet the sexual needs of male naked apes, thereby enhancing the mate relationship. The strengthening of sexual stimulation will bring about another problem, that is, when the spouses are separated, there must be a mechanism to inhibit the sexual behavior of naked apes, otherwise the social structure of monogamy will be destroyed. This is for raising the next generation. It was almost a devastating blow. The most obvious measure is to cover the fig leaf. The genitals and sexual behavior must be covered up and become a kind of extremely important privacy. The cold protection effect of clothing is not revealed until the naked ape goes out of the tropics. In addition, there are other means, such as to cover secondary sexual characteristics, shaving the child, such as armpit hair shave; remove the smell of the body; prohibition of physical contact. Naked apes need to strengthen the sexual stimulation between their spouses on the one hand, and weaken the sexual stimulation between non-mates on the one hand, so as to maintain the stability of monogamy and ensure that the cooperative relationship of the entire social structure is not destroyed. Some science fiction novels make some bold conjectures, such as: baby farms, social behavior, selective sterilization, and division of labor. For now, these behaviors are contrary to the biological instincts of naked apes. If they are implemented on a large scale one day, it can almost be concluded that the social structure and lifestyle of naked apes will undergo unimaginable changes, and the impact of changes in sexual and parenting behavior will be extremely profound. "" Among the existing 4237 mammals, almost no animal can be found suitable for survival without fur. Mammals are different from their reptile ancestors. They have an unparalleled advantage in their physiological characteristics. They can maintain a constant comparison. High body temperature. This makes the delicate machine with physiological functions suitable for efficient operation. This attribute is neither easily damaged nor easily abandoned. The body's thermostat is extremely important. Thicker, hairy and insulated The epidermis obviously plays an important role in preventing heat loss. Under strong sunlight, it can also prevent high body temperature and prevent direct sun burns to the skin. Therefore, if body hair is to fall off, obviously there must be a very good reason To give it up. Apart from a few rare exceptions, mammals acquired a new medium in evolution after referral to take this drastic step change. Flying mammals, such as bats, were forced to remove their body hair on both wings, but the body hair of other parts was still preserved, so they cannot be included as a nude species. Several burrowing mammals have greatly reduced body hair, such as voles, aardvarks, and armadillos. Aquatic mammals, such as whales, dolphins, mermaids, manatees, and seahorses, also lose their body hair as their bodies become streamlined. However, for all typical mammals that live on the surface, whether it is an animal jumping on the ground or an animal climbing on plants, the densely covered skin is an inevitable law. Except for the unusually large rhinoceros and elephants (which have special problems with their heat preservation and cooling mechanisms), naked apes are unique mammals without body hair . "" If we study humans from a biological point of view , ignore the fact that we are humans, and try our best to adopt a relatively objective attitude to study humans as animals. In fact, many interesting new ideas will be obtained. These biological insights may enable us to better understand many social phenomena. "" We know that the climate has undergone unfavorable changes. By about 15 million years ago, the scale of their forest fortresses dropped sharply. The ancestors of monkeys were forced to do two things. One of the two must be one of them: or they still defend the forest. The dilapidated hometown, or bravely faced the fate of being expelled from the Garden of Eden as the Bible says. Chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons and orangutans remained in the woods, and their numbers have been declining ever since. There is only another kind that exists apes - naked ape ancestors blaze a way out of it. they withdraw into the forest wilderness, engaged in fierce competition, the oath has been highly adaptable animal life on the ground is assessed by this risky step, but it is the outcome of evolution. In short, this adventure has been greatly rewarded. "" Even during the careful evolution of organisms . Also experienced several important adventures . These risky decisions influence so far-reaching, it determines the millions of years later, his race would die out , or will evolve into more advanced species . ""The predatory ancient apes are basically a group of males. Females are busy raising children and cannot take the main role in hunting prey. As the complexity of hunting increases, the time for hunting gradually increases, and it is necessary to abandon ancestors drifting and migrating. Lifestyle. Therefore, a fixed residence is needed to bring the prey back to the fixed base. Females and cubs wait at home for the males to return from hunting and share food. The step of fixing the residence will be seen in later chapters. , And will have a profound impact on all aspects of today’s most perfectly developed apes. "" As early human Australopithecus social division of labor during the formation of straight to this day , still a profound impact on our society. In family life, the man primarily responsible for the provision of social resources , to feed the family. While women are primarily responsible for providing resources , to breed and raise offspring. To this day, our tendency to choose a spouse basically follows this line of thinking. Men are eager to marry young, beautiful women , which implies that she has a strong ability to reproduce. Women desire to marry rich and loyal men, which means that they have the will and ability to provide a favorable living environment for themselves and their offspring. "" Fundamentally, we originated from a carnivore in the primate order. Among the existing monkeys and apes, our evolution is very unique. But this evolutionary change is not uncommon among animals of other subjects. For example, the giant panda is an animal that has completely transformed in evolution. This example is exquisite. We have changed from a vegetarian animal to a carnivore, while the giant panda has changed from a carnivore to a vegetarian animal. Just like us. The giant panda is an incomparable and very unique animal. One important thing is that the animal created by this violent transformation has a dual personality. Once it crosses the threshold between the two species, it plunges into its new role. Moving forward with great evolutionary energy-it has become too fast, so it still carries many original qualities. The time for evolution is not sufficient, it is too late to get rid of all the original features, just put on the surface features in a hurry. When primitive fish have just overcome the water-free obstacles in their terrestrial life, their terrestrial animal qualities have evolved by leaps and bounds, but they still embrace the characteristics of aquatic animals. To complete a perfect and dramatic new species, it will take millions of years. The pioneers who walk in the front are usually bizarre mixed animals. The naked ape is just such a mixed four different elephants. His entire body and the lifestyle of the pond are suitable for arboreal life, but suddenly (the so-called sudden is from the slow evolutionary process), he was thrown into a completely different world. "" "" Carnivores give birth to fleas, but primates do not. Monkeys and apes are plagued by lice and are also infected with some parasitic diseases. However, contrary to popular belief, they are not fleas at all; therefore, there are A very convincing reason. To understand this, we must first examine the life cycle of the flea. When a flea lays eggs, it does not lay on the host, but in the sleeping home of the host. The flea eggs hatch after 3 days. Wriggling little maggots. These larvae do not suck blood, but live on the dust collected in their dens. After another two weeks, the larvae cocoon and pupate. The pupae become adults after resting in the cocoon for about half a month and emerge from the cocoon. Find a suitable host. It can be seen that at least during the first month of its life cycle, the flea is separated from its host. Obviously, mammals that do not settle down, such as monkeys or apes, are not troubled by fleas. This is the reason. Even if one or two fleas accidentally land on a primate and successfully mate, the eggs they lay cannot be taken away by the primate because the primate is constantly migrating. When the flea pupae emerge from the cocoon, there will be no host waiting for them ""at home"", maintaining the host and guest relationship with them. Therefore, fleas are parasites of animals in fixed dwellings. For example, typical carnivores are such animals. "" "" First of all, the naked ape sense organs are not suitable for life on the ground. His sense of smell is too weak, his ears keen enough. His physique is too weak to withstand the grueling endurance test experience, not to break out like thunder lightning sprint, This weakness is irreparable. In terms of personality, he is more competitive, not more cooperative, and he is undoubtedly not good at planning and focusing. Fortunately, his brain is extremely good. In general intelligence, he surpassed his rival carnivore. With the help of walking upright, he has transformed both his hands and feet; through further improvements in his brain and dedicated use of the brain, he may be successful. "" "" If we look at a typical monkey fetus, we will be able to understand the most profoundly why the juvenile persistence mechanism contributes to the development and development of the primate brain. The brain during the fetal period of the monkey develops rapidly, growing up and becoming complex. The baby monkey is born. , Its brain has reached 70% of the mature brain. The remaining 30% are fully developed in the first 6 months after birth. Even chimpanzee babies with higher intelligence have brain development within 12 months after birth Be completed. Our species is in sharp contrast to this. The brain volume of a baby at birth is only 23% of that of an adult. During the 6 years after birth, children’s brains continue to develop rapidly, but the entire developmental period of the human brain can only be completed at about 23 years of age. This shows that for you and me, after sexual maturity, brain development will continue for 10 years. However, for chimpanzees, brain development has been completed for six or seven years before reproductive capacity becomes active. "" "" Infant monkeys and chimpanzees also like to play, explore, and are creative, but they die soon at this stage. However, for naked apes, these infancy characteristics will continue until they mature. In adulthood. He has enough time to imitate and learn all the techniques designed by his ancestors. In terms of physique and instinct, he has many shortcomings as a hunter. However, his intelligence and imitating ability can make up for its shortcomings and More than enough. The way and depth he accepts his parents' teaching is beyond the reach of any other animal. "" In the flesh, humans do not have the advantage of competing with large carnivores. But the reason why we can get to this point. Mainly rely on the wisdom of individuals is superb , and the organization of social groups. "
122,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2094984-weston,5,"""The Naked Ape"" is remarkable. It embodies precisely the type of popular-science literature I love to read: the matter-of-fact pointing out of things which, having been pointed out, seem totally obvious, as if Desmond Morris were just reciting things I already knew but hadn't gotten around to actually realizing yet. His observations run that gamut of what he terms ""typical"" human behavior and physiology. That is, at the time of this book's writing (as now) anthropologists and sociologists commonly made the atypical specimens and their behaviors the focus of their studies. Were other scientists engaged in the study of lifeforms to do similarly they would never get anywhere. Perhaps out of vanity, perhaps out of a lack of self-awareness, science has historically avoided turning its objective eye toward the scientist (obvious and irrelevant exceptions of medical science excluded). Luckily for us, Desmond Morris undertook this endeavor and his findings are not only fascinating but wildly entertaining.A great deal of the pleasure derived from this book is in the way that Morris so ruthlessly picks apart his subject. The book's title itself is a playful and astutely humbling jab at the subject which drives straight to the heart of his message: human beings are first and foremost animals. Apes, to be precise, and our principal distinguishing feature, from a zoological standpoint, from our ape cousins is no more than our lack of a shaggy coat. We may drive around in fancy cars, work in skyscrapers, level mountains, dam rivers, etc. At the end of the day, we're still a bunch of naked apes. Which isn't to say that we aren't members of an incredibly resourceful and clever species, fascinating from all angles and fascinated by all things. Because we are unique, we are remarkable. Still, it is no more than gross vanity that makes us suppose that our manipulation of the external environment or the complexity and ingeniousness of our cultural expression has enabled us to overcome the fact that we are ""still very much a biological phenomenon... subject to all the basic laws of animal behavior.""Morris arms his reader with a new arsenal of cocktail party factoids, some endearing, some disgusting, some depressing, others hilarious, which alone make the read worthwhile. For instance, the size and shape of human breasts suggest that they have developed, through many centuries of sexual selection, as sexual signaling devices rather than merely as organs used to feed infants. That is, human breasts are actually not very good feeding devices when compared to those of other apes. The nipple typically isn't shaped to fit easily into the infant mouth and the excess tissue around it can even obstruct the baby's breathing. And yet breasts are universally used to spectacular success in piquing the interest of potential mates and, it could go without saying, play an enormous secondary role in human intercourse, behavior which is seen nowhere else in the animal kingdom. The evolutionary reasons for this development, believe it or not, are fascinatingly and intimately woven into our ancestors struggle for survival as the first carnivorous apes on the ancient plains of Africa.Having been first published in the 60's, ""Naked Ape"" is somewhat outdated. Morris' characterization of indigenous societies as atypical cultural failures makes sense from the coldly zoological perspective from which he was attempting to write, but fails to take into consideration historical truths which invite explanations beyond a socities' supposed lack of functionality. Modern readers will be equally squeamish by the occasional reference made to the ""negroid race"" and the interpretation of homosexuality as little more than deviant behavior caused by abnormal childhood experiences. Present day sensitivities aside, Morris is nevertheless quite forward-thinking and the intellectual merits of the book by far exceed whatever flags might be raised by your inner-p.c. reactionary.As entertaining a book as it is, Morris' tone and message is ultimately one of apocalyptic foreboding. We naked apes have been so spectacularly successful as a species that we have come to think of ourselves as invincible and we are not. Our success will, sooner rather than later, catch up with us because the global economy of environmental resources is, after all, finite. The modern reader will recognize all too well that the book's imperative rings even truer today, despite Morris' having to sound like a fanatic at the time of its initial publishing. Ironically, Morris suggests, the naked ape's first step toward salvation will be the recognition of his true nature. To go forward we have to take an honest look at where we came from."

124,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21322837-heather-mcalister,1,"Backwards, sexist, racist drivel. Written by a man obviously trying to stroke his own ego by arguing how ""objectively,"" when you look at it from the impartial perspective of a rational (male) scientist, early hominids clearly evolved to walk upright, lose their fur, use tools, develop spoken language, etc. ALL so that males could hunt in groups like wolves or lions. Literally every physiological feature of the modern homo sapien, according to the ""impartial"" male Desmond Morris, was led by ""hot-blooded,"" aggressive alpha males to hunt and kill. The invention of tools being so men could hunt; walking upright so men could see over grass; learning to talk so men could communicate complex hunting strategies; the loss of fur so men wouldn't die of heatstroke running in the hot African climate, etc.And the women? Oh, they just evolved to be child-rearers and home-makers. They sat around in caves suckling their babes like mama wolves in their dens with cubs (never mind that real mother wolves are out of the den in weeks, and often dump their pups on a babysitter as soon as they possibly can) waiting with baited breath for the menfolk to come home and share the spoils of the hunt with them.And all the physical features early female hominids not covered by his ""male hunting"" explanation? Like female hominid larger breasts, wider birthing hips, hominids developing downward facing noses, etc? Oh, they just evolved to ""make sex sexier."" (I'm not kidding. That's what it says in the book.) Female hominids have larger breasts than other greater apes? It's because the males found it sexy. Female hominids have wider hips? Males found it sexy. Downward facing noses? Same thing. Homo sapiens have fuller lips than other greater apes? Because it made kissing sexier, and kissing is a great evolutionary foreplay to sex.The minute I stopped reading was when Desmond Morris claimed that (white) homo sapiens having pink lips because it gave them a pouty kissable look, thus making them look more kissable, thus more desirable as a mate. And what of certain black Africans who tend to have enough melanin in their skin not to have pink lips, and/or have fuller, puffier lips? According to Desmond Morris, it's because they're evolutionary failures who had to evolve fuller lips to make up for not having the desired pink lips that more evolutionary successful (white) homo sapiens possess. (Which, according to him, are like those living in North America. Not the ""obscure"" cultures in Africa that are ""not as evolutionary successful,"" his words. Never mind that white 'North American' culture as we know it has only existed for a few centuries at most, and hasn't withstood the test of time the way the 'obscure' African cultures have, which have stood for centuries, if not millennia.) This book is a transparent straight white male ego stroke, where a guy who fancies himself ""rational"" and ""objective"" breaks his arm patting himself, as a straight white male homo sapien, on the back for being ""an evolutionary success."" According to him, EVERY SINGLE physiological trait of the entire modern homo sapien species came from (presumably white) men of eons past being big strong hunters. Women and people of color were just hanger-ons who reaped the evolutionary benefits of the past (presumably) straight white male hunters' ingenuity. And every trait females have that males (presumably) don't is because the males found it sexy, or it aided in bearing the males' children. And every trait that people of color have that whites don't was formed to compensate the ""evolutionary disadvantage"" of not being white.Also, I took a few anthropology classes in community college. Almost every point he ever made has been largely disproven, or called into serious question. Fuck this guy, fuck this book. The fact that people still read this sexist, racist drivel and see it as anything resembling fact is frankly insulting to the whole homo sapien species."
125,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19627177-n-jr,5,"A fascinating read by a great thinker. Virtually no aspect of human nature and physiognomy escapes his keen zoologist eyes; even responses such as smiling, laughing and crying. However, be warned: not only is this book nearly 50 years old and therefore outdated, but one must ingest his words with a large heaping of salt. As a scientific treatise it fails. The best way to read it is to consider this the personal musings of a biologist/anthropologist, not the findings of an expert researcher. It's greatest value is in instigating thought on the subject. It is the step-back-and look-at-ourselves approach which is of real value here, not his (sometimes hilarious)conclusions.His explanation of the protuberance and shape of female breasts developing as a frontal sexual display resulting from our upright posture, rather than for increased efficiency of nursing, is presented as a credible argument. Mmm, maybe that explains the human male's fascination with them.Most of his observations are comparative, highlighting similarities and differences between other mammals, notably the chimpanzee. In all cases, Morris makes us think about many aspects of ourselves that we normally take for granted.One criticism I have is his over-emphasis on genetic origins - for example, he claims the pair-bond formation between sexes (i.e monogamy) is genetic rather than cultural - afraid I disagree there. Also his treatment of warfare is incomplete and not entirely satisfactory for me.I know others will attack the author as chauvinistic (not only in regards the sexes, but cultures as well), but still, hey, the book can just be considered food for thought.All in all, a stimulating read, one so rich that I have marked it for a second time around in the future. It helped me to come up with my own thoughts on the subject"
126,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4373676-jonathan-david-jackson,5,"Really a very interesting book. It's written as if the author were writing it about any other animal, and hearing myself talked about as if I am a naked mole rat or a chimpanzee is very refreshing (this doesn't give you permission to refer to me as such in polite society, btw). We are animals as much as any other, and we should consider all the things that make us what we are, including our animal instincts and our biological history.There are some ideas I think are odd, for example when he says that adults want to save elephants from extinction mainly because of our own impending individual extinction (death). Some things seem like just his opinion, and don't make sense to me. All the ideas, though - every single one - I found to be interesting. There were plenty of things I'd heard before (after all, it's a 40 year old book), but there were also plenty of things I hadn't heard which were totally new to me, and made me reconsider some of my own ideas. One such idea I have is that clothes are something unnatural, something to be avoided. He puts it to us that humans are a very sexual species, unlike other animals which have a mating season we are ready all the time, and unlike other animals which need to do something special to display their genitals ours are visible all the time, so to avoid making sexual displays to everyone all the time, we cover up. I've thought about most of my opinions long and hard for many years, and reading anything that makes me consider changing them is a rare and wonderful experience which had me turning each page almost in awe at what I had found before and might find after.I have the other two books in this series, and I can't wait to read them next."
127,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180947-j,3,"Desmond Morris raises some interesting points in this book, some more farfetched than others. Honestly, I have problems with a lot of the points he makes in this book. Attempting to explain everything we do by comparing us to our nearest relatives in the animal kingdom is like I said interesting but the truth is many of our behaviors are unique to our species because of our advanced intellect and I think simplifying them by saying they can be explained by looking at the behaviors of other primates is not entirely accurate. Furthermore, he makes a few mistakes I wouldn't expect anyone familiar with biology to make (including the 'tongue-map' for taste recognition) as well as taking a very eurocentric stance on human behavior. His postulations aren't really backed up with anything more than the observation of other primates which by itself can't really be used to explain our behavior. Along with his insistance on using North Americans and Europeans as the model for humanity, I have to say that this book is more rooted in speculation than fact and shouldn't be taken seriously as a work of science. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining read and worthy of the 3 stars I gave it."
128,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027404-david-o-brien,5,"Fascinating reading and life affirming in an unexpected way. The most common complaint about this book is lack of evidence or proof. Morris states clearly that he did not list all the evidence because it would turn the book into an encyclopedia. There is a bibliography at the end for those who want to see where he got his information and inspiration.The style of the book is not purely scientific in so far as he he makes assumptions and draws conclusions from his own experience and his research, which makes for very interesting reading, however can be interpreted as imprecise. Just because something is not 100% proven, that does not mean that it is not interesting, relevant, thought provoking or inspirational. Throughout the book there are segments I might not wholly agree with, however the scope of the book is so vast yet still well tied together and coherent that it deserves 5/5. A brave book that even today is refreshing, educational, inspiring and a break from convention."
129,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763793-jean,3,"I disagree with those who say this book is homophobic and/or misogynistic. Morris says some things that in normal conversational context might be dubbed as such, but his explicit purpose was to view mans behavior from an objective standpoint. He succeeds. Political correctness has no place in (even attempted) scientific writing. He DOES state that gay couples cannot procreate on their own. However he goes on to discuss scenarios where this may be a pro. Don't overreact. When I read this book, I was unaware it was written decades ago. Morris' observations were fairly elementary to me, I assume since I grew up hearing a good deal of them. It is still quite enjoyable to read despite my experience. "

Morris thinks that working is today's form of hunting and women obviously have no place there. also, male relaxing can only ever happen with an all male group. There are some interesting parts though, I loved the chapter about grooming and fighting (sad to see that he left out the vastly different way men and women fight, but oh, I forgot, women don't)."
131,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5155466-clare,2,"I found this book to be very disappointing. Morris makes some interesting statements about human behavior, but unfortunately, he has almost nothing that could be called evidence for anything that he poses as fact. Although at first I thought I might be unfairly judging it because his sexual politics differ from mine and his understanding of human sexuality is dated to say the least, his statements on non-sex-related behaviors are equally unsupported."

141,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,3,"Objective SummaryThis book explores the evolution, biology, psychology, and sociology of human beings. Morris refers to humans as the “naked ape” in an attempt to remove his cultural and experiential biases from his analysis, and to remind his readers that they, like all humans, are just evolved animals. Morris attempts to objectively describe human beings’ features, behavior, and the reasons for both in the same way a zoologist would describe any newly discovered species. The defining characteristic about human beings is our intelligence. But that intelligence is mapped crudely onto base animalistic tendencies and necessities. Rather than jumping straight to our intelligence, which may cloud important but elementary observations, Morris refers to us as the “naked ape,” a statement on our physical appearance as nearly hairless primates. Despite any attempts to ignore or transcend our animal roots, they persist. Morris explores human evolution, sex, child rearing, exploration, fighting, feeding, pursuit of comfort, and interaction with other animals. Listed below are some of the main lessons and interesting tidbits.•	Humans evolved from monkeys and apes. We moved from forests to the plains, though one theory suggests we moved from forests to seaside coasts to the plains. •	We moved from a vegetarian to an omnivore diet when we left the forest. This required cooperative hunting and defensive parties of males within the social hierarchy. This cooperation could now be a contributing factor to the development of gangs and wars.•	Neoteny, or extension of childhood development, played a significant role in human evolution. It allowed the human brain to continue to develop and grow for decades after birth, and it required pair-bonding between males and females to support the extended adolescence of their offspring. •	Pair-bonding helped females remain faithful to their mates, it reduced social friction between males over mating access, and it helped in rearing the slow-developing children. Pair-bonding is powerful but imperfect. The female orgasm, which is unusual if not unique to humans, was a contributor to pair-bonding. •	Why humans are relatively hairless isn’t known with certainty. The most popular theory is that it aids cooling during times of extreme exertion, like hunting. •	Much of our appearance is sexual signaling. Relatively large penises and breasts, red lips, and hairlessness all likely have sexual origins. Pubic and armpit hair likely trap pheromones for sexual arousal. •	80% of mothers hold infants in their left arms most likely because their heartbeat soothes their young.•	Animals fight to establish the dominance hierarchy and defend territory. They do not use their weapons to try to kill members of their own species because that would not be evolutionarily advantageous. Successful species establish aggressive and submissive displays that can substitute for actual physical confrontation and reduce physical harm and death.

We want the excitement of the former with the security of the latter. By pushing the boundaries and exploring, we discover new and better ways to feed, protect, and comfort ourselves. •	Human desire for sweet foods can lead to obesity.•	Humans domesticated dozens of species of animals for food (cows, chickens, goats, pigs), companionship (dogs, cats, horses), transportation (horses, camels, elephants), experimentation (mice, rats, guinea pigs), and other tasks like plowing and hauling heavy stuff (horses, donkeys, oxen). •	Dogs were likely domesticated when we took wolf pups to fatten them up for food.

Subjective ThoughtsI read this book because the dude in the movie “Bring It On” was reading it during a high school football game. It was interesting and thought-provoking, but much of the content seemed familiar. That makes sense since I am a naked ape and have interacted with them all my life. And I think much of this material was covered in my biology textbooks back in the day.It was impossible for me to miss how much a product of its time this book was. Written in 1967, Morris was only five years removed from the Cuban missile crisis, and nuclear annihilation was clearly on his mind. He also harbored Malthusian fears of continued population growth, resource strain, and territorial strife. He anticipated the Ehrlichs’ “Population Bomb,” which would be published one year later. He seemed quite pessimistic on both the nuclear annihilation and overpopulation fronts. If he were to update the book today, he’d no doubt include global cooling, I mean global warming, errr global climate change in his list of calamities. Fortunately, as I type this, nukes haven’t dropped in anger since ’45, Trump may be in the process of solving Korea, reproduction rates have slowed across the developed world and sometimes below replacement levels, and there are alternative albeit expensive energy sources. Not that I’m worried enough about any of this to shut off the air conditioner or my computer. And this Honeycrisp apple from Walmart is amazing. Morris should also update his advice on how to handle being pulled over by police. His suggestion is to immediately leave your car and approach the officer so that you two don’t interact on “your” territory near your car, which will make the officer feel threatened. That shit will get you shot today. Stay in your car with your hands on the wheel, and wait to move until you’re told. You don’t want to suddenly approach someone with a Glock 17 on standby.Memorable Quotes“A solitary monkey or ape is a vulnerable creature. It lacks the powerful natural weapons of the carnivore and in isolation falls easy prey to the stalking killers.”“It is only a wise primate, like our hunting ape, that knows its own father.”“The male reaches the consummatory act of sperm ejaculation within a few minutes in most cases, unless deliberate delaying tactics are employed. . . . Some females may reach this point very quickly, others not at all, but on the average it is attained between ten and twenty minutes after the start of copulation.”“Its normal, average length of nine and a half centimetres is increased by seven to eight centimetres. The diameter is also considerably increased, giving the species the largest erect penis of any living primate.”“After a gestation period of approximately 266 days her uterus begins to contract powerfully and rhythmically.”“The average weight of a baby at birth is just over seven pounds, which is slightly more than one-twentieth of the weight of the average parent.”“Lucky is the society that enjoys the gradual acquisition of a perfect balance between imitation and curiosity, between slavish, unthinking copying and progressive, rational experimentation.”“In all exploratory behaviour, whether artistic or scientific, there is the ever-present battle between the neophilic and neophobic urges. The former drives us on to new experiences, makes us crave for novelty. The latter holds us back, makes us take refuge in the familiar. We are constantly in a state of shifting balance between the conflicting attractions of the exciting new stimulus and the friendly old one. If we lost our neophilia we would stagnate. If we lost our neophobia, we would rush headlong into disaster.”“We are, to put it mildly, in a mess, and there is a strong chance that we shall have exterminated ourselves by the end of the century.”“Animals fight amongst themselves for one of two very good reasons: either to establish their dominance in a social hierarchy, or to establish their territorial rights over a particular piece of ground.” “If a species is to survive, it simply cannot afford to go around slaughtering its own kind. Intra-specific aggression has to be inhibited and controlled, and the more powerful and savage the prey-killing weapons of a particular species are, the stronger must be the inhibitions about using them to settle disputes with rivals.”“To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion. Abortion is a drastic measure and can involve serious emotional disturbance. Furthermore, once a zygote has been formed by the act of fertilization it constitutes a new individual member of society, and its destruction is, in effect, an act of aggression, which is the very pattern of behaviour that we are attempting to control. Contraception is obviously preferable, and any religious or other ‘moralizing’ factions that oppose it must face the fact that they are engaged in dangerous war-mongering.”“We each possess about 10,000 of these taste buds, but in old age they deteriorate and decrease in number, hence the jaded palate of the elderly gastronome. Surprisingly, we can only respond to four basic tastes. They are: sour, salt, bitter, and sweet.”“Domestication of livestock, involving the organized control and selective breeding of prey, is known to have been practised for at least ten thousand years and, in certain cases, probably much longer. Goats, sheep and reindeer appear to have been the earliest prey species dealt with in this way.”“It is probable that [an interspecific bond between humans and dogs] began as a result of young puppies being brought in to the tribal home base to be fattened as food.”“Unless we can colonize other planets on a massive scale and spread the load, or seriously check our population increase in some way, we shall, in the not-too-far distant future, have to remove all other forms of life from the earth. . . . We need not dwell on this nightmare: the possibility of its becoming a reality is remote.”"

While it's a good review of instinctive human behaviour it is expectionally light into actual comparisons to other primates.He does make interesting points, e.g. noting that when the forests started to disappear we converged towards carnivore traits but by using artificial weapons rather than natural ones we did not need to move towards becoming like cats/dogs (though he doesn't note that other plains primates probably did so more than us). He notes the importance of us acquiring home bases where the females were left, and hence the need to develop more clear territories, pair bonds and ability to share food with family/tribe.He talks about how adolescents acquite the need to go off and develop their own home. But here he doesn't spend any time discussing what's actually known about how humans do this. It's actually remarkable how variable this is across different societies (albeit it generally has fixed form within a society). Sometimes it it the male, sometimes the female. These are generally species fixed traits, and yet he doesn't cover this.He talks about how the development of a pair bond meant that we needed to start hiding our sexual features in public. He notes that other species generally sustain the pair bond through aggression, but we do it instead by wearing clothes and avoiding touching each other.It's quite an old book and features some exceptional examples of envirionmentalist (e.g. blank slate) thinking from the era it was written, which is somewhat startling in a book which otherwise fully acknowledges that we are creatures driven by innate behaviours. For instance, he talks about how if a mother is tense and smiles to conceil it, the baby will detect it and mistake the function of a smile... he then warns that this could be permanently damaging and cause the child serious social difficulties... nuttier environmentalist claptrap than that is only spewed forth by modern SJWs but I guess it was par for the course back then. The section on music and it's relation to mothers heart beat is similarly whacko.A section of the book deals with our innate sounds/actions, e.g. laughter and smiling. Discussion about how they evolved is perhaps questionable. Notes things like when a baby smiles it waves it's arms and legs around, and suggests this is the vestigial primate clinging response. There's also curious little factoids, like our 'sweet tooth' being a distinct primate thing that other carnivores don't generally have.An interesting section is when he talks about how men go along to trade unions, social clubs , learned societies etc as an equivilent of the hunting pack. They do so to experience our built in bond from male togetherness. Interestingly, this was written before it became taboo to go to male only societies. One suspects that the author would not thus be suprised that membership of all voluntary societies has utterly collapsed since women were permitted to join them (see Putnam's 'Bowling Alone'). He also describes how work is probably a poor substitute for hunting for the working classes in a manner that it is not for the middle class. Expresses it in a manner that is probably illegal these days.A key point the author wants to get across in the book is that we're going through a population boom and being forced into living in environments increasingly more crowded and distrinct from what we evolved for. He talks about how the modern usage of soulless featureless architecture where everything looks the same flys against our built in desire to mark territory as our own through personalisation (declaring quite rightly that modern architects are terrorists). He is sceptical about the ability of us to adapt our innate behaviour. On that, he is probably correct. He could have argued his case better (and I believe that in his next book he went on to do so). "

But exactly how far did we get? Your guesses might be way off the mark. This book says that under the surface we are ruled mostly by our inner primates. Things just look different on us. Evolution is too slow a process for us to have shed our animal past.In our species there is, as we have seen, a strong tendency to ‘fall in love’—to develop a powerful bond with the object of our sexual attentions.No primates are monogamous so why are we? The answer comes from our adaptation to life on the plains of Africa once we were thrown out of the jungle perhaps due to environmental changes. Hint, pack hunters need cooperation from all males.They occur with particularly high frequency during the initial stages of social encounters, where hidden fears and aggressions are lurking just below the surface. At a dinner party, or any small social gathering, as soon as the mutual appeasement ceremonies of hand-shaking and smiling are over, displacement cigarettes, displacement drinks and displacement food-snacks are immediately offered.This was the most fascinating part. Monkeys and apes are very much social animals with hierarchy being most crucial thing on their minds. How did we get rid of that, or did we? Even the most innocuous conversations and meetings are anything but that for your social relations obsessed brain. To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion.His argument is that cramming animals in compact spaces invariably leads to aggression. We might think we are special but think again. Only way to make sure we do not turn against each other is to give everyone enough space. Debatable, but interesting viewpoint none the less.Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else.One can only hope ;-)"
144,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98103014-jonas,4,"This book was first published in 1967 and I found it to be somewhat of a foreboding book.I was first introduced into many of these concepts regarding “the naked ape’s” ecological role and behaviour from other books, such as Ishmael by Daniel Quinn and The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. Though those books are written about something else, I found myself thinking of those books while I was reading this one. Many of the arguments presented in those books could be paralleled with the comparative elements between the human and ape presented throughout this book.Each chapter though succinct, presents an interesting perspective on the anatomy of the human body, as well as our behavioural aspects against the bodies and social practices of other ape species. I thought many of the ideas were very inventive, but the chapter on sex comes across as crass and salacious, but otherwise, the book presents itself in a very tame manner.Whilst the book contains many fantastic ideas, I can see why this book created controversy within the feminist/homosexual communities. The book even manages to squeeze in a supporting message for contraceptives and population control. Overall, I think the book makes for an interesting read, but is by no means the best book regarding the topic especially in modern day, due to changing of the zeitgeist from the late 1960’s to the prevalence of technology today (even though some of the fears might still be present today). Despite that, I still think it’s worth a read to understand how it was relevant at that time, and how it has paved a way and introduced the idea of comparative ethology to the general public."
145,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705775-gerardo-alonso,4,"The Naked Ape is a mirror. While reading it, one sees a reflection of oneself. But unlike many other reflections, this one is raw and based on our biological characteristics. This reflection breaks down our egos and social constructs to their bare bones. Desmond Morris attempts to show humanity that we are merely a species of the Animal KingdomI found the book inspiring, and highly effective to understand characteristic behaviours we may have. It feels as if someone is saying what one has already known but could not figure out the words to explain it.While this book is very powerful philosophically, I think it lacks thoroughness in logic. One of the things that concerns me is that it seems to me that Morris takes a one-sided view of several arguments sometimes based on factoids/opinions that may debatable. Another difficulty I find is the ease of comparison between the Homo Sapiens and the apes. While true that we share a very similar DNA structure, I think that Morris not only tries to link biological similarities (which he does in a great way in the beginning of the book), but also behavioural similarities.I get that in some cases or themes, the behaviour among species will be the same. The fight or flight response, for example. But when highly specific social interactions are compared between species, Morris should have analysed the Naked Ape by itself.It may be the case that some of the science behind the book is outdated, since this was published in the 60s. Regardless of the leaps Morris takes, this book is worth reading as a biology, anthropology and history lesson of our species. "
146,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"I had a great time reading this book. Despite coming out almost fifty years ago when I found it, much of what it says is still thought provoking and relevant. The book owes a little bit to psychoanalysis which was more dominant at the time. Which is good since Morris uses it to good effect to tie together physiological and behavioral facts into a general theory of human nature. What is that theory of human nature? Well, that we are the way we are because our ancestors were forced to become a predator species/hunting-ape and couldn't stay in and around trees picking fruits. Millions of years ago in Africa, during the Miocene, the forests started to disappear, and the apes could either cling onto whatever was left, or leave the ""garden of Eden"" and enter into competition with the predators on the ground. Ape populations have dwindled since, and we have emerged the apex predator. To get to that point we had to overcome the other predators, but with inferior equipment so to speak; no fangs or claws. So we made use of two things carried over to a certain degree from our ape past; intelligence and social communication. ""His whole body, his way of life, was geared to a forest existence, and then suddenly he was jettisoned into a world where he could survive only if he began to live like a brainy, weapon toting wolf."" Our social lives are to this day built on a sort of tension between social communication and intellect (from ape life) and group loyalty and hunting from our predator existence. Vestiges of our ape life are our greater reliance on sight at the expense of smell and a more various taste palate. Our predator life involves traveling greater distances to find game, rather than remaining close to the trees, having a home base to protect and return to, and having regular meals rather than momentary snacking. Being a predatory ape means developing ways to facilitate male cooperation, to hunt together with dangerous weapons, and to guarantee a share of the kills and a female for the effort. Monogamy and private property likely arise from a need to secure the loyalty of males to females and children while they hunted and prevent conflict among the males. This isn't all bad, as the predator life means some degree of male solidarity. We can't have a single alpha male who gets exclusive access to women and food. The ability to cooperate and use weapon technology means the lesser males can gang up and resist, limit, or kill the alpha male. Thus some satisfactory distribution of females and resources becomes necessary for social order, and this is likely where marriage and property and even government developed from. Morris channels Sigmund Freud and argues that religion emerges from the guilt of (symbolically) killing the alpha ape. Even with all his faults, an all powerful male does instill some sort of order and security which is socially useful. You knew where you stood, and the alpha ape in a way encouraged exogamous mating, preventing incest by kicking the sons out of the harem. So religion projects the seemingly omnipotent alpha ape onto the cosmos, extending its influence to our personal lives without actually being here. There are several downsides that ape life has: lack of cooperation (among males), a pecking order with one individual on top, and less incentive to control nature. Ape and monkey society is more about competition and dominance, and dependent on nature providing food for the picking. Depending on the environment means not traveling too far and remaining close, thus reducing the need for defense of home as well as needing to know what others are up to as they aren't far. If we just forage for food, there isn't a need to cooperate. It's ""finders keepers"", and so dominance becomes more important. The alpha male gets the first pick, and so long as everybody abides conflict can be avoided, with little need to work together other than staying out of the big guy's way. Despite all these downsides, we are still closest to the apes. We haven't evolved to be complete predators, just enough behaviors to utilize our intelligence and social cooperation to survive and thrive. And we only evolved that way because the environment made us, forced us out east of Eden. It seems that much of our aesthetics, tastes, curiosity, and enjoyment of life are owed to our more ape aspects. A pure predator kind of society would resemble the Spartans I think. What we do in leisure however reflects both aspects of our nature, in varying degrees. The popularity of sports and online first person shooter video games reflects the more predator side. More relaxing and solitary activities like cooking or painting reflect the ape side. As for the title, the naked ape, the reason why we don't have a full coat of fur is to aid us in hunting; cooling us down by chasing animals. Other predators can make fast dashes after prey, but our bipedal stature and the occupation of our hands makes this difficult. ""By losing the heavy coat of hair and by increasing the number of sweat glands all over the body surface, considerable cooling could be achieved- not for minute by minute living, but for the supreme moments of the chase."" Our subcutaneous fat and ability to fashion clothes help keep us warm without fur. With the help of neoteny, the retaining of youthful traits into adulthood, all this explains our appearance as the naked ape. Younger chimps have flatter faces, a long slender neck, smaller teeth, absence of heavy brow ridges, non-rotating big toe, and more hair on the head than the rest of the body. Our extended childhood also allows us to develop our powerful brains. A desire to explore and learn new things are also associated with youth, and so we are the young ape as well as the naked ape. Though of course neoteny is selective, as we aren't attracted to infant genitals, infantile emotions, or infantile strength. The book is full of interesting speculations about behavior, always trying to link us to our animal nature. The message of the book is that we are still operating with an animal mindset no matter how developed we are. Even the most complex behaviors like pacing back and forth and the conduct of war harken back to our more modest origins."

Grazie, Mr. Gabbani (you were my personal winner anyways... and that is kind of all I know in Italian).Thus study was such a positive disappointment! I was afraid it would be too academical for my humanities-oriented brain... but guys, if you want to read a study on how humans evolved from apes and ""the missing links"" and how certains traditions and habits of ours formed, that is really interesting and really easy to read, it is for you. I read that Desmond Morris said he wanted to de-mistify science... and I could not put it better. The explanation is really clear, easy to understand and there were some really interesting and cool facts about certain human behaviour that we still practice... it was really interesting to see where they could come from.Also: if you are a really devout creatonist, I'd recommend you only read the book if you do not get triggered by reading full-on declared truths about evolution (as I believe in evolution and the scientific research that are supposed to prove it, I did not have any issues)."

We mustn't forget when was developed this essay, as well as the possible intentions of the author.The last chapter of the book is just... funny. Suddenly, Morris seems to see sex in the explanations about why we like some animals instead of others (maybe he was possessed by Freud when he wrote the last pages) and the justifications about animal exploitation are, some of them, just ridiculous. But I'm totally agree with one of the ideas in this book, and is that the world is overpopulated by the human beings and that it would be necessary to reduce the population (not killing people!), promoting and facilitating the use of contraceptive measures.In summary: to be careful with some of the contents in the book, but is a really interesting reading in my opinion."
149,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58948646-hendrik-borginon,5,"When starting to read The Naked Ape, I expected it to be severely outdated (it was published in '67 after all). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book aged as well as can be expected. Desmond Morris writes from a zoologist's perspective and tries to describe man as if he were an external observer of our species. He analyses us and our behaviours from a very functional point of view. In the first chapters he mostly explores our physiological characteristics (and the differences between us and our closest animal relatives) and offers various evolutionary explanations for how they could have come to be. The zoologist's perspective proves to be very insightful for this purpose and I learned a great deal. In later chapters he starts to focus more on our behaviour. Though still thought-provoking, much of what he says is very speculative and his views on women and homosexuality are strongly influenced by the era in which the book was written.Despite some of these outdated speculations, it is still extremely interesting and insightful. I would recommend it to anyone who's fascinated by human evolution. "

""Naked Ape"" was first published in the UK in 1967. It treats humans as a kind of hairless apes and explores various human behaviors from a biological point of view. Desmond Morris was born in Wiltshire, England in 1928. He studied at the University of Birmingham with a degree in zoology and a Ph.D. from Oxford University. He is a famous zoologist in England. Representative works: ""Naked Ape"", ""Human Zoo"", ""Intimate Behavior"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Origin2. Sex3. Parenting4. Explore5. Fight6. Foraging and eating7. Finishing and comfort8. People and animals ""The Analects"" says, ""A gentleman has three precepts: when he is young, his blood is indeterminate, but he is in color; he is strong, his blood is strong, he is in fighting; he is old, his blood is declining, he is in good faith. ""The need for sex, the desire to hunt, and the unsatisfied desire are the nature of animals. It is extremely difficult to control these three instinctive impulses with reason. Millions of years ago, due to some reason, most likely due to climate change, the arboreal apes that originally lived in the forest had to walk out of the forest and leave the branches to stand on the ground, and became hunting apes in order to get enough food. In the process of evolution of hunting apes, although seemingly distinctive naked apes have gradually formed, naked apes still reflect the characteristics of typical primates and typical carnivores. Naked apes maintain their juvenile development, allowing the development of the brain to continue for a long time. The long developmental process will bring a heavy burden of parenting for females, which requires naked apes to form a more stable spouse relationship to complete the nurturing of the next generation. In order to ensure that this goal can be achieved, nature seems to give the naked ape stronger sexual stimulation as compensation. Even in the social structure of naked apes where multiple spouses are allowed, the vast majority of members still adopt a one-to-one monogamy relationship due to the high cost of parenting . From the perspective of species, reproduction is the biggest mission. In this process, ""sex"" plays an extremely important role. The sexual behavior of naked apes is typically different from other 192 species of apes. The females of other apes do not seem to have an orgasm, and the sexual intercourse process is often extremely short, usually only lasting 15 times. The estrus period of females is also very short, they often leave immediately after the end of sexual intercourse, ready for the next sexual act at any time, so as not to miss the precious opportunity for fertilization. The female of the naked ape will continue to lie down to rest after the sexual intercourse is completed, immersed in the aftermath of a certain orgasm. Not only that, except for a few periods, the sexual activity of naked apes is almost unaffected. This means that even during pregnancy, female naked apes can still meet the sexual needs of male naked apes, thereby enhancing the mate relationship. The strengthening of sexual stimulation will bring about another problem, that is, when the spouses are separated, there must be a mechanism to inhibit the sexual behavior of naked apes, otherwise the social structure of monogamy will be destroyed. This is for raising the next generation. It was almost a devastating blow. The most obvious measure is to cover the fig leaf. The genitals and sexual behavior must be covered up and become a kind of extremely important privacy. The cold protection effect of clothing is not revealed until the naked ape goes out of the tropics. In addition, there are other means, such as to cover secondary sexual characteristics, shaving the child, such as armpit hair shave; remove the smell of the body; prohibition of physical contact. Naked apes need to strengthen the sexual stimulation between their spouses on the one hand, and weaken the sexual stimulation between non-mates on the one hand, so as to maintain the stability of monogamy and ensure that the cooperative relationship of the entire social structure is not destroyed. Some science fiction novels make some bold conjectures, such as: baby farms, social behavior, selective sterilization, and division of labor. For now, these behaviors are contrary to the biological instincts of naked apes. If they are implemented on a large scale one day, it can almost be concluded that the social structure and lifestyle of naked apes will undergo unimaginable changes, and the impact of changes in sexual and parenting behavior will be extremely profound. "" Among the existing 4237 mammals, almost no animal can be found suitable for survival without fur. Mammals are different from their reptile ancestors. They have an unparalleled advantage in their physiological characteristics. They can maintain a constant comparison. High body temperature. This makes the delicate machine with physiological functions suitable for efficient operation. This attribute is neither easily damaged nor easily abandoned. The body's thermostat is extremely important. Thicker, hairy and insulated The epidermis obviously plays an important role in preventing heat loss. Under strong sunlight, it can also prevent high body temperature and prevent direct sun burns to the skin. Therefore, if body hair is to fall off, obviously there must be a very good reason To give it up. Apart from a few rare exceptions, mammals acquired a new medium in evolution after referral to take this drastic step change. Flying mammals, such as bats, were forced to remove their body hair on both wings, but the body hair of other parts was still preserved, so they cannot be included as a nude species. Several burrowing mammals have greatly reduced body hair, such as voles, aardvarks, and armadillos. Aquatic mammals, such as whales, dolphins, mermaids, manatees, and seahorses, also lose their body hair as their bodies become streamlined. However, for all typical mammals that live on the surface, whether it is an animal jumping on the ground or an animal climbing on plants, the densely covered skin is an inevitable law. Except for the unusually large rhinoceros and elephants (which have special problems with their heat preservation and cooling mechanisms), naked apes are unique mammals without body hair . "" If we study humans from a biological point of view , ignore the fact that we are humans, and try our best to adopt a relatively objective attitude to study humans as animals. In fact, many interesting new ideas will be obtained. These biological insights may enable us to better understand many social phenomena. "" We know that the climate has undergone unfavorable changes. By about 15 million years ago, the scale of their forest fortresses dropped sharply. The ancestors of monkeys were forced to do two things. One of the two must be one of them: or they still defend the forest. The dilapidated hometown, or bravely faced the fate of being expelled from the Garden of Eden as the Bible says. Chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons and orangutans remained in the woods, and their numbers have been declining ever since. There is only another kind that exists apes - naked ape ancestors blaze a way out of it. they withdraw into the forest wilderness, engaged in fierce competition, the oath has been highly adaptable animal life on the ground is assessed by this risky step, but it is the outcome of evolution. In short, this adventure has been greatly rewarded. "" Even during the careful evolution of organisms . Also experienced several important adventures . These risky decisions influence so far-reaching, it determines the millions of years later, his race would die out , or will evolve into more advanced species . ""The predatory ancient apes are basically a group of males. Females are busy raising children and cannot take the main role in hunting prey. As the complexity of hunting increases, the time for hunting gradually increases, and it is necessary to abandon ancestors drifting and migrating. Lifestyle. Therefore, a fixed residence is needed to bring the prey back to the fixed base. Females and cubs wait at home for the males to return from hunting and share food. The step of fixing the residence will be seen in later chapters. , And will have a profound impact on all aspects of today’s most perfectly developed apes. "" As early human Australopithecus social division of labor during the formation of straight to this day , still a profound impact on our society. In family life, the man primarily responsible for the provision of social resources , to feed the family. While women are primarily responsible for providing resources , to breed and raise offspring. To this day, our tendency to choose a spouse basically follows this line of thinking. Men are eager to marry young, beautiful women , which implies that she has a strong ability to reproduce. Women desire to marry rich and loyal men, which means that they have the will and ability to provide a favorable living environment for themselves and their offspring. "" Fundamentally, we originated from a carnivore in the primate order. Among the existing monkeys and apes, our evolution is very unique. But this evolutionary change is not uncommon among animals of other subjects. For example, the giant panda is an animal that has completely transformed in evolution. This example is exquisite. We have changed from a vegetarian animal to a carnivore, while the giant panda has changed from a carnivore to a vegetarian animal. Just like us. The giant panda is an incomparable and very unique animal. One important thing is that the animal created by this violent transformation has a dual personality. Once it crosses the threshold between the two species, it plunges into its new role. Moving forward with great evolutionary energy-it has become too fast, so it still carries many original qualities. The time for evolution is not sufficient, it is too late to get rid of all the original features, just put on the surface features in a hurry. When primitive fish have just overcome the water-free obstacles in their terrestrial life, their terrestrial animal qualities have evolved by leaps and bounds, but they still embrace the characteristics of aquatic animals. To complete a perfect and dramatic new species, it will take millions of years. The pioneers who walk in the front are usually bizarre mixed animals. The naked ape is just such a mixed four different elephants. His entire body and the lifestyle of the pond are suitable for arboreal life, but suddenly (the so-called sudden is from the slow evolutionary process), he was thrown into a completely different world. "" "" Carnivores give birth to fleas, but primates do not. Monkeys and apes are plagued by lice and are also infected with some parasitic diseases. However, contrary to popular belief, they are not fleas at all; therefore, there are A very convincing reason. To understand this, we must first examine the life cycle of the flea. When a flea lays eggs, it does not lay on the host, but in the sleeping home of the host. The flea eggs hatch after 3 days. Wriggling little maggots. These larvae do not suck blood, but live on the dust collected in their dens. After another two weeks, the larvae cocoon and pupate. The pupae become adults after resting in the cocoon for about half a month and emerge from the cocoon. Find a suitable host. It can be seen that at least during the first month of its life cycle, the flea is separated from its host. Obviously, mammals that do not settle down, such as monkeys or apes, are not troubled by fleas. This is the reason. Even if one or two fleas accidentally land on a primate and successfully mate, the eggs they lay cannot be taken away by the primate because the primate is constantly migrating. When the flea pupae emerge from the cocoon, there will be no host waiting for them ""at home"", maintaining the host and guest relationship with them. Therefore, fleas are parasites of animals in fixed dwellings. For example, typical carnivores are such animals. "" "" First of all, the naked ape sense organs are not suitable for life on the ground. His sense of smell is too weak, his ears keen enough. His physique is too weak to withstand the grueling endurance test experience, not to break out like thunder lightning sprint, This weakness is irreparable. In terms of personality, he is more competitive, not more cooperative, and he is undoubtedly not good at planning and focusing. Fortunately, his brain is extremely good. In general intelligence, he surpassed his rival carnivore. With the help of walking upright, he has transformed both his hands and feet; through further improvements in his brain and dedicated use of the brain, he may be successful. "" "" If we look at a typical monkey fetus, we will be able to understand the most profoundly why the juvenile persistence mechanism contributes to the development and development of the primate brain. The brain during the fetal period of the monkey develops rapidly, growing up and becoming complex. The baby monkey is born. , Its brain has reached 70% of the mature brain. The remaining 30% are fully developed in the first 6 months after birth. Even chimpanzee babies with higher intelligence have brain development within 12 months after birth Be completed. Our species is in sharp contrast to this. The brain volume of a baby at birth is only 23% of that of an adult. During the 6 years after birth, children’s brains continue to develop rapidly, but the entire developmental period of the human brain can only be completed at about 23 years of age. This shows that for you and me, after sexual maturity, brain development will continue for 10 years. However, for chimpanzees, brain development has been completed for six or seven years before reproductive capacity becomes active. "" "" Infant monkeys and chimpanzees also like to play, explore, and are creative, but they die soon at this stage. However, for naked apes, these infancy characteristics will continue until they mature. In adulthood. He has enough time to imitate and learn all the techniques designed by his ancestors. In terms of physique and instinct, he has many shortcomings as a hunter. However, his intelligence and imitating ability can make up for its shortcomings and More than enough. The way and depth he accepts his parents' teaching is beyond the reach of any other animal. "" In the flesh, humans do not have the advantage of competing with large carnivores. But the reason why we can get to this point. Mainly rely on the wisdom of individuals is superb , and the organization of social groups. "

It embodies precisely the type of popular-science literature I love to read: the matter-of-fact pointing out of things which, having been pointed out, seem totally obvious, as if Desmond Morris were just reciting things I already knew but hadn't gotten around to actually realizing yet. His observations run that gamut of what he terms ""typical"" human behavior and physiology. That is, at the time of this book's writing (as now) anthropologists and sociologists commonly made the atypical specimens and their behaviors the focus of their studies. Were other scientists engaged in the study of lifeforms to do similarly they would never get anywhere. Perhaps out of vanity, perhaps out of a lack of self-awareness, science has historically avoided turning its objective eye toward the scientist (obvious and irrelevant exceptions of medical science excluded). Luckily for us, Desmond Morris undertook this endeavor and his findings are not only fascinating but wildly entertaining.A great deal of the pleasure derived from this book is in the way that Morris so ruthlessly picks apart his subject. The book's title itself is a playful and astutely humbling jab at the subject which drives straight to the heart of his message: human beings are first and foremost animals. Apes, to be precise, and our principal distinguishing feature, from a zoological standpoint, from our ape cousins is no more than our lack of a shaggy coat. We may drive around in fancy cars, work in skyscrapers, level mountains, dam rivers, etc. At the end of the day, we're still a bunch of naked apes. Which isn't to say that we aren't members of an incredibly resourceful and clever species, fascinating from all angles and fascinated by all things. Because we are unique, we are remarkable. Still, it is no more than gross vanity that makes us suppose that our manipulation of the external environment or the complexity and ingeniousness of our cultural expression has enabled us to overcome the fact that we are ""still very much a biological phenomenon... subject to all the basic laws of animal behavior.""Morris arms his reader with a new arsenal of cocktail party factoids, some endearing, some disgusting, some depressing, others hilarious, which alone make the read worthwhile. For instance, the size and shape of human breasts suggest that they have developed, through many centuries of sexual selection, as sexual signaling devices rather than merely as organs used to feed infants. That is, human breasts are actually not very good feeding devices when compared to those of other apes. The nipple typically isn't shaped to fit easily into the infant mouth and the excess tissue around it can even obstruct the baby's breathing. And yet breasts are universally used to spectacular success in piquing the interest of potential mates and, it could go without saying, play an enormous secondary role in human intercourse, behavior which is seen nowhere else in the animal kingdom. The evolutionary reasons for this development, believe it or not, are fascinatingly and intimately woven into our ancestors struggle for survival as the first carnivorous apes on the ancient plains of Africa.Having been first published in the 60's, ""Naked Ape"" is somewhat outdated. Morris' characterization of indigenous societies as atypical cultural failures makes sense from the coldly zoological perspective from which he was attempting to write, but fails to take into consideration historical truths which invite explanations beyond a socities' supposed lack of functionality. Modern readers will be equally squeamish by the occasional reference made to the ""negroid race"" and the interpretation of homosexuality as little more than deviant behavior caused by abnormal childhood experiences. Present day sensitivities aside, Morris is nevertheless quite forward-thinking and the intellectual merits of the book by far exceed whatever flags might be raised by your inner-p.c. reactionary.As entertaining a book as it is, Morris' tone and message is ultimately one of apocalyptic foreboding. We naked apes have been so spectacularly successful as a species that we have come to think of ourselves as invincible and we are not. Our success will, sooner rather than later, catch up with us because the global economy of environmental resources is, after all, finite. The modern reader will recognize all too well that the book's imperative rings even truer today, despite Morris' having to sound like a fanatic at the time of its initial publishing. Ironically, Morris suggests, the naked ape's first step toward salvation will be the recognition of his true nature. To go forward we have to take an honest look at where we came from."

154,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21322837-heather-mcalister,1,"Backwards, sexist, racist drivel. Written by a man obviously trying to stroke his own ego by arguing how ""objectively,"" when you look at it from the impartial perspective of a rational (male) scientist, early hominids clearly evolved to walk upright, lose their fur, use tools, develop spoken language, etc. ALL so that males could hunt in groups like wolves or lions. Literally every physiological feature of the modern homo sapien, according to the ""impartial"" male Desmond Morris, was led by ""hot-blooded,"" aggressive alpha males to hunt and kill. The invention of tools being so men could hunt; walking upright so men could see over grass; learning to talk so men could communicate complex hunting strategies; the loss of fur so men wouldn't die of heatstroke running in the hot African climate, etc.And the women? Oh, they just evolved to be child-rearers and home-makers. They sat around in caves suckling their babes like mama wolves in their dens with cubs (never mind that real mother wolves are out of the den in weeks, and often dump their pups on a babysitter as soon as they possibly can) waiting with baited breath for the menfolk to come home and share the spoils of the hunt with them.And all the physical features early female hominids not covered by his ""male hunting"" explanation? Like female hominid larger breasts, wider birthing hips, hominids developing downward facing noses, etc? Oh, they just evolved to ""make sex sexier."" (I'm not kidding. That's what it says in the book.) Female hominids have larger breasts than other greater apes? It's because the males found it sexy. Female hominids have wider hips? Males found it sexy. Downward facing noses? Same thing. Homo sapiens have fuller lips than other greater apes? Because it made kissing sexier, and kissing is a great evolutionary foreplay to sex.The minute I stopped reading was when Desmond Morris claimed that (white) homo sapiens having pink lips because it gave them a pouty kissable look, thus making them look more kissable, thus more desirable as a mate. And what of certain black Africans who tend to have enough melanin in their skin not to have pink lips, and/or have fuller, puffier lips? According to Desmond Morris, it's because they're evolutionary failures who had to evolve fuller lips to make up for not having the desired pink lips that more evolutionary successful (white) homo sapiens possess. (Which, according to him, are like those living in North America. Not the ""obscure"" cultures in Africa that are ""not as evolutionary successful,"" his words. Never mind that white 'North American' culture as we know it has only existed for a few centuries at most, and hasn't withstood the test of time the way the 'obscure' African cultures have, which have stood for centuries, if not millennia.) This book is a transparent straight white male ego stroke, where a guy who fancies himself ""rational"" and ""objective"" breaks his arm patting himself, as a straight white male homo sapien, on the back for being ""an evolutionary success."" According to him, EVERY SINGLE physiological trait of the entire modern homo sapien species came from (presumably white) men of eons past being big strong hunters. Women and people of color were just hanger-ons who reaped the evolutionary benefits of the past (presumably) straight white male hunters' ingenuity. And every trait females have that males (presumably) don't is because the males found it sexy, or it aided in bearing the males' children. And every trait that people of color have that whites don't was formed to compensate the ""evolutionary disadvantage"" of not being white.Also, I took a few anthropology classes in community college. Almost every point he ever made has been largely disproven, or called into serious question. Fuck this guy, fuck this book. The fact that people still read this sexist, racist drivel and see it as anything resembling fact is frankly insulting to the whole homo sapien species."
155,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19627177-n-jr,5,"A fascinating read by a great thinker. Virtually no aspect of human nature and physiognomy escapes his keen zoologist eyes; even responses such as smiling, laughing and crying. However, be warned: not only is this book nearly 50 years old and therefore outdated, but one must ingest his words with a large heaping of salt. As a scientific treatise it fails. The best way to read it is to consider this the personal musings of a biologist/anthropologist, not the findings of an expert researcher. It's greatest value is in instigating thought on the subject. It is the step-back-and look-at-ourselves approach which is of real value here, not his (sometimes hilarious)conclusions.His explanation of the protuberance and shape of female breasts developing as a frontal sexual display resulting from our upright posture, rather than for increased efficiency of nursing, is presented as a credible argument. Mmm, maybe that explains the human male's fascination with them.Most of his observations are comparative, highlighting similarities and differences between other mammals, notably the chimpanzee. In all cases, Morris makes us think about many aspects of ourselves that we normally take for granted.One criticism I have is his over-emphasis on genetic origins - for example, he claims the pair-bond formation between sexes (i.e monogamy) is genetic rather than cultural - afraid I disagree there. Also his treatment of warfare is incomplete and not entirely satisfactory for me.I know others will attack the author as chauvinistic (not only in regards the sexes, but cultures as well), but still, hey, the book can just be considered food for thought.All in all, a stimulating read, one so rich that I have marked it for a second time around in the future. It helped me to come up with my own thoughts on the subject"
156,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4373676-jonathan-david-jackson,5,"Really a very interesting book. It's written as if the author were writing it about any other animal, and hearing myself talked about as if I am a naked mole rat or a chimpanzee is very refreshing (this doesn't give you permission to refer to me as such in polite society, btw). We are animals as much as any other, and we should consider all the things that make us what we are, including our animal instincts and our biological history.There are some ideas I think are odd, for example when he says that adults want to save elephants from extinction mainly because of our own impending individual extinction (death). Some things seem like just his opinion, and don't make sense to me. All the ideas, though - every single one - I found to be interesting. There were plenty of things I'd heard before (after all, it's a 40 year old book), but there were also plenty of things I hadn't heard which were totally new to me, and made me reconsider some of my own ideas. One such idea I have is that clothes are something unnatural, something to be avoided. He puts it to us that humans are a very sexual species, unlike other animals which have a mating season we are ready all the time, and unlike other animals which need to do something special to display their genitals ours are visible all the time, so to avoid making sexual displays to everyone all the time, we cover up. I've thought about most of my opinions long and hard for many years, and reading anything that makes me consider changing them is a rare and wonderful experience which had me turning each page almost in awe at what I had found before and might find after.I have the other two books in this series, and I can't wait to read them next."
157,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180947-j,3,"Desmond Morris raises some interesting points in this book, some more farfetched than others. Honestly, I have problems with a lot of the points he makes in this book. Attempting to explain everything we do by comparing us to our nearest relatives in the animal kingdom is like I said interesting but the truth is many of our behaviors are unique to our species because of our advanced intellect and I think simplifying them by saying they can be explained by looking at the behaviors of other primates is not entirely accurate. Furthermore, he makes a few mistakes I wouldn't expect anyone familiar with biology to make (including the 'tongue-map' for taste recognition) as well as taking a very eurocentric stance on human behavior. His postulations aren't really backed up with anything more than the observation of other primates which by itself can't really be used to explain our behavior. Along with his insistance on using North Americans and Europeans as the model for humanity, I have to say that this book is more rooted in speculation than fact and shouldn't be taken seriously as a work of science. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining read and worthy of the 3 stars I gave it."
158,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027404-david-o-brien,5,"Fascinating reading and life affirming in an unexpected way. The most common complaint about this book is lack of evidence or proof. Morris states clearly that he did not list all the evidence because it would turn the book into an encyclopedia. There is a bibliography at the end for those who want to see where he got his information and inspiration.The style of the book is not purely scientific in so far as he he makes assumptions and draws conclusions from his own experience and his research, which makes for very interesting reading, however can be interpreted as imprecise. Just because something is not 100% proven, that does not mean that it is not interesting, relevant, thought provoking or inspirational. Throughout the book there are segments I might not wholly agree with, however the scope of the book is so vast yet still well tied together and coherent that it deserves 5/5. A brave book that even today is refreshing, educational, inspiring and a break from convention."
159,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763793-jean,3,"I disagree with those who say this book is homophobic and/or misogynistic. Morris says some things that in normal conversational context might be dubbed as such, but his explicit purpose was to view mans behavior from an objective standpoint. He succeeds. Political correctness has no place in (even attempted) scientific writing. He DOES state that gay couples cannot procreate on their own. However he goes on to discuss scenarios where this may be a pro. Don't overreact. When I read this book, I was unaware it was written decades ago. Morris' observations were fairly elementary to me, I assume since I grew up hearing a good deal of them. It is still quite enjoyable to read despite my experience. "

The author adopts a super-alpha-male stance and women have only evolved because it served men. Don't you think they did anything other than having children!! Morris thinks that working is today's form of hunting and women obviously have no place there. also, male relaxing can only ever happen with an all male group. There are some interesting parts though, I loved the chapter about grooming and fighting (sad to see that he left out the vastly different way men and women fight, but oh, I forgot, women don't)."
161,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5155466-clare,2,"I found this book to be very disappointing. Morris makes some interesting statements about human behavior, but unfortunately, he has almost nothing that could be called evidence for anything that he poses as fact. Although at first I thought I might be unfairly judging it because his sexual politics differ from mine and his understanding of human sexuality is dated to say the least, his statements on non-sex-related behaviors are equally unsupported."
162,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,4,"Very fun and interesting. The chapter on sex is laugh out loud hilarious at many points.

171,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,3,"Objective SummaryThis book explores the evolution, biology, psychology, and sociology of human beings. Morris refers to humans as the “naked ape” in an attempt to remove his cultural and experiential biases from his analysis, and to remind his readers that they, like all humans, are just evolved animals. Morris attempts to objectively describe human beings’ features, behavior, and the reasons for both in the same way a zoologist would describe any newly discovered species. The defining characteristic about human beings is our intelligence. But that intelligence is mapped crudely onto base animalistic tendencies and necessities. Rather than jumping straight to our intelligence, which may cloud important but elementary observations, Morris refers to us as the “naked ape,” a statement on our physical appearance as nearly hairless primates. Despite any attempts to ignore or transcend our animal roots, they persist. Morris explores human evolution, sex, child rearing, exploration, fighting, feeding, pursuit of comfort, and interaction with other animals. Listed below are some of the main lessons and interesting tidbits.•	Humans evolved from monkeys and apes. We moved from forests to the plains, though one theory suggests we moved from forests to seaside coasts to the plains. •	We moved from a vegetarian to an omnivore diet when we left the forest. This required cooperative hunting and defensive parties of males within the social hierarchy. This cooperation could now be a contributing factor to the development of gangs and wars.•	Neoteny, or extension of childhood development, played a significant role in human evolution. It allowed the human brain to continue to develop and grow for decades after birth, and it required pair-bonding between males and females to support the extended adolescence of their offspring. •	Pair-bonding helped females remain faithful to their mates, it reduced social friction between males over mating access, and it helped in rearing the slow-developing children. Pair-bonding is powerful but imperfect. The female orgasm, which is unusual if not unique to humans, was a contributor to pair-bonding. •	Why humans are relatively hairless isn’t known with certainty. The most popular theory is that it aids cooling during times of extreme exertion, like hunting. •	Much of our appearance is sexual signaling. Relatively large penises and breasts, red lips, and hairlessness all likely have sexual origins. Pubic and armpit hair likely trap pheromones for sexual arousal. •	80% of mothers hold infants in their left arms most likely because their heartbeat soothes their young.•	Animals fight to establish the dominance hierarchy and defend territory. They do not use their weapons to try to kill members of their own species because that would not be evolutionarily advantageous. Successful species establish aggressive and submissive displays that can substitute for actual physical confrontation and reduce physical harm and death. Bowing and avoiding eye contact are submissive signs. Standing tall and direct eye contact are dominant or aggressive signs. •	Human weaponry permits fatal action from afar. Our inability to observe submissive signals may contribute to additional killing and destruction. •	Curiosity serves a vital function to an opportunistic species. It has led humans to discover new lands, invent new tools, and try new foods. Curiosity has expanded into arts, science, and technology. There is a perpetual balance between novelty and familiarity. We want the excitement of the former with the security of the latter. By pushing the boundaries and exploring, we discover new and better ways to feed, protect, and comfort ourselves. •	Human desire for sweet foods can lead to obesity.•	Humans domesticated dozens of species of animals for food (cows, chickens, goats, pigs), companionship (dogs, cats, horses), transportation (horses, camels, elephants), experimentation (mice, rats, guinea pigs), and other tasks like plowing and hauling heavy stuff (horses, donkeys, oxen). •	Dogs were likely domesticated when we took wolf pups to fatten them up for food. Then we realized they could help us hunt and alert us to danger. There are breeds of dogs that are herders, scent-trackers, setters and pointers to prey, retrievers, killers of vermin, and guard dogs.•	Animals have five basic relationships with other animals: prey, symbiont, competitor, parasite, and predator.•	Religion may have roots in the need for an ultimately powerful being at the top of a hierarchy.•	12,000 British kids listed their favorite animals as: 1. Chimpanzee, 2. Monkey, 3. Horse, 4. Bushbaby, 5. Panda, 6. Bear, 7. Elephant, 8. Lion, 9. Dog, 10. Giraffe. They tend to have anthropomorphic features like sitting or moving upright and having highly expressive faces.•	12,000 British kids listed their most hated animals as: 1. Snake, 2. Spider, 3. Crocodile, 4. Lion, 5. Rat, 6. Skunk, 7. Gorilla, 8. Rhinoceros, 9. Hippopotamus, 10. Tiger. These are all dangerous. •	To survive as a civilization and a species, we must recognize and submit to our biological features. They cannot all be overcome through thought, culture, or technology. Subjective ThoughtsI read this book because the dude in the movie “Bring It On” was reading it during a high school football game. It was interesting and thought-provoking, but much of the content seemed familiar. That makes sense since I am a naked ape and have interacted with them all my life. And I think much of this material was covered in my biology textbooks back in the day.It was impossible for me to miss how much a product of its time this book was. Written in 1967, Morris was only five years removed from the Cuban missile crisis, and nuclear annihilation was clearly on his mind. He also harbored Malthusian fears of continued population growth, resource strain, and territorial strife. He anticipated the Ehrlichs’ “Population Bomb,” which would be published one year later. He seemed quite pessimistic on both the nuclear annihilation and overpopulation fronts. If he were to update the book today, he’d no doubt include global cooling, I mean global warming, errr global climate change in his list of calamities. Fortunately, as I type this, nukes haven’t dropped in anger since ’45, Trump may be in the process of solving Korea, reproduction rates have slowed across the developed world and sometimes below replacement levels, and there are alternative albeit expensive energy sources. Not that I’m worried enough about any of this to shut off the air conditioner or my computer. And this Honeycrisp apple from Walmart is amazing. Morris should also update his advice on how to handle being pulled over by police. His suggestion is to immediately leave your car and approach the officer so that you two don’t interact on “your” territory near your car, which will make the officer feel threatened. That shit will get you shot today. Stay in your car with your hands on the wheel, and wait to move until you’re told. You don’t want to suddenly approach someone with a Glock 17 on standby.Memorable Quotes“A solitary monkey or ape is a vulnerable creature. It lacks the powerful natural weapons of the carnivore and in isolation falls easy prey to the stalking killers.”“It is only a wise primate, like our hunting ape, that knows its own father.”“The male reaches the consummatory act of sperm ejaculation within a few minutes in most cases, unless deliberate delaying tactics are employed. . . . Some females may reach this point very quickly, others not at all, but on the average it is attained between ten and twenty minutes after the start of copulation.”“Its normal, average length of nine and a half centimetres is increased by seven to eight centimetres. The diameter is also considerably increased, giving the species the largest erect penis of any living primate.”“After a gestation period of approximately 266 days her uterus begins to contract powerfully and rhythmically.”“The average weight of a baby at birth is just over seven pounds, which is slightly more than one-twentieth of the weight of the average parent.”“Lucky is the society that enjoys the gradual acquisition of a perfect balance between imitation and curiosity, between slavish, unthinking copying and progressive, rational experimentation.”“In all exploratory behaviour, whether artistic or scientific, there is the ever-present battle between the neophilic and neophobic urges. The former drives us on to new experiences, makes us crave for novelty. The latter holds us back, makes us take refuge in the familiar. We are constantly in a state of shifting balance between the conflicting attractions of the exciting new stimulus and the friendly old one. If we lost our neophilia we would stagnate. If we lost our neophobia, we would rush headlong into disaster.”“We are, to put it mildly, in a mess, and there is a strong chance that we shall have exterminated ourselves by the end of the century.”“Animals fight amongst themselves for one of two very good reasons: either to establish their dominance in a social hierarchy, or to establish their territorial rights over a particular piece of ground.” “If a species is to survive, it simply cannot afford to go around slaughtering its own kind. Intra-specific aggression has to be inhibited and controlled, and the more powerful and savage the prey-killing weapons of a particular species are, the stronger must be the inhibitions about using them to settle disputes with rivals.”“To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion. Abortion is a drastic measure and can involve serious emotional disturbance. Furthermore, once a zygote has been formed by the act of fertilization it constitutes a new individual member of society, and its destruction is, in effect, an act of aggression, which is the very pattern of behaviour that we are attempting to control. Contraception is obviously preferable, and any religious or other ‘moralizing’ factions that oppose it must face the fact that they are engaged in dangerous war-mongering.”“We each possess about 10,000 of these taste buds, but in old age they deteriorate and decrease in number, hence the jaded palate of the elderly gastronome. Surprisingly, we can only respond to four basic tastes. They are: sour, salt, bitter, and sweet.”“Domestication of livestock, involving the organized control and selective breeding of prey, is known to have been practised for at least ten thousand years and, in certain cases, probably much longer. Goats, sheep and reindeer appear to have been the earliest prey species dealt with in this way.”“It is probable that [an interspecific bond between humans and dogs] began as a result of young puppies being brought in to the tribal home base to be fattened as food.”“Unless we can colonize other planets on a massive scale and spread the load, or seriously check our population increase in some way, we shall, in the not-too-far distant future, have to remove all other forms of life from the earth. . . . We need not dwell on this nightmare: the possibility of its becoming a reality is remote.”"

While it's a good review of instinctive human behaviour it is expectionally light into actual comparisons to other primates.He does make interesting points, e.g. noting that when the forests started to disappear we converged towards carnivore traits but by using artificial weapons rather than natural ones we did not need to move towards becoming like cats/dogs (though he doesn't note that other plains primates probably did so more than us). He notes the importance of us acquiring home bases where the females were left, and hence the need to develop more clear territories, pair bonds and ability to share food with family/tribe.He talks about how adolescents acquite the need to go off and develop their own home. But here he doesn't spend any time discussing what's actually known about how humans do this. It's actually remarkable how variable this is across different societies (albeit it generally has fixed form within a society). Sometimes it it the male, sometimes the female. These are generally species fixed traits, and yet he doesn't cover this.He talks about how the development of a pair bond meant that we needed to start hiding our sexual features in public. He notes that other species generally sustain the pair bond through aggression, but we do it instead by wearing clothes and avoiding touching each other.It's quite an old book and features some exceptional examples of envirionmentalist (e.g. blank slate) thinking from the era it was written, which is somewhat startling in a book which otherwise fully acknowledges that we are creatures driven by innate behaviours. For instance, he talks about how if a mother is tense and smiles to conceil it, the baby will detect it and mistake the function of a smile... he then warns that this could be permanently damaging and cause the child serious social difficulties... nuttier environmentalist claptrap than that is only spewed forth by modern SJWs but I guess it was par for the course back then. The section on music and it's relation to mothers heart beat is similarly whacko.A section of the book deals with our innate sounds/actions, e.g. laughter and smiling. Discussion about how they evolved is perhaps questionable. Notes things like when a baby smiles it waves it's arms and legs around, and suggests this is the vestigial primate clinging response. There's also curious little factoids, like our 'sweet tooth' being a distinct primate thing that other carnivores don't generally have.An interesting section is when he talks about how men go along to trade unions, social clubs , learned societies etc as an equivilent of the hunting pack. They do so to experience our built in bond from male togetherness. Interestingly, this was written before it became taboo to go to male only societies. One suspects that the author would not thus be suprised that membership of all voluntary societies has utterly collapsed since women were permitted to join them (see Putnam's 'Bowling Alone'). He also describes how work is probably a poor substitute for hunting for the working classes in a manner that it is not for the middle class. Expresses it in a manner that is probably illegal these days.A key point the author wants to get across in the book is that we're going through a population boom and being forced into living in environments increasingly more crowded and distrinct from what we evolved for. He talks about how the modern usage of soulless featureless architecture where everything looks the same flys against our built in desire to mark territory as our own through personalisation (declaring quite rightly that modern architects are terrorists). He is sceptical about the ability of us to adapt our innate behaviour. On that, he is probably correct. He could have argued his case better (and I believe that in his next book he went on to do so).

But exactly how far did we get? Your guesses might be way off the mark. This book says that under the surface we are ruled mostly by our inner primates. Things just look different on us. Evolution is too slow a process for us to have shed our animal past.In our species there is, as we have seen, a strong tendency to ‘fall in love’—to develop a powerful bond with the object of our sexual attentions.No primates are monogamous so why are we? The answer comes from our adaptation to life on the plains of Africa once we were thrown out of the jungle perhaps due to environmental changes. Hint, pack hunters need cooperation from all males.They occur with particularly high frequency during the initial stages of social encounters, where hidden fears and aggressions are lurking just below the surface. At a dinner party, or any small social gathering, as soon as the mutual appeasement ceremonies of hand-shaking and smiling are over, displacement cigarettes, displacement drinks and displacement food-snacks are immediately offered.This was the most fascinating part. Monkeys and apes are very much social animals with hierarchy being most crucial thing on their minds. How did we get rid of that, or did we? Even the most innocuous conversations and meetings are anything but that for your social relations obsessed brain. To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion.His argument is that cramming animals in compact spaces invariably leads to aggression. We might think we are special but think again. Only way to make sure we do not turn against each other is to give everyone enough space. Debatable, but interesting viewpoint none the less.Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else.One can only hope ;-)"
174,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98103014-jonas,4,"This book was first published in 1967 and I found it to be somewhat of a foreboding book.I was first introduced into many of these concepts regarding “the naked ape’s” ecological role and behaviour from other books, such as Ishmael by Daniel Quinn and The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. Though those books are written about something else, I found myself thinking of those books while I was reading this one. Many of the arguments presented in those books could be paralleled with the comparative elements between the human and ape presented throughout this book.Each chapter though succinct, presents an interesting perspective on the anatomy of the human body, as well as our behavioural aspects against the bodies and social practices of other ape species. I thought many of the ideas were very inventive, but the chapter on sex comes across as crass and salacious, but otherwise, the book presents itself in a very tame manner.Whilst the book contains many fantastic ideas, I can see why this book created controversy within the feminist/homosexual communities. The book even manages to squeeze in a supporting message for contraceptives and population control. Overall, I think the book makes for an interesting read, but is by no means the best book regarding the topic especially in modern day, due to changing of the zeitgeist from the late 1960’s to the prevalence of technology today (even though some of the fears might still be present today). Despite that, I still think it’s worth a read to understand how it was relevant at that time, and how it has paved a way and introduced the idea of comparative ethology to the general public."
175,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705775-gerardo-alonso,4,"The Naked Ape is a mirror. While reading it, one sees a reflection of oneself. But unlike many other reflections, this one is raw and based on our biological characteristics. This reflection breaks down our egos and social constructs to their bare bones. Desmond Morris attempts to show humanity that we are merely a species of the Animal KingdomI found the book inspiring, and highly effective to understand characteristic behaviours we may have. It feels as if someone is saying what one has already known but could not figure out the words to explain it.While this book is very powerful philosophically, I think it lacks thoroughness in logic. One of the things that concerns me is that it seems to me that Morris takes a one-sided view of several arguments sometimes based on factoids/opinions that may debatable. Another difficulty I find is the ease of comparison between the Homo Sapiens and the apes. While true that we share a very similar DNA structure, I think that Morris not only tries to link biological similarities (which he does in a great way in the beginning of the book), but also behavioural similarities.I get that in some cases or themes, the behaviour among species will be the same. The fight or flight response, for example. But when highly specific social interactions are compared between species, Morris should have analysed the Naked Ape by itself.It may be the case that some of the science behind the book is outdated, since this was published in the 60s. Regardless of the leaps Morris takes, this book is worth reading as a biology, anthropology and history lesson of our species. "
176,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"I had a great time reading this book. Despite coming out almost fifty years ago when I found it, much of what it says is still thought provoking and relevant. The book owes a little bit to psychoanalysis which was more dominant at the time. Which is good since Morris uses it to good effect to tie together physiological and behavioral facts into a general theory of human nature. What is that theory of human nature? Well, that we are the way we are because our ancestors were forced to become a predator species/hunting-ape and couldn't stay in and around trees picking fruits. Millions of years ago in Africa, during the Miocene, the forests started to disappear, and the apes could either cling onto whatever was left, or leave the ""garden of Eden"" and enter into competition with the predators on the ground. Ape populations have dwindled since, and we have emerged the apex predator. To get to that point we had to overcome the other predators, but with inferior equipment so to speak; no fangs or claws. So we made use of two things carried over to a certain degree from our ape past; intelligence and social communication. ""His whole body, his way of life, was geared to a forest existence, and then suddenly he was jettisoned into a world where he could survive only if he began to live like a brainy, weapon toting wolf."" Our social lives are to this day built on a sort of tension between social communication and intellect (from ape life) and group loyalty and hunting from our predator existence. Vestiges of our ape life are our greater reliance on sight at the expense of smell and a more various taste palate. Our predator life involves traveling greater distances to find game, rather than remaining close to the trees, having a home base to protect and return to, and having regular meals rather than momentary snacking. Being a predatory ape means developing ways to facilitate male cooperation, to hunt together with dangerous weapons, and to guarantee a share of the kills and a female for the effort. Monogamy and private property likely arise from a need to secure the loyalty of males to females and children while they hunted and prevent conflict among the males. This isn't all bad, as the predator life means some degree of male solidarity. We can't have a single alpha male who gets exclusive access to women and food. The ability to cooperate and use weapon technology means the lesser males can gang up and resist, limit, or kill the alpha male. Thus some satisfactory distribution of females and resources becomes necessary for social order, and this is likely where marriage and property and even government developed from. Morris channels Sigmund Freud and argues that religion emerges from the guilt of (symbolically) killing the alpha ape. Even with all his faults, an all powerful male does instill some sort of order and security which is socially useful. You knew where you stood, and the alpha ape in a way encouraged exogamous mating, preventing incest by kicking the sons out of the harem. So religion projects the seemingly omnipotent alpha ape onto the cosmos, extending its influence to our personal lives without actually being here. There are several downsides that ape life has: lack of cooperation (among males), a pecking order with one individual on top, and less incentive to control nature. Ape and monkey society is more about competition and dominance, and dependent on nature providing food for the picking. Depending on the environment means not traveling too far and remaining close, thus reducing the need for defense of home as well as needing to know what others are up to as they aren't far. If we just forage for food, there isn't a need to cooperate. It's ""finders keepers"", and so dominance becomes more important. The alpha male gets the first pick, and so long as everybody abides conflict can be avoided, with little need to work together other than staying out of the big guy's way. Despite all these downsides, we are still closest to the apes. We haven't evolved to be complete predators, just enough behaviors to utilize our intelligence and social cooperation to survive and thrive. And we only evolved that way because the environment made us, forced us out east of Eden. It seems that much of our aesthetics, tastes, curiosity, and enjoyment of life are owed to our more ape aspects. A pure predator kind of society would resemble the Spartans I think. What we do in leisure however reflects both aspects of our nature, in varying degrees. The popularity of sports and online first person shooter video games reflects the more predator side. More relaxing and solitary activities like cooking or painting reflect the ape side. As for the title, the naked ape, the reason why we don't have a full coat of fur is to aid us in hunting; cooling us down by chasing animals. Other predators can make fast dashes after prey, but our bipedal stature and the occupation of our hands makes this difficult. ""By losing the heavy coat of hair and by increasing the number of sweat glands all over the body surface, considerable cooling could be achieved- not for minute by minute living, but for the supreme moments of the chase."" Our subcutaneous fat and ability to fashion clothes help keep us warm without fur. With the help of neoteny, the retaining of youthful traits into adulthood, all this explains our appearance as the naked ape. Younger chimps have flatter faces, a long slender neck, smaller teeth, absence of heavy brow ridges, non-rotating big toe, and more hair on the head than the rest of the body. Our extended childhood also allows us to develop our powerful brains. A desire to explore and learn new things are also associated with youth, and so we are the young ape as well as the naked ape. Though of course neoteny is selective, as we aren't attracted to infant genitals, infantile emotions, or infantile strength. The book is full of interesting speculations about behavior, always trying to link us to our animal nature. The message of the book is that we are still operating with an animal mindset no matter how developed we are. Even the most complex behaviors like pacing back and forth and the conduct of war harken back to our more modest origins."

Grazie, Mr. Gabbani (you were my personal winner anyways... and that is kind of all I know in Italian).Thus study was such a positive disappointment! I was afraid it would be too academical for my humanities-oriented brain... but guys, if you want to read a study on how humans evolved from apes and ""the missing links"" and how certains traditions and habits of ours formed, that is really interesting and really easy to read, it is for you. I read that Desmond Morris said he wanted to de-mistify science... and I could not put it better. The explanation is really clear, easy to understand and there were some really interesting and cool facts about certain human behaviour that we still practice... it was really interesting to see where they could come from.Also: if you are a really devout creatonist, I'd recommend you only read the book if you do not get triggered by reading full-on declared truths about evolution (as I believe in evolution and the scientific research that are supposed to prove it, I did not have any issues)."

We mustn't forget when was developed this essay, as well as the possible intentions of the author.The last chapter of the book is just... funny. Suddenly, Morris seems to see sex in the explanations about why we like some animals instead of others (maybe he was possessed by Freud when he wrote the last pages) and the justifications about animal exploitation are, some of them, just ridiculous. But I'm totally agree with one of the ideas in this book, and is that the world is overpopulated by the human beings and that it would be necessary to reduce the population (not killing people!), promoting and facilitating the use of contraceptive measures.In summary: to be careful with some of the contents in the book, but is a really interesting reading in my opinion."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book aged as well as can be expected. Desmond Morris writes from a zoologist's perspective and tries to describe man as if he were an external observer of our species. He analyses us and our behaviours from a very functional point of view. In the first chapters he mostly explores our physiological characteristics (and the differences between us and our closest animal relatives) and offers various evolutionary explanations for how they could have come to be. The zoologist's perspective proves to be very insightful for this purpose and I learned a great deal. In later chapters he starts to focus more on our behaviour. Though still thought-provoking, much of what he says is very speculative and his views on women and homosexuality are strongly influenced by the era in which the book was written.Despite some of these outdated speculations, it is still extremely interesting and insightful. I would recommend it to anyone who's fascinated by human evolution. "

""Naked Ape"" was first published in the UK in 1967. It treats humans as a kind of hairless apes and explores various human behaviors from a biological point of view. Desmond Morris was born in Wiltshire, England in 1928. He studied at the University of Birmingham with a degree in zoology and a Ph.D. from Oxford University. He is a famous zoologist in England. Representative works: ""Naked Ape"", ""Human Zoo"", ""Intimate Behavior"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Origin2. Sex3. Parenting4. Explore5. Fight6. Foraging and eating7. Finishing and comfort8. People and animals ""The Analects"" says, ""A gentleman has three precepts: when he is young, his blood is indeterminate, but he is in color; he is strong, his blood is strong, he is in fighting; he is old, his blood is declining, he is in good faith. ""The need for sex, the desire to hunt, and the unsatisfied desire are the nature of animals. It is extremely difficult to control these three instinctive impulses with reason. Millions of years ago, due to some reason, most likely due to climate change, the arboreal apes that originally lived in the forest had to walk out of the forest and leave the branches to stand on the ground, and became hunting apes in order to get enough food. In the process of evolution of hunting apes, although seemingly distinctive naked apes have gradually formed, naked apes still reflect the characteristics of typical primates and typical carnivores. Naked apes maintain their juvenile development, allowing the development of the brain to continue for a long time. The long developmental process will bring a heavy burden of parenting for females, which requires naked apes to form a more stable spouse relationship to complete the nurturing of the next generation. In order to ensure that this goal can be achieved, nature seems to give the naked ape stronger sexual stimulation as compensation. Even in the social structure of naked apes where multiple spouses are allowed, the vast majority of members still adopt a one-to-one monogamy relationship due to the high cost of parenting . From the perspective of species, reproduction is the biggest mission. In this process, ""sex"" plays an extremely important role. The sexual behavior of naked apes is typically different from other 192 species of apes. The females of other apes do not seem to have an orgasm, and the sexual intercourse process is often extremely short, usually only lasting 15 times. The estrus period of females is also very short, they often leave immediately after the end of sexual intercourse, ready for the next sexual act at any time, so as not to miss the precious opportunity for fertilization. The female of the naked ape will continue to lie down to rest after the sexual intercourse is completed, immersed in the aftermath of a certain orgasm. Not only that, except for a few periods, the sexual activity of naked apes is almost unaffected. This means that even during pregnancy, female naked apes can still meet the sexual needs of male naked apes, thereby enhancing the mate relationship. The strengthening of sexual stimulation will bring about another problem, that is, when the spouses are separated, there must be a mechanism to inhibit the sexual behavior of naked apes, otherwise the social structure of monogamy will be destroyed. This is for raising the next generation. It was almost a devastating blow. The most obvious measure is to cover the fig leaf. The genitals and sexual behavior must be covered up and become a kind of extremely important privacy. The cold protection effect of clothing is not revealed until the naked ape goes out of the tropics. In addition, there are other means, such as to cover secondary sexual characteristics, shaving the child, such as armpit hair shave; remove the smell of the body; prohibition of physical contact. Naked apes need to strengthen the sexual stimulation between their spouses on the one hand, and weaken the sexual stimulation between non-mates on the one hand, so as to maintain the stability of monogamy and ensure that the cooperative relationship of the entire social structure is not destroyed. Some science fiction novels make some bold conjectures, such as: baby farms, social behavior, selective sterilization, and division of labor. For now, these behaviors are contrary to the biological instincts of naked apes. If they are implemented on a large scale one day, it can almost be concluded that the social structure and lifestyle of naked apes will undergo unimaginable changes, and the impact of changes in sexual and parenting behavior will be extremely profound. "" Among the existing 4237 mammals, almost no animal can be found suitable for survival without fur. Mammals are different from their reptile ancestors. They have an unparalleled advantage in their physiological characteristics. They can maintain a constant comparison. High body temperature. This makes the delicate machine with physiological functions suitable for efficient operation. This attribute is neither easily damaged nor easily abandoned. The body's thermostat is extremely important. Thicker, hairy and insulated The epidermis obviously plays an important role in preventing heat loss. Under strong sunlight, it can also prevent high body temperature and prevent direct sun burns to the skin. Therefore, if body hair is to fall off, obviously there must be a very good reason To give it up. Apart from a few rare exceptions, mammals acquired a new medium in evolution after referral to take this drastic step change. Flying mammals, such as bats, were forced to remove their body hair on both wings, but the body hair of other parts was still preserved, so they cannot be included as a nude species. Several burrowing mammals have greatly reduced body hair, such as voles, aardvarks, and armadillos. Aquatic mammals, such as whales, dolphins, mermaids, manatees, and seahorses, also lose their body hair as their bodies become streamlined. However, for all typical mammals that live on the surface, whether it is an animal jumping on the ground or an animal climbing on plants, the densely covered skin is an inevitable law. Except for the unusually large rhinoceros and elephants (which have special problems with their heat preservation and cooling mechanisms), naked apes are unique mammals without body hair . "" If we study humans from a biological point of view , ignore the fact that we are humans, and try our best to adopt a relatively objective attitude to study humans as animals. In fact, many interesting new ideas will be obtained. These biological insights may enable us to better understand many social phenomena. "" We know that the climate has undergone unfavorable changes. By about 15 million years ago, the scale of their forest fortresses dropped sharply. The ancestors of monkeys were forced to do two things. One of the two must be one of them: or they still defend the forest. The dilapidated hometown, or bravely faced the fate of being expelled from the Garden of Eden as the Bible says. Chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons and orangutans remained in the woods, and their numbers have been declining ever since. There is only another kind that exists apes - naked ape ancestors blaze a way out of it. they withdraw into the forest wilderness, engaged in fierce competition, the oath has been highly adaptable animal life on the ground is assessed by this risky step, but it is the outcome of evolution. In short, this adventure has been greatly rewarded. "" Even during the careful evolution of organisms . Also experienced several important adventures . These risky decisions influence so far-reaching, it determines the millions of years later, his race would die out , or will evolve into more advanced species . ""The predatory ancient apes are basically a group of males. Females are busy raising children and cannot take the main role in hunting prey. As the complexity of hunting increases, the time for hunting gradually increases, and it is necessary to abandon ancestors drifting and migrating. Lifestyle. Therefore, a fixed residence is needed to bring the prey back to the fixed base. Females and cubs wait at home for the males to return from hunting and share food. The step of fixing the residence will be seen in later chapters. , And will have a profound impact on all aspects of today’s most perfectly developed apes. "" As early human Australopithecus social division of labor during the formation of straight to this day , still a profound impact on our society. In family life, the man primarily responsible for the provision of social resources , to feed the family. While women are primarily responsible for providing resources , to breed and raise offspring. To this day, our tendency to choose a spouse basically follows this line of thinking. Men are eager to marry young, beautiful women , which implies that she has a strong ability to reproduce. Women desire to marry rich and loyal men, which means that they have the will and ability to provide a favorable living environment for themselves and their offspring. "" Fundamentally, we originated from a carnivore in the primate order. Among the existing monkeys and apes, our evolution is very unique. But this evolutionary change is not uncommon among animals of other subjects. For example, the giant panda is an animal that has completely transformed in evolution. This example is exquisite. We have changed from a vegetarian animal to a carnivore, while the giant panda has changed from a carnivore to a vegetarian animal. Just like us. The giant panda is an incomparable and very unique animal. One important thing is that the animal created by this violent transformation has a dual personality. Once it crosses the threshold between the two species, it plunges into its new role. Moving forward with great evolutionary energy-it has become too fast, so it still carries many original qualities. The time for evolution is not sufficient, it is too late to get rid of all the original features, just put on the surface features in a hurry. When primitive fish have just overcome the water-free obstacles in their terrestrial life, their terrestrial animal qualities have evolved by leaps and bounds, but they still embrace the characteristics of aquatic animals. To complete a perfect and dramatic new species, it will take millions of years. The pioneers who walk in the front are usually bizarre mixed animals. The naked ape is just such a mixed four different elephants. His entire body and the lifestyle of the pond are suitable for arboreal life, but suddenly (the so-called sudden is from the slow evolutionary process), he was thrown into a completely different world. "" "" Carnivores give birth to fleas, but primates do not. Monkeys and apes are plagued by lice and are also infected with some parasitic diseases. However, contrary to popular belief, they are not fleas at all; therefore, there are A very convincing reason. To understand this, we must first examine the life cycle of the flea. When a flea lays eggs, it does not lay on the host, but in the sleeping home of the host. The flea eggs hatch after 3 days. Wriggling little maggots. These larvae do not suck blood, but live on the dust collected in their dens. After another two weeks, the larvae cocoon and pupate. The pupae become adults after resting in the cocoon for about half a month and emerge from the cocoon. Find a suitable host. It can be seen that at least during the first month of its life cycle, the flea is separated from its host. Obviously, mammals that do not settle down, such as monkeys or apes, are not troubled by fleas. This is the reason. Even if one or two fleas accidentally land on a primate and successfully mate, the eggs they lay cannot be taken away by the primate because the primate is constantly migrating. When the flea pupae emerge from the cocoon, there will be no host waiting for them ""at home"", maintaining the host and guest relationship with them. Therefore, fleas are parasites of animals in fixed dwellings. For example, typical carnivores are such animals. "" "" First of all, the naked ape sense organs are not suitable for life on the ground. His sense of smell is too weak, his ears keen enough. His physique is too weak to withstand the grueling endurance test experience, not to break out like thunder lightning sprint, This weakness is irreparable. In terms of personality, he is more competitive, not more cooperative, and he is undoubtedly not good at planning and focusing. Fortunately, his brain is extremely good. In general intelligence, he surpassed his rival carnivore. With the help of walking upright, he has transformed both his hands and feet; through further improvements in his brain and dedicated use of the brain, he may be successful. "" "" If we look at a typical monkey fetus, we will be able to understand the most profoundly why the juvenile persistence mechanism contributes to the development and development of the primate brain. The brain during the fetal period of the monkey develops rapidly, growing up and becoming complex. The baby monkey is born. , Its brain has reached 70% of the mature brain. The remaining 30% are fully developed in the first 6 months after birth. Even chimpanzee babies with higher intelligence have brain development within 12 months after birth Be completed. Our species is in sharp contrast to this. The brain volume of a baby at birth is only 23% of that of an adult. During the 6 years after birth, children’s brains continue to develop rapidly, but the entire developmental period of the human brain can only be completed at about 23 years of age. This shows that for you and me, after sexual maturity, brain development will continue for 10 years. However, for chimpanzees, brain development has been completed for six or seven years before reproductive capacity becomes active. "" "" Infant monkeys and chimpanzees also like to play, explore, and are creative, but they die soon at this stage. However, for naked apes, these infancy characteristics will continue until they mature. In adulthood. He has enough time to imitate and learn all the techniques designed by his ancestors. In terms of physique and instinct, he has many shortcomings as a hunter. However, his intelligence and imitating ability can make up for its shortcomings and More than enough. The way and depth he accepts his parents' teaching is beyond the reach of any other animal. "" In the flesh, humans do not have the advantage of competing with large carnivores. But the reason why we can get to this point. Mainly rely on the wisdom of individuals is superb , and the organization of social groups. "
182,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2094984-weston,5,"""The Naked Ape"" is remarkable. It embodies precisely the type of popular-science literature I love to read: the matter-of-fact pointing out of things which, having been pointed out, seem totally obvious, as if Desmond Morris were just reciting things I already knew but hadn't gotten around to actually realizing yet. His observations run that gamut of what he terms ""typical"" human behavior and physiology. That is, at the time of this book's writing (as now) anthropologists and sociologists commonly made the atypical specimens and their behaviors the focus of their studies. Were other scientists engaged in the study of lifeforms to do similarly they would never get anywhere. Perhaps out of vanity, perhaps out of a lack of self-awareness, science has historically avoided turning its objective eye toward the scientist (obvious and irrelevant exceptions of medical science excluded). Luckily for us, Desmond Morris undertook this endeavor and his findings are not only fascinating but wildly entertaining.A great deal of the pleasure derived from this book is in the way that Morris so ruthlessly picks apart his subject. The book's title itself is a playful and astutely humbling jab at the subject which drives straight to the heart of his message: human beings are first and foremost animals. Apes, to be precise, and our principal distinguishing feature, from a zoological standpoint, from our ape cousins is no more than our lack of a shaggy coat. We may drive around in fancy cars, work in skyscrapers, level mountains, dam rivers, etc. At the end of the day, we're still a bunch of naked apes. Which isn't to say that we aren't members of an incredibly resourceful and clever species, fascinating from all angles and fascinated by all things. Because we are unique, we are remarkable. Still, it is no more than gross vanity that makes us suppose that our manipulation of the external environment or the complexity and ingeniousness of our cultural expression has enabled us to overcome the fact that we are ""still very much a biological phenomenon... subject to all the basic laws of animal behavior.""Morris arms his reader with a new arsenal of cocktail party factoids, some endearing, some disgusting, some depressing, others hilarious, which alone make the read worthwhile. For instance, the size and shape of human breasts suggest that they have developed, through many centuries of sexual selection, as sexual signaling devices rather than merely as organs used to feed infants. That is, human breasts are actually not very good feeding devices when compared to those of other apes. The nipple typically isn't shaped to fit easily into the infant mouth and the excess tissue around it can even obstruct the baby's breathing. And yet breasts are universally used to spectacular success in piquing the interest of potential mates and, it could go without saying, play an enormous secondary role in human intercourse, behavior which is seen nowhere else in the animal kingdom. The evolutionary reasons for this development, believe it or not, are fascinatingly and intimately woven into our ancestors struggle for survival as the first carnivorous apes on the ancient plains of Africa.Having been first published in the 60's, ""Naked Ape"" is somewhat outdated. Morris' characterization of indigenous societies as atypical cultural failures makes sense from the coldly zoological perspective from which he was attempting to write, but fails to take into consideration historical truths which invite explanations beyond a socities' supposed lack of functionality. Modern readers will be equally squeamish by the occasional reference made to the ""negroid race"" and the interpretation of homosexuality as little more than deviant behavior caused by abnormal childhood experiences. Present day sensitivities aside, Morris is nevertheless quite forward-thinking and the intellectual merits of the book by far exceed whatever flags might be raised by your inner-p.c. reactionary.As entertaining a book as it is, Morris' tone and message is ultimately one of apocalyptic foreboding. We naked apes have been so spectacularly successful as a species that we have come to think of ourselves as invincible and we are not. Our success will, sooner rather than later, catch up with us because the global economy of environmental resources is, after all, finite. The modern reader will recognize all too well that the book's imperative rings even truer today, despite Morris' having to sound like a fanatic at the time of its initial publishing. Ironically, Morris suggests, the naked ape's first step toward salvation will be the recognition of his true nature. To go forward we have to take an honest look at where we came from."

184,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21322837-heather-mcalister,1,"Backwards, sexist, racist drivel. Written by a man obviously trying to stroke his own ego by arguing how ""objectively,"" when you look at it from the impartial perspective of a rational (male) scientist, early hominids clearly evolved to walk upright, lose their fur, use tools, develop spoken language, etc. ALL so that males could hunt in groups like wolves or lions. Literally every physiological feature of the modern homo sapien, according to the ""impartial"" male Desmond Morris, was led by ""hot-blooded,"" aggressive alpha males to hunt and kill. The invention of tools being so men could hunt; walking upright so men could see over grass; learning to talk so men could communicate complex hunting strategies; the loss of fur so men wouldn't die of heatstroke running in the hot African climate, etc.And the women? Oh, they just evolved to be child-rearers and home-makers. They sat around in caves suckling their babes like mama wolves in their dens with cubs (never mind that real mother wolves are out of the den in weeks, and often dump their pups on a babysitter as soon as they possibly can) waiting with baited breath for the menfolk to come home and share the spoils of the hunt with them.And all the physical features early female hominids not covered by his ""male hunting"" explanation? Like female hominid larger breasts, wider birthing hips, hominids developing downward facing noses, etc? Oh, they just evolved to ""make sex sexier."" (I'm not kidding. That's what it says in the book.) Female hominids have larger breasts than other greater apes? It's because the males found it sexy. Female hominids have wider hips? Males found it sexy. Downward facing noses? Same thing. Homo sapiens have fuller lips than other greater apes? Because it made kissing sexier, and kissing is a great evolutionary foreplay to sex.The minute I stopped reading was when Desmond Morris claimed that (white) homo sapiens having pink lips because it gave them a pouty kissable look, thus making them look more kissable, thus more desirable as a mate. And what of certain black Africans who tend to have enough melanin in their skin not to have pink lips, and/or have fuller, puffier lips? According to Desmond Morris, it's because they're evolutionary failures who had to evolve fuller lips to make up for not having the desired pink lips that more evolutionary successful (white) homo sapiens possess. (Which, according to him, are like those living in North America. Not the ""obscure"" cultures in Africa that are ""not as evolutionary successful,"" his words. Never mind that white 'North American' culture as we know it has only existed for a few centuries at most, and hasn't withstood the test of time the way the 'obscure' African cultures have, which have stood for centuries, if not millennia.) This book is a transparent straight white male ego stroke, where a guy who fancies himself ""rational"" and ""objective"" breaks his arm patting himself, as a straight white male homo sapien, on the back for being ""an evolutionary success."" According to him, EVERY SINGLE physiological trait of the entire modern homo sapien species came from (presumably white) men of eons past being big strong hunters. Women and people of color were just hanger-ons who reaped the evolutionary benefits of the past (presumably) straight white male hunters' ingenuity. And every trait females have that males (presumably) don't is because the males found it sexy, or it aided in bearing the males' children. And every trait that people of color have that whites don't was formed to compensate the ""evolutionary disadvantage"" of not being white.Also, I took a few anthropology classes in community college. Almost every point he ever made has been largely disproven, or called into serious question. Fuck this guy, fuck this book. The fact that people still read this sexist, racist drivel and see it as anything resembling fact is frankly insulting to the whole homo sapien species."
185,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19627177-n-jr,5,"A fascinating read by a great thinker. Virtually no aspect of human nature and physiognomy escapes his keen zoologist eyes; even responses such as smiling, laughing and crying. However, be warned: not only is this book nearly 50 years old and therefore outdated, but one must ingest his words with a large heaping of salt. As a scientific treatise it fails. The best way to read it is to consider this the personal musings of a biologist/anthropologist, not the findings of an expert researcher. It's greatest value is in instigating thought on the subject. It is the step-back-and look-at-ourselves approach which is of real value here, not his (sometimes hilarious)conclusions.His explanation of the protuberance and shape of female breasts developing as a frontal sexual display resulting from our upright posture, rather than for increased efficiency of nursing, is presented as a credible argument. Mmm, maybe that explains the human male's fascination with them.Most of his observations are comparative, highlighting similarities and differences between other mammals, notably the chimpanzee. In all cases, Morris makes us think about many aspects of ourselves that we normally take for granted.One criticism I have is his over-emphasis on genetic origins - for example, he claims the pair-bond formation between sexes (i.e monogamy) is genetic rather than cultural - afraid I disagree there. Also his treatment of warfare is incomplete and not entirely satisfactory for me.I know others will attack the author as chauvinistic (not only in regards the sexes, but cultures as well), but still, hey, the book can just be considered food for thought.All in all, a stimulating read, one so rich that I have marked it for a second time around in the future. It helped me to come up with my own thoughts on the subject"
186,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4373676-jonathan-david-jackson,5,"Really a very interesting book. It's written as if the author were writing it about any other animal, and hearing myself talked about as if I am a naked mole rat or a chimpanzee is very refreshing (this doesn't give you permission to refer to me as such in polite society, btw). We are animals as much as any other, and we should consider all the things that make us what we are, including our animal instincts and our biological history.There are some ideas I think are odd, for example when he says that adults want to save elephants from extinction mainly because of our own impending individual extinction (death). Some things seem like just his opinion, and don't make sense to me. All the ideas, though - every single one - I found to be interesting. There were plenty of things I'd heard before (after all, it's a 40 year old book), but there were also plenty of things I hadn't heard which were totally new to me, and made me reconsider some of my own ideas. One such idea I have is that clothes are something unnatural, something to be avoided. He puts it to us that humans are a very sexual species, unlike other animals which have a mating season we are ready all the time, and unlike other animals which need to do something special to display their genitals ours are visible all the time, so to avoid making sexual displays to everyone all the time, we cover up. I've thought about most of my opinions long and hard for many years, and reading anything that makes me consider changing them is a rare and wonderful experience which had me turning each page almost in awe at what I had found before and might find after.I have the other two books in this series, and I can't wait to read them next."
187,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180947-j,3,"Desmond Morris raises some interesting points in this book, some more farfetched than others. Honestly, I have problems with a lot of the points he makes in this book. Attempting to explain everything we do by comparing us to our nearest relatives in the animal kingdom is like I said interesting but the truth is many of our behaviors are unique to our species because of our advanced intellect and I think simplifying them by saying they can be explained by looking at the behaviors of other primates is not entirely accurate. Furthermore, he makes a few mistakes I wouldn't expect anyone familiar with biology to make (including the 'tongue-map' for taste recognition) as well as taking a very eurocentric stance on human behavior. His postulations aren't really backed up with anything more than the observation of other primates which by itself can't really be used to explain our behavior. Along with his insistance on using North Americans and Europeans as the model for humanity, I have to say that this book is more rooted in speculation than fact and shouldn't be taken seriously as a work of science. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining read and worthy of the 3 stars I gave it."
188,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027404-david-o-brien,5,"Fascinating reading and life affirming in an unexpected way. The most common complaint about this book is lack of evidence or proof. Morris states clearly that he did not list all the evidence because it would turn the book into an encyclopedia. There is a bibliography at the end for those who want to see where he got his information and inspiration.The style of the book is not purely scientific in so far as he he makes assumptions and draws conclusions from his own experience and his research, which makes for very interesting reading, however can be interpreted as imprecise. Just because something is not 100% proven, that does not mean that it is not interesting, relevant, thought provoking or inspirational. Throughout the book there are segments I might not wholly agree with, however the scope of the book is so vast yet still well tied together and coherent that it deserves 5/5. A brave book that even today is refreshing, educational, inspiring and a break from convention."
189,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763793-jean,3,"I disagree with those who say this book is homophobic and/or misogynistic. Morris says some things that in normal conversational context might be dubbed as such, but his explicit purpose was to view mans behavior from an objective standpoint. He succeeds. Political correctness has no place in (even attempted) scientific writing. He DOES state that gay couples cannot procreate on their own. However he goes on to discuss scenarios where this may be a pro. Don't overreact. When I read this book, I was unaware it was written decades ago. Morris' observations were fairly elementary to me, I assume since I grew up hearing a good deal of them. It is still quite enjoyable to read despite my experience. "

The author adopts a super-alpha-male stance and women have only evolved because it served men. Don't you think they did anything other than having children!! Morris thinks that working is today's form of hunting and women obviously have no place there. also, male relaxing can only ever happen with an all male group. There are some interesting parts though, I loved the chapter about grooming and fighting (sad to see that he left out the vastly different way men and women fight, but oh, I forgot, women don't)."
191,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5155466-clare,2,"I found this book to be very disappointing. Morris makes some interesting statements about human behavior, but unfortunately, he has almost nothing that could be called evidence for anything that he poses as fact. Although at first I thought I might be unfairly judging it because his sexual politics differ from mine and his understanding of human sexuality is dated to say the least, his statements on non-sex-related behaviors are equally unsupported."

201,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,3,"Objective SummaryThis book explores the evolution, biology, psychology, and sociology of human beings. Morris refers to humans as the “naked ape” in an attempt to remove his cultural and experiential biases from his analysis, and to remind his readers that they, like all humans, are just evolved animals. Morris attempts to objectively describe human beings’ features, behavior, and the reasons for both in the same way a zoologist would describe any newly discovered species. The defining characteristic about human beings is our intelligence. But that intelligence is mapped crudely onto base animalistic tendencies and necessities. Rather than jumping straight to our intelligence, which may cloud important but elementary observations, Morris refers to us as the “naked ape,” a statement on our physical appearance as nearly hairless primates. Despite any attempts to ignore or transcend our animal roots, they persist. Morris explores human evolution, sex, child rearing, exploration, fighting, feeding, pursuit of comfort, and interaction with other animals. Listed below are some of the main lessons and interesting tidbits.•	Humans evolved from monkeys and apes. We moved from forests to the plains, though one theory suggests we moved from forests to seaside coasts to the plains. •	We moved from a vegetarian to an omnivore diet when we left the forest. This required cooperative hunting and defensive parties of males within the social hierarchy. This cooperation could now be a contributing factor to the development of gangs and wars.•	Neoteny, or extension of childhood development, played a significant role in human evolution. It allowed the human brain to continue to develop and grow for decades after birth, and it required pair-bonding between males and females to support the extended adolescence of their offspring. •	Pair-bonding helped females remain faithful to their mates, it reduced social friction between males over mating access, and it helped in rearing the slow-developing children. Pair-bonding is powerful but imperfect. The female orgasm, which is unusual if not unique to humans, was a contributor to pair-bonding. •	Why humans are relatively hairless isn’t known with certainty. The most popular theory is that it aids cooling during times of extreme exertion, like hunting. •	Much of our appearance is sexual signaling. Relatively large penises and breasts, red lips, and hairlessness all likely have sexual origins. Pubic and armpit hair likely trap pheromones for sexual arousal. •	80% of mothers hold infants in their left arms most likely because their heartbeat soothes their young.•	Animals fight to establish the dominance hierarchy and defend territory. They do not use their weapons to try to kill members of their own species because that would not be evolutionarily advantageous. Successful species establish aggressive and submissive displays that can substitute for actual physical confrontation and reduce physical harm and death. Bowing and avoiding eye contact are submissive signs. Standing tall and direct eye contact are dominant or aggressive signs. •	Human weaponry permits fatal action from afar. Our inability to observe submissive signals may contribute to additional killing and destruction. •	Curiosity serves a vital function to an opportunistic species. It has led humans to discover new lands, invent new tools, and try new foods. Curiosity has expanded into arts, science, and technology. There is a perpetual balance between novelty and familiarity. We want the excitement of the former with the security of the latter. By pushing the boundaries and exploring, we discover new and better ways to feed, protect, and comfort ourselves. •	Human desire for sweet foods can lead to obesity.•	Humans domesticated dozens of species of animals for food (cows, chickens, goats, pigs), companionship (dogs, cats, horses), transportation (horses, camels, elephants), experimentation (mice, rats, guinea pigs), and other tasks like plowing and hauling heavy stuff (horses, donkeys, oxen). •	Dogs were likely domesticated when we took wolf pups to fatten them up for food. Then we realized they could help us hunt and alert us to danger. There are breeds of dogs that are herders, scent-trackers, setters and pointers to prey, retrievers, killers of vermin, and guard dogs.•	Animals have five basic relationships with other animals: prey, symbiont, competitor, parasite, and predator.•	Religion may have roots in the need for an ultimately powerful being at the top of a hierarchy.•	12,000 British kids listed their favorite animals as: 1. Chimpanzee, 2. Monkey, 3. Horse, 4. Bushbaby, 5. Panda, 6. Bear, 7. Elephant, 8. Lion, 9. Dog, 10. Giraffe. They tend to have anthropomorphic features like sitting or moving upright and having highly expressive faces.•	12,000 British kids listed their most hated animals as: 1. Snake, 2. Spider, 3. Crocodile, 4. Lion, 5. Rat, 6. Skunk, 7. Gorilla, 8. Rhinoceros, 9. Hippopotamus, 10. Tiger. These are all dangerous. •	To survive as a civilization and a species, we must recognize and submit to our biological features. They cannot all be overcome through thought, culture, or technology. Subjective ThoughtsI read this book because the dude in the movie “Bring It On” was reading it during a high school football game. It was interesting and thought-provoking, but much of the content seemed familiar. That makes sense since I am a naked ape and have interacted with them all my life. And I think much of this material was covered in my biology textbooks back in the day.It was impossible for me to miss how much a product of its time this book was. Written in 1967, Morris was only five years removed from the Cuban missile crisis, and nuclear annihilation was clearly on his mind. He also harbored Malthusian fears of continued population growth, resource strain, and territorial strife. He anticipated the Ehrlichs’ “Population Bomb,” which would be published one year later. He seemed quite pessimistic on both the nuclear annihilation and overpopulation fronts. If he were to update the book today, he’d no doubt include global cooling, I mean global warming, errr global climate change in his list of calamities. Fortunately, as I type this, nukes haven’t dropped in anger since ’45, Trump may be in the process of solving Korea, reproduction rates have slowed across the developed world and sometimes below replacement levels, and there are alternative albeit expensive energy sources. Not that I’m worried enough about any of this to shut off the air conditioner or my computer. And this Honeycrisp apple from Walmart is amazing. Morris should also update his advice on how to handle being pulled over by police. His suggestion is to immediately leave your car and approach the officer so that you two don’t interact on “your” territory near your car, which will make the officer feel threatened. That shit will get you shot today. Stay in your car with your hands on the wheel, and wait to move until you’re told. You don’t want to suddenly approach someone with a Glock 17 on standby.Memorable Quotes“A solitary monkey or ape is a vulnerable creature. It lacks the powerful natural weapons of the carnivore and in isolation falls easy prey to the stalking killers.”“It is only a wise primate, like our hunting ape, that knows its own father.”“The male reaches the consummatory act of sperm ejaculation within a few minutes in most cases, unless deliberate delaying tactics are employed. . . . Some females may reach this point very quickly, others not at all, but on the average it is attained between ten and twenty minutes after the start of copulation.”“Its normal, average length of nine and a half centimetres is increased by seven to eight centimetres. The diameter is also considerably increased, giving the species the largest erect penis of any living primate.”“After a gestation period of approximately 266 days her uterus begins to contract powerfully and rhythmically.”“The average weight of a baby at birth is just over seven pounds, which is slightly more than one-twentieth of the weight of the average parent.”“Lucky is the society that enjoys the gradual acquisition of a perfect balance between imitation and curiosity, between slavish, unthinking copying and progressive, rational experimentation.”“In all exploratory behaviour, whether artistic or scientific, there is the ever-present battle between the neophilic and neophobic urges. The former drives us on to new experiences, makes us crave for novelty. The latter holds us back, makes us take refuge in the familiar. We are constantly in a state of shifting balance between the conflicting attractions of the exciting new stimulus and the friendly old one. If we lost our neophilia we would stagnate. If we lost our neophobia, we would rush headlong into disaster.”“We are, to put it mildly, in a mess, and there is a strong chance that we shall have exterminated ourselves by the end of the century.”“Animals fight amongst themselves for one of two very good reasons: either to establish their dominance in a social hierarchy, or to establish their territorial rights over a particular piece of ground.” “If a species is to survive, it simply cannot afford to go around slaughtering its own kind. Intra-specific aggression has to be inhibited and controlled, and the more powerful and savage the prey-killing weapons of a particular species are, the stronger must be the inhibitions about using them to settle disputes with rivals.”“To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion. Abortion is a drastic measure and can involve serious emotional disturbance. Furthermore, once a zygote has been formed by the act of fertilization it constitutes a new individual member of society, and its destruction is, in effect, an act of aggression, which is the very pattern of behaviour that we are attempting to control. Contraception is obviously preferable, and any religious or other ‘moralizing’ factions that oppose it must face the fact that they are engaged in dangerous war-mongering.”“We each possess about 10,000 of these taste buds, but in old age they deteriorate and decrease in number, hence the jaded palate of the elderly gastronome. Surprisingly, we can only respond to four basic tastes. They are: sour, salt, bitter, and sweet.”“Domestication of livestock, involving the organized control and selective breeding of prey, is known to have been practised for at least ten thousand years and, in certain cases, probably much longer. Goats, sheep and reindeer appear to have been the earliest prey species dealt with in this way.”“It is probable that [an interspecific bond between humans and dogs] began as a result of young puppies being brought in to the tribal home base to be fattened as food.”“Unless we can colonize other planets on a massive scale and spread the load, or seriously check our population increase in some way, we shall, in the not-too-far distant future, have to remove all other forms of life from the earth. . . . We need not dwell on this nightmare: the possibility of its becoming a reality is remote.”"
202,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62596158-n-g-habsburg,3,"I enjoyed reading this (it's written in quite an amusing style) but I was hoping for something more heavy on the primatology. While it's a good review of instinctive human behaviour it is expectionally light into actual comparisons to other primates.He does make interesting points, e.g. noting that when the forests started to disappear we converged towards carnivore traits but by using artificial weapons rather than natural ones we did not need to move towards becoming like cats/dogs (though he doesn't note that other plains primates probably did so more than us). He notes the importance of us acquiring home bases where the females were left, and hence the need to develop more clear territories, pair bonds and ability to share food with family/tribe.He talks about how adolescents acquite the need to go off and develop their own home. But here he doesn't spend any time discussing what's actually known about how humans do this. It's actually remarkable how variable this is across different societies (albeit it generally has fixed form within a society). Sometimes it it the male, sometimes the female. These are generally species fixed traits, and yet he doesn't cover this.He talks about how the development of a pair bond meant that we needed to start hiding our sexual features in public. He notes that other species generally sustain the pair bond through aggression, but we do it instead by wearing clothes and avoiding touching each other.It's quite an old book and features some exceptional examples of envirionmentalist (e.g. blank slate) thinking from the era it was written, which is somewhat startling in a book which otherwise fully acknowledges that we are creatures driven by innate behaviours. For instance, he talks about how if a mother is tense and smiles to conceil it, the baby will detect it and mistake the function of a smile... he then warns that this could be permanently damaging and cause the child serious social difficulties... nuttier environmentalist claptrap than that is only spewed forth by modern SJWs but I guess it was par for the course back then. The section on music and it's relation to mothers heart beat is similarly whacko.A section of the book deals with our innate sounds/actions, e.g. laughter and smiling. Discussion about how they evolved is perhaps questionable. Notes things like when a baby smiles it waves it's arms and legs around, and suggests this is the vestigial primate clinging response. There's also curious little factoids, like our 'sweet tooth' being a distinct primate thing that other carnivores don't generally have.An interesting section is when he talks about how men go along to trade unions, social clubs , learned societies etc as an equivilent of the hunting pack. They do so to experience our built in bond from male togetherness. Interestingly, this was written before it became taboo to go to male only societies. One suspects that the author would not thus be suprised that membership of all voluntary societies has utterly collapsed since women were permitted to join them (see Putnam's 'Bowling Alone'). He also describes how work is probably a poor substitute for hunting for the working classes in a manner that it is not for the middle class. Expresses it in a manner that is probably illegal these days.A key point the author wants to get across in the book is that we're going through a population boom and being forced into living in environments increasingly more crowded and distrinct from what we evolved for. He talks about how the modern usage of soulless featureless architecture where everything looks the same flys against our built in desire to mark territory as our own through personalisation (declaring quite rightly that modern architects are terrorists). He is sceptical about the ability of us to adapt our innate behaviour. On that, he is probably correct. He could have argued his case better (and I believe that in his next book he went on to do so).

But exactly how far did we get? Your guesses might be way off the mark. This book says that under the surface we are ruled mostly by our inner primates. Things just look different on us. Evolution is too slow a process for us to have shed our animal past.In our species there is, as we have seen, a strong tendency to ‘fall in love’—to develop a powerful bond with the object of our sexual attentions.No primates are monogamous so why are we? The answer comes from our adaptation to life on the plains of Africa once we were thrown out of the jungle perhaps due to environmental changes. Hint, pack hunters need cooperation from all males.They occur with particularly high frequency during the initial stages of social encounters, where hidden fears and aggressions are lurking just below the surface. At a dinner party, or any small social gathering, as soon as the mutual appeasement ceremonies of hand-shaking and smiling are over, displacement cigarettes, displacement drinks and displacement food-snacks are immediately offered.This was the most fascinating part. Monkeys and apes are very much social animals with hierarchy being most crucial thing on their minds. How did we get rid of that, or did we? Even the most innocuous conversations and meetings are anything but that for your social relations obsessed brain. To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion.His argument is that cramming animals in compact spaces invariably leads to aggression. We might think we are special but think again. Only way to make sure we do not turn against each other is to give everyone enough space. Debatable, but interesting viewpoint none the less.Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else.One can only hope ;-)"
204,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98103014-jonas,4,"This book was first published in 1967 and I found it to be somewhat of a foreboding book.I was first introduced into many of these concepts regarding “the naked ape’s” ecological role and behaviour from other books, such as Ishmael by Daniel Quinn and The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. Though those books are written about something else, I found myself thinking of those books while I was reading this one. Many of the arguments presented in those books could be paralleled with the comparative elements between the human and ape presented throughout this book.Each chapter though succinct, presents an interesting perspective on the anatomy of the human body, as well as our behavioural aspects against the bodies and social practices of other ape species. I thought many of the ideas were very inventive, but the chapter on sex comes across as crass and salacious, but otherwise, the book presents itself in a very tame manner.Whilst the book contains many fantastic ideas, I can see why this book created controversy within the feminist/homosexual communities. The book even manages to squeeze in a supporting message for contraceptives and population control. Overall, I think the book makes for an interesting read, but is by no means the best book regarding the topic especially in modern day, due to changing of the zeitgeist from the late 1960’s to the prevalence of technology today (even though some of the fears might still be present today). Despite that, I still think it’s worth a read to understand how it was relevant at that time, and how it has paved a way and introduced the idea of comparative ethology to the general public."
205,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705775-gerardo-alonso,4,"The Naked Ape is a mirror. While reading it, one sees a reflection of oneself. But unlike many other reflections, this one is raw and based on our biological characteristics. This reflection breaks down our egos and social constructs to their bare bones. Desmond Morris attempts to show humanity that we are merely a species of the Animal KingdomI found the book inspiring, and highly effective to understand characteristic behaviours we may have. It feels as if someone is saying what one has already known but could not figure out the words to explain it.While this book is very powerful philosophically, I think it lacks thoroughness in logic. One of the things that concerns me is that it seems to me that Morris takes a one-sided view of several arguments sometimes based on factoids/opinions that may debatable. Another difficulty I find is the ease of comparison between the Homo Sapiens and the apes. While true that we share a very similar DNA structure, I think that Morris not only tries to link biological similarities (which he does in a great way in the beginning of the book), but also behavioural similarities.I get that in some cases or themes, the behaviour among species will be the same. The fight or flight response, for example. But when highly specific social interactions are compared between species, Morris should have analysed the Naked Ape by itself.It may be the case that some of the science behind the book is outdated, since this was published in the 60s. Regardless of the leaps Morris takes, this book is worth reading as a biology, anthropology and history lesson of our species. "
206,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"I had a great time reading this book. Despite coming out almost fifty years ago when I found it, much of what it says is still thought provoking and relevant. The book owes a little bit to psychoanalysis which was more dominant at the time. Which is good since Morris uses it to good effect to tie together physiological and behavioral facts into a general theory of human nature. What is that theory of human nature? Well, that we are the way we are because our ancestors were forced to become a predator species/hunting-ape and couldn't stay in and around trees picking fruits. Millions of years ago in Africa, during the Miocene, the forests started to disappear, and the apes could either cling onto whatever was left, or leave the ""garden of Eden"" and enter into competition with the predators on the ground. Ape populations have dwindled since, and we have emerged the apex predator. To get to that point we had to overcome the other predators, but with inferior equipment so to speak; no fangs or claws. So we made use of two things carried over to a certain degree from our ape past; intelligence and social communication. ""His whole body, his way of life, was geared to a forest existence, and then suddenly he was jettisoned into a world where he could survive only if he began to live like a brainy, weapon toting wolf."" Our social lives are to this day built on a sort of tension between social communication and intellect (from ape life) and group loyalty and hunting from our predator existence. Vestiges of our ape life are our greater reliance on sight at the expense of smell and a more various taste palate. Our predator life involves traveling greater distances to find game, rather than remaining close to the trees, having a home base to protect and return to, and having regular meals rather than momentary snacking. Being a predatory ape means developing ways to facilitate male cooperation, to hunt together with dangerous weapons, and to guarantee a share of the kills and a female for the effort. Monogamy and private property likely arise from a need to secure the loyalty of males to females and children while they hunted and prevent conflict among the males. This isn't all bad, as the predator life means some degree of male solidarity. We can't have a single alpha male who gets exclusive access to women and food. The ability to cooperate and use weapon technology means the lesser males can gang up and resist, limit, or kill the alpha male. Thus some satisfactory distribution of females and resources becomes necessary for social order, and this is likely where marriage and property and even government developed from. Morris channels Sigmund Freud and argues that religion emerges from the guilt of (symbolically) killing the alpha ape. Even with all his faults, an all powerful male does instill some sort of order and security which is socially useful. You knew where you stood, and the alpha ape in a way encouraged exogamous mating, preventing incest by kicking the sons out of the harem. So religion projects the seemingly omnipotent alpha ape onto the cosmos, extending its influence to our personal lives without actually being here. There are several downsides that ape life has: lack of cooperation (among males), a pecking order with one individual on top, and less incentive to control nature. Ape and monkey society is more about competition and dominance, and dependent on nature providing food for the picking. Depending on the environment means not traveling too far and remaining close, thus reducing the need for defense of home as well as needing to know what others are up to as they aren't far. If we just forage for food, there isn't a need to cooperate. It's ""finders keepers"", and so dominance becomes more important. The alpha male gets the first pick, and so long as everybody abides conflict can be avoided, with little need to work together other than staying out of the big guy's way. Despite all these downsides, we are still closest to the apes. We haven't evolved to be complete predators, just enough behaviors to utilize our intelligence and social cooperation to survive and thrive. And we only evolved that way because the environment made us, forced us out east of Eden. It seems that much of our aesthetics, tastes, curiosity, and enjoyment of life are owed to our more ape aspects. A pure predator kind of society would resemble the Spartans I think. What we do in leisure however reflects both aspects of our nature, in varying degrees. The popularity of sports and online first person shooter video games reflects the more predator side. More relaxing and solitary activities like cooking or painting reflect the ape side. As for the title, the naked ape, the reason why we don't have a full coat of fur is to aid us in hunting; cooling us down by chasing animals. Other predators can make fast dashes after prey, but our bipedal stature and the occupation of our hands makes this difficult. ""By losing the heavy coat of hair and by increasing the number of sweat glands all over the body surface, considerable cooling could be achieved- not for minute by minute living, but for the supreme moments of the chase."" Our subcutaneous fat and ability to fashion clothes help keep us warm without fur. With the help of neoteny, the retaining of youthful traits into adulthood, all this explains our appearance as the naked ape. Younger chimps have flatter faces, a long slender neck, smaller teeth, absence of heavy brow ridges, non-rotating big toe, and more hair on the head than the rest of the body. Our extended childhood also allows us to develop our powerful brains. A desire to explore and learn new things are also associated with youth, and so we are the young ape as well as the naked ape. Though of course neoteny is selective, as we aren't attracted to infant genitals, infantile emotions, or infantile strength. The book is full of interesting speculations about behavior, always trying to link us to our animal nature. The message of the book is that we are still operating with an animal mindset no matter how developed we are. Even the most complex behaviors like pacing back and forth and the conduct of war harken back to our more modest origins."

I was afraid it would be too academical for my humanities-oriented brain... but guys, if you want to read a study on how humans evolved from apes and ""the missing links"" and how certains traditions and habits of ours formed, that is really interesting and really easy to read, it is for you. I read that Desmond Morris said he wanted to de-mistify science... and I could not put it better. The explanation is really clear, easy to understand and there were some really interesting and cool facts about certain human behaviour that we still practice... it was really interesting to see where they could come from.Also: if you are a really devout creatonist, I'd recommend you only read the book if you do not get triggered by reading full-on declared truths about evolution (as I believe in evolution and the scientific research that are supposed to prove it, I did not have any issues)."

We mustn't forget when was developed this essay, as well as the possible intentions of the author.The last chapter of the book is just... funny. Suddenly, Morris seems to see sex in the explanations about why we like some animals instead of others (maybe he was possessed by Freud when he wrote the last pages) and the justifications about animal exploitation are, some of them, just ridiculous. But I'm totally agree with one of the ideas in this book, and is that the world is overpopulated by the human beings and that it would be necessary to reduce the population (not killing people!), promoting and facilitating the use of contraceptive measures.In summary: to be careful with some of the contents in the book, but is a really interesting reading in my opinion."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book aged as well as can be expected. Desmond Morris writes from a zoologist's perspective and tries to describe man as if he were an external observer of our species. He analyses us and our behaviours from a very functional point of view. In the first chapters he mostly explores our physiological characteristics (and the differences between us and our closest animal relatives) and offers various evolutionary explanations for how they could have come to be. The zoologist's perspective proves to be very insightful for this purpose and I learned a great deal. In later chapters he starts to focus more on our behaviour. Though still thought-provoking, much of what he says is very speculative and his views on women and homosexuality are strongly influenced by the era in which the book was written.Despite some of these outdated speculations, it is still extremely interesting and insightful. I would recommend it to anyone who's fascinated by human evolution. "

211,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112166097-barack-liu,4," 227-The Naked Ape-Desmond Morris-Nature-1967Barack2019/07/082020/06/23 - Biologically, people are divided, Mammal, primates, hominids, human genus Homo sapiens, is the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and gibbon apes belong to the superfamily of primates. ""Naked Ape"" was first published in the UK in 1967. It treats humans as a kind of hairless apes and explores various human behaviors from a biological point of view. Desmond Morris was born in Wiltshire, England in 1928. He studied at the University of Birmingham with a degree in zoology and a Ph.D. from Oxford University. He is a famous zoologist in England. Representative works: ""Naked Ape"", ""Human Zoo"", ""Intimate Behavior"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Origin2. Sex3. Parenting4. Explore5. Fight6. Foraging and eating7. Finishing and comfort8. People and animals ""The Analects"" says, ""A gentleman has three precepts: when he is young, his blood is indeterminate, but he is in color; he is strong, his blood is strong, he is in fighting; he is old, his blood is declining, he is in good faith. ""The need for sex, the desire to hunt, and the unsatisfied desire are the nature of animals. It is extremely difficult to control these three instinctive impulses with reason. Millions of years ago, due to some reason, most likely due to climate change, the arboreal apes that originally lived in the forest had to walk out of the forest and leave the branches to stand on the ground, and became hunting apes in order to get enough food. In the process of evolution of hunting apes, although seemingly distinctive naked apes have gradually formed, naked apes still reflect the characteristics of typical primates and typical carnivores. Naked apes maintain their juvenile development, allowing the development of the brain to continue for a long time. The long developmental process will bring a heavy burden of parenting for females, which requires naked apes to form a more stable spouse relationship to complete the nurturing of the next generation. In order to ensure that this goal can be achieved, nature seems to give the naked ape stronger sexual stimulation as compensation. Even in the social structure of naked apes where multiple spouses are allowed, the vast majority of members still adopt a one-to-one monogamy relationship due to the high cost of parenting . From the perspective of species, reproduction is the biggest mission. In this process, ""sex"" plays an extremely important role. The sexual behavior of naked apes is typically different from other 192 species of apes. The females of other apes do not seem to have an orgasm, and the sexual intercourse process is often extremely short, usually only lasting 15 times. The estrus period of females is also very short, they often leave immediately after the end of sexual intercourse, ready for the next sexual act at any time, so as not to miss the precious opportunity for fertilization. The female of the naked ape will continue to lie down to rest after the sexual intercourse is completed, immersed in the aftermath of a certain orgasm. Not only that, except for a few periods, the sexual activity of naked apes is almost unaffected. This means that even during pregnancy, female naked apes can still meet the sexual needs of male naked apes, thereby enhancing the mate relationship. The strengthening of sexual stimulation will bring about another problem, that is, when the spouses are separated, there must be a mechanism to inhibit the sexual behavior of naked apes, otherwise the social structure of monogamy will be destroyed. This is for raising the next generation. It was almost a devastating blow. The most obvious measure is to cover the fig leaf. The genitals and sexual behavior must be covered up and become a kind of extremely important privacy. The cold protection effect of clothing is not revealed until the naked ape goes out of the tropics. In addition, there are other means, such as to cover secondary sexual characteristics, shaving the child, such as armpit hair shave; remove the smell of the body; prohibition of physical contact. Naked apes need to strengthen the sexual stimulation between their spouses on the one hand, and weaken the sexual stimulation between non-mates on the one hand, so as to maintain the stability of monogamy and ensure that the cooperative relationship of the entire social structure is not destroyed. Some science fiction novels make some bold conjectures, such as: baby farms, social behavior, selective sterilization, and division of labor. For now, these behaviors are contrary to the biological instincts of naked apes. If they are implemented on a large scale one day, it can almost be concluded that the social structure and lifestyle of naked apes will undergo unimaginable changes, and the impact of changes in sexual and parenting behavior will be extremely profound. "" Among the existing 4237 mammals, almost no animal can be found suitable for survival without fur. Mammals are different from their reptile ancestors. They have an unparalleled advantage in their physiological characteristics. They can maintain a constant comparison. High body temperature. This makes the delicate machine with physiological functions suitable for efficient operation. This attribute is neither easily damaged nor easily abandoned. The body's thermostat is extremely important. Thicker, hairy and insulated The epidermis obviously plays an important role in preventing heat loss. Under strong sunlight, it can also prevent high body temperature and prevent direct sun burns to the skin. Therefore, if body hair is to fall off, obviously there must be a very good reason To give it up. Apart from a few rare exceptions, mammals acquired a new medium in evolution after referral to take this drastic step change. Flying mammals, such as bats, were forced to remove their body hair on both wings, but the body hair of other parts was still preserved, so they cannot be included as a nude species. Several burrowing mammals have greatly reduced body hair, such as voles, aardvarks, and armadillos. Aquatic mammals, such as whales, dolphins, mermaids, manatees, and seahorses, also lose their body hair as their bodies become streamlined. However, for all typical mammals that live on the surface, whether it is an animal jumping on the ground or an animal climbing on plants, the densely covered skin is an inevitable law. Except for the unusually large rhinoceros and elephants (which have special problems with their heat preservation and cooling mechanisms), naked apes are unique mammals without body hair . "" If we study humans from a biological point of view , ignore the fact that we are humans, and try our best to adopt a relatively objective attitude to study humans as animals. In fact, many interesting new ideas will be obtained. These biological insights may enable us to better understand many social phenomena. "" We know that the climate has undergone unfavorable changes. By about 15 million years ago, the scale of their forest fortresses dropped sharply. The ancestors of monkeys were forced to do two things. One of the two must be one of them: or they still defend the forest. The dilapidated hometown, or bravely faced the fate of being expelled from the Garden of Eden as the Bible says. Chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons and orangutans remained in the woods, and their numbers have been declining ever since. There is only another kind that exists apes - naked ape ancestors blaze a way out of it. they withdraw into the forest wilderness, engaged in fierce competition, the oath has been highly adaptable animal life on the ground is assessed by this risky step, but it is the outcome of evolution. In short, this adventure has been greatly rewarded. "" Even during the careful evolution of organisms . Also experienced several important adventures . These risky decisions influence so far-reaching, it determines the millions of years later, his race would die out , or will evolve into more advanced species . ""The predatory ancient apes are basically a group of males. Females are busy raising children and cannot take the main role in hunting prey. As the complexity of hunting increases, the time for hunting gradually increases, and it is necessary to abandon ancestors drifting and migrating. Lifestyle. Therefore, a fixed residence is needed to bring the prey back to the fixed base. Females and cubs wait at home for the males to return from hunting and share food. The step of fixing the residence will be seen in later chapters. , And will have a profound impact on all aspects of today’s most perfectly developed apes. "" As early human Australopithecus social division of labor during the formation of straight to this day , still a profound impact on our society. In family life, the man primarily responsible for the provision of social resources , to feed the family. While women are primarily responsible for providing resources , to breed and raise offspring. To this day, our tendency to choose a spouse basically follows this line of thinking. Men are eager to marry young, beautiful women , which implies that she has a strong ability to reproduce. Women desire to marry rich and loyal men, which means that they have the will and ability to provide a favorable living environment for themselves and their offspring. "" Fundamentally, we originated from a carnivore in the primate order. Among the existing monkeys and apes, our evolution is very unique. But this evolutionary change is not uncommon among animals of other subjects. For example, the giant panda is an animal that has completely transformed in evolution. This example is exquisite. We have changed from a vegetarian animal to a carnivore, while the giant panda has changed from a carnivore to a vegetarian animal. Just like us. The giant panda is an incomparable and very unique animal. One important thing is that the animal created by this violent transformation has a dual personality. Once it crosses the threshold between the two species, it plunges into its new role. Moving forward with great evolutionary energy-it has become too fast, so it still carries many original qualities. The time for evolution is not sufficient, it is too late to get rid of all the original features, just put on the surface features in a hurry. When primitive fish have just overcome the water-free obstacles in their terrestrial life, their terrestrial animal qualities have evolved by leaps and bounds, but they still embrace the characteristics of aquatic animals. To complete a perfect and dramatic new species, it will take millions of years. The pioneers who walk in the front are usually bizarre mixed animals. The naked ape is just such a mixed four different elephants. His entire body and the lifestyle of the pond are suitable for arboreal life, but suddenly (the so-called sudden is from the slow evolutionary process), he was thrown into a completely different world. "" "" Carnivores give birth to fleas, but primates do not. Monkeys and apes are plagued by lice and are also infected with some parasitic diseases. However, contrary to popular belief, they are not fleas at all; therefore, there are A very convincing reason. To understand this, we must first examine the life cycle of the flea. When a flea lays eggs, it does not lay on the host, but in the sleeping home of the host. The flea eggs hatch after 3 days. Wriggling little maggots. These larvae do not suck blood, but live on the dust collected in their dens. After another two weeks, the larvae cocoon and pupate. The pupae become adults after resting in the cocoon for about half a month and emerge from the cocoon. Find a suitable host. It can be seen that at least during the first month of its life cycle, the flea is separated from its host. Obviously, mammals that do not settle down, such as monkeys or apes, are not troubled by fleas. This is the reason. Even if one or two fleas accidentally land on a primate and successfully mate, the eggs they lay cannot be taken away by the primate because the primate is constantly migrating. When the flea pupae emerge from the cocoon, there will be no host waiting for them ""at home"", maintaining the host and guest relationship with them. Therefore, fleas are parasites of animals in fixed dwellings. For example, typical carnivores are such animals. "" "" First of all, the naked ape sense organs are not suitable for life on the ground. His sense of smell is too weak, his ears keen enough. His physique is too weak to withstand the grueling endurance test experience, not to break out like thunder lightning sprint, This weakness is irreparable. In terms of personality, he is more competitive, not more cooperative, and he is undoubtedly not good at planning and focusing. Fortunately, his brain is extremely good. In general intelligence, he surpassed his rival carnivore. With the help of walking upright, he has transformed both his hands and feet; through further improvements in his brain and dedicated use of the brain, he may be successful. "" "" If we look at a typical monkey fetus, we will be able to understand the most profoundly why the juvenile persistence mechanism contributes to the development and development of the primate brain. The brain during the fetal period of the monkey develops rapidly, growing up and becoming complex. The baby monkey is born. , Its brain has reached 70% of the mature brain. The remaining 30% are fully developed in the first 6 months after birth. Even chimpanzee babies with higher intelligence have brain development within 12 months after birth Be completed. Our species is in sharp contrast to this. The brain volume of a baby at birth is only 23% of that of an adult. During the 6 years after birth, children’s brains continue to develop rapidly, but the entire developmental period of the human brain can only be completed at about 23 years of age. This shows that for you and me, after sexual maturity, brain development will continue for 10 years. However, for chimpanzees, brain development has been completed for six or seven years before reproductive capacity becomes active. "" "" Infant monkeys and chimpanzees also like to play, explore, and are creative, but they die soon at this stage. However, for naked apes, these infancy characteristics will continue until they mature. In adulthood. He has enough time to imitate and learn all the techniques designed by his ancestors. In terms of physique and instinct, he has many shortcomings as a hunter. However, his intelligence and imitating ability can make up for its shortcomings and More than enough. The way and depth he accepts his parents' teaching is beyond the reach of any other animal. "" In the flesh, humans do not have the advantage of competing with large carnivores. But the reason why we can get to this point. Mainly rely on the wisdom of individuals is superb , and the organization of social groups. "
212,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2094984-weston,5,"""The Naked Ape"" is remarkable. It embodies precisely the type of popular-science literature I love to read: the matter-of-fact pointing out of things which, having been pointed out, seem totally obvious, as if Desmond Morris were just reciting things I already knew but hadn't gotten around to actually realizing yet. His observations run that gamut of what he terms ""typical"" human behavior and physiology. That is, at the time of this book's writing (as now) anthropologists and sociologists commonly made the atypical specimens and their behaviors the focus of their studies. Were other scientists engaged in the study of lifeforms to do similarly they would never get anywhere. Perhaps out of vanity, perhaps out of a lack of self-awareness, science has historically avoided turning its objective eye toward the scientist (obvious and irrelevant exceptions of medical science excluded). Luckily for us, Desmond Morris undertook this endeavor and his findings are not only fascinating but wildly entertaining.A great deal of the pleasure derived from this book is in the way that Morris so ruthlessly picks apart his subject. The book's title itself is a playful and astutely humbling jab at the subject which drives straight to the heart of his message: human beings are first and foremost animals. Apes, to be precise, and our principal distinguishing feature, from a zoological standpoint, from our ape cousins is no more than our lack of a shaggy coat. We may drive around in fancy cars, work in skyscrapers, level mountains, dam rivers, etc. At the end of the day, we're still a bunch of naked apes. Which isn't to say that we aren't members of an incredibly resourceful and clever species, fascinating from all angles and fascinated by all things. Because we are unique, we are remarkable. Still, it is no more than gross vanity that makes us suppose that our manipulation of the external environment or the complexity and ingeniousness of our cultural expression has enabled us to overcome the fact that we are ""still very much a biological phenomenon... subject to all the basic laws of animal behavior.""Morris arms his reader with a new arsenal of cocktail party factoids, some endearing, some disgusting, some depressing, others hilarious, which alone make the read worthwhile. For instance, the size and shape of human breasts suggest that they have developed, through many centuries of sexual selection, as sexual signaling devices rather than merely as organs used to feed infants. That is, human breasts are actually not very good feeding devices when compared to those of other apes. The nipple typically isn't shaped to fit easily into the infant mouth and the excess tissue around it can even obstruct the baby's breathing. And yet breasts are universally used to spectacular success in piquing the interest of potential mates and, it could go without saying, play an enormous secondary role in human intercourse, behavior which is seen nowhere else in the animal kingdom. The evolutionary reasons for this development, believe it or not, are fascinatingly and intimately woven into our ancestors struggle for survival as the first carnivorous apes on the ancient plains of Africa.Having been first published in the 60's, ""Naked Ape"" is somewhat outdated. Morris' characterization of indigenous societies as atypical cultural failures makes sense from the coldly zoological perspective from which he was attempting to write, but fails to take into consideration historical truths which invite explanations beyond a socities' supposed lack of functionality. Modern readers will be equally squeamish by the occasional reference made to the ""negroid race"" and the interpretation of homosexuality as little more than deviant behavior caused by abnormal childhood experiences. Present day sensitivities aside, Morris is nevertheless quite forward-thinking and the intellectual merits of the book by far exceed whatever flags might be raised by your inner-p.c. reactionary.As entertaining a book as it is, Morris' tone and message is ultimately one of apocalyptic foreboding. We naked apes have been so spectacularly successful as a species that we have come to think of ourselves as invincible and we are not. Our success will, sooner rather than later, catch up with us because the global economy of environmental resources is, after all, finite. The modern reader will recognize all too well that the book's imperative rings even truer today, despite Morris' having to sound like a fanatic at the time of its initial publishing. Ironically, Morris suggests, the naked ape's first step toward salvation will be the recognition of his true nature. To go forward we have to take an honest look at where we came from."

The invention of tools being so men could hunt; walking upright so men could see over grass; learning to talk so men could communicate complex hunting strategies; the loss of fur so men wouldn't die of heatstroke running in the hot African climate, etc.And the women? Oh, they just evolved to be child-rearers and home-makers. They sat around in caves suckling their babes like mama wolves in their dens with cubs (never mind that real mother wolves are out of the den in weeks, and often dump their pups on a babysitter as soon as they possibly can) waiting with baited breath for the menfolk to come home and share the spoils of the hunt with them.And all the physical features early female hominids not covered by his ""male hunting"" explanation? Like female hominid larger breasts, wider birthing hips, hominids developing downward facing noses, etc? Oh, they just evolved to ""make sex sexier."" (I'm not kidding. That's what it says in the book.) Female hominids have larger breasts than other greater apes? It's because the males found it sexy. Female hominids have wider hips? Males found it sexy. Downward facing noses? Same thing. Homo sapiens have fuller lips than other greater apes? Because it made kissing sexier, and kissing is a great evolutionary foreplay to sex.The minute I stopped reading was when Desmond Morris claimed that (white) homo sapiens having pink lips because it gave them a pouty kissable look, thus making them look more kissable, thus more desirable as a mate. And what of certain black Africans who tend to have enough melanin in their skin not to have pink lips, and/or have fuller, puffier lips? According to Desmond Morris, it's because they're evolutionary failures who had to evolve fuller lips to make up for not having the desired pink lips that more evolutionary successful (white) homo sapiens possess. (Which, according to him, are like those living in North America. Not the ""obscure"" cultures in Africa that are ""not as evolutionary successful,"" his words. Never mind that white 'North American' culture as we know it has only existed for a few centuries at most, and hasn't withstood the test of time the way the 'obscure' African cultures have, which have stood for centuries, if not millennia.) This book is a transparent straight white male ego stroke, where a guy who fancies himself ""rational"" and ""objective"" breaks his arm patting himself, as a straight white male homo sapien, on the back for being ""an evolutionary success."" According to him, EVERY SINGLE physiological trait of the entire modern homo sapien species came from (presumably white) men of eons past being big strong hunters. Women and people of color were just hanger-ons who reaped the evolutionary benefits of the past (presumably) straight white male hunters' ingenuity. And every trait females have that males (presumably) don't is because the males found it sexy, or it aided in bearing the males' children. And every trait that people of color have that whites don't was formed to compensate the ""evolutionary disadvantage"" of not being white.Also, I took a few anthropology classes in community college. Almost every point he ever made has been largely disproven, or called into serious question. Fuck this guy, fuck this book. The fact that people still read this sexist, racist drivel and see it as anything resembling fact is frankly insulting to the whole homo sapien species."

Virtually no aspect of human nature and physiognomy escapes his keen zoologist eyes; even responses such as smiling, laughing and crying. However, be warned: not only is this book nearly 50 years old and therefore outdated, but one must ingest his words with a large heaping of salt. As a scientific treatise it fails. The best way to read it is to consider this the personal musings of a biologist/anthropologist, not the findings of an expert researcher. It's greatest value is in instigating thought on the subject. It is the step-back-and look-at-ourselves approach which is of real value here, not his (sometimes hilarious)conclusions.His explanation of the protuberance and shape of female breasts developing as a frontal sexual display resulting from our upright posture, rather than for increased efficiency of nursing, is presented as a credible argument. Mmm, maybe that explains the human male's fascination with them.Most of his observations are comparative, highlighting similarities and differences between other mammals, notably the chimpanzee. In all cases, Morris makes us think about many aspects of ourselves that we normally take for granted.One criticism I have is his over-emphasis on genetic origins - for example, he claims the pair-bond formation between sexes (i.e monogamy) is genetic rather than cultural - afraid I disagree there. Also his treatment of warfare is incomplete and not entirely satisfactory for me.I know others will attack the author as chauvinistic (not only in regards the sexes, but cultures as well), but still, hey, the book can just be considered food for thought.All in all, a stimulating read, one so rich that I have marked it for a second time around in the future. It helped me to come up with my own thoughts on the subject"
216,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4373676-jonathan-david-jackson,5,"Really a very interesting book. It's written as if the author were writing it about any other animal, and hearing myself talked about as if I am a naked mole rat or a chimpanzee is very refreshing (this doesn't give you permission to refer to me as such in polite society, btw). We are animals as much as any other, and we should consider all the things that make us what we are, including our animal instincts and our biological history.There are some ideas I think are odd, for example when he says that adults want to save elephants from extinction mainly because of our own impending individual extinction (death). Some things seem like just his opinion, and don't make sense to me. All the ideas, though - every single one - I found to be interesting. There were plenty of things I'd heard before (after all, it's a 40 year old book), but there were also plenty of things I hadn't heard which were totally new to me, and made me reconsider some of my own ideas. One such idea I have is that clothes are something unnatural, something to be avoided. He puts it to us that humans are a very sexual species, unlike other animals which have a mating season we are ready all the time, and unlike other animals which need to do something special to display their genitals ours are visible all the time, so to avoid making sexual displays to everyone all the time, we cover up. I've thought about most of my opinions long and hard for many years, and reading anything that makes me consider changing them is a rare and wonderful experience which had me turning each page almost in awe at what I had found before and might find after.I have the other two books in this series, and I can't wait to read them next."
217,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180947-j,3,"Desmond Morris raises some interesting points in this book, some more farfetched than others. Honestly, I have problems with a lot of the points he makes in this book. Attempting to explain everything we do by comparing us to our nearest relatives in the animal kingdom is like I said interesting but the truth is many of our behaviors are unique to our species because of our advanced intellect and I think simplifying them by saying they can be explained by looking at the behaviors of other primates is not entirely accurate. Furthermore, he makes a few mistakes I wouldn't expect anyone familiar with biology to make (including the 'tongue-map' for taste recognition) as well as taking a very eurocentric stance on human behavior. His postulations aren't really backed up with anything more than the observation of other primates which by itself can't really be used to explain our behavior. Along with his insistance on using North Americans and Europeans as the model for humanity, I have to say that this book is more rooted in speculation than fact and shouldn't be taken seriously as a work of science. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining read and worthy of the 3 stars I gave it."
218,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027404-david-o-brien,5,"Fascinating reading and life affirming in an unexpected way. The most common complaint about this book is lack of evidence or proof. Morris states clearly that he did not list all the evidence because it would turn the book into an encyclopedia. There is a bibliography at the end for those who want to see where he got his information and inspiration.The style of the book is not purely scientific in so far as he he makes assumptions and draws conclusions from his own experience and his research, which makes for very interesting reading, however can be interpreted as imprecise. Just because something is not 100% proven, that does not mean that it is not interesting, relevant, thought provoking or inspirational. Throughout the book there are segments I might not wholly agree with, however the scope of the book is so vast yet still well tied together and coherent that it deserves 5/5. A brave book that even today is refreshing, educational, inspiring and a break from convention."
219,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763793-jean,3,"I disagree with those who say this book is homophobic and/or misogynistic. Morris says some things that in normal conversational context might be dubbed as such, but his explicit purpose was to view mans behavior from an objective standpoint. He succeeds. Political correctness has no place in (even attempted) scientific writing. He DOES state that gay couples cannot procreate on their own. However he goes on to discuss scenarios where this may be a pro. Don't overreact. When I read this book, I was unaware it was written decades ago. Morris' observations were fairly elementary to me, I assume since I grew up hearing a good deal of them. It is still quite enjoyable to read despite my experience. "

The author adopts a super-alpha-male stance and women have only evolved because it served men. Don't you think they did anything other than having children!! Morris thinks that working is today's form of hunting and women obviously have no place there. also, male relaxing can only ever happen with an all male group. There are some interesting parts though, I loved the chapter about grooming and fighting (sad to see that he left out the vastly different way men and women fight, but oh, I forgot, women don't)."
221,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5155466-clare,2,"I found this book to be very disappointing. Morris makes some interesting statements about human behavior, but unfortunately, he has almost nothing that could be called evidence for anything that he poses as fact. Although at first I thought I might be unfairly judging it because his sexual politics differ from mine and his understanding of human sexuality is dated to say the least, his statements on non-sex-related behaviors are equally unsupported."

231,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,3,"Objective SummaryThis book explores the evolution, biology, psychology, and sociology of human beings. Morris refers to humans as the “naked ape” in an attempt to remove his cultural and experiential biases from his analysis, and to remind his readers that they, like all humans, are just evolved animals. Morris attempts to objectively describe human beings’ features, behavior, and the reasons for both in the same way a zoologist would describe any newly discovered species. The defining characteristic about human beings is our intelligence. But that intelligence is mapped crudely onto base animalistic tendencies and necessities. Rather than jumping straight to our intelligence, which may cloud important but elementary observations, Morris refers to us as the “naked ape,” a statement on our physical appearance as nearly hairless primates. Despite any attempts to ignore or transcend our animal roots, they persist. Morris explores human evolution, sex, child rearing, exploration, fighting, feeding, pursuit of comfort, and interaction with other animals. Listed below are some of the main lessons and interesting tidbits.•	Humans evolved from monkeys and apes. We moved from forests to the plains, though one theory suggests we moved from forests to seaside coasts to the plains. •	We moved from a vegetarian to an omnivore diet when we left the forest. This required cooperative hunting and defensive parties of males within the social hierarchy. This cooperation could now be a contributing factor to the development of gangs and wars.•	Neoteny, or extension of childhood development, played a significant role in human evolution. It allowed the human brain to continue to develop and grow for decades after birth, and it required pair-bonding between males and females to support the extended adolescence of their offspring. •	Pair-bonding helped females remain faithful to their mates, it reduced social friction between males over mating access, and it helped in rearing the slow-developing children. Pair-bonding is powerful but imperfect. The female orgasm, which is unusual if not unique to humans, was a contributor to pair-bonding. •	Why humans are relatively hairless isn’t known with certainty. The most popular theory is that it aids cooling during times of extreme exertion, like hunting. •	Much of our appearance is sexual signaling. Relatively large penises and breasts, red lips, and hairlessness all likely have sexual origins. Pubic and armpit hair likely trap pheromones for sexual arousal. •	80% of mothers hold infants in their left arms most likely because their heartbeat soothes their young.•	Animals fight to establish the dominance hierarchy and defend territory. They do not use their weapons to try to kill members of their own species because that would not be evolutionarily advantageous. Successful species establish aggressive and submissive displays that can substitute for actual physical confrontation and reduce physical harm and death. Bowing and avoiding eye contact are submissive signs. Standing tall and direct eye contact are dominant or aggressive signs. •	Human weaponry permits fatal action from afar. Our inability to observe submissive signals may contribute to additional killing and destruction. •	Curiosity serves a vital function to an opportunistic species. It has led humans to discover new lands, invent new tools, and try new foods. Curiosity has expanded into arts, science, and technology. There is a perpetual balance between novelty and familiarity. We want the excitement of the former with the security of the latter. By pushing the boundaries and exploring, we discover new and better ways to feed, protect, and comfort ourselves. •	Human desire for sweet foods can lead to obesity.•	Humans domesticated dozens of species of animals for food (cows, chickens, goats, pigs), companionship (dogs, cats, horses), transportation (horses, camels, elephants), experimentation (mice, rats, guinea pigs), and other tasks like plowing and hauling heavy stuff (horses, donkeys, oxen). •	Dogs were likely domesticated when we took wolf pups to fatten them up for food. Then we realized they could help us hunt and alert us to danger. There are breeds of dogs that are herders, scent-trackers, setters and pointers to prey, retrievers, killers of vermin, and guard dogs.•	Animals have five basic relationships with other animals: prey, symbiont, competitor, parasite, and predator.•	Religion may have roots in the need for an ultimately powerful being at the top of a hierarchy.•	12,000 British kids listed their favorite animals as: 1. Chimpanzee, 2. Monkey, 3. Horse, 4. Bushbaby, 5. Panda, 6. Bear, 7. Elephant, 8. Lion, 9. Dog, 10. Giraffe. They tend to have anthropomorphic features like sitting or moving upright and having highly expressive faces.•	12,000 British kids listed their most hated animals as: 1. Snake, 2. Spider, 3. Crocodile, 4. Lion, 5. Rat, 6. Skunk, 7. Gorilla, 8. Rhinoceros, 9. Hippopotamus, 10. Tiger. These are all dangerous. •	To survive as a civilization and a species, we must recognize and submit to our biological features. They cannot all be overcome through thought, culture, or technology. Subjective ThoughtsI read this book because the dude in the movie “Bring It On” was reading it during a high school football game. It was interesting and thought-provoking, but much of the content seemed familiar. That makes sense since I am a naked ape and have interacted with them all my life. And I think much of this material was covered in my biology textbooks back in the day.It was impossible for me to miss how much a product of its time this book was. Written in 1967, Morris was only five years removed from the Cuban missile crisis, and nuclear annihilation was clearly on his mind. He also harbored Malthusian fears of continued population growth, resource strain, and territorial strife. He anticipated the Ehrlichs’ “Population Bomb,” which would be published one year later. He seemed quite pessimistic on both the nuclear annihilation and overpopulation fronts. If he were to update the book today, he’d no doubt include global cooling, I mean global warming, errr global climate change in his list of calamities. Fortunately, as I type this, nukes haven’t dropped in anger since ’45, Trump may be in the process of solving Korea, reproduction rates have slowed across the developed world and sometimes below replacement levels, and there are alternative albeit expensive energy sources. Not that I’m worried enough about any of this to shut off the air conditioner or my computer. And this Honeycrisp apple from Walmart is amazing. Morris should also update his advice on how to handle being pulled over by police. His suggestion is to immediately leave your car and approach the officer so that you two don’t interact on “your” territory near your car, which will make the officer feel threatened. That shit will get you shot today. Stay in your car with your hands on the wheel, and wait to move until you’re told. You don’t want to suddenly approach someone with a Glock 17 on standby.Memorable Quotes“A solitary monkey or ape is a vulnerable creature. It lacks the powerful natural weapons of the carnivore and in isolation falls easy prey to the stalking killers.”“It is only a wise primate, like our hunting ape, that knows its own father.”“The male reaches the consummatory act of sperm ejaculation within a few minutes in most cases, unless deliberate delaying tactics are employed. . . . Some females may reach this point very quickly, others not at all, but on the average it is attained between ten and twenty minutes after the start of copulation.”“Its normal, average length of nine and a half centimetres is increased by seven to eight centimetres. The diameter is also considerably increased, giving the species the largest erect penis of any living primate.”“After a gestation period of approximately 266 days her uterus begins to contract powerfully and rhythmically.”“The average weight of a baby at birth is just over seven pounds, which is slightly more than one-twentieth of the weight of the average parent.”“Lucky is the society that enjoys the gradual acquisition of a perfect balance between imitation and curiosity, between slavish, unthinking copying and progressive, rational experimentation.”“In all exploratory behaviour, whether artistic or scientific, there is the ever-present battle between the neophilic and neophobic urges. The former drives us on to new experiences, makes us crave for novelty. The latter holds us back, makes us take refuge in the familiar. We are constantly in a state of shifting balance between the conflicting attractions of the exciting new stimulus and the friendly old one. If we lost our neophilia we would stagnate. If we lost our neophobia, we would rush headlong into disaster.”“We are, to put it mildly, in a mess, and there is a strong chance that we shall have exterminated ourselves by the end of the century.”“Animals fight amongst themselves for one of two very good reasons: either to establish their dominance in a social hierarchy, or to establish their territorial rights over a particular piece of ground.” “If a species is to survive, it simply cannot afford to go around slaughtering its own kind. Intra-specific aggression has to be inhibited and controlled, and the more powerful and savage the prey-killing weapons of a particular species are, the stronger must be the inhibitions about using them to settle disputes with rivals.”“To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion. Abortion is a drastic measure and can involve serious emotional disturbance. Furthermore, once a zygote has been formed by the act of fertilization it constitutes a new individual member of society, and its destruction is, in effect, an act of aggression, which is the very pattern of behaviour that we are attempting to control. Contraception is obviously preferable, and any religious or other ‘moralizing’ factions that oppose it must face the fact that they are engaged in dangerous war-mongering.”“We each possess about 10,000 of these taste buds, but in old age they deteriorate and decrease in number, hence the jaded palate of the elderly gastronome. Surprisingly, we can only respond to four basic tastes. They are: sour, salt, bitter, and sweet.”“Domestication of livestock, involving the organized control and selective breeding of prey, is known to have been practised for at least ten thousand years and, in certain cases, probably much longer. Goats, sheep and reindeer appear to have been the earliest prey species dealt with in this way.”“It is probable that [an interspecific bond between humans and dogs] began as a result of young puppies being brought in to the tribal home base to be fattened as food.”“Unless we can colonize other planets on a massive scale and spread the load, or seriously check our population increase in some way, we shall, in the not-too-far distant future, have to remove all other forms of life from the earth. . . . We need not dwell on this nightmare: the possibility of its becoming a reality is remote.”"
232,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62596158-n-g-habsburg,3,"I enjoyed reading this (it's written in quite an amusing style) but I was hoping for something more heavy on the primatology. While it's a good review of instinctive human behaviour it is expectionally light into actual comparisons to other primates.He does make interesting points, e.g. noting that when the forests started to disappear we converged towards carnivore traits but by using artificial weapons rather than natural ones we did not need to move towards becoming like cats/dogs (though he doesn't note that other plains primates probably did so more than us). He notes the importance of us acquiring home bases where the females were left, and hence the need to develop more clear territories, pair bonds and ability to share food with family/tribe.He talks about how adolescents acquite the need to go off and develop their own home. But here he doesn't spend any time discussing what's actually known about how humans do this. It's actually remarkable how variable this is across different societies (albeit it generally has fixed form within a society). Sometimes it it the male, sometimes the female. These are generally species fixed traits, and yet he doesn't cover this.He talks about how the development of a pair bond meant that we needed to start hiding our sexual features in public. He notes that other species generally sustain the pair bond through aggression, but we do it instead by wearing clothes and avoiding touching each other.It's quite an old book and features some exceptional examples of envirionmentalist (e.g. blank slate) thinking from the era it was written, which is somewhat startling in a book which otherwise fully acknowledges that we are creatures driven by innate behaviours. For instance, he talks about how if a mother is tense and smiles to conceil it, the baby will detect it and mistake the function of a smile... he then warns that this could be permanently damaging and cause the child serious social difficulties... nuttier environmentalist claptrap than that is only spewed forth by modern SJWs but I guess it was par for the course back then. The section on music and it's relation to mothers heart beat is similarly whacko.A section of the book deals with our innate sounds/actions, e.g. laughter and smiling. Discussion about how they evolved is perhaps questionable. Notes things like when a baby smiles it waves it's arms and legs around, and suggests this is the vestigial primate clinging response. There's also curious little factoids, like our 'sweet tooth' being a distinct primate thing that other carnivores don't generally have.An interesting section is when he talks about how men go along to trade unions, social clubs , learned societies etc as an equivilent of the hunting pack. They do so to experience our built in bond from male togetherness. Interestingly, this was written before it became taboo to go to male only societies. One suspects that the author would not thus be suprised that membership of all voluntary societies has utterly collapsed since women were permitted to join them (see Putnam's 'Bowling Alone'). He also describes how work is probably a poor substitute for hunting for the working classes in a manner that it is not for the middle class. Expresses it in a manner that is probably illegal these days.A key point the author wants to get across in the book is that we're going through a population boom and being forced into living in environments increasingly more crowded and distrinct from what we evolved for. He talks about how the modern usage of soulless featureless architecture where everything looks the same flys against our built in desire to mark territory as our own through personalisation (declaring quite rightly that modern architects are terrorists). He is sceptical about the ability of us to adapt our innate behaviour. On that, he is probably correct. He could have argued his case better (and I believe that in his next book he went on to do so). "
233,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13626166-siddarth-gore,5,"So there he stands, our vertical, hunting, weapon-toting, territorial, neotenous, brainy, Naked Ape, a primate by ancestry and a carnivore by adoption, ready to conquer the world.We evolved from apes. But exactly how far did we get? Your guesses might be way off the mark. This book says that under the surface we are ruled mostly by our inner primates. Things just look different on us. Evolution is too slow a process for us to have shed our animal past.In our species there is, as we have seen, a strong tendency to ‘fall in love’—to develop a powerful bond with the object of our sexual attentions.No primates are monogamous so why are we? The answer comes from our adaptation to life on the plains of Africa once we were thrown out of the jungle perhaps due to environmental changes. Hint, pack hunters need cooperation from all males.They occur with particularly high frequency during the initial stages of social encounters, where hidden fears and aggressions are lurking just below the surface. At a dinner party, or any small social gathering, as soon as the mutual appeasement ceremonies of hand-shaking and smiling are over, displacement cigarettes, displacement drinks and displacement food-snacks are immediately offered.This was the most fascinating part. Monkeys and apes are very much social animals with hierarchy being most crucial thing on their minds. How did we get rid of that, or did we? Even the most innocuous conversations and meetings are anything but that for your social relations obsessed brain. To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion.His argument is that cramming animals in compact spaces invariably leads to aggression. We might think we are special but think again. Only way to make sure we do not turn against each other is to give everyone enough space. Debatable, but interesting viewpoint none the less.Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else.One can only hope ;-)"
234,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98103014-jonas,4,"This book was first published in 1967 and I found it to be somewhat of a foreboding book.I was first introduced into many of these concepts regarding “the naked ape’s” ecological role and behaviour from other books, such as Ishmael by Daniel Quinn and The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. Though those books are written about something else, I found myself thinking of those books while I was reading this one. Many of the arguments presented in those books could be paralleled with the comparative elements between the human and ape presented throughout this book.Each chapter though succinct, presents an interesting perspective on the anatomy of the human body, as well as our behavioural aspects against the bodies and social practices of other ape species. I thought many of the ideas were very inventive, but the chapter on sex comes across as crass and salacious, but otherwise, the book presents itself in a very tame manner.Whilst the book contains many fantastic ideas, I can see why this book created controversy within the feminist/homosexual communities. The book even manages to squeeze in a supporting message for contraceptives and population control. Overall, I think the book makes for an interesting read, but is by no means the best book regarding the topic especially in modern day, due to changing of the zeitgeist from the late 1960’s to the prevalence of technology today (even though some of the fears might still be present today). Despite that, I still think it’s worth a read to understand how it was relevant at that time, and how it has paved a way and introduced the idea of comparative ethology to the general public."
235,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705775-gerardo-alonso,4,"The Naked Ape is a mirror. While reading it, one sees a reflection of oneself. But unlike many other reflections, this one is raw and based on our biological characteristics. This reflection breaks down our egos and social constructs to their bare bones. Desmond Morris attempts to show humanity that we are merely a species of the Animal KingdomI found the book inspiring, and highly effective to understand characteristic behaviours we may have. It feels as if someone is saying what one has already known but could not figure out the words to explain it.While this book is very powerful philosophically, I think it lacks thoroughness in logic. One of the things that concerns me is that it seems to me that Morris takes a one-sided view of several arguments sometimes based on factoids/opinions that may debatable. Another difficulty I find is the ease of comparison between the Homo Sapiens and the apes. While true that we share a very similar DNA structure, I think that Morris not only tries to link biological similarities (which he does in a great way in the beginning of the book), but also behavioural similarities.I get that in some cases or themes, the behaviour among species will be the same. The fight or flight response, for example. But when highly specific social interactions are compared between species, Morris should have analysed the Naked Ape by itself.It may be the case that some of the science behind the book is outdated, since this was published in the 60s. Regardless of the leaps Morris takes, this book is worth reading as a biology, anthropology and history lesson of our species. "
236,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"I had a great time reading this book. Despite coming out almost fifty years ago when I found it, much of what it says is still thought provoking and relevant. The book owes a little bit to psychoanalysis which was more dominant at the time. Which is good since Morris uses it to good effect to tie together physiological and behavioral facts into a general theory of human nature. What is that theory of human nature? Well, that we are the way we are because our ancestors were forced to become a predator species/hunting-ape and couldn't stay in and around trees picking fruits. Millions of years ago in Africa, during the Miocene, the forests started to disappear, and the apes could either cling onto whatever was left, or leave the ""garden of Eden"" and enter into competition with the predators on the ground. Ape populations have dwindled since, and we have emerged the apex predator. To get to that point we had to overcome the other predators, but with inferior equipment so to speak; no fangs or claws. So we made use of two things carried over to a certain degree from our ape past; intelligence and social communication. ""His whole body, his way of life, was geared to a forest existence, and then suddenly he was jettisoned into a world where he could survive only if he began to live like a brainy, weapon toting wolf."" Our social lives are to this day built on a sort of tension between social communication and intellect (from ape life) and group loyalty and hunting from our predator existence. Vestiges of our ape life are our greater reliance on sight at the expense of smell and a more various taste palate. Our predator life involves traveling greater distances to find game, rather than remaining close to the trees, having a home base to protect and return to, and having regular meals rather than momentary snacking. Being a predatory ape means developing ways to facilitate male cooperation, to hunt together with dangerous weapons, and to guarantee a share of the kills and a female for the effort. Monogamy and private property likely arise from a need to secure the loyalty of males to females and children while they hunted and prevent conflict among the males. This isn't all bad, as the predator life means some degree of male solidarity. We can't have a single alpha male who gets exclusive access to women and food. The ability to cooperate and use weapon technology means the lesser males can gang up and resist, limit, or kill the alpha male. Thus some satisfactory distribution of females and resources becomes necessary for social order, and this is likely where marriage and property and even government developed from. Morris channels Sigmund Freud and argues that religion emerges from the guilt of (symbolically) killing the alpha ape. Even with all his faults, an all powerful male does instill some sort of order and security which is socially useful. You knew where you stood, and the alpha ape in a way encouraged exogamous mating, preventing incest by kicking the sons out of the harem. So religion projects the seemingly omnipotent alpha ape onto the cosmos, extending its influence to our personal lives without actually being here. There are several downsides that ape life has: lack of cooperation (among males), a pecking order with one individual on top, and less incentive to control nature. Ape and monkey society is more about competition and dominance, and dependent on nature providing food for the picking. Depending on the environment means not traveling too far and remaining close, thus reducing the need for defense of home as well as needing to know what others are up to as they aren't far. If we just forage for food, there isn't a need to cooperate. It's ""finders keepers"", and so dominance becomes more important. The alpha male gets the first pick, and so long as everybody abides conflict can be avoided, with little need to work together other than staying out of the big guy's way. Despite all these downsides, we are still closest to the apes. We haven't evolved to be complete predators, just enough behaviors to utilize our intelligence and social cooperation to survive and thrive. And we only evolved that way because the environment made us, forced us out east of Eden. It seems that much of our aesthetics, tastes, curiosity, and enjoyment of life are owed to our more ape aspects. A pure predator kind of society would resemble the Spartans I think. What we do in leisure however reflects both aspects of our nature, in varying degrees. The popularity of sports and online first person shooter video games reflects the more predator side. More relaxing and solitary activities like cooking or painting reflect the ape side. As for the title, the naked ape, the reason why we don't have a full coat of fur is to aid us in hunting; cooling us down by chasing animals. Other predators can make fast dashes after prey, but our bipedal stature and the occupation of our hands makes this difficult. ""By losing the heavy coat of hair and by increasing the number of sweat glands all over the body surface, considerable cooling could be achieved- not for minute by minute living, but for the supreme moments of the chase."" Our subcutaneous fat and ability to fashion clothes help keep us warm without fur. With the help of neoteny, the retaining of youthful traits into adulthood, all this explains our appearance as the naked ape. Younger chimps have flatter faces, a long slender neck, smaller teeth, absence of heavy brow ridges, non-rotating big toe, and more hair on the head than the rest of the body. Our extended childhood also allows us to develop our powerful brains. A desire to explore and learn new things are also associated with youth, and so we are the young ape as well as the naked ape. Though of course neoteny is selective, as we aren't attracted to infant genitals, infantile emotions, or infantile strength. The book is full of interesting speculations about behavior, always trying to link us to our animal nature. The message of the book is that we are still operating with an animal mindset no matter how developed we are. Even the most complex behaviors like pacing back and forth and the conduct of war harken back to our more modest origins."

Grazie, Mr. Gabbani (you were my personal winner anyways... and that is kind of all I know in Italian).Thus study was such a positive disappointment! I was afraid it would be too academical for my humanities-oriented brain... but guys, if you want to read a study on how humans evolved from apes and ""the missing links"" and how certains traditions and habits of ours formed, that is really interesting and really easy to read, it is for you. I read that Desmond Morris said he wanted to de-mistify science... and I could not put it better. The explanation is really clear, easy to understand and there were some really interesting and cool facts about certain human behaviour that we still practice... it was really interesting to see where they could come from.Also: if you are a really devout creatonist, I'd recommend you only read the book if you do not get triggered by reading full-on declared truths about evolution (as I believe in evolution and the scientific research that are supposed to prove it, I did not have any issues)."

We mustn't forget when was developed this essay, as well as the possible intentions of the author.The last chapter of the book is just... funny. Suddenly, Morris seems to see sex in the explanations about why we like some animals instead of others (maybe he was possessed by Freud when he wrote the last pages) and the justifications about animal exploitation are, some of them, just ridiculous. But I'm totally agree with one of the ideas in this book, and is that the world is overpopulated by the human beings and that it would be necessary to reduce the population (not killing people!), promoting and facilitating the use of contraceptive measures.In summary: to be careful with some of the contents in the book, but is a really interesting reading in my opinion."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book aged as well as can be expected. Desmond Morris writes from a zoologist's perspective and tries to describe man as if he were an external observer of our species. He analyses us and our behaviours from a very functional point of view. In the first chapters he mostly explores our physiological characteristics (and the differences between us and our closest animal relatives) and offers various evolutionary explanations for how they could have come to be. The zoologist's perspective proves to be very insightful for this purpose and I learned a great deal. In later chapters he starts to focus more on our behaviour. Though still thought-provoking, much of what he says is very speculative and his views on women and homosexuality are strongly influenced by the era in which the book was written.Despite some of these outdated speculations, it is still extremely interesting and insightful. I would recommend it to anyone who's fascinated by human evolution. "

I have learned a lot by reading it, and I have gained a huge amount of thought provoking material throughout the book.

""Naked Ape"" was first published in the UK in 1967. It treats humans as a kind of hairless apes and explores various human behaviors from a biological point of view. Desmond Morris was born in Wiltshire, England in 1928. He studied at the University of Birmingham with a degree in zoology and a Ph.D. from Oxford University. He is a famous zoologist in England. Representative works: ""Naked Ape"", ""Human Zoo"", ""Intimate Behavior"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Origin2. Sex3. Parenting4. Explore5. Fight6. Foraging and eating7. Finishing and comfort8. People and animals ""The Analects"" says, ""A gentleman has three precepts: when he is young, his blood is indeterminate, but he is in color; he is strong, his blood is strong, he is in fighting; he is old, his blood is declining, he is in good faith. ""The need for sex, the desire to hunt, and the unsatisfied desire are the nature of animals. It is extremely difficult to control these three instinctive impulses with reason. Millions of years ago, due to some reason, most likely due to climate change, the arboreal apes that originally lived in the forest had to walk out of the forest and leave the branches to stand on the ground, and became hunting apes in order to get enough food. In the process of evolution of hunting apes, although seemingly distinctive naked apes have gradually formed, naked apes still reflect the characteristics of typical primates and typical carnivores. Naked apes maintain their juvenile development, allowing the development of the brain to continue for a long time. The long developmental process will bring a heavy burden of parenting for females, which requires naked apes to form a more stable spouse relationship to complete the nurturing of the next generation. In order to ensure that this goal can be achieved, nature seems to give the naked ape stronger sexual stimulation as compensation. Even in the social structure of naked apes where multiple spouses are allowed, the vast majority of members still adopt a one-to-one monogamy relationship due to the high cost of parenting . From the perspective of species, reproduction is the biggest mission. In this process, ""sex"" plays an extremely important role. The sexual behavior of naked apes is typically different from other 192 species of apes. The females of other apes do not seem to have an orgasm, and the sexual intercourse process is often extremely short, usually only lasting 15 times. The estrus period of females is also very short, they often leave immediately after the end of sexual intercourse, ready for the next sexual act at any time, so as not to miss the precious opportunity for fertilization. The female of the naked ape will continue to lie down to rest after the sexual intercourse is completed, immersed in the aftermath of a certain orgasm. Not only that, except for a few periods, the sexual activity of naked apes is almost unaffected. This means that even during pregnancy, female naked apes can still meet the sexual needs of male naked apes, thereby enhancing the mate relationship. The strengthening of sexual stimulation will bring about another problem, that is, when the spouses are separated, there must be a mechanism to inhibit the sexual behavior of naked apes, otherwise the social structure of monogamy will be destroyed. This is for raising the next generation. It was almost a devastating blow. The most obvious measure is to cover the fig leaf. The genitals and sexual behavior must be covered up and become a kind of extremely important privacy. The cold protection effect of clothing is not revealed until the naked ape goes out of the tropics. In addition, there are other means, such as to cover secondary sexual characteristics, shaving the child, such as armpit hair shave; remove the smell of the body; prohibition of physical contact. Naked apes need to strengthen the sexual stimulation between their spouses on the one hand, and weaken the sexual stimulation between non-mates on the one hand, so as to maintain the stability of monogamy and ensure that the cooperative relationship of the entire social structure is not destroyed. Some science fiction novels make some bold conjectures, such as: baby farms, social behavior, selective sterilization, and division of labor. For now, these behaviors are contrary to the biological instincts of naked apes. If they are implemented on a large scale one day, it can almost be concluded that the social structure and lifestyle of naked apes will undergo unimaginable changes, and the impact of changes in sexual and parenting behavior will be extremely profound. "" Among the existing 4237 mammals, almost no animal can be found suitable for survival without fur. Mammals are different from their reptile ancestors. They have an unparalleled advantage in their physiological characteristics. They can maintain a constant comparison. High body temperature. This makes the delicate machine with physiological functions suitable for efficient operation. This attribute is neither easily damaged nor easily abandoned. The body's thermostat is extremely important. Thicker, hairy and insulated The epidermis obviously plays an important role in preventing heat loss. Under strong sunlight, it can also prevent high body temperature and prevent direct sun burns to the skin. Therefore, if body hair is to fall off, obviously there must be a very good reason To give it up. Apart from a few rare exceptions, mammals acquired a new medium in evolution after referral to take this drastic step change. Flying mammals, such as bats, were forced to remove their body hair on both wings, but the body hair of other parts was still preserved, so they cannot be included as a nude species. Several burrowing mammals have greatly reduced body hair, such as voles, aardvarks, and armadillos. Aquatic mammals, such as whales, dolphins, mermaids, manatees, and seahorses, also lose their body hair as their bodies become streamlined. However, for all typical mammals that live on the surface, whether it is an animal jumping on the ground or an animal climbing on plants, the densely covered skin is an inevitable law. Except for the unusually large rhinoceros and elephants (which have special problems with their heat preservation and cooling mechanisms), naked apes are unique mammals without body hair . "" If we study humans from a biological point of view , ignore the fact that we are humans, and try our best to adopt a relatively objective attitude to study humans as animals. In fact, many interesting new ideas will be obtained. These biological insights may enable us to better understand many social phenomena. "" We know that the climate has undergone unfavorable changes. By about 15 million years ago, the scale of their forest fortresses dropped sharply. The ancestors of monkeys were forced to do two things. One of the two must be one of them: or they still defend the forest. The dilapidated hometown, or bravely faced the fate of being expelled from the Garden of Eden as the Bible says. Chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons and orangutans remained in the woods, and their numbers have been declining ever since. There is only another kind that exists apes - naked ape ancestors blaze a way out of it. they withdraw into the forest wilderness, engaged in fierce competition, the oath has been highly adaptable animal life on the ground is assessed by this risky step, but it is the outcome of evolution. In short, this adventure has been greatly rewarded. "" Even during the careful evolution of organisms . Also experienced several important adventures . These risky decisions influence so far-reaching, it determines the millions of years later, his race would die out , or will evolve into more advanced species . ""The predatory ancient apes are basically a group of males. Females are busy raising children and cannot take the main role in hunting prey. As the complexity of hunting increases, the time for hunting gradually increases, and it is necessary to abandon ancestors drifting and migrating. Lifestyle. Therefore, a fixed residence is needed to bring the prey back to the fixed base. Females and cubs wait at home for the males to return from hunting and share food. The step of fixing the residence will be seen in later chapters. , And will have a profound impact on all aspects of today’s most perfectly developed apes. "" As early human Australopithecus social division of labor during the formation of straight to this day , still a profound impact on our society. In family life, the man primarily responsible for the provision of social resources , to feed the family. While women are primarily responsible for providing resources , to breed and raise offspring. To this day, our tendency to choose a spouse basically follows this line of thinking. Men are eager to marry young, beautiful women , which implies that she has a strong ability to reproduce. Women desire to marry rich and loyal men, which means that they have the will and ability to provide a favorable living environment for themselves and their offspring. "" Fundamentally, we originated from a carnivore in the primate order. Among the existing monkeys and apes, our evolution is very unique. But this evolutionary change is not uncommon among animals of other subjects. For example, the giant panda is an animal that has completely transformed in evolution. This example is exquisite. We have changed from a vegetarian animal to a carnivore, while the giant panda has changed from a carnivore to a vegetarian animal. Just like us. The giant panda is an incomparable and very unique animal. One important thing is that the animal created by this violent transformation has a dual personality. Once it crosses the threshold between the two species, it plunges into its new role. Moving forward with great evolutionary energy-it has become too fast, so it still carries many original qualities. The time for evolution is not sufficient, it is too late to get rid of all the original features, just put on the surface features in a hurry. When primitive fish have just overcome the water-free obstacles in their terrestrial life, their terrestrial animal qualities have evolved by leaps and bounds, but they still embrace the characteristics of aquatic animals. To complete a perfect and dramatic new species, it will take millions of years. The pioneers who walk in the front are usually bizarre mixed animals. The naked ape is just such a mixed four different elephants. His entire body and the lifestyle of the pond are suitable for arboreal life, but suddenly (the so-called sudden is from the slow evolutionary process), he was thrown into a completely different world. "" "" Carnivores give birth to fleas, but primates do not. Monkeys and apes are plagued by lice and are also infected with some parasitic diseases. However, contrary to popular belief, they are not fleas at all; therefore, there are A very convincing reason. To understand this, we must first examine the life cycle of the flea. When a flea lays eggs, it does not lay on the host, but in the sleeping home of the host. The flea eggs hatch after 3 days. Wriggling little maggots. These larvae do not suck blood, but live on the dust collected in their dens. After another two weeks, the larvae cocoon and pupate. The pupae become adults after resting in the cocoon for about half a month and emerge from the cocoon. Find a suitable host. It can be seen that at least during the first month of its life cycle, the flea is separated from its host. Obviously, mammals that do not settle down, such as monkeys or apes, are not troubled by fleas. This is the reason. Even if one or two fleas accidentally land on a primate and successfully mate, the eggs they lay cannot be taken away by the primate because the primate is constantly migrating. When the flea pupae emerge from the cocoon, there will be no host waiting for them ""at home"", maintaining the host and guest relationship with them. Therefore, fleas are parasites of animals in fixed dwellings. For example, typical carnivores are such animals. "" "" First of all, the naked ape sense organs are not suitable for life on the ground. His sense of smell is too weak, his ears keen enough. His physique is too weak to withstand the grueling endurance test experience, not to break out like thunder lightning sprint, This weakness is irreparable. In terms of personality, he is more competitive, not more cooperative, and he is undoubtedly not good at planning and focusing. Fortunately, his brain is extremely good. In general intelligence, he surpassed his rival carnivore. With the help of walking upright, he has transformed both his hands and feet; through further improvements in his brain and dedicated use of the brain, he may be successful. "" "" If we look at a typical monkey fetus, we will be able to understand the most profoundly why the juvenile persistence mechanism contributes to the development and development of the primate brain. The brain during the fetal period of the monkey develops rapidly, growing up and becoming complex. The baby monkey is born. , Its brain has reached 70% of the mature brain. The remaining 30% are fully developed in the first 6 months after birth. Even chimpanzee babies with higher intelligence have brain development within 12 months after birth Be completed. Our species is in sharp contrast to this. The brain volume of a baby at birth is only 23% of that of an adult. During the 6 years after birth, children’s brains continue to develop rapidly, but the entire developmental period of the human brain can only be completed at about 23 years of age. This shows that for you and me, after sexual maturity, brain development will continue for 10 years. However, for chimpanzees, brain development has been completed for six or seven years before reproductive capacity becomes active. "" "" Infant monkeys and chimpanzees also like to play, explore, and are creative, but they die soon at this stage. However, for naked apes, these infancy characteristics will continue until they mature. In adulthood. He has enough time to imitate and learn all the techniques designed by his ancestors. In terms of physique and instinct, he has many shortcomings as a hunter. However, his intelligence and imitating ability can make up for its shortcomings and More than enough. The way and depth he accepts his parents' teaching is beyond the reach of any other animal. "" In the flesh, humans do not have the advantage of competing with large carnivores. But the reason why we can get to this point. Mainly rely on the wisdom of individuals is superb , and the organization of social groups. "
242,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2094984-weston,5,"""The Naked Ape"" is remarkable. It embodies precisely the type of popular-science literature I love to read: the matter-of-fact pointing out of things which, having been pointed out, seem totally obvious, as if Desmond Morris were just reciting things I already knew but hadn't gotten around to actually realizing yet. His observations run that gamut of what he terms ""typical"" human behavior and physiology. That is, at the time of this book's writing (as now) anthropologists and sociologists commonly made the atypical specimens and their behaviors the focus of their studies. Were other scientists engaged in the study of lifeforms to do similarly they would never get anywhere. Perhaps out of vanity, perhaps out of a lack of self-awareness, science has historically avoided turning its objective eye toward the scientist (obvious and irrelevant exceptions of medical science excluded). Luckily for us, Desmond Morris undertook this endeavor and his findings are not only fascinating but wildly entertaining.A great deal of the pleasure derived from this book is in the way that Morris so ruthlessly picks apart his subject. The book's title itself is a playful and astutely humbling jab at the subject which drives straight to the heart of his message: human beings are first and foremost animals. Apes, to be precise, and our principal distinguishing feature, from a zoological standpoint, from our ape cousins is no more than our lack of a shaggy coat. We may drive around in fancy cars, work in skyscrapers, level mountains, dam rivers, etc. At the end of the day, we're still a bunch of naked apes. Which isn't to say that we aren't members of an incredibly resourceful and clever species, fascinating from all angles and fascinated by all things. Because we are unique, we are remarkable. Still, it is no more than gross vanity that makes us suppose that our manipulation of the external environment or the complexity and ingeniousness of our cultural expression has enabled us to overcome the fact that we are ""still very much a biological phenomenon... subject to all the basic laws of animal behavior.""Morris arms his reader with a new arsenal of cocktail party factoids, some endearing, some disgusting, some depressing, others hilarious, which alone make the read worthwhile. For instance, the size and shape of human breasts suggest that they have developed, through many centuries of sexual selection, as sexual signaling devices rather than merely as organs used to feed infants. That is, human breasts are actually not very good feeding devices when compared to those of other apes. The nipple typically isn't shaped to fit easily into the infant mouth and the excess tissue around it can even obstruct the baby's breathing. And yet breasts are universally used to spectacular success in piquing the interest of potential mates and, it could go without saying, play an enormous secondary role in human intercourse, behavior which is seen nowhere else in the animal kingdom. The evolutionary reasons for this development, believe it or not, are fascinatingly and intimately woven into our ancestors struggle for survival as the first carnivorous apes on the ancient plains of Africa.Having been first published in the 60's, ""Naked Ape"" is somewhat outdated. Morris' characterization of indigenous societies as atypical cultural failures makes sense from the coldly zoological perspective from which he was attempting to write, but fails to take into consideration historical truths which invite explanations beyond a socities' supposed lack of functionality. Modern readers will be equally squeamish by the occasional reference made to the ""negroid race"" and the interpretation of homosexuality as little more than deviant behavior caused by abnormal childhood experiences. Present day sensitivities aside, Morris is nevertheless quite forward-thinking and the intellectual merits of the book by far exceed whatever flags might be raised by your inner-p.c. reactionary.As entertaining a book as it is, Morris' tone and message is ultimately one of apocalyptic foreboding. We naked apes have been so spectacularly successful as a species that we have come to think of ourselves as invincible and we are not. Our success will, sooner rather than later, catch up with us because the global economy of environmental resources is, after all, finite. The modern reader will recognize all too well that the book's imperative rings even truer today, despite Morris' having to sound like a fanatic at the time of its initial publishing. Ironically, Morris suggests, the naked ape's first step toward salvation will be the recognition of his true nature. To go forward we have to take an honest look at where we came from."

244,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21322837-heather-mcalister,1,"Backwards, sexist, racist drivel. Written by a man obviously trying to stroke his own ego by arguing how ""objectively,"" when you look at it from the impartial perspective of a rational (male) scientist, early hominids clearly evolved to walk upright, lose their fur, use tools, develop spoken language, etc. ALL so that males could hunt in groups like wolves or lions. Literally every physiological feature of the modern homo sapien, according to the ""impartial"" male Desmond Morris, was led by ""hot-blooded,"" aggressive alpha males to hunt and kill. The invention of tools being so men could hunt; walking upright so men could see over grass; learning to talk so men could communicate complex hunting strategies; the loss of fur so men wouldn't die of heatstroke running in the hot African climate, etc.And the women? Oh, they just evolved to be child-rearers and home-makers. They sat around in caves suckling their babes like mama wolves in their dens with cubs (never mind that real mother wolves are out of the den in weeks, and often dump their pups on a babysitter as soon as they possibly can) waiting with baited breath for the menfolk to come home and share the spoils of the hunt with them.And all the physical features early female hominids not covered by his ""male hunting"" explanation? Like female hominid larger breasts, wider birthing hips, hominids developing downward facing noses, etc? Oh, they just evolved to ""make sex sexier."" (I'm not kidding. That's what it says in the book.) Female hominids have larger breasts than other greater apes? It's because the males found it sexy. Female hominids have wider hips? Males found it sexy. Downward facing noses? Same thing. Homo sapiens have fuller lips than other greater apes? Because it made kissing sexier, and kissing is a great evolutionary foreplay to sex.The minute I stopped reading was when Desmond Morris claimed that (white) homo sapiens having pink lips because it gave them a pouty kissable look, thus making them look more kissable, thus more desirable as a mate. And what of certain black Africans who tend to have enough melanin in their skin not to have pink lips, and/or have fuller, puffier lips? According to Desmond Morris, it's because they're evolutionary failures who had to evolve fuller lips to make up for not having the desired pink lips that more evolutionary successful (white) homo sapiens possess. (Which, according to him, are like those living in North America. Not the ""obscure"" cultures in Africa that are ""not as evolutionary successful,"" his words. Never mind that white 'North American' culture as we know it has only existed for a few centuries at most, and hasn't withstood the test of time the way the 'obscure' African cultures have, which have stood for centuries, if not millennia.) This book is a transparent straight white male ego stroke, where a guy who fancies himself ""rational"" and ""objective"" breaks his arm patting himself, as a straight white male homo sapien, on the back for being ""an evolutionary success."" According to him, EVERY SINGLE physiological trait of the entire modern homo sapien species came from (presumably white) men of eons past being big strong hunters. Women and people of color were just hanger-ons who reaped the evolutionary benefits of the past (presumably) straight white male hunters' ingenuity. And every trait females have that males (presumably) don't is because the males found it sexy, or it aided in bearing the males' children. And every trait that people of color have that whites don't was formed to compensate the ""evolutionary disadvantage"" of not being white.Also, I took a few anthropology classes in community college. Almost every point he ever made has been largely disproven, or called into serious question. Fuck this guy, fuck this book. The fact that people still read this sexist, racist drivel and see it as anything resembling fact is frankly insulting to the whole homo sapien species."
245,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19627177-n-jr,5,"A fascinating read by a great thinker. Virtually no aspect of human nature and physiognomy escapes his keen zoologist eyes; even responses such as smiling, laughing and crying. However, be warned: not only is this book nearly 50 years old and therefore outdated, but one must ingest his words with a large heaping of salt. As a scientific treatise it fails. The best way to read it is to consider this the personal musings of a biologist/anthropologist, not the findings of an expert researcher. It's greatest value is in instigating thought on the subject. It is the step-back-and look-at-ourselves approach which is of real value here, not his (sometimes hilarious)conclusions.His explanation of the protuberance and shape of female breasts developing as a frontal sexual display resulting from our upright posture, rather than for increased efficiency of nursing, is presented as a credible argument. Mmm, maybe that explains the human male's fascination with them.Most of his observations are comparative, highlighting similarities and differences between other mammals, notably the chimpanzee. In all cases, Morris makes us think about many aspects of ourselves that we normally take for granted.One criticism I have is his over-emphasis on genetic origins - for example, he claims the pair-bond formation between sexes (i.e monogamy) is genetic rather than cultural - afraid I disagree there. Also his treatment of warfare is incomplete and not entirely satisfactory for me.I know others will attack the author as chauvinistic (not only in regards the sexes, but cultures as well), but still, hey, the book can just be considered food for thought.All in all, a stimulating read, one so rich that I have marked it for a second time around in the future. It helped me to come up with my own thoughts on the subject"

It's written as if the author were writing it about any other animal, and hearing myself talked about as if I am a naked mole rat or a chimpanzee is very refreshing (this doesn't give you permission to refer to me as such in polite society, btw). We are animals as much as any other, and we should consider all the things that make us what we are, including our animal instincts and our biological history.There are some ideas I think are odd, for example when he says that adults want to save elephants from extinction mainly because of our own impending individual extinction (death). Some things seem like just his opinion, and don't make sense to me. All the ideas, though - every single one - I found to be interesting. There were plenty of things I'd heard before (after all, it's a 40 year old book), but there were also plenty of things I hadn't heard which were totally new to me, and made me reconsider some of my own ideas. One such idea I have is that clothes are something unnatural, something to be avoided. He puts it to us that humans are a very sexual species, unlike other animals which have a mating season we are ready all the time, and unlike other animals which need to do something special to display their genitals ours are visible all the time, so to avoid making sexual displays to everyone all the time, we cover up. I've thought about most of my opinions long and hard for many years, and reading anything that makes me consider changing them is a rare and wonderful experience which had me turning each page almost in awe at what I had found before and might find after.I have the other two books in this series, and I can't wait to read them next."
247,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180947-j,3,"Desmond Morris raises some interesting points in this book, some more farfetched than others. Honestly, I have problems with a lot of the points he makes in this book. Attempting to explain everything we do by comparing us to our nearest relatives in the animal kingdom is like I said interesting but the truth is many of our behaviors are unique to our species because of our advanced intellect and I think simplifying them by saying they can be explained by looking at the behaviors of other primates is not entirely accurate. Furthermore, he makes a few mistakes I wouldn't expect anyone familiar with biology to make (including the 'tongue-map' for taste recognition) as well as taking a very eurocentric stance on human behavior. His postulations aren't really backed up with anything more than the observation of other primates which by itself can't really be used to explain our behavior. Along with his insistance on using North Americans and Europeans as the model for humanity, I have to say that this book is more rooted in speculation than fact and shouldn't be taken seriously as a work of science. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining read and worthy of the 3 stars I gave it."
248,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027404-david-o-brien,5,"Fascinating reading and life affirming in an unexpected way. The most common complaint about this book is lack of evidence or proof. Morris states clearly that he did not list all the evidence because it would turn the book into an encyclopedia. There is a bibliography at the end for those who want to see where he got his information and inspiration.The style of the book is not purely scientific in so far as he he makes assumptions and draws conclusions from his own experience and his research, which makes for very interesting reading, however can be interpreted as imprecise. Just because something is not 100% proven, that does not mean that it is not interesting, relevant, thought provoking or inspirational. Throughout the book there are segments I might not wholly agree with, however the scope of the book is so vast yet still well tied together and coherent that it deserves 5/5. A brave book that even today is refreshing, educational, inspiring and a break from convention."
249,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763793-jean,3,"I disagree with those who say this book is homophobic and/or misogynistic. Morris says some things that in normal conversational context might be dubbed as such, but his explicit purpose was to view mans behavior from an objective standpoint. He succeeds. Political correctness has no place in (even attempted) scientific writing. He DOES state that gay couples cannot procreate on their own. However he goes on to discuss scenarios where this may be a pro. Don't overreact. When I read this book, I was unaware it was written decades ago. Morris' observations were fairly elementary to me, I assume since I grew up hearing a good deal of them. It is still quite enjoyable to read despite my experience. "
250,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56218095-benehime,2,"In theory a good book, but so Sooooo outdated. The author adopts a super-alpha-male stance and women have only evolved because it served men. Don't you think they did anything other than having children!! Morris thinks that working is today's form of hunting and women obviously have no place there. also, male relaxing can only ever happen with an all male group. There are some interesting parts though, I loved the chapter about grooming and fighting (sad to see that he left out the vastly different way men and women fight, but oh, I forgot, women don't)."
251,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5155466-clare,2,"I found this book to be very disappointing. Morris makes some interesting statements about human behavior, but unfortunately, he has almost nothing that could be called evidence for anything that he poses as fact. Although at first I thought I might be unfairly judging it because his sexual politics differ from mine and his understanding of human sexuality is dated to say the least, his statements on non-sex-related behaviors are equally unsupported."
252,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,4,"Very fun and interesting. The chapter on sex is laugh out loud hilarious at many points. There are a few outdated ideas present which betray the year this was written (1967) but nonetheless Morris displays a fine understanding of evolutionary theory and animal behavior and applies it with wit and clear, concise language to our upright species."

261,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,3,"Objective SummaryThis book explores the evolution, biology, psychology, and sociology of human beings. Morris refers to humans as the “naked ape” in an attempt to remove his cultural and experiential biases from his analysis, and to remind his readers that they, like all humans, are just evolved animals. Morris attempts to objectively describe human beings’ features, behavior, and the reasons for both in the same way a zoologist would describe any newly discovered species. The defining characteristic about human beings is our intelligence. But that intelligence is mapped crudely onto base animalistic tendencies and necessities. Rather than jumping straight to our intelligence, which may cloud important but elementary observations, Morris refers to us as the “naked ape,” a statement on our physical appearance as nearly hairless primates. Despite any attempts to ignore or transcend our animal roots, they persist. Morris explores human evolution, sex, child rearing, exploration, fighting, feeding, pursuit of comfort, and interaction with other animals. Listed below are some of the main lessons and interesting tidbits.•	Humans evolved from monkeys and apes. We moved from forests to the plains, though one theory suggests we moved from forests to seaside coasts to the plains. •	We moved from a vegetarian to an omnivore diet when we left the forest. This required cooperative hunting and defensive parties of males within the social hierarchy. This cooperation could now be a contributing factor to the development of gangs and wars.•	Neoteny, or extension of childhood development, played a significant role in human evolution. It allowed the human brain to continue to develop and grow for decades after birth, and it required pair-bonding between males and females to support the extended adolescence of their offspring. •	Pair-bonding helped females remain faithful to their mates, it reduced social friction between males over mating access, and it helped in rearing the slow-developing children. Pair-bonding is powerful but imperfect. The female orgasm, which is unusual if not unique to humans, was a contributor to pair-bonding. •	Why humans are relatively hairless isn’t known with certainty. The most popular theory is that it aids cooling during times of extreme exertion, like hunting. •	Much of our appearance is sexual signaling. Relatively large penises and breasts, red lips, and hairlessness all likely have sexual origins. Pubic and armpit hair likely trap pheromones for sexual arousal. •	80% of mothers hold infants in their left arms most likely because their heartbeat soothes their young.•	Animals fight to establish the dominance hierarchy and defend territory. They do not use their weapons to try to kill members of their own species because that would not be evolutionarily advantageous. Successful species establish aggressive and submissive displays that can substitute for actual physical confrontation and reduce physical harm and death. Bowing and avoiding eye contact are submissive signs. Standing tall and direct eye contact are dominant or aggressive signs. •	Human weaponry permits fatal action from afar. Our inability to observe submissive signals may contribute to additional killing and destruction. •	Curiosity serves a vital function to an opportunistic species. It has led humans to discover new lands, invent new tools, and try new foods. Curiosity has expanded into arts, science, and technology. There is a perpetual balance between novelty and familiarity. We want the excitement of the former with the security of the latter. By pushing the boundaries and exploring, we discover new and better ways to feed, protect, and comfort ourselves. •	Human desire for sweet foods can lead to obesity.•	Humans domesticated dozens of species of animals for food (cows, chickens, goats, pigs), companionship (dogs, cats, horses), transportation (horses, camels, elephants), experimentation (mice, rats, guinea pigs), and other tasks like plowing and hauling heavy stuff (horses, donkeys, oxen). •	Dogs were likely domesticated when we took wolf pups to fatten them up for food. Then we realized they could help us hunt and alert us to danger. There are breeds of dogs that are herders, scent-trackers, setters and pointers to prey, retrievers, killers of vermin, and guard dogs.•	Animals have five basic relationships with other animals: prey, symbiont, competitor, parasite, and predator.•	Religion may have roots in the need for an ultimately powerful being at the top of a hierarchy.•	12,000 British kids listed their favorite animals as: 1. Chimpanzee, 2. Monkey, 3. Horse, 4. Bushbaby, 5. Panda, 6. Bear, 7. Elephant, 8. Lion, 9. Dog, 10. Giraffe. They tend to have anthropomorphic features like sitting or moving upright and having highly expressive faces.•	12,000 British kids listed their most hated animals as: 1. Snake, 2. Spider, 3. Crocodile, 4. Lion, 5. Rat, 6. Skunk, 7. Gorilla, 8. Rhinoceros, 9. Hippopotamus, 10. Tiger. These are all dangerous. •	To survive as a civilization and a species, we must recognize and submit to our biological features. They cannot all be overcome through thought, culture, or technology. Subjective ThoughtsI read this book because the dude in the movie “Bring It On” was reading it during a high school football game. It was interesting and thought-provoking, but much of the content seemed familiar. That makes sense since I am a naked ape and have interacted with them all my life. And I think much of this material was covered in my biology textbooks back in the day.It was impossible for me to miss how much a product of its time this book was. Written in 1967, Morris was only five years removed from the Cuban missile crisis, and nuclear annihilation was clearly on his mind. He also harbored Malthusian fears of continued population growth, resource strain, and territorial strife. He anticipated the Ehrlichs’ “Population Bomb,” which would be published one year later. He seemed quite pessimistic on both the nuclear annihilation and overpopulation fronts. If he were to update the book today, he’d no doubt include global cooling, I mean global warming, errr global climate change in his list of calamities. Fortunately, as I type this, nukes haven’t dropped in anger since ’45, Trump may be in the process of solving Korea, reproduction rates have slowed across the developed world and sometimes below replacement levels, and there are alternative albeit expensive energy sources. Not that I’m worried enough about any of this to shut off the air conditioner or my computer. And this Honeycrisp apple from Walmart is amazing. Morris should also update his advice on how to handle being pulled over by police. His suggestion is to immediately leave your car and approach the officer so that you two don’t interact on “your” territory near your car, which will make the officer feel threatened. That shit will get you shot today. Stay in your car with your hands on the wheel, and wait to move until you’re told. You don’t want to suddenly approach someone with a Glock 17 on standby.Memorable Quotes“A solitary monkey or ape is a vulnerable creature. It lacks the powerful natural weapons of the carnivore and in isolation falls easy prey to the stalking killers.”“It is only a wise primate, like our hunting ape, that knows its own father.”“The male reaches the consummatory act of sperm ejaculation within a few minutes in most cases, unless deliberate delaying tactics are employed. . . . Some females may reach this point very quickly, others not at all, but on the average it is attained between ten and twenty minutes after the start of copulation.”“Its normal, average length of nine and a half centimetres is increased by seven to eight centimetres. The diameter is also considerably increased, giving the species the largest erect penis of any living primate.”“After a gestation period of approximately 266 days her uterus begins to contract powerfully and rhythmically.”“The average weight of a baby at birth is just over seven pounds, which is slightly more than one-twentieth of the weight of the average parent.”“Lucky is the society that enjoys the gradual acquisition of a perfect balance between imitation and curiosity, between slavish, unthinking copying and progressive, rational experimentation.”“In all exploratory behaviour, whether artistic or scientific, there is the ever-present battle between the neophilic and neophobic urges. The former drives us on to new experiences, makes us crave for novelty. The latter holds us back, makes us take refuge in the familiar. We are constantly in a state of shifting balance between the conflicting attractions of the exciting new stimulus and the friendly old one. If we lost our neophilia we would stagnate. If we lost our neophobia, we would rush headlong into disaster.”“We are, to put it mildly, in a mess, and there is a strong chance that we shall have exterminated ourselves by the end of the century.”“Animals fight amongst themselves for one of two very good reasons: either to establish their dominance in a social hierarchy, or to establish their territorial rights over a particular piece of ground.” “If a species is to survive, it simply cannot afford to go around slaughtering its own kind. Intra-specific aggression has to be inhibited and controlled, and the more powerful and savage the prey-killing weapons of a particular species are, the stronger must be the inhibitions about using them to settle disputes with rivals.”“To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion. Abortion is a drastic measure and can involve serious emotional disturbance. Furthermore, once a zygote has been formed by the act of fertilization it constitutes a new individual member of society, and its destruction is, in effect, an act of aggression, which is the very pattern of behaviour that we are attempting to control. Contraception is obviously preferable, and any religious or other ‘moralizing’ factions that oppose it must face the fact that they are engaged in dangerous war-mongering.”“We each possess about 10,000 of these taste buds, but in old age they deteriorate and decrease in number, hence the jaded palate of the elderly gastronome. Surprisingly, we can only respond to four basic tastes. They are: sour, salt, bitter, and sweet.”“Domestication of livestock, involving the organized control and selective breeding of prey, is known to have been practised for at least ten thousand years and, in certain cases, probably much longer. Goats, sheep and reindeer appear to have been the earliest prey species dealt with in this way.”“It is probable that [an interspecific bond between humans and dogs] began as a result of young puppies being brought in to the tribal home base to be fattened as food.”“Unless we can colonize other planets on a massive scale and spread the load, or seriously check our population increase in some way, we shall, in the not-too-far distant future, have to remove all other forms of life from the earth. . . . We need not dwell on this nightmare: the possibility of its becoming a reality is remote.”"
262,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62596158-n-g-habsburg,3,"I enjoyed reading this (it's written in quite an amusing style) but I was hoping for something more heavy on the primatology. While it's a good review of instinctive human behaviour it is expectionally light into actual comparisons to other primates.He does make interesting points, e.g. noting that when the forests started to disappear we converged towards carnivore traits but by using artificial weapons rather than natural ones we did not need to move towards becoming like cats/dogs (though he doesn't note that other plains primates probably did so more than us). He notes the importance of us acquiring home bases where the females were left, and hence the need to develop more clear territories, pair bonds and ability to share food with family/tribe.He talks about how adolescents acquite the need to go off and develop their own home. But here he doesn't spend any time discussing what's actually known about how humans do this. It's actually remarkable how variable this is across different societies (albeit it generally has fixed form within a society). Sometimes it it the male, sometimes the female. These are generally species fixed traits, and yet he doesn't cover this.He talks about how the development of a pair bond meant that we needed to start hiding our sexual features in public. He notes that other species generally sustain the pair bond through aggression, but we do it instead by wearing clothes and avoiding touching each other.It's quite an old book and features some exceptional examples of envirionmentalist (e.g. blank slate) thinking from the era it was written, which is somewhat startling in a book which otherwise fully acknowledges that we are creatures driven by innate behaviours. For instance, he talks about how if a mother is tense and smiles to conceil it, the baby will detect it and mistake the function of a smile... he then warns that this could be permanently damaging and cause the child serious social difficulties... nuttier environmentalist claptrap than that is only spewed forth by modern SJWs but I guess it was par for the course back then. The section on music and it's relation to mothers heart beat is similarly whacko.A section of the book deals with our innate sounds/actions, e.g. laughter and smiling. Discussion about how they evolved is perhaps questionable. Notes things like when a baby smiles it waves it's arms and legs around, and suggests this is the vestigial primate clinging response. There's also curious little factoids, like our 'sweet tooth' being a distinct primate thing that other carnivores don't generally have.An interesting section is when he talks about how men go along to trade unions, social clubs , learned societies etc as an equivilent of the hunting pack. They do so to experience our built in bond from male togetherness. Interestingly, this was written before it became taboo to go to male only societies. One suspects that the author would not thus be suprised that membership of all voluntary societies has utterly collapsed since women were permitted to join them (see Putnam's 'Bowling Alone'). He also describes how work is probably a poor substitute for hunting for the working classes in a manner that it is not for the middle class. Expresses it in a manner that is probably illegal these days.A key point the author wants to get across in the book is that we're going through a population boom and being forced into living in environments increasingly more crowded and distrinct from what we evolved for. He talks about how the modern usage of soulless featureless architecture where everything looks the same flys against our built in desire to mark territory as our own through personalisation (declaring quite rightly that modern architects are terrorists). He is sceptical about the ability of us to adapt our innate behaviour. On that, he is probably correct. He could have argued his case better (and I believe that in his next book he went on to do so). "
263,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13626166-siddarth-gore,5,"So there he stands, our vertical, hunting, weapon-toting, territorial, neotenous, brainy, Naked Ape, a primate by ancestry and a carnivore by adoption, ready to conquer the world.We evolved from apes. But exactly how far did we get? Your guesses might be way off the mark. This book says that under the surface we are ruled mostly by our inner primates. Things just look different on us. Evolution is too slow a process for us to have shed our animal past.In our species there is, as we have seen, a strong tendency to ‘fall in love’—to develop a powerful bond with the object of our sexual attentions.No primates are monogamous so why are we? The answer comes from our adaptation to life on the plains of Africa once we were thrown out of the jungle perhaps due to environmental changes. Hint, pack hunters need cooperation from all males.They occur with particularly high frequency during the initial stages of social encounters, where hidden fears and aggressions are lurking just below the surface. At a dinner party, or any small social gathering, as soon as the mutual appeasement ceremonies of hand-shaking and smiling are over, displacement cigarettes, displacement drinks and displacement food-snacks are immediately offered.This was the most fascinating part. Monkeys and apes are very much social animals with hierarchy being most crucial thing on their minds. How did we get rid of that, or did we? Even the most innocuous conversations and meetings are anything but that for your social relations obsessed brain. To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion.His argument is that cramming animals in compact spaces invariably leads to aggression. We might think we are special but think again. Only way to make sure we do not turn against each other is to give everyone enough space. Debatable, but interesting viewpoint none the less.Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else.One can only hope ;-)"
264,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98103014-jonas,4,"This book was first published in 1967 and I found it to be somewhat of a foreboding book.I was first introduced into many of these concepts regarding “the naked ape’s” ecological role and behaviour from other books, such as Ishmael by Daniel Quinn and The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. Though those books are written about something else, I found myself thinking of those books while I was reading this one. Many of the arguments presented in those books could be paralleled with the comparative elements between the human and ape presented throughout this book.Each chapter though succinct, presents an interesting perspective on the anatomy of the human body, as well as our behavioural aspects against the bodies and social practices of other ape species. I thought many of the ideas were very inventive, but the chapter on sex comes across as crass and salacious, but otherwise, the book presents itself in a very tame manner.Whilst the book contains many fantastic ideas, I can see why this book created controversy within the feminist/homosexual communities. The book even manages to squeeze in a supporting message for contraceptives and population control. Overall, I think the book makes for an interesting read, but is by no means the best book regarding the topic especially in modern day, due to changing of the zeitgeist from the late 1960’s to the prevalence of technology today (even though some of the fears might still be present today). Despite that, I still think it’s worth a read to understand how it was relevant at that time, and how it has paved a way and introduced the idea of comparative ethology to the general public."
265,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705775-gerardo-alonso,4,"The Naked Ape is a mirror. While reading it, one sees a reflection of oneself. But unlike many other reflections, this one is raw and based on our biological characteristics. This reflection breaks down our egos and social constructs to their bare bones. Desmond Morris attempts to show humanity that we are merely a species of the Animal KingdomI found the book inspiring, and highly effective to understand characteristic behaviours we may have. It feels as if someone is saying what one has already known but could not figure out the words to explain it.While this book is very powerful philosophically, I think it lacks thoroughness in logic. One of the things that concerns me is that it seems to me that Morris takes a one-sided view of several arguments sometimes based on factoids/opinions that may debatable. Another difficulty I find is the ease of comparison between the Homo Sapiens and the apes. While true that we share a very similar DNA structure, I think that Morris not only tries to link biological similarities (which he does in a great way in the beginning of the book), but also behavioural similarities.I get that in some cases or themes, the behaviour among species will be the same. The fight or flight response, for example. But when highly specific social interactions are compared between species, Morris should have analysed the Naked Ape by itself.It may be the case that some of the science behind the book is outdated, since this was published in the 60s. Regardless of the leaps Morris takes, this book is worth reading as a biology, anthropology and history lesson of our species. "
266,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"I had a great time reading this book. Despite coming out almost fifty years ago when I found it, much of what it says is still thought provoking and relevant. The book owes a little bit to psychoanalysis which was more dominant at the time. Which is good since Morris uses it to good effect to tie together physiological and behavioral facts into a general theory of human nature. What is that theory of human nature? Well, that we are the way we are because our ancestors were forced to become a predator species/hunting-ape and couldn't stay in and around trees picking fruits. Millions of years ago in Africa, during the Miocene, the forests started to disappear, and the apes could either cling onto whatever was left, or leave the ""garden of Eden"" and enter into competition with the predators on the ground. Ape populations have dwindled since, and we have emerged the apex predator. To get to that point we had to overcome the other predators, but with inferior equipment so to speak; no fangs or claws. So we made use of two things carried over to a certain degree from our ape past; intelligence and social communication. ""His whole body, his way of life, was geared to a forest existence, and then suddenly he was jettisoned into a world where he could survive only if he began to live like a brainy, weapon toting wolf."" Our social lives are to this day built on a sort of tension between social communication and intellect (from ape life) and group loyalty and hunting from our predator existence. Vestiges of our ape life are our greater reliance on sight at the expense of smell and a more various taste palate. Our predator life involves traveling greater distances to find game, rather than remaining close to the trees, having a home base to protect and return to, and having regular meals rather than momentary snacking. Being a predatory ape means developing ways to facilitate male cooperation, to hunt together with dangerous weapons, and to guarantee a share of the kills and a female for the effort. Monogamy and private property likely arise from a need to secure the loyalty of males to females and children while they hunted and prevent conflict among the males. This isn't all bad, as the predator life means some degree of male solidarity. We can't have a single alpha male who gets exclusive access to women and food. The ability to cooperate and use weapon technology means the lesser males can gang up and resist, limit, or kill the alpha male. Thus some satisfactory distribution of females and resources becomes necessary for social order, and this is likely where marriage and property and even government developed from. Morris channels Sigmund Freud and argues that religion emerges from the guilt of (symbolically) killing the alpha ape. Even with all his faults, an all powerful male does instill some sort of order and security which is socially useful. You knew where you stood, and the alpha ape in a way encouraged exogamous mating, preventing incest by kicking the sons out of the harem. So religion projects the seemingly omnipotent alpha ape onto the cosmos, extending its influence to our personal lives without actually being here. There are several downsides that ape life has: lack of cooperation (among males), a pecking order with one individual on top, and less incentive to control nature. Ape and monkey society is more about competition and dominance, and dependent on nature providing food for the picking. Depending on the environment means not traveling too far and remaining close, thus reducing the need for defense of home as well as needing to know what others are up to as they aren't far. If we just forage for food, there isn't a need to cooperate. It's ""finders keepers"", and so dominance becomes more important. The alpha male gets the first pick, and so long as everybody abides conflict can be avoided, with little need to work together other than staying out of the big guy's way. Despite all these downsides, we are still closest to the apes. We haven't evolved to be complete predators, just enough behaviors to utilize our intelligence and social cooperation to survive and thrive. And we only evolved that way because the environment made us, forced us out east of Eden. It seems that much of our aesthetics, tastes, curiosity, and enjoyment of life are owed to our more ape aspects. A pure predator kind of society would resemble the Spartans I think. What we do in leisure however reflects both aspects of our nature, in varying degrees. The popularity of sports and online first person shooter video games reflects the more predator side. More relaxing and solitary activities like cooking or painting reflect the ape side. As for the title, the naked ape, the reason why we don't have a full coat of fur is to aid us in hunting; cooling us down by chasing animals. Other predators can make fast dashes after prey, but our bipedal stature and the occupation of our hands makes this difficult. ""By losing the heavy coat of hair and by increasing the number of sweat glands all over the body surface, considerable cooling could be achieved- not for minute by minute living, but for the supreme moments of the chase."" Our subcutaneous fat and ability to fashion clothes help keep us warm without fur. With the help of neoteny, the retaining of youthful traits into adulthood, all this explains our appearance as the naked ape. Younger chimps have flatter faces, a long slender neck, smaller teeth, absence of heavy brow ridges, non-rotating big toe, and more hair on the head than the rest of the body. Our extended childhood also allows us to develop our powerful brains. A desire to explore and learn new things are also associated with youth, and so we are the young ape as well as the naked ape. Though of course neoteny is selective, as we aren't attracted to infant genitals, infantile emotions, or infantile strength. The book is full of interesting speculations about behavior, always trying to link us to our animal nature. The message of the book is that we are still operating with an animal mindset no matter how developed we are. Even the most complex behaviors like pacing back and forth and the conduct of war harken back to our more modest origins."

Grazie, Mr. Gabbani (you were my personal winner anyways... and that is kind of all I know in Italian).Thus study was such a positive disappointment! I was afraid it would be too academical for my humanities-oriented brain... but guys, if you want to read a study on how humans evolved from apes and ""the missing links"" and how certains traditions and habits of ours formed, that is really interesting and really easy to read, it is for you. I read that Desmond Morris said he wanted to de-mistify science... and I could not put it better. The explanation is really clear, easy to understand and there were some really interesting and cool facts about certain human behaviour that we still practice... it was really interesting to see where they could come from.Also: if you are a really devout creatonist, I'd recommend you only read the book if you do not get triggered by reading full-on declared truths about evolution (as I believe in evolution and the scientific research that are supposed to prove it, I did not have any issues)."

We mustn't forget when was developed this essay, as well as the possible intentions of the author.The last chapter of the book is just... funny. Suddenly, Morris seems to see sex in the explanations about why we like some animals instead of others (maybe he was possessed by Freud when he wrote the last pages) and the justifications about animal exploitation are, some of them, just ridiculous. But I'm totally agree with one of the ideas in this book, and is that the world is overpopulated by the human beings and that it would be necessary to reduce the population (not killing people!), promoting and facilitating the use of contraceptive measures.In summary: to be careful with some of the contents in the book, but is a really interesting reading in my opinion."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book aged as well as can be expected. Desmond Morris writes from a zoologist's perspective and tries to describe man as if he were an external observer of our species. He analyses us and our behaviours from a very functional point of view. In the first chapters he mostly explores our physiological characteristics (and the differences between us and our closest animal relatives) and offers various evolutionary explanations for how they could have come to be. The zoologist's perspective proves to be very insightful for this purpose and I learned a great deal. In later chapters he starts to focus more on our behaviour. Though still thought-provoking, much of what he says is very speculative and his views on women and homosexuality are strongly influenced by the era in which the book was written.Despite some of these outdated speculations, it is still extremely interesting and insightful. I would recommend it to anyone who's fascinated by human evolution. "

Apart from these points, and the fact that it feels a bit old-fashioned in many of it's statements, there is something extremely fascinating in the approach this book has to offer. I have learned a lot by reading it, and I have gained a huge amount of thought provoking material throughout the book. The two longest chapters - Sex and Fighting - were the most interesting in my opinion. "
271,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112166097-barack-liu,4," 227-The Naked Ape-Desmond Morris-Nature-1967Barack2019/07/082020/06/23 - Biologically, people are divided, Mammal, primates, hominids, human genus Homo sapiens, is the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and gibbon apes belong to the superfamily of primates. ""Naked Ape"" was first published in the UK in 1967. It treats humans as a kind of hairless apes and explores various human behaviors from a biological point of view. Desmond Morris was born in Wiltshire, England in 1928. He studied at the University of Birmingham with a degree in zoology and a Ph.D. from Oxford University. He is a famous zoologist in England. Representative works: ""Naked Ape"", ""Human Zoo"", ""Intimate Behavior"", etc. Part of the catalog1. Origin2. Sex3. Parenting4. Explore5. Fight6. Foraging and eating7. Finishing and comfort8. People and animals ""The Analects"" says, ""A gentleman has three precepts: when he is young, his blood is indeterminate, but he is in color; he is strong, his blood is strong, he is in fighting; he is old, his blood is declining, he is in good faith. ""The need for sex, the desire to hunt, and the unsatisfied desire are the nature of animals. It is extremely difficult to control these three instinctive impulses with reason. Millions of years ago, due to some reason, most likely due to climate change, the arboreal apes that originally lived in the forest had to walk out of the forest and leave the branches to stand on the ground, and became hunting apes in order to get enough food. In the process of evolution of hunting apes, although seemingly distinctive naked apes have gradually formed, naked apes still reflect the characteristics of typical primates and typical carnivores. Naked apes maintain their juvenile development, allowing the development of the brain to continue for a long time. The long developmental process will bring a heavy burden of parenting for females, which requires naked apes to form a more stable spouse relationship to complete the nurturing of the next generation. In order to ensure that this goal can be achieved, nature seems to give the naked ape stronger sexual stimulation as compensation. Even in the social structure of naked apes where multiple spouses are allowed, the vast majority of members still adopt a one-to-one monogamy relationship due to the high cost of parenting . From the perspective of species, reproduction is the biggest mission. In this process, ""sex"" plays an extremely important role. The sexual behavior of naked apes is typically different from other 192 species of apes. The females of other apes do not seem to have an orgasm, and the sexual intercourse process is often extremely short, usually only lasting 15 times. The estrus period of females is also very short, they often leave immediately after the end of sexual intercourse, ready for the next sexual act at any time, so as not to miss the precious opportunity for fertilization. The female of the naked ape will continue to lie down to rest after the sexual intercourse is completed, immersed in the aftermath of a certain orgasm. Not only that, except for a few periods, the sexual activity of naked apes is almost unaffected. This means that even during pregnancy, female naked apes can still meet the sexual needs of male naked apes, thereby enhancing the mate relationship. The strengthening of sexual stimulation will bring about another problem, that is, when the spouses are separated, there must be a mechanism to inhibit the sexual behavior of naked apes, otherwise the social structure of monogamy will be destroyed. This is for raising the next generation. It was almost a devastating blow. The most obvious measure is to cover the fig leaf. The genitals and sexual behavior must be covered up and become a kind of extremely important privacy. The cold protection effect of clothing is not revealed until the naked ape goes out of the tropics. In addition, there are other means, such as to cover secondary sexual characteristics, shaving the child, such as armpit hair shave; remove the smell of the body; prohibition of physical contact. Naked apes need to strengthen the sexual stimulation between their spouses on the one hand, and weaken the sexual stimulation between non-mates on the one hand, so as to maintain the stability of monogamy and ensure that the cooperative relationship of the entire social structure is not destroyed. Some science fiction novels make some bold conjectures, such as: baby farms, social behavior, selective sterilization, and division of labor. For now, these behaviors are contrary to the biological instincts of naked apes. If they are implemented on a large scale one day, it can almost be concluded that the social structure and lifestyle of naked apes will undergo unimaginable changes, and the impact of changes in sexual and parenting behavior will be extremely profound. "" Among the existing 4237 mammals, almost no animal can be found suitable for survival without fur. Mammals are different from their reptile ancestors. They have an unparalleled advantage in their physiological characteristics. They can maintain a constant comparison. High body temperature. This makes the delicate machine with physiological functions suitable for efficient operation. This attribute is neither easily damaged nor easily abandoned. The body's thermostat is extremely important. Thicker, hairy and insulated The epidermis obviously plays an important role in preventing heat loss. Under strong sunlight, it can also prevent high body temperature and prevent direct sun burns to the skin. Therefore, if body hair is to fall off, obviously there must be a very good reason To give it up. Apart from a few rare exceptions, mammals acquired a new medium in evolution after referral to take this drastic step change. Flying mammals, such as bats, were forced to remove their body hair on both wings, but the body hair of other parts was still preserved, so they cannot be included as a nude species. Several burrowing mammals have greatly reduced body hair, such as voles, aardvarks, and armadillos. Aquatic mammals, such as whales, dolphins, mermaids, manatees, and seahorses, also lose their body hair as their bodies become streamlined. However, for all typical mammals that live on the surface, whether it is an animal jumping on the ground or an animal climbing on plants, the densely covered skin is an inevitable law. Except for the unusually large rhinoceros and elephants (which have special problems with their heat preservation and cooling mechanisms), naked apes are unique mammals without body hair . "" If we study humans from a biological point of view , ignore the fact that we are humans, and try our best to adopt a relatively objective attitude to study humans as animals. In fact, many interesting new ideas will be obtained. These biological insights may enable us to better understand many social phenomena. "" We know that the climate has undergone unfavorable changes. By about 15 million years ago, the scale of their forest fortresses dropped sharply. The ancestors of monkeys were forced to do two things. One of the two must be one of them: or they still defend the forest. The dilapidated hometown, or bravely faced the fate of being expelled from the Garden of Eden as the Bible says. Chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons and orangutans remained in the woods, and their numbers have been declining ever since. There is only another kind that exists apes - naked ape ancestors blaze a way out of it. they withdraw into the forest wilderness, engaged in fierce competition, the oath has been highly adaptable animal life on the ground is assessed by this risky step, but it is the outcome of evolution. In short, this adventure has been greatly rewarded. "" Even during the careful evolution of organisms . Also experienced several important adventures . These risky decisions influence so far-reaching, it determines the millions of years later, his race would die out , or will evolve into more advanced species . ""The predatory ancient apes are basically a group of males. Females are busy raising children and cannot take the main role in hunting prey. As the complexity of hunting increases, the time for hunting gradually increases, and it is necessary to abandon ancestors drifting and migrating. Lifestyle. Therefore, a fixed residence is needed to bring the prey back to the fixed base. Females and cubs wait at home for the males to return from hunting and share food. The step of fixing the residence will be seen in later chapters. , And will have a profound impact on all aspects of today’s most perfectly developed apes. "" As early human Australopithecus social division of labor during the formation of straight to this day , still a profound impact on our society. In family life, the man primarily responsible for the provision of social resources , to feed the family. While women are primarily responsible for providing resources , to breed and raise offspring. To this day, our tendency to choose a spouse basically follows this line of thinking. Men are eager to marry young, beautiful women , which implies that she has a strong ability to reproduce. Women desire to marry rich and loyal men, which means that they have the will and ability to provide a favorable living environment for themselves and their offspring. "" Fundamentally, we originated from a carnivore in the primate order. Among the existing monkeys and apes, our evolution is very unique. But this evolutionary change is not uncommon among animals of other subjects. For example, the giant panda is an animal that has completely transformed in evolution. This example is exquisite. We have changed from a vegetarian animal to a carnivore, while the giant panda has changed from a carnivore to a vegetarian animal. Just like us. The giant panda is an incomparable and very unique animal. One important thing is that the animal created by this violent transformation has a dual personality. Once it crosses the threshold between the two species, it plunges into its new role. Moving forward with great evolutionary energy-it has become too fast, so it still carries many original qualities. The time for evolution is not sufficient, it is too late to get rid of all the original features, just put on the surface features in a hurry. When primitive fish have just overcome the water-free obstacles in their terrestrial life, their terrestrial animal qualities have evolved by leaps and bounds, but they still embrace the characteristics of aquatic animals. To complete a perfect and dramatic new species, it will take millions of years. The pioneers who walk in the front are usually bizarre mixed animals. The naked ape is just such a mixed four different elephants. His entire body and the lifestyle of the pond are suitable for arboreal life, but suddenly (the so-called sudden is from the slow evolutionary process), he was thrown into a completely different world. "" "" Carnivores give birth to fleas, but primates do not. Monkeys and apes are plagued by lice and are also infected with some parasitic diseases. However, contrary to popular belief, they are not fleas at all; therefore, there are A very convincing reason. To understand this, we must first examine the life cycle of the flea. When a flea lays eggs, it does not lay on the host, but in the sleeping home of the host. The flea eggs hatch after 3 days. Wriggling little maggots. These larvae do not suck blood, but live on the dust collected in their dens. After another two weeks, the larvae cocoon and pupate. The pupae become adults after resting in the cocoon for about half a month and emerge from the cocoon. Find a suitable host. It can be seen that at least during the first month of its life cycle, the flea is separated from its host. Obviously, mammals that do not settle down, such as monkeys or apes, are not troubled by fleas. This is the reason. Even if one or two fleas accidentally land on a primate and successfully mate, the eggs they lay cannot be taken away by the primate because the primate is constantly migrating. When the flea pupae emerge from the cocoon, there will be no host waiting for them ""at home"", maintaining the host and guest relationship with them. Therefore, fleas are parasites of animals in fixed dwellings. For example, typical carnivores are such animals. "" "" First of all, the naked ape sense organs are not suitable for life on the ground. His sense of smell is too weak, his ears keen enough. His physique is too weak to withstand the grueling endurance test experience, not to break out like thunder lightning sprint, This weakness is irreparable. In terms of personality, he is more competitive, not more cooperative, and he is undoubtedly not good at planning and focusing. Fortunately, his brain is extremely good. In general intelligence, he surpassed his rival carnivore. With the help of walking upright, he has transformed both his hands and feet; through further improvements in his brain and dedicated use of the brain, he may be successful. "" "" If we look at a typical monkey fetus, we will be able to understand the most profoundly why the juvenile persistence mechanism contributes to the development and development of the primate brain. The brain during the fetal period of the monkey develops rapidly, growing up and becoming complex. The baby monkey is born. , Its brain has reached 70% of the mature brain. The remaining 30% are fully developed in the first 6 months after birth. Even chimpanzee babies with higher intelligence have brain development within 12 months after birth Be completed. Our species is in sharp contrast to this. The brain volume of a baby at birth is only 23% of that of an adult. During the 6 years after birth, children’s brains continue to develop rapidly, but the entire developmental period of the human brain can only be completed at about 23 years of age. This shows that for you and me, after sexual maturity, brain development will continue for 10 years. However, for chimpanzees, brain development has been completed for six or seven years before reproductive capacity becomes active. "" "" Infant monkeys and chimpanzees also like to play, explore, and are creative, but they die soon at this stage. However, for naked apes, these infancy characteristics will continue until they mature. In adulthood. He has enough time to imitate and learn all the techniques designed by his ancestors. In terms of physique and instinct, he has many shortcomings as a hunter. However, his intelligence and imitating ability can make up for its shortcomings and More than enough. The way and depth he accepts his parents' teaching is beyond the reach of any other animal. "" In the flesh, humans do not have the advantage of competing with large carnivores. But the reason why we can get to this point. Mainly rely on the wisdom of individuals is superb , and the organization of social groups. "
272,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2094984-weston,5,"""The Naked Ape"" is remarkable. It embodies precisely the type of popular-science literature I love to read: the matter-of-fact pointing out of things which, having been pointed out, seem totally obvious, as if Desmond Morris were just reciting things I already knew but hadn't gotten around to actually realizing yet. His observations run that gamut of what he terms ""typical"" human behavior and physiology. That is, at the time of this book's writing (as now) anthropologists and sociologists commonly made the atypical specimens and their behaviors the focus of their studies. Were other scientists engaged in the study of lifeforms to do similarly they would never get anywhere. Perhaps out of vanity, perhaps out of a lack of self-awareness, science has historically avoided turning its objective eye toward the scientist (obvious and irrelevant exceptions of medical science excluded). Luckily for us, Desmond Morris undertook this endeavor and his findings are not only fascinating but wildly entertaining.A great deal of the pleasure derived from this book is in the way that Morris so ruthlessly picks apart his subject. The book's title itself is a playful and astutely humbling jab at the subject which drives straight to the heart of his message: human beings are first and foremost animals. Apes, to be precise, and our principal distinguishing feature, from a zoological standpoint, from our ape cousins is no more than our lack of a shaggy coat. We may drive around in fancy cars, work in skyscrapers, level mountains, dam rivers, etc. At the end of the day, we're still a bunch of naked apes. Which isn't to say that we aren't members of an incredibly resourceful and clever species, fascinating from all angles and fascinated by all things. Because we are unique, we are remarkable. Still, it is no more than gross vanity that makes us suppose that our manipulation of the external environment or the complexity and ingeniousness of our cultural expression has enabled us to overcome the fact that we are ""still very much a biological phenomenon... subject to all the basic laws of animal behavior.""Morris arms his reader with a new arsenal of cocktail party factoids, some endearing, some disgusting, some depressing, others hilarious, which alone make the read worthwhile. For instance, the size and shape of human breasts suggest that they have developed, through many centuries of sexual selection, as sexual signaling devices rather than merely as organs used to feed infants. That is, human breasts are actually not very good feeding devices when compared to those of other apes. The nipple typically isn't shaped to fit easily into the infant mouth and the excess tissue around it can even obstruct the baby's breathing. And yet breasts are universally used to spectacular success in piquing the interest of potential mates and, it could go without saying, play an enormous secondary role in human intercourse, behavior which is seen nowhere else in the animal kingdom. The evolutionary reasons for this development, believe it or not, are fascinatingly and intimately woven into our ancestors struggle for survival as the first carnivorous apes on the ancient plains of Africa.Having been first published in the 60's, ""Naked Ape"" is somewhat outdated. Morris' characterization of indigenous societies as atypical cultural failures makes sense from the coldly zoological perspective from which he was attempting to write, but fails to take into consideration historical truths which invite explanations beyond a socities' supposed lack of functionality. Modern readers will be equally squeamish by the occasional reference made to the ""negroid race"" and the interpretation of homosexuality as little more than deviant behavior caused by abnormal childhood experiences. Present day sensitivities aside, Morris is nevertheless quite forward-thinking and the intellectual merits of the book by far exceed whatever flags might be raised by your inner-p.c. reactionary.As entertaining a book as it is, Morris' tone and message is ultimately one of apocalyptic foreboding. We naked apes have been so spectacularly successful as a species that we have come to think of ourselves as invincible and we are not. Our success will, sooner rather than later, catch up with us because the global economy of environmental resources is, after all, finite. The modern reader will recognize all too well that the book's imperative rings even truer today, despite Morris' having to sound like a fanatic at the time of its initial publishing. Ironically, Morris suggests, the naked ape's first step toward salvation will be the recognition of his true nature. To go forward we have to take an honest look at where we came from."

274,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21322837-heather-mcalister,1,"Backwards, sexist, racist drivel. Written by a man obviously trying to stroke his own ego by arguing how ""objectively,"" when you look at it from the impartial perspective of a rational (male) scientist, early hominids clearly evolved to walk upright, lose their fur, use tools, develop spoken language, etc. ALL so that males could hunt in groups like wolves or lions. Literally every physiological feature of the modern homo sapien, according to the ""impartial"" male Desmond Morris, was led by ""hot-blooded,"" aggressive alpha males to hunt and kill. The invention of tools being so men could hunt; walking upright so men could see over grass; learning to talk so men could communicate complex hunting strategies; the loss of fur so men wouldn't die of heatstroke running in the hot African climate, etc.And the women? Oh, they just evolved to be child-rearers and home-makers. They sat around in caves suckling their babes like mama wolves in their dens with cubs (never mind that real mother wolves are out of the den in weeks, and often dump their pups on a babysitter as soon as they possibly can) waiting with baited breath for the menfolk to come home and share the spoils of the hunt with them.And all the physical features early female hominids not covered by his ""male hunting"" explanation? Like female hominid larger breasts, wider birthing hips, hominids developing downward facing noses, etc? Oh, they just evolved to ""make sex sexier."" (I'm not kidding. That's what it says in the book.) Female hominids have larger breasts than other greater apes? It's because the males found it sexy. Female hominids have wider hips? Males found it sexy. Downward facing noses? Same thing. Homo sapiens have fuller lips than other greater apes? Because it made kissing sexier, and kissing is a great evolutionary foreplay to sex.The minute I stopped reading was when Desmond Morris claimed that (white) homo sapiens having pink lips because it gave them a pouty kissable look, thus making them look more kissable, thus more desirable as a mate. And what of certain black Africans who tend to have enough melanin in their skin not to have pink lips, and/or have fuller, puffier lips? According to Desmond Morris, it's because they're evolutionary failures who had to evolve fuller lips to make up for not having the desired pink lips that more evolutionary successful (white) homo sapiens possess. (Which, according to him, are like those living in North America. Not the ""obscure"" cultures in Africa that are ""not as evolutionary successful,"" his words. Never mind that white 'North American' culture as we know it has only existed for a few centuries at most, and hasn't withstood the test of time the way the 'obscure' African cultures have, which have stood for centuries, if not millennia.) This book is a transparent straight white male ego stroke, where a guy who fancies himself ""rational"" and ""objective"" breaks his arm patting himself, as a straight white male homo sapien, on the back for being ""an evolutionary success."" According to him, EVERY SINGLE physiological trait of the entire modern homo sapien species came from (presumably white) men of eons past being big strong hunters. Women and people of color were just hanger-ons who reaped the evolutionary benefits of the past (presumably) straight white male hunters' ingenuity. And every trait females have that males (presumably) don't is because the males found it sexy, or it aided in bearing the males' children. And every trait that people of color have that whites don't was formed to compensate the ""evolutionary disadvantage"" of not being white.Also, I took a few anthropology classes in community college. Almost every point he ever made has been largely disproven, or called into serious question. Fuck this guy, fuck this book. The fact that people still read this sexist, racist drivel and see it as anything resembling fact is frankly insulting to the whole homo sapien species."
275,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19627177-n-jr,5,"A fascinating read by a great thinker. Virtually no aspect of human nature and physiognomy escapes his keen zoologist eyes; even responses such as smiling, laughing and crying. However, be warned: not only is this book nearly 50 years old and therefore outdated, but one must ingest his words with a large heaping of salt. As a scientific treatise it fails. The best way to read it is to consider this the personal musings of a biologist/anthropologist, not the findings of an expert researcher. It's greatest value is in instigating thought on the subject. It is the step-back-and look-at-ourselves approach which is of real value here, not his (sometimes hilarious)conclusions.His explanation of the protuberance and shape of female breasts developing as a frontal sexual display resulting from our upright posture, rather than for increased efficiency of nursing, is presented as a credible argument. Mmm, maybe that explains the human male's fascination with them.Most of his observations are comparative, highlighting similarities and differences between other mammals, notably the chimpanzee. In all cases, Morris makes us think about many aspects of ourselves that we normally take for granted.One criticism I have is his over-emphasis on genetic origins - for example, he claims the pair-bond formation between sexes (i.e monogamy) is genetic rather than cultural - afraid I disagree there. Also his treatment of warfare is incomplete and not entirely satisfactory for me.I know others will attack the author as chauvinistic (not only in regards the sexes, but cultures as well), but still, hey, the book can just be considered food for thought.All in all, a stimulating read, one so rich that I have marked it for a second time around in the future. It helped me to come up with my own thoughts on the subject"
276,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4373676-jonathan-david-jackson,5,"Really a very interesting book. It's written as if the author were writing it about any other animal, and hearing myself talked about as if I am a naked mole rat or a chimpanzee is very refreshing (this doesn't give you permission to refer to me as such in polite society, btw). We are animals as much as any other, and we should consider all the things that make us what we are, including our animal instincts and our biological history.There are some ideas I think are odd, for example when he says that adults want to save elephants from extinction mainly because of our own impending individual extinction (death). Some things seem like just his opinion, and don't make sense to me. All the ideas, though - every single one - I found to be interesting. There were plenty of things I'd heard before (after all, it's a 40 year old book), but there were also plenty of things I hadn't heard which were totally new to me, and made me reconsider some of my own ideas. One such idea I have is that clothes are something unnatural, something to be avoided. He puts it to us that humans are a very sexual species, unlike other animals which have a mating season we are ready all the time, and unlike other animals which need to do something special to display their genitals ours are visible all the time, so to avoid making sexual displays to everyone all the time, we cover up. I've thought about most of my opinions long and hard for many years, and reading anything that makes me consider changing them is a rare and wonderful experience which had me turning each page almost in awe at what I had found before and might find after.I have the other two books in this series, and I can't wait to read them next."
277,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180947-j,3,"Desmond Morris raises some interesting points in this book, some more farfetched than others. Honestly, I have problems with a lot of the points he makes in this book. Attempting to explain everything we do by comparing us to our nearest relatives in the animal kingdom is like I said interesting but the truth is many of our behaviors are unique to our species because of our advanced intellect and I think simplifying them by saying they can be explained by looking at the behaviors of other primates is not entirely accurate. Furthermore, he makes a few mistakes I wouldn't expect anyone familiar with biology to make (including the 'tongue-map' for taste recognition) as well as taking a very eurocentric stance on human behavior. His postulations aren't really backed up with anything more than the observation of other primates which by itself can't really be used to explain our behavior. Along with his insistance on using North Americans and Europeans as the model for humanity, I have to say that this book is more rooted in speculation than fact and shouldn't be taken seriously as a work of science. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining read and worthy of the 3 stars I gave it."
278,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027404-david-o-brien,5,"Fascinating reading and life affirming in an unexpected way. The most common complaint about this book is lack of evidence or proof. Morris states clearly that he did not list all the evidence because it would turn the book into an encyclopedia. There is a bibliography at the end for those who want to see where he got his information and inspiration.The style of the book is not purely scientific in so far as he he makes assumptions and draws conclusions from his own experience and his research, which makes for very interesting reading, however can be interpreted as imprecise. Just because something is not 100% proven, that does not mean that it is not interesting, relevant, thought provoking or inspirational. Throughout the book there are segments I might not wholly agree with, however the scope of the book is so vast yet still well tied together and coherent that it deserves 5/5. A brave book that even today is refreshing, educational, inspiring and a break from convention."
279,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5763793-jean,3,"I disagree with those who say this book is homophobic and/or misogynistic. Morris says some things that in normal conversational context might be dubbed as such, but his explicit purpose was to view mans behavior from an objective standpoint. He succeeds. Political correctness has no place in (even attempted) scientific writing. He DOES state that gay couples cannot procreate on their own. However he goes on to discuss scenarios where this may be a pro. Don't overreact. When I read this book, I was unaware it was written decades ago. Morris' observations were fairly elementary to me, I assume since I grew up hearing a good deal of them. It is still quite enjoyable to read despite my experience. "
280,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56218095-benehime,2,"In theory a good book, but so Sooooo outdated. The author adopts a super-alpha-male stance and women have only evolved because it served men. Don't you think they did anything other than having children!! Morris thinks that working is today's form of hunting and women obviously have no place there. also, male relaxing can only ever happen with an all male group. There are some interesting parts though, I loved the chapter about grooming and fighting (sad to see that he left out the vastly different way men and women fight, but oh, I forgot, women don't)."
281,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5155466-clare,2,"I found this book to be very disappointing. Morris makes some interesting statements about human behavior, but unfortunately, he has almost nothing that could be called evidence for anything that he poses as fact. Although at first I thought I might be unfairly judging it because his sexual politics differ from mine and his understanding of human sexuality is dated to say the least, his statements on non-sex-related behaviors are equally unsupported."

There are a few outdated ideas present which betray the year this was written (1967) but nonetheless Morris displays a fine understanding of evolutionary theory and animal behavior and applies it with wit and clear, concise language to our upright species."

291,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,3,"Objective SummaryThis book explores the evolution, biology, psychology, and sociology of human beings. Morris refers to humans as the “naked ape” in an attempt to remove his cultural and experiential biases from his analysis, and to remind his readers that they, like all humans, are just evolved animals. Morris attempts to objectively describe human beings’ features, behavior, and the reasons for both in the same way a zoologist would describe any newly discovered species. The defining characteristic about human beings is our intelligence. But that intelligence is mapped crudely onto base animalistic tendencies and necessities. Rather than jumping straight to our intelligence, which may cloud important but elementary observations, Morris refers to us as the “naked ape,” a statement on our physical appearance as nearly hairless primates. Despite any attempts to ignore or transcend our animal roots, they persist. Morris explores human evolution, sex, child rearing, exploration, fighting, feeding, pursuit of comfort, and interaction with other animals. Listed below are some of the main lessons and interesting tidbits.•	Humans evolved from monkeys and apes. We moved from forests to the plains, though one theory suggests we moved from forests to seaside coasts to the plains. •	We moved from a vegetarian to an omnivore diet when we left the forest. This required cooperative hunting and defensive parties of males within the social hierarchy. This cooperation could now be a contributing factor to the development of gangs and wars.•	Neoteny, or extension of childhood development, played a significant role in human evolution. It allowed the human brain to continue to develop and grow for decades after birth, and it required pair-bonding between males and females to support the extended adolescence of their offspring. •	Pair-bonding helped females remain faithful to their mates, it reduced social friction between males over mating access, and it helped in rearing the slow-developing children. Pair-bonding is powerful but imperfect. The female orgasm, which is unusual if not unique to humans, was a contributor to pair-bonding. •	Why humans are relatively hairless isn’t known with certainty. The most popular theory is that it aids cooling during times of extreme exertion, like hunting. •	Much of our appearance is sexual signaling. Relatively large penises and breasts, red lips, and hairlessness all likely have sexual origins. Pubic and armpit hair likely trap pheromones for sexual arousal. •	80% of mothers hold infants in their left arms most likely because their heartbeat soothes their young.•	Animals fight to establish the dominance hierarchy and defend territory. They do not use their weapons to try to kill members of their own species because that would not be evolutionarily advantageous. Successful species establish aggressive and submissive displays that can substitute for actual physical confrontation and reduce physical harm and death. Bowing and avoiding eye contact are submissive signs. Standing tall and direct eye contact are dominant or aggressive signs. •	Human weaponry permits fatal action from afar. Our inability to observe submissive signals may contribute to additional killing and destruction. •	Curiosity serves a vital function to an opportunistic species. It has led humans to discover new lands, invent new tools, and try new foods. Curiosity has expanded into arts, science, and technology. There is a perpetual balance between novelty and familiarity. We want the excitement of the former with the security of the latter. By pushing the boundaries and exploring, we discover new and better ways to feed, protect, and comfort ourselves. •	Human desire for sweet foods can lead to obesity.•	Humans domesticated dozens of species of animals for food (cows, chickens, goats, pigs), companionship (dogs, cats, horses), transportation (horses, camels, elephants), experimentation (mice, rats, guinea pigs), and other tasks like plowing and hauling heavy stuff (horses, donkeys, oxen). •	Dogs were likely domesticated when we took wolf pups to fatten them up for food. Then we realized they could help us hunt and alert us to danger. There are breeds of dogs that are herders, scent-trackers, setters and pointers to prey, retrievers, killers of vermin, and guard dogs.•	Animals have five basic relationships with other animals: prey, symbiont, competitor, parasite, and predator.•	Religion may have roots in the need for an ultimately powerful being at the top of a hierarchy.•	12,000 British kids listed their favorite animals as: 1. Chimpanzee, 2. Monkey, 3. Horse, 4. Bushbaby, 5. Panda, 6. Bear, 7. Elephant, 8. Lion, 9. Dog, 10. Giraffe. They tend to have anthropomorphic features like sitting or moving upright and having highly expressive faces.•	12,000 British kids listed their most hated animals as: 1. Snake, 2. Spider, 3. Crocodile, 4. Lion, 5. Rat, 6. Skunk, 7. Gorilla, 8. Rhinoceros, 9. Hippopotamus, 10. Tiger. These are all dangerous. •	To survive as a civilization and a species, we must recognize and submit to our biological features. They cannot all be overcome through thought, culture, or technology. Subjective ThoughtsI read this book because the dude in the movie “Bring It On” was reading it during a high school football game. It was interesting and thought-provoking, but much of the content seemed familiar. That makes sense since I am a naked ape and have interacted with them all my life. And I think much of this material was covered in my biology textbooks back in the day.It was impossible for me to miss how much a product of its time this book was. Written in 1967, Morris was only five years removed from the Cuban missile crisis, and nuclear annihilation was clearly on his mind. He also harbored Malthusian fears of continued population growth, resource strain, and territorial strife. He anticipated the Ehrlichs’ “Population Bomb,” which would be published one year later. He seemed quite pessimistic on both the nuclear annihilation and overpopulation fronts. If he were to update the book today, he’d no doubt include global cooling, I mean global warming, errr global climate change in his list of calamities. Fortunately, as I type this, nukes haven’t dropped in anger since ’45, Trump may be in the process of solving Korea, reproduction rates have slowed across the developed world and sometimes below replacement levels, and there are alternative albeit expensive energy sources. Not that I’m worried enough about any of this to shut off the air conditioner or my computer. And this Honeycrisp apple from Walmart is amazing. Morris should also update his advice on how to handle being pulled over by police. His suggestion is to immediately leave your car and approach the officer so that you two don’t interact on “your” territory near your car, which will make the officer feel threatened. That shit will get you shot today. Stay in your car with your hands on the wheel, and wait to move until you’re told. You don’t want to suddenly approach someone with a Glock 17 on standby.Memorable Quotes“A solitary monkey or ape is a vulnerable creature. It lacks the powerful natural weapons of the carnivore and in isolation falls easy prey to the stalking killers.”“It is only a wise primate, like our hunting ape, that knows its own father.”“The male reaches the consummatory act of sperm ejaculation within a few minutes in most cases, unless deliberate delaying tactics are employed. . . . Some females may reach this point very quickly, others not at all, but on the average it is attained between ten and twenty minutes after the start of copulation.”“Its normal, average length of nine and a half centimetres is increased by seven to eight centimetres. The diameter is also considerably increased, giving the species the largest erect penis of any living primate.”“After a gestation period of approximately 266 days her uterus begins to contract powerfully and rhythmically.”“The average weight of a baby at birth is just over seven pounds, which is slightly more than one-twentieth of the weight of the average parent.”“Lucky is the society that enjoys the gradual acquisition of a perfect balance between imitation and curiosity, between slavish, unthinking copying and progressive, rational experimentation.”“In all exploratory behaviour, whether artistic or scientific, there is the ever-present battle between the neophilic and neophobic urges. The former drives us on to new experiences, makes us crave for novelty. The latter holds us back, makes us take refuge in the familiar. We are constantly in a state of shifting balance between the conflicting attractions of the exciting new stimulus and the friendly old one. If we lost our neophilia we would stagnate. If we lost our neophobia, we would rush headlong into disaster.”“We are, to put it mildly, in a mess, and there is a strong chance that we shall have exterminated ourselves by the end of the century.”“Animals fight amongst themselves for one of two very good reasons: either to establish their dominance in a social hierarchy, or to establish their territorial rights over a particular piece of ground.” “If a species is to survive, it simply cannot afford to go around slaughtering its own kind. Intra-specific aggression has to be inhibited and controlled, and the more powerful and savage the prey-killing weapons of a particular species are, the stronger must be the inhibitions about using them to settle disputes with rivals.”“To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion. Abortion is a drastic measure and can involve serious emotional disturbance. Furthermore, once a zygote has been formed by the act of fertilization it constitutes a new individual member of society, and its destruction is, in effect, an act of aggression, which is the very pattern of behaviour that we are attempting to control. Contraception is obviously preferable, and any religious or other ‘moralizing’ factions that oppose it must face the fact that they are engaged in dangerous war-mongering.”“We each possess about 10,000 of these taste buds, but in old age they deteriorate and decrease in number, hence the jaded palate of the elderly gastronome. Surprisingly, we can only respond to four basic tastes. They are: sour, salt, bitter, and sweet.”“Domestication of livestock, involving the organized control and selective breeding of prey, is known to have been practised for at least ten thousand years and, in certain cases, probably much longer. Goats, sheep and reindeer appear to have been the earliest prey species dealt with in this way.”“It is probable that [an interspecific bond between humans and dogs] began as a result of young puppies being brought in to the tribal home base to be fattened as food.”“Unless we can colonize other planets on a massive scale and spread the load, or seriously check our population increase in some way, we shall, in the not-too-far distant future, have to remove all other forms of life from the earth. . . . We need not dwell on this nightmare: the possibility of its becoming a reality is remote.”"

While it's a good review of instinctive human behaviour it is expectionally light into actual comparisons to other primates.He does make interesting points, e.g. noting that when the forests started to disappear we converged towards carnivore traits but by using artificial weapons rather than natural ones we did not need to move towards becoming like cats/dogs (though he doesn't note that other plains primates probably did so more than us). He notes the importance of us acquiring home bases where the females were left, and hence the need to develop more clear territories, pair bonds and ability to share food with family/tribe.He talks about how adolescents acquite the need to go off and develop their own home. But here he doesn't spend any time discussing what's actually known about how humans do this. It's actually remarkable how variable this is across different societies (albeit it generally has fixed form within a society). Sometimes it it the male, sometimes the female. These are generally species fixed traits, and yet he doesn't cover this.He talks about how the development of a pair bond meant that we needed to start hiding our sexual features in public. He notes that other species generally sustain the pair bond through aggression, but we do it instead by wearing clothes and avoiding touching each other.It's quite an old book and features some exceptional examples of envirionmentalist (e.g. blank slate) thinking from the era it was written, which is somewhat startling in a book which otherwise fully acknowledges that we are creatures driven by innate behaviours. For instance, he talks about how if a mother is tense and smiles to conceil it, the baby will detect it and mistake the function of a smile... he then warns that this could be permanently damaging and cause the child serious social difficulties... nuttier environmentalist claptrap than that is only spewed forth by modern SJWs but I guess it was par for the course back then. The section on music and it's relation to mothers heart beat is similarly whacko.A section of the book deals with our innate sounds/actions, e.g. laughter and smiling. Discussion about how they evolved is perhaps questionable. Notes things like when a baby smiles it waves it's arms and legs around, and suggests this is the vestigial primate clinging response. There's also curious little factoids, like our 'sweet tooth' being a distinct primate thing that other carnivores don't generally have.An interesting section is when he talks about how men go along to trade unions, social clubs , learned societies etc as an equivilent of the hunting pack. They do so to experience our built in bond from male togetherness. Interestingly, this was written before it became taboo to go to male only societies. One suspects that the author would not thus be suprised that membership of all voluntary societies has utterly collapsed since women were permitted to join them (see Putnam's 'Bowling Alone'). He also describes how work is probably a poor substitute for hunting for the working classes in a manner that it is not for the middle class. Expresses it in a manner that is probably illegal these days.A key point the author wants to get across in the book is that we're going through a population boom and being forced into living in environments increasingly more crowded and distrinct from what we evolved for. He talks about how the modern usage of soulless featureless architecture where everything looks the same flys against our built in desire to mark territory as our own through personalisation (declaring quite rightly that modern architects are terrorists). He is sceptical about the ability of us to adapt our innate behaviour. On that, he is probably correct. He could have argued his case better (and I believe that in his next book he went on to do so). "
293,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13626166-siddarth-gore,5,"So there he stands, our vertical, hunting, weapon-toting, territorial, neotenous, brainy, Naked Ape, a primate by ancestry and a carnivore by adoption, ready to conquer the world.We evolved from apes. But exactly how far did we get? Your guesses might be way off the mark. This book says that under the surface we are ruled mostly by our inner primates. Things just look different on us. Evolution is too slow a process for us to have shed our animal past.In our species there is, as we have seen, a strong tendency to ‘fall in love’—to develop a powerful bond with the object of our sexual attentions.No primates are monogamous so why are we? The answer comes from our adaptation to life on the plains of Africa once we were thrown out of the jungle perhaps due to environmental changes. Hint, pack hunters need cooperation from all males.They occur with particularly high frequency during the initial stages of social encounters, where hidden fears and aggressions are lurking just below the surface. At a dinner party, or any small social gathering, as soon as the mutual appeasement ceremonies of hand-shaking and smiling are over, displacement cigarettes, displacement drinks and displacement food-snacks are immediately offered.This was the most fascinating part. Monkeys and apes are very much social animals with hierarchy being most crucial thing on their minds. How did we get rid of that, or did we? Even the most innocuous conversations and meetings are anything but that for your social relations obsessed brain. To sum up then, the best solution for ensuring world peace is the widespread promotion of contraception or abortion.His argument is that cramming animals in compact spaces invariably leads to aggression. We might think we are special but think again. Only way to make sure we do not turn against each other is to give everyone enough space. Debatable, but interesting viewpoint none the less.Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else.One can only hope ;-)"
294,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98103014-jonas,4,"This book was first published in 1967 and I found it to be somewhat of a foreboding book.I was first introduced into many of these concepts regarding “the naked ape’s” ecological role and behaviour from other books, such as Ishmael by Daniel Quinn and The Selfish Gene by Dawkins. Though those books are written about something else, I found myself thinking of those books while I was reading this one. Many of the arguments presented in those books could be paralleled with the comparative elements between the human and ape presented throughout this book.Each chapter though succinct, presents an interesting perspective on the anatomy of the human body, as well as our behavioural aspects against the bodies and social practices of other ape species. I thought many of the ideas were very inventive, but the chapter on sex comes across as crass and salacious, but otherwise, the book presents itself in a very tame manner.Whilst the book contains many fantastic ideas, I can see why this book created controversy within the feminist/homosexual communities. The book even manages to squeeze in a supporting message for contraceptives and population control. Overall, I think the book makes for an interesting read, but is by no means the best book regarding the topic especially in modern day, due to changing of the zeitgeist from the late 1960’s to the prevalence of technology today (even though some of the fears might still be present today). Despite that, I still think it’s worth a read to understand how it was relevant at that time, and how it has paved a way and introduced the idea of comparative ethology to the general public."
295,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31705775-gerardo-alonso,4,"The Naked Ape is a mirror. While reading it, one sees a reflection of oneself. But unlike many other reflections, this one is raw and based on our biological characteristics. This reflection breaks down our egos and social constructs to their bare bones. Desmond Morris attempts to show humanity that we are merely a species of the Animal KingdomI found the book inspiring, and highly effective to understand characteristic behaviours we may have. It feels as if someone is saying what one has already known but could not figure out the words to explain it.While this book is very powerful philosophically, I think it lacks thoroughness in logic. One of the things that concerns me is that it seems to me that Morris takes a one-sided view of several arguments sometimes based on factoids/opinions that may debatable. Another difficulty I find is the ease of comparison between the Homo Sapiens and the apes. While true that we share a very similar DNA structure, I think that Morris not only tries to link biological similarities (which he does in a great way in the beginning of the book), but also behavioural similarities.I get that in some cases or themes, the behaviour among species will be the same. The fight or flight response, for example. But when highly specific social interactions are compared between species, Morris should have analysed the Naked Ape by itself.It may be the case that some of the science behind the book is outdated, since this was published in the 60s. Regardless of the leaps Morris takes, this book is worth reading as a biology, anthropology and history lesson of our species. "
296,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"I had a great time reading this book. Despite coming out almost fifty years ago when I found it, much of what it says is still thought provoking and relevant. The book owes a little bit to psychoanalysis which was more dominant at the time. Which is good since Morris uses it to good effect to tie together physiological and behavioral facts into a general theory of human nature. What is that theory of human nature? Well, that we are the way we are because our ancestors were forced to become a predator species/hunting-ape and couldn't stay in and around trees picking fruits. Millions of years ago in Africa, during the Miocene, the forests started to disappear, and the apes could either cling onto whatever was left, or leave the ""garden of Eden"" and enter into competition with the predators on the ground. Ape populations have dwindled since, and we have emerged the apex predator. To get to that point we had to overcome the other predators, but with inferior equipment so to speak; no fangs or claws. So we made use of two things carried over to a certain degree from our ape past; intelligence and social communication. ""His whole body, his way of life, was geared to a forest existence, and then suddenly he was jettisoned into a world where he could survive only if he began to live like a brainy, weapon toting wolf."" Our social lives are to this day built on a sort of tension between social communication and intellect (from ape life) and group loyalty and hunting from our predator existence. Vestiges of our ape life are our greater reliance on sight at the expense of smell and a more various taste palate. Our predator life involves traveling greater distances to find game, rather than remaining close to the trees, having a home base to protect and return to, and having regular meals rather than momentary snacking. Being a predatory ape means developing ways to facilitate male cooperation, to hunt together with dangerous weapons, and to guarantee a share of the kills and a female for the effort. Monogamy and private property likely arise from a need to secure the loyalty of males to females and children while they hunted and prevent conflict among the males. This isn't all bad, as the predator life means some degree of male solidarity. We can't have a single alpha male who gets exclusive access to women and food. The ability to cooperate and use weapon technology means the lesser males can gang up and resist, limit, or kill the alpha male. Thus some satisfactory distribution of females and resources becomes necessary for social order, and this is likely where marriage and property and even government developed from. Morris channels Sigmund Freud and argues that religion emerges from the guilt of (symbolically) killing the alpha ape. Even with all his faults, an all powerful male does instill some sort of order and security which is socially useful. You knew where you stood, and the alpha ape in a way encouraged exogamous mating, preventing incest by kicking the sons out of the harem. So religion projects the seemingly omnipotent alpha ape onto the cosmos, extending its influence to our personal lives without actually being here. There are several downsides that ape life has: lack of cooperation (among males), a pecking order with one individual on top, and less incentive to control nature. Ape and monkey society is more about competition and dominance, and dependent on nature providing food for the picking. Depending on the environment means not traveling too far and remaining close, thus reducing the need for defense of home as well as needing to know what others are up to as they aren't far. If we just forage for food, there isn't a need to cooperate. It's ""finders keepers"", and so dominance becomes more important. The alpha male gets the first pick, and so long as everybody abides conflict can be avoided, with little need to work together other than staying out of the big guy's way. Despite all these downsides, we are still closest to the apes. We haven't evolved to be complete predators, just enough behaviors to utilize our intelligence and social cooperation to survive and thrive. And we only evolved that way because the environment made us, forced us out east of Eden. It seems that much of our aesthetics, tastes, curiosity, and enjoyment of life are owed to our more ape aspects. A pure predator kind of society would resemble the Spartans I think. What we do in leisure however reflects both aspects of our nature, in varying degrees. The popularity of sports and online first person shooter video games reflects the more predator side. More relaxing and solitary activities like cooking or painting reflect the ape side. As for the title, the naked ape, the reason why we don't have a full coat of fur is to aid us in hunting; cooling us down by chasing animals. Other predators can make fast dashes after prey, but our bipedal stature and the occupation of our hands makes this difficult. ""By losing the heavy coat of hair and by increasing the number of sweat glands all over the body surface, considerable cooling could be achieved- not for minute by minute living, but for the supreme moments of the chase."" Our subcutaneous fat and ability to fashion clothes help keep us warm without fur. With the help of neoteny, the retaining of youthful traits into adulthood, all this explains our appearance as the naked ape. Younger chimps have flatter faces, a long slender neck, smaller teeth, absence of heavy brow ridges, non-rotating big toe, and more hair on the head than the rest of the body. Our extended childhood also allows us to develop our powerful brains. A desire to explore and learn new things are also associated with youth, and so we are the young ape as well as the naked ape. Though of course neoteny is selective, as we aren't attracted to infant genitals, infantile emotions, or infantile strength. The book is full of interesting speculations about behavior, always trying to link us to our animal nature. The message of the book is that we are still operating with an animal mindset no matter how developed we are. Even the most complex behaviors like pacing back and forth and the conduct of war harken back to our more modest origins."

Grazie, Mr. Gabbani (you were my personal winner anyways... and that is kind of all I know in Italian).Thus study was such a positive disappointment! I was afraid it would be too academical for my humanities-oriented brain... but guys, if you want to read a study on how humans evolved from apes and ""the missing links"" and how certains traditions and habits of ours formed, that is really interesting and really easy to read, it is for you. I read that Desmond Morris said he wanted to de-mistify science... and I could not put it better. The explanation is really clear, easy to understand and there were some really interesting and cool facts about certain human behaviour that we still practice... it was really interesting to see where they could come from.Also: if you are a really devout creatonist, I'd recommend you only read the book if you do not get triggered by reading full-on declared truths about evolution (as I believe in evolution and the scientific research that are supposed to prove it, I did not have any issues)."

We mustn't forget when was developed this essay, as well as the possible intentions of the author.The last chapter of the book is just... funny. Suddenly, Morris seems to see sex in the explanations about why we like some animals instead of others (maybe he was possessed by Freud when he wrote the last pages) and the justifications about animal exploitation are, some of them, just ridiculous. But I'm totally agree with one of the ideas in this book, and is that the world is overpopulated by the human beings and that it would be necessary to reduce the population (not killing people!), promoting and facilitating the use of contraceptive measures.In summary: to be careful with some of the contents in the book, but is a really interesting reading in my opinion."
299,0385334303,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58948646-hendrik-borginon,5,"When starting to read The Naked Ape, I expected it to be severely outdated (it was published in '67 after all). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book aged as well as can be expected. Desmond Morris writes from a zoologist's perspective and tries to describe man as if he were an external observer of our species. He analyses us and our behaviours from a very functional point of view. In the first chapters he mostly explores our physiological characteristics (and the differences between us and our closest animal relatives) and offers various evolutionary explanations for how they could have come to be. The zoologist's perspective proves to be very insightful for this purpose and I learned a great deal. In later chapters he starts to focus more on our behaviour. Though still thought-provoking, much of what he says is very speculative and his views on women and homosexuality are strongly influenced by the era in which the book was written.Despite some of these outdated speculations, it is still extremely interesting and insightful. I would recommend it to anyone who's fascinated by human evolution. "
