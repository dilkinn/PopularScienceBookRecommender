0,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,4,"This is a profoundly shocking piece of writing, a tactic which Yuval Noah Harari uses to great effect in getting readers to think about society today. The book is ostensibly about the future of mankind, but really is a means of highlighting how current trends in science, technology, humanity etc may progress and asks if that's really how we want things to go. It's philosophy. That big question that has been posed throughout the ages: how should we live? He makes clear that his hypotheses are only potential ways the future might unfold, but the text comes across as a warning as much as anything else.For me, the most interesting and thought-provoking was his argument for the better treatment of animals. While we have placed ourselves at the top of the species ladder, new advents in technology may bring about computer technologies which replace us in the number one spot. Considering we may well end up in the unenviable position of the underdog, perhaps we should take more care of those who, like us, may well depend on the goodwill of this higher in the chain. Not only that, modern technology has increasingly allowed us to understand the emotional and intellectual complexity of animals in a way that should make it difficult to treat them as lesser beings. This is an issue that has been playing on my mind for some time. It seems like every week now we are getting news reports of another animal ripped from its habitat for a selfie and dying as a result. Pictures of intensive farming that have animals in cages so small they can't lay down. My social media newsfeed of animals mistreated, dumped, abused, given no more thought than a piece of trash. Harari is a vegan and his specific set of beliefs come across in the text. Yet, as a current meat eater, it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify my position. I don't know what to do that can help and the book doesn't offer any concrete plans for change, but it has added another dimension to the considerations I have been struggling with myself.Overall though, it is Harari's style which is the most engaging. I rushed though this book because even the most complex issues are dealt with in accessible language and an approachable tone. It's fun and despite the subject matter, doesn't take itself too seriously. It felt like the starting point of a conversation, somewhat controversial of course, but isn't that the best way to get a debate going?Many thanks to Yuval Noah Harari, Random House/Vintage, and Netgalley for this copy in exchange for an honest review."
1,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,2,"This book reads like the author read a number of popular science articles, watched some sci-fi movies, attended a transhumanist meetup, got just a bit high on weed and then started writing."
2,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Homo ObsoletusThe audacious first act, Sapiens, ended with a wild and apocalyptic prophesy - that the Sapiens were cooking up the next epochal revolution that will overshadow the previous three: the cognitive, agricultural and scientific/industrial revolutions. Home Deus, the second act, is the full exploration of that prophesy. Both Sapiens and Homo Deus are compulsory reading in my book, even though the macro-history presented is plenty vulnerable to all sorts of attacks. But then, it might be better to think of these as works of philosophy and not of history. Just like Sapiens is not a History, Home Deus is not a prophesy, both are explorations. This line can be taken as the transition line that links the first book with the second one:“Having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival struggles, we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods, and turn Homo sapiens into Homo deus.”The old enemies of mankind— plague, famine and war—are now under control. Except for the potentially restrictive energy constraint, Sapiens has very little standing in our way now. The result is that the Sapiens are becoming more and more God-like, Harari says, and one is forced to pause and reflect: by any previous standards of our history, are we not already Gods? Have we not already exceeded most wild power fantasies? Well yes, but even more God-like attributes are coming: cheating death and creating new life being primary.And along with this march towards the godlike we are marching towards being machine-like too, as we outsource more and more of our internal algorithms to better data-based external algorithms. And the march is relentless, Homo Deus is taking birth before our eyes. The tomorrow is already upon us, and so forth.However, just like the previous three revolutions that infused the Sapiens with power, this revolution too will come at a price, the price of a ratcheting up of inequality. The new Gods will be the techno-super-rich. BTW, reading Harari is good motivation to work on getting rich faster: he hints at a possibility that anyone who is rich enough to afford it, some 50 years into the future, should be able to buy proxy-immortality. And it will probably be a window that closes quickly, since the super-rich would soon take over the monopoly on immortality. So if you are rich enough at the right point in time, then you can be part of Olympus too. That might not be a deal many would want to miss out on… There is one more catch: as technology takes over most of the functions, even the godlike sapiens will find themselves stuck in a universe devoid of real meaning. Bulk of humanity will have no economic, social or cultural purpose since anything we can do our new creations would be able to do even better. “Organisms are algorithms,” and the new algorithms will be so much better than the imperfect ones we are made of. As Bill Gates asked in his article about the book, “What If People Run Out of Things to Do?” We will be stuck in an immortal meaninglessness, our own creations clearly our betters. We will need a new religion to make sense of all this, since the powerful combo of Humanism+Science will not work in world where the sanctity of being Human has lost meaning. Harari feels that “Dataism” will be the religion that will fill the avoid left by Humanism. The whole of Humanity, the Earth, and maybe the entire Universe will become servants to data - a huge data-processing system, the eternal all-knowing Atman. And serving this goal will be the only meaningful pursuit left for us. Immortal, All-powerful, Obsolete: this is the future of the Sapiens."
3,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31791908-nir,2,"Harari is a fantastic historian: he writes effortlessly and fascinatingly about historic trends, and has a great big picture perspective of the revolutions and contexts of historical progression.Harari, however, is not a good futurologist and an absolutely terrible cognitive scientist. Being educated in Cognitive Science and technology myself, all I can say, with the utmost respect I can offer to a fellow Israeli, is that he's full of shit.Homo Deus is an attempt to make a sequel to the wildly popular (and actually quite good) ""From Animals into Gods"" - its main thesis is that in the 21st century, liberal humanism would progress into ""techno humanism""; and that humanity's main efforts would be to upgrade humans into some bizarre godlike cyborg entity. He focuses on some aspects of modern progress (e.g. genetic engineering) and extrapolates completely insane uses. An example of a claim that he makes: In the near future, the efforts of medical science would be tuned to upgrading the rich rather than healing the diseases of the poor.His underlying zeal for a hunter gatherer sociological eco-utopia notwithstanding - this is bullshit, and focuses on a remote obscure threat rather than a very real threat that's already here: If there's a threat to modern society from modern medical science, it's is the personalization of medicine, rather than ""upgrades"". That is, drugs would be concocted to be maximally efficient according to a genotype. This is already happening at a very rough scale (for instance, there are drugs that are more effective on people of African American descent) - but in the near future, rather than upgrade themselves, the rich people would simply have far more effective cancer treatment because they'd be able to afford genotyping and personal medicine.If the cyborg-upgrade part sounds to you like a bad synopsis of a Neal Stephenson novel, you're absolutely right. Let's all jack into the Matrix now! Needless to say, the views have the grounding in scientific and research reality that a SciFi fanfic about Kirk banging Uhura has, and it is written with the same brain addling juvenile exuberance.Read the first book of his; avoid the second."
4,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,4,"Homo Deus is not quite as factual and cohesive as Sapiens. It falls into the realm of speculation rather than trying to organise and make sense of the world. Sapiens was fantastic because it was almost like a novelisation of human history. It was dramatic and loaded with exciting revelations about what makes us human. It discussed where we came from and where we are now. It was a thought provoking, an exceedingly intelligent piece of writing. With this book Harari looks to the future, to where we may go and how we may get there. And here Harari’s opinion comes across very strongly. He examines our current practices regarding technology and animals. We advance scientifically, but not emotionally or spiritually. We continue to make the same mistakes as we destroy the natural world and ruin our planet. Like me, Harari is a vegan and he is disgusted with current practice. He does not offer an idealistic view of the future (one a vegan would wish for) but instead discusses what will happen if we continue with our erroneous ways. And for me, this took the book to an entirely new level. It became thoughtful, critical and totally necessary. 

“This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But some freedom is better than none.”

 He looks at animals, about what we truly know about them. They are not so different from us, and the way we treat them is deplorable. I could write essays on this subject; I am beyond bitter about it. I’m angry. I’m frustrated. And above all I am so deeply sad. My heart is broken every day because humanity is so terribly unjust to those it deems beneath them. And here Harari adds another element, he considers what would happen if we became a “lesser” lifeform. With the progress in technology and genetic engineering, it is not to far to suggest that computers could replace us or some form of superhuman. So, in a way, we should not act all high and mighty because one day we may be in a very different situation. I don’t find it too hard to believe.I do not doubt that these two books have the potential to change how you think about the world. They will open your eyes to issues you may never have thought about. They’re not to be missed. FBR | Twitter | Facebook | Insta | Academia"

In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human.” ― Yuval Noah Harari, Homo Deus: A Brief History of TomorrowHarari takes us, with this continuation to his blockbuster book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, from the past to the future. This book shares a lot of the same limitations of the previous book. But because ""speculation"" is inherent in writing about the future, Harari's jumps are easier to forgive when talking about tomorrow than when talking about today. I'm a diabetic and have an insulin pump and I've thought of myself, only partially in jest, as a early, unsophisticated, cyborg the last ten years. I walk around with my iphone plugged into my ears, my artificial pancreas plugged into my thigh, my sensor for my pump plugged into my stomach. It isn't very neat. We have miles to go before all of this technology becomes aesthetically amazing, and loses all the wires and clunky functionality, but it still gives me pause about the future. My friend's Tesla drives by itself, big data seems able to predict what I will buy next, my smart phone really is smart. Perhaps we are all surfing towards some Omega Point. I have a friend who is a Transhumanist and it has been interesting to hear him discuss the values and virtues of Transhumanism. I'm a little more hesitant. I'm no Luddite, but I DO worry about these big technological/cultural/commercial shifts. Will technology make Homo Sapiens the next Homo Neanderthalensis? Will these gains through AI, technology, genetic modification, etc., be well-thought-out? Harari hedges by saying he doesn't know what the future brings (If he did, perhaps we should just join his church), but is only using this discussion to suggest the type of ethical and moral and even survival discussions we SHOULD probably be having. As we incrementally crawl towards some form of technological singularity, perhaps we need to give pause to not just the benefits, but costs of self-driving cars and sex robots."

It is simultaneously arrogant and self-debasing; stimulating and depressing. I can therefore only comment on it by suggesting a series of alternative subtitles. Those noted above only scratch the surface of possibilities. It is the last however that I find most insightful and inspiring to further thought. Perhaps an addendum to this review will be necessary at some point."
7,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a powerful book by a truly insightful author. I recently read Harari's previous great book, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, and I enjoyed this one just as much. There is so much packed into Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, that it is hard to do justice to the book in a review. Yuval Harari has such a unique insight into how the world turns. He is sometimes very blunt, but he ""tells it like he sees it."" The first two-thirds of the book is devoted to a description of how the humanist philosophy developed, while the last third is about how humanism may very well fall to the wayside in the not-too-distant future.In the beginning of the book, Harari describes two new human agendas. The first is how humans attempt to extend their lifetimes, and the second is to increase happiness. The goal is to upgrade homo sapiens into homo deus. That is, the desire to re-engineer our bodies and minds, escape old age, death and misery. Basically, to attain divinity. Harari gives numerous examples of how were technologies developed to aid ill or handicapped people, and then were borrowed to help ""normal"" healthy people; prosthetics, bionics, Viagra, memory aid drugs, plastic surgery, and genetic engineering. (In 2000, a baby girl was born with genetic inheritance from three parents; nuclear genes from mother and father, and mitochondrial DNA from another woman! A year later, the U.S. government banned this special treatment, but the U.K. has since approved it.)Harari contends that historians study the past, not in order to repeat it, or to foretell the future, but to be liberated from it. He gives a marvelous example of the history of the grass lawn. He writes that the best reason to study history is not to predict the future, but to ""free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies.""Harari has some interesting insights into the founding of modern religions. He writes that they were founded when humans switched from hunting/foraging to agriculture. A central point of the religions was to give humans dominion over all animals, in order to justify their domestication and superiority, and to justify the terrible suffering humans cause for animals. The agricultural revolution was both an economic and a religious revolution, used to justify brutal exploitation of animals. Agricultural societies also started treating some classes of people as property. I wonder, though, didn't pre-agricultural societies practice slavery? When I try to do some simple online research in this subject, it seems like Harari might be correct; slavery was established to mimic the domestication of animals. And, the agricultural revolution was bad for humans in other ways, as well. A peasant in 1850 in China or Britain had a worse life than an archaic hunter-gatherer, from the point of view of diet and hygiene.Harari has some unique insights into the dichotomy between religion and science. He describes science as a new ""religion"" that replaced theist religions with humanist religions, replacing gods with humans. The hatred of monotheists for the theory of evolution is inspired by the lack of scientific evidence for a human soul. A soul has no parts, and evolution operates through incremental changes to various parts of a whole. But, both religion and science, in theory at least, are both devoted to the truth. But since their truths are different they seem doomed to clash. However, since neither religion nor science really care much about truth, they can coexist. Religion is mostly interested in social order and structure, while science is mostly interested in power. That is, the power to cure disease, fight war and produce food. So, since religion and science prefer order and power over truth, they ""make good bedfellows.""Modernity is a simple deal based on a contract: Humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power. Plagues, droughts and wars have no cosmic meaning to modern humanism, but we have the power to eradicate them. Paradise does not await us after death, but we have the power, in principle, to create paradise here on Earth. Modernity is based on the belief that growth is essential. Growth is the supreme value. Because avarice and greed help to fuel growth, they are encouraged. Traditional religions offer no alternative to liberalism because they are reactive instead of creative. This wasn't always true. During the Middle Ages, Christian monasteries were among the most advanced centers for innovations--Harari lists a number of their innovations. But today religions look to scriptures for answer. But scriptures are no longer a source of creativity, as they say nothing about modern technologies such as genetic engineering or artificial intelligence. Harari describes three different possible futures for humanism. In one of these, liberalism may die out as technology displaces humans. The masses will lose their economic and military importance. Harari suggests that ""Dataism"" may appear as a new religion. Dataism advances the first truly new value in nearly 200 years; the value of freedom of information. Dataism is firmly entrenched in its two mother disciplines, computer science and biology. Organisms are seen by scientists as data-processing systems. The stock market is the most powerful of all data processing systems, and centralized government is one of the worst. Capitalism defeated Communism during the Cold War, not because it is more ethical or because individual liberties are sacred, but because in times of rapid technological change, distributed processing systems work better than centralized systems.Humanists rely on feelings to make important decisions, and these feelings evolved over millions of years. But often our feelings are just irrational and wrong. Computer algorithms can surpass feelings in making good decisions. So, the humanist recommendation to ""get in touch with your feelings"" may not he given in the future. Perhaps, meaning in life will not lie in our experiences, until they are shared with others, through social media. And, these social media will analyze our experiences, and be able to give expert advice on important decisions. Harari gives some pretty good evidence that this trend may come to pass.I do want to quibble with some numbers that Harari proposes. He writes that the one billion cars owned around the world could be reduced to 50 million, if they were jointly owned and operated autonomously. People could share rides. However, people want to commute to work in cars all at the same time. They sit in parking lots at work and at home because people have no need for them during work hours and overnight. But this is perhaps a minor point in Harari's argument. Many people will pooh-pooh much of what Harari has to say. But, it is all extremely thought-provoking. I have just scratched the surface of this book. I highly recommend it to all open-minded people who are not afraid to think a bit differently about the meaning of life, about our political structures, and the future."
8,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,4,"Excellent again. Harari is fast becoming one of my favourite writers.I didn't love  Homo Deus quite as much as  Sapiens, but I think that's because the history Harari takes us through in the latter really does read like a very compelling novel. This book explores different themes and theories about the future of humanity - relating to aging, technological advancements, etc. - which makes it not as cohesive. Still, though, very interesting. He really knows how to break down complex concepts so everyone can understand them."
9,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39575951-helen-2-0,5,"Obviously I need to get a copy of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind because I loved this book. I can't claim to be well-read in the topic of Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, so I'm definitely biased in my opinion that Harari is a genius. Every few pages my copy has lengthy passages highlighted, brilliant bits I just knew I would want to reference when I pitched this book to family and friends later on. In Homo Deus, Harari holds that now that humanity has all but solved the mammoth problems plaguing it before the 21st century - disease, famine, and violence - it will turn to a new agenda, namely attaining happiness, immortality, and divinity. This is what the blurb will tell you, but the book addresses many more topics beyond the above. The author writes about our potential future in terms of our recent and ancient past (he is, after all, first and foremost a historian). He explains how humans distinguished themselves from the animal world and came to recognize the human experience and economic growth as the ultimate powers of the recent centuries. Harari then turns to look at where the unstoppable tide of technology and progress may take us in a few decades - whether intelligent algorithms and a genetically upgraded superhuman elite may make ordinary humans obsolete. His ideas, put starkly, may sound like far-fetched science fiction, but Harari supports his assertions with historical and current evidence as well as deep insights that make his predictions seem chillingly close to prophecy. Even though he states that Homo Deus is meant to help readers explore all possible future routes of humankind, the book still induced an ominous feeling in me the whole way. One of my favorite passages concerns the belief in a potential scientific ""Noah's Ark"" which will deliver the rich and social elite from detrimental future effects of climate change, leaving the poor masses to deal with the fallout: 
Even if bad comes to worse and science cannot hold off the deluge, engineers could still build a hi-tech Noah's Ark for the upper caste, while leaving billions of others to drown. The belief in this hi-tech Ark is currently one of the biggest threats to the future of humankind and of the entire ecosystem. People who believe in the hi-tech Ark should not be put in charge of the global ecology, for the same reason that people who belive in a heavenly afterlife should not be given nuclear weapons.
 Touché.And one of the best ""food for thought"" snippets, in a chapter discussing (among other things) the moral implications of farming animals: 
If and when computer programs attain superhuman intelligence and unprecedented power, should we begin valuing these programs more than we value humans? Would it be okay, for example, for an artificial intelligence to exploit humans and even kill them to further its own needs and desires? If it should never be allowed to do that, despite its superior intelligence and power, why is it ethical for humans to exploit and kill pigs?
All that being said, the book does have a tendency to ramble a bit. Harari hammers his main points into the reader through numerous repetitions and returns. There are 50 page chapters in Homo Deus, elaborating on and illustrating one single-sentence argument. However, lots of the evidence the author presents is interesting in itself - often it was a historical case applicable to current events - so it never gets boring."
10,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59458347-petrik,3,"3.5/5 starsNot as good as Homo Sapiens but Homo Deus did provide me with additional informative knowledge and intriguing speculations told in an engaging and thought-provoking style.

“People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.”

I will first say that Harari is a good writer, he really knows how to make interesting topics more compelling and he also kept me focused on information that would’ve been boring to read usually. Frankly speaking, there were indeed some sections in Part II—liberalism—that in my opinion was super dull and dry to read, but Part 1 and Part 3 of the book was superb; I found the majority of my attention grabbed by the way Harari discussed topics that evidently relevant in our society. Unlike Homo Sapiens which mostly dealt with facts and how humanity progressed—or stay the same—from the past up to the present, in Homo Deus Harari tells and speculates what comes after; what kind of futures humanity might be facing or going for based on the data and theories gathered from our history and present timeframe. There are so many topics that I could talk about here, but I feel like talking too much would diminish the benefit of reading this book itself; I’ll refrain from doing that and gives a bit of my opinion regarding one of the topics discussed: the power and curses of social media.

“In the past, censorship worked by blocking the flow of information. In the twenty-first century, censorship works by flooding people with irrelevant information. [...] In ancient times having power meant having access to data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore.”

The passage above speaks a loud volume to the way humanity lives these days. You want to know about something? Search it on Google. You want to see beautiful places you’ve never been to or bookish pictures? Search it on Instagram. Do you want to learn how to do something? Search it on Youtube or Pinterest. Book reviews? Search it on Goodreads/Amazon. There are many more examples, but the conclusion is that we live in an era where we have incredibly easy access to information that wasn’t possible to gain more than a decade ago. There’s no doubt that internet and social media have changed the way we live completely and there’s simply no going back from here. I’ve seen and heard some people complained about the way their privacy and data are used, and yes, their reasons are valid and I do believe that privacy of each individual should be respected. But this isn’t actually a hard-to-find knowledge; majority of social media users know that they’re giving away their data when they used their applications. Knowing all the risk of data sacrificial, we arrive at the most important question:Will we/they continue to use the applications? Most likely yes, the convenience and strength given by social media are simply way too powerful to ignore. I don’t have many issues against social media; most of my lives are enriched because of it. you’re reading this—and my other—review through social media, after all. However, it truly saddens me to see how many people have their lives destroyed by social media. Depression is at an all-time high; jealousy sparked easily; we constantly feel unsatisfied by what we have because of the beauty and unrealistic expectations set by filtered lenses.

“We do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon.”

The heavy reliance on social media usage might be responsible for many issues these days, honestly speaking, though, I personally don’t think that social media should take the blame entirely. It’s easier said than done, but internet/social media should be treated with the same rule of drinking alcohol: use it responsibly and it has a chance of bringing you happiness instead of harm/problems. Anything that’s too much is never good and that notion applies here, on our way to increase our quality of life by becoming a user of internet/social media, the opposite happens when we’re not in control: social media doesn’t become the product we use, WE become the social media’s product.

“Every day millions of people decide to grant their smartphone a bit more control over their lives or try a new and more effective antidepressant drug. In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human.”

There are still many more words I could write regarding this topic, but this is a book review and I plan to keep it that way. Please don’t take the long paragraphs I wrote about data, social media, and internet as a way of me saying that these are the only prominent topics that Harari talked about, there were still many other VERY important topics such as food, history, human dominance, belief, and religions that Harari elaborated with effectiveness, but I think it would be better for you to read them for yourself.

“This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But some freedom is better than none.”

Overall though, despite finding this book interesting and engaging, I still think that Homo Sapiens is the superior book. Now, I have no idea whether it’s due to Homo Sapiens being the first book I read instead of Homo Deus or not, but it really felt like some of the discussions and ideas gets repetitive to read. Plus, I had mixed feelings regarding Part 2 of the book where a lot of sections were uninteresting and told in an almost text-book manner. Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow is a thought-provoking book about societies, dataism, humanism, and the power of beliefs. As always, my rating speaks more for enjoyment rather than technicality, and I honestly believe that this, and Homo Sapiens, are books that should be read at least once whether you enjoy them or not. I agree and don’t agree with Harari on several topics, but the reasonings he gave will most likely make you reflect on many important topics.

“Fiction isn't bad. It is vital. Without commonly accepted stories about things like money, states or corporations, no complex human society can function. We can't play football unless everyone believes in the same made-up rules, and we can't enjoy the benefits of markets and courts without similar make-believe stories. But stories are just tools. They shouldn't become our goals or our yardsticks. When we forget that they are mere fiction, we lose touch with reality. Then we begin entire wars `to make a lot of money for the cooperation' or 'to protect the national interest'. Corporations, money and nations exist only in our imagination. We invented them to serve us; why do we find ourselves sacrificing our life in their service.”

11,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,3,"The title and the premise of Yuval Noah Harari’s Home Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow sounds intriguing; however, not much felt new. I feel like I’ve already heard much of the author’s arguments in other places. So while the various topics discussed are interesting and thought-provoking, Homo Deus is mostly provocative because of the way it is packaged. Advancements in a number of fields, especially in relation to data and an increase in our longevity, are examined to make the point that we are reaching a pivotal moment in our history. In order for transformations to be made, the author argues we need to change our mindset and expectations and maybe even our concept about individualism. While that may be true, I was hoping to hear more about the future, the tomorrow in Harari’s subtitle, than the past. The final quarter of the book did focus on that tomorrow (what the job market might look like, whether man or some people in the job market might end up being completely superfluous, the future role of AIs in our society etc.), but I would have preferred more of that analysis earlier in the book. I would have also liked something closer to the beginning of the book about how important algorithms would be in that analysis. 3.5 stars.   "
12,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40334778-cj-dufficy,2,"Certainly a disappointment when compared to Sapiens. The insights were generally already well presented in the earlier book. The section on animal lives is not convincingly warranted for inclusion but more obviously just a passion for the author leading me to feel I was being preached too. His criticism of Dawkins et al although correct could be equally pointed at himself. The universe will move from hot to cold regardless of quantum mechanical randomness at the quanta scale and equally at our barely greater scale (in universal terms) the path of the universe need not worry about human probabilistic behaviour, our free will is irrelevant to the progress of the universe. The fact that it is buried in our consciousness where language based thought is absent is hardly surprising as without it we could never have arrived at language based thought.All living things will die (even if capable of life spans we can't comprehend now) something terminal eventually happens to everything. As finally when the universe is so cold nothing can happen, long after this proton decay will plant the last nail in all coffins. Dr Hariri is no different to a WW1 general asking people to sacrifice some of their one and only life to benefit some unknown present or future person or animal with zero guarantees the sacrifice pays off but 100% certainty of the personal cost. Technology won't replicate humans, why would anyone want to copy such an imperfect organism when so many better options would be available?He admits, to paraphrase Dr King, that the arc of history is towards justice. The future is not a destination we choose any effort to dictate global outcomes never succeeds and this book is just another ""I know best contribution"" that will soon be forgotten.Generally the book feels as a world view supported selectively and not the wonderful voyage of discovery presented in Sapiens. Like Dawkins hating God though not believing, the author to object to humanism sneers at humans. No one ever said humans should act justly towards anything as a result of evolution but wth curiosity, generosity and empathy we have achieved a lot and are headed to achieve more although doomed anyway either in the long or short term. He fails completely to demonstrate any logic for a human that is mortal caring the exact length of time left to the species and acting altruistically as a result, and so totally unaware his action would have a measurable affect. If Mr Schickelbach hadn't changed his name to Hitler how different would the 20th century have been? What is the possibility of picking out causal events like these or knowing preventing them offers a better present. Everyone alive today must selfishly accept all of the great or horrible past or simply not exist.I'm happy I read it just a little deflated that so little eye opening left field explanations are in it and so many unsupported claims are made.To sum up he reminds me of the experimenter that forgets he is part of the experiment and can never not be."
13,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46716546-weronika,2,"The book is hugely disappointing. A year or so ago I read an interview with Harari on this book, which was still work in progress, and I found his views on biological inequality (and, to a lesser extent, the decoupling of intelligence from consciousness) very insightful. Actually, it was that interview that inspired me to read Sapiens, which, despite certain flaws, unfortunately amplified in Deus, is a book definitely worth reading. Meanwhile, Deus is wordy, chaotic and repetitive; most of the book is a just hotchpotch of quite basic facts stretching across many disciplines that does not seem to serve any purpose. A portion of that is a repetition from Sapiens, but most sounds like extended paragraphs from high school textbooks which are intended – I guess – to support each chapter’s main claim, but fail to do so, as they are not inserted in any kind of persuasive argumentation. Despite most of the book’s being redundant, I have to say I appreciated Harari’s insights on free will. Had I not read about biological inequality before, I’d probably also somewhat praise that part. If I hadn’t read Sapiens, I could have liked the parts already discussed in Sapiens (but if you haven't read Sapiens, just read Sapiens). But I'm afraid that's all. Really disappointing, I honestly wanted to give up on this book at least three times, but ploughed through it, including notes, anyway, because I hoped I'd discover something of real value in the end. Didn’t happen."
14,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21843540-safat,3,"We are not so taken aback when we hear computer programs can beat human chess masters. After all, computers are far more efficient calculators than humans, and chess can be broken down to calculations (In fact, nowadays chess masters don't stand a chance against present day computer Chessmaster programs. It's simply not possible for a human mind to beat them). And we're also not at all shocked when Google and Tesla present us automated cars driven by computer programs. Nevertheless, we reason,computers can never rival humans in arts, because arts require something distinctively(perhaps even spiritually) humane, which can never be replicated by computers. If you're a believer in this sort of human distinctiveness, perhaps you would naturally be thrown off upon hearing that a computer program written by a professor of musicology produced musical piece that the audience thought was superior to Bach. In other words, AI has already passed the Turing test in music. If programs can outperform us in our allegedly distinct 'human art' form, there's really no reason to think that it can't outperform us in every other field. Programs may lack subjective consciousness like us, but that doesn't stop them to outperform us in intellectual and artistic fields. Harari's new book explores the dimensions of the marriage between man and machine. He basically paints a dystopian vision of the future where humanity is by and large subjugated to non conscious intelligent machines. He even entertains the idea with the rise of brain-machine interfaces, where today's elite class of human beings would upgrade themselves to a biologically improved version of humans, which the general mass couldn't possibly afford for their lives. This would create a real caste system with real biological hierarchies. After reading Harari's previous book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, I must say that I am a bit disappointed with this book. Much of the book is reiteration of the previous book which seemed to me largely redundant. However, although this book is not as articulated or entertaining as the previous one, it is probably more important, considering the topics it deals with. "
15,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29843800-bianca,5,"Mind-blowing! What an interesting, compelling, thought-provoking and, yeah, kind of scary book. After finishing it, I'm both elated and anxious.Homo Deus (what a perfect title) was complex and it covered a lot of things, but it is especially trying to decipher where the humanity is going.Consciousness, the individual, intelligence, and the very important ability to organise are thoroughly analysed.I was very surprised to have my native country mentioned and analysed briefly but comprehensively. More importantly, Harari answered a question I've been asking myself for many years. In retrospect, the explanation is logical but it never occurred to me and nobody else was able to enlighten me either. Algorithms - a modern word, but very important, as we all are biological algorithms.What's more important - intelligence or consciousness?I also enjoyed the recap/rundown of some historical events in history. Harari also addresses our cruel treatment of farm animals. I'm an omnivore who feels guilty. What else? There's a lot to take in, but Harari unpacks it for us in an eloquent, easy to understand manner (well, I understood it). I'll probably buy the paperback so I go over certain chapters again.This audiobook was splendidly narrated by Derek Perkins.Highly recommended"
16,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,4,"I was a HUGE fan of Harari's previous smash hit Sapiens, and as such I came into this book with high expectations. Those expectations were met in some areas, and not in others: overall the book is engaging but a shadow of its predecessor.First, the good stuff. Harari's prose is as readable and clear as ever in Homo Deus, and he paces himself excellently. Too often in popular science books I find that either the author drags their feet getting to the interesting stuff or rockets over important sections, leaving some fatal misunderstandings. As in Sapiens Harari is economical with his words, saying just enough to convey the point exactly without overstaying his welcome. Additionally, similar to Sapiens the broad-brush overview of history is extremely compelling (provided you don't expect academically rigorous sources). Most of the book is actually a re-telling of the power structures that have shaped human societies, focusing on the concept of religions. Naturally this includes Abrahamic religions, animalist or spiritualist beliefs, and a slew of ancient religions. However crucially Harari also classifies humanism as a religion, and, in fact, as the defining religion of the modern period, placing the individual human at the centre of the moral universe. With this framework in place Harari then extrapolates modern interplay of religion and society forward a few centuries, speculating about what future religions might look like.This speculative section of the book is what drew me to Homo Deus, as I'm sure was the case for many readers. Unfortunately I think many will likewise come away disappointed. For such a long buildup, Harari spends very little time actually discussing the potential future, or how society might look with, for example, a caste of technologically-enhanced humans lording it over us mere biological peasants. The rise of machine learning gets the most thorough treatment, being as it is likely the most severe social disruptor of this century, but even the predictions here feel brief, even perfunctory. A much more thorough discussion takes place in Pedro Domingo's excellent The Master Algorithm. I really hoped for more from Harari in speculating how current broad trends might plan out, but (perhaps understandably) he shirks away from providing many predictions.This said, in the few years since the book has been published many of its predictions have come true. For example, the rise of not only ride-sharing but car-sharing apps is directly predicted. The very day that I read that section of the book I saw an advert for car-sharing app ZipCar on the tube. The rising discontent with politics (as hinted at during the writing of the book with the election campaigns of Brexit and Donald Trump) have absolutely come to pass. This certainly lends some validity to the broad vision Harari presents, and I have no doubt that his vision of how technology and society will interact in the 21st century will come to pass. Between the lack of details however, as well as an uncharacteristically patchy discussion of modern religions, and his perennial problem of writing for a popular audience and so skimping on references, this just doesn't hold up to comparison to Sapiens. Still, a recommended read for those who enjoyed the previous book."
17,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"Having read Sapiens, I had some idea that there would be new themes which Yuval Noah Harari would cover which nobody else has before. With Sapiens, it was about the agricultural revolution and the binding power of stories. And yes - there are brilliant new themes in Homo Deus as well - our delusion of free will and the Sapiens in a future world ruled by algorithms, and it continues excellently from where Sapiens left off. If Sapiens was about how the most powerful species consolidated it's power, Homo Deus is about what is in store for Sapiens. The theme of the power of stories - to bind and also delude is continued in Homo Deus. Stories - good or bad enables large scale co-operation among Sapiens - even if the story is not entirely logical or fair to other species. This has led to Humanism as a religion, where Sapiens have declared themselves as the centre and primary purpose of the universe. So everything else revolves around Sapiens - and all other life forms are for it's use. This has led to us being extremely cruel with other life forms and farm animals lead miserable lives from birth till death. The story which binds humans regards this as the norm and generation after generation sees nothing wrong in it. How would humans feels if a more advanced species (spawned off by artificial intelligence) should make judgements and kill undesirable humans?There are fairly long discussions around political systems and the growth of liberalism. I found this to be a little too long, and it could well have been crisper. Humans have acquired a combination of intellect and consciousness which was regarded as necessary for being advanced life forms at the top of the pyramid. Consciousness especially would be difficult to acquire. However, it is clear now that intelligence which is superior is adequate to ascend the pyramid. Already artificial intelligence is winning over humans in several fields regarded as earlier insurmountable such as chess and even the arts. Humans will depend more and more on algorithms and at some point algorithms will be all powerful. One big surprise which the book springs is around our free will. Do we really have free will? - or do we make forced choices based on experience and conditioning? I found this to be the most interesting discussion in the book.While I do not think the future will play out entirely as outlined, it might still be close. The reasoning and discussions are excellent, provoking us to think & reflect - and isn't that what is most important in a good book?Yuval Noah Hariri closes the book being thankful to the practice of Vipassana meditation as taught by S N Goenka for allowing him to look beyond conditioning and see things as they are. A sign that there is wisdom which is eternal and will endure, isn't it?"
18,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27098959-leonard-gaya,3,"Harari wrote Homo Deus following the success of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind a couple of years earlier. And while the first book’s ambition is to tell the saga of humanity’s past, this one is offered as a sort of sequel, showing what our future might hold. In truth, Sapiens was mostly glossing over the complexities of humankind’s history. And most of the first half of Homo Deus commits to rehashing the same arguments, only to thin them down with a slightly different set of examples and anecdotes. For example, Harari spends quite a few pages discussing once again the notion that human societies are shaped by arbitrary conventions or “intersubjective fictional entities” (economy, ethics, laws, ideologies, religions). He also devotes a significant part of the book to his pet cause: the callousness of industrial livestock farming. Most of the book is written in a journalistic style, with anecdotes aplenty, which makes for both engaging and easy reading, but at the same time, renders the book a bit sketchy, patchy, dated and peripheral.Nevertheless, Homo Deus starts to introduce new notions about halfway through. The core of the book is an examination of modernity, in the wake of what Nietzsche had coined the “Death of God”. The ideology that is currently replacing the moribund religions of the past is humanism, in its either liberal or socialist version. Harari briefly examines the question of consciousness and free-will, which are the founding (albeit debatable) principles of humanism. He also outlines the distinctive features of this modern ideology: the belief in perpetual technological and economic growth; the belief in individualism, “inner-awareness” and “self-determination” and, thus, in democracy and happiness. Even though, in the end, modern humanism does very little to provide meaning to human existence.Towards the end of the book, however, as Harari considers what might come next, it becomes clear that the blessings of humanism might ultimately be bestowed on a very limited elite. Harari examines how the humanist obsession with technological progress might well become the downfall of our humanist civilisation and the inception of a “dataist” dystopia. A few precursory elements include novel techniques of body and brain “hacking”, the systematic replacement of the human workforce by increasingly intelligent machines (and the social inequalities this will imply), and last but not least, the flourishing belief that the Self and even the whole of society is but a bunch of pre-determined data-processing systems. In other words, we are algorithms.Homo Deus’ closing chapters paint, with broad brush strokes, a grim picture of our possible future. The dawn of this new era is probably upon us already, and individuals are increasingly treated, through an ever encircling net of technology, as data-bags, suitable only for corporations’ meaningless profits — just as animals are treated as meat-bags, suited only to humans’ boundless consumption. Nietzsche (again) prophetically called this the age of the “Last Man”. That was more than a century ago, however, so there is nothing groundbreaking in Homo Deus today. In any event, this places Harari right next to a couple of other slightly gloomy transhumanists, such as Nick Bostrom."

It was a working hypothesis that worked, and I didn't look behind it until it became untenable. Now I effectively assume my continuing identity as a person - because that works, sort of, too. In me, and most people I know, the baton of consciousness, of awareness of one's I-ness, is repeatedly exchanged at unimaginable speeds between the two hemispheres. That baton seems to get dropped by people suffering certain forms of dementia - with increasing frequency as their condition worsens, being eventually only picked up and handed to and fro for brief, sometimes apparently fortuitous periods, if at all. How cruel (alongside other pains and indignities) to lose the working hypothesis that everyone else lives by. But perhaps, isolated in the permanently unfamiliar and frightening. Now they may be closer to the reality of the human condition than the rest of us. As with Santa, the mere fact that a working hypothesis produces a desirable and convenient result does not make it correct.Take famine. We are told that ""famine is rare"". But across what data-set is that claim true? Across the data-set of what we actually know, about what is actually happening, at the present time? But that is a profoundly-inadequate data-set. We ought to consider also what we don't know about what is happening right now (Do we know whether or not, even right now, a serious famine is underway in under-reported/remote in parts of Africa?). More important, we ought to consider what might have happened, in recent history (has humanity quite possibly been merely lucky not to have experienced a mega-famine, in recent times (we may have come close, for instance, in 2007-9, during which period most of the world's countries resorted to banning food exports)?"

I think Homo Deus poses some excellent questions that make you question your existence. Why do we think of ourselves as superior to all other life forms. Why do we have such strong faith in imaginary things such as money, gods, human rights, companies...And what will become of us if dataism succeeds. All in all, it's clear that we can't keep living like this. Harari's writing style is very engaging. He's a bit of sarcastic when he questions religion, our history, science, technology, humanity, our supposedly superior position to other life forms, humanism, liberalism, yet he doesn't claim that he's some expert in this matter, he just gives you a set of facts.Thank you Yuval Noah Harari for writing this & Random House UK, Vintage Publishing Harvill Secker and Netgalley for this copy in exchange for an honest review."

23,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Sapiens was one of my favorite nonfiction books I've read in the past few years - so I was excited for the sequel. Overall, its very worth it and full of a lot of the interesting high level perspectives and frameworks. But it also lacks the clear structure of a coherent narrative, isn't presenting (to me) quite as novel information, and also does some strange things - like using the word 'liberal' in contexts that I don't think definitionally make sense.I like the train of the thought that Harari closed Sapiens with and continues in this book, which is about human happiness and how to optimize for it - though he doesn't have rosy conclusions on where we are headed. And the notion that we are going to beat death at some point soonish (I'd guess in 20-40 years) is not a new one, but is a very interesting one. Whether or not humans will over time stay human, or be divided into superhumans and regular humans, or create a class of economically useless people - are some of the larger questions we will face in the future as AI and aging advance.Success breeds ambition, and our recent achievements are now pushing humankind to set itself even more daring goals. Having secured unprecedented levels of prosperity, health and harmony, and given our past record and our current values, humanity’s next targets are likely to be immortality, happiness and divinity. Having reduced mortality from starvation, disease and violence, we will now aim to overcome old age and even death itself. Having saved people from abject misery, we will now aim to make them positively happy. And having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival struggles, we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods, and turn Homo sapiens into Homo deus. """
24,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,4,"I’ve only read one other book written by Yuval Noah Harari and that was Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, this follows in the steps of that to the point that it seems more like a sequel even if they can be read in whatever order you wish. Just as Sapiens, Homo Deus is a gripping book, I love Yuval’s writing style because it never bores me, he always manages to draw my full attention. Homo Deus is a book that wants to present the possible roads that the future might lead us to. It’s not a presentation of how the future will look, but rather how it might. I found the format of this book interesting, it often seems chaotic with subjects ranging from the history of lawns to even a chapter about Nicolae Ceaușescu. When you look at them individually, they don't seem to be that relevant to the subject of the book, but there’s order in his chaos and this is what makes this book and Sapiens so compelling, how he uses examples that are not only fascinating, but also easy to understand, informative and relatable. The only thing I could reproach is that the title is misleading, there’s surprisingly little about the future of humankind in this. It felt more like an extension of the last chapter in Sapiens. It even recycles some ideas from Sapiens while expanding others. Overall the ideas presented here are by no means original, but Yuval Noah Harari deserves credit for the way it managed to gather and present so many ideas in a way that not only made sense but was also easy to understand and follow, all that while also being surprisingly entertaining."

Homo sapiens (modern humans) were able to gain dominance over all of nature because of their ability to communicate and to collaborate with each other and because they could use their collective brain to come up with novel ideas, but as technology progresses and we rely more and more in computers and algorithms these computers programs are based on , are we as a species giving up dominance to technology? Are we becoming obsolete? And if we become obsolete who or what is primed to take over the mantle and what will happens to Homo Sapiens once it does happen? This is what these book asks and it dwells in many scenarios this could happen, there are already artificial intelligence available (our iPhones, robot doctors and gps) , humans could use these new technology to enhance themselves and if they do , will they still be fundamentally human? Or would they more divine , (Homo Deus) and once these disparities become apparent, how would ethics, religion or the human experience changed to accommodate this reality? The point of this book is to explore these questions and to make us try to come up with an answer , or pretty soon if not already too late that choice will be taken from us."
26,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"A great and ausual book. When considering many more books about the same topic, ""how we are going to be"", Harari's arguments are more than satisfying and his reasonings are both terrifying and educated. I believe his warnings were the most accurate, I could have found on the topic of technologies and how they may be a danger to us. So there are so many people, like Hawkins that try to warn us about future AI uprising, which any sci-fi author from 90's could counter argue effectively and easily. However, Harari's predictions are actually possible and are risen from just fear of unknown. Rather his warnings are based on what we know is possible. I adore and recommend this book, as a great sequel to ""Sapiens"" by Harari. "
27,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/765636-ray,4,"This book is sure to give one a lot to think about.Firstly, I’d highly recommend reading Harari’s seminal Sapiens book before delving into Homo Deus. They are meant to complement each other in order to better understand humanity’s past and future. Much of Homo Deus repeats the previous themes, which is a bit of a flaw, and frames human historical patterns into broad categories which can seem rushed if one didn’t read Sapiens already. Still, the concepts are so important and take much energy to truly contemplate so they are generally worth repeating. While constantly mind-blowing, Harari writes in a readable engaging style which may or may not be oversimplifying depending on how good his research is…I originally thought Homo Deus would be a book about transhumanism, and it is to some degree, but it’s not meant to give the details on how cybernetic movements will work in the technological sense. Rather, Harari seeks to contemplate the underlying philosophies of what he concludes will be the new techno-religions of the future. It’s interesting how he defines religions, which don’t require belief in the supernatural and rather any thought process which ends in ‘-ism’ can pretty much be a religion. Much is written about individualistic humanism for example, and it’s various 20th century branches nationalism-socialism-communism-liberalism etc. as he defines them. Also, everything is apparently all about algorithms. I would criticize that he is too harsh at times, always saying that the ethics of human rights and whatnot are arbitrary and there is no sense that the social contract is any kind of evolution. Just one of many choices. It is true that borders and laws are intersubjective illusions, and it is true that human beings treat animals appallingly. But personally I still hope, however naively, that there is some kind of progress going on throughout the ages.In any case it is fascinating to dissect how we got here and where we may go next. Harari is a master of the big picture, which is refreshing in times of turmoil when it becomes hard to see further from the events right in front of us. From superhumans to Dataism, what is being cooked up in Silicon Valley is supremely more important than the regressive reactionary forces which we are usually told are such a big deal.The challenges to come as the human race changes are going to unlike anything imaginable. Indeed, much of it is by definition impossible to predict because the way our brains currently work is not the way brains will work in the future. The singularity must be mentioned as well. These are important things to think about even if it will be tricky to truly understand. Ultimately Harari is raising questions and doesn’t pretend to know all the answers. But what questions. Readers are left hoping that if we contemplate these things seriously enough we might actually be able to avoid some of the disasters. Yet that will require a lot of foresight. Good luck, humans. The final questions are these and I don’t think it’s a spoiler to share so here, please think:1. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?2. What’s more valuable – intelligence or consciousness. 3. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?"
28,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Harari picks up where he left off with Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, a fantastic book that I gave a 5 star review HERE. There he shows where we've been & spends the last chapters asking where are we going. He also asks what is happiness? Both are important questions that he starts off addressing here with The New Human Agenda, an interesting & long introduction that covers a lot of thoughtful territory to set the stage for the 3 parts of the book.His examples are great since they take me places I've never been before. I had a good education, I'm curious, & fairly well read, yet he constantly reminds me how poor & US-centric my knowledge of world & its history is. Unfortunately, the length & numbers of his examples actually detract from his overall points at times. He doesn't clearly & succinctly define a premise from the outset & then prove it. Instead, he usually provides a super short idea & expands on it along with a running proof that often obfuscates the premise. I was tempted to drop a star for this, but didn't.He's also preachy at times, something I object to even though I'm usually in the choir, if not on the pulpit with him. Too often his examples & interpretations are lopsided. Normally, the book would lose at least a star, but I didn't even though I point one out later in the review & in the first comment of this review. (I put that comment & some other excursions of my own in the comments since there's just too much here to think about & I was afraid I'd run out space in the review.)---------------------Update 16Dec2018: here is a good piece about Harari's philosophy that should be taken into account when reading his books. I don't agree with it all, but it does contain important points to consider.https://www.thenewatlantis.com/public...---------------------As an audio book that I'm listening to at varying times, I occasionally lost sight of where he was going & only found my way back by skimming the text version, but it's all interesting. He's a smart guy with a unique way of structuring large, complex ideas, but the first & second sections could have used more editing. Don't give up, though! The third section brings it all together in a fantastic fashion that I wish everyone would read, especially politicians. That's why this garnered 5 stars.Highly recommended in both text & audio. As with his other book, this is great to listen to, but a text edition is a great way to check & ponder his many points. As you can tell, I found much to ponder here.The rest of the review isn't really for you, but notes for me.
Most people rarely think about it, but in the last few decades we have managed to rein in famine, plague and war.
 It wasn't unusual for 10% or more of a population to die from any one of these. They were once completely beyond our control & in the realm of deities. Now men are held accountable & the amount is down both as a percentage & even actual numbers in many cases even though there are far more people (500 million 1500, 1 billion 1800, 1.8 billion 1920, 7.6 billion 2017). People are still hungry, sick, & killed violently, but it's incredible just how much better things are for most people.- The 1918 Spanish flu killed 20-50 million while the 2014 Ebola outbreak killed less than 12,000. Small pox wiped out 90% of many populations in the Americas. We've now wiped out small pox.- In 2012 about 56 million people died throughout the world; 620,000 of them died due to human violence (war killed 120,000 people, and crime killed another 500,000.Perspective: There were 615,000 Allied casualties in the Battle of Somme in WWI - one battle of many both in that war & those that followed in the 20th century.- Far more people die today due to gluttony than famine.
It took just a piece of bread to make a starving medieval peasant joyful. How do you bring joy to a bored, overpaid and overweight engineer?
From the primordial ooze to a century ago, survival once demanded our full attention & now it doesn't. The animal satisfied with one meal starved to death, while the one that kept scrambling for more passed on its genes, so we're hardwired to always want more. Now we have it & what? Where are our cravings - the pursuit of happiness - taking us? He provides numbers on suicides that are both indicative & disheartening. From 1/100K in developing countries to 25/100K in developed ones, our relative wealth shows a growing dissatisfaction with life that will only be exacerbated as lifespans & wealth increase. Immortality, actually ammortality, is coming soon to rich people.Part I: Homo Sapiens Conquers the WorldWe live in the Anthropocene era, an age where humans are a force more powerful than the comet that destroyed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. While the beginning of this age is the 20th century, we've actually had a huge effect on the environment since shortly after our cognitive revolution & he doesn't make that point well. Actually, this section suffers greatly from a wandering, yet narrow viewpoint that I didn't expect from him. He seems to have an agenda, especially against factory farming, as if that's the only sort there is.Out of book research: A quick read of Harari's Wikipedia page & his website show that he's a vegan & an animal welfare advocate. That accounts for the lopsided arguments & fanatical tone I detected.While I agree that we're as gods to animals & have done piss poor job of it, we are getting better. We actually have people arguing for animal welfare now & we can afford to. As a historical trend, our treatment of animals is very similar to other technologies - we're very inefficient at first, but we gain understanding & economic resilience as the tech matures (e.g. insulin - see comment #1 for more). I'm disappointed that he didn't point this out at all, but just painted the darkest picture possible.
Now humankind is poised to replace natural selection with intelligent design, and to extend life from the organic realm into the inorganic.
 What is human? What are the bounds between human & machine? Our striving toward artificial intelligence & fixing humans has created cyborgs & designer people. He points out that later versions of these may well regard us as we do animals & have even less in common. His example for how these will come about is excellent. It will start with a needed fix & expand, just like plastic surgery did. (See Comment 2)He spends a lot of time trying to figure out what separates us from other animals. While all have both objective & subjective realities, humans are the only ones that share intersubjective realities or fictions (He referred to them as 'shared myths' in ""Sapiens"" e.g., money, empire, religion.) which allow us to cooperate in large groups. He wanders through some interesting paths, but seems to have blinders on. For instance, he never once mentions selfishness (ego) in this context & if he did mention the evolutionary maxim of 'the more copies of DNA available, the better', I missed it.Still, he sums up the section well with the following. As human fictions are translated into genetic and electronic codes, the intersubjective reality will swallow up the objective reality and biology will merge with history. In the twenty-first century fiction might thereby become the most potent force on earth, surpassing even wayward asteroids and natural selection. Hence if we want to understand our future, cracking genomes and crunching numbers is hardly enough. We must also decipher the fictions that give meaning to the world.Part II: Homo Sapiens Gives Meaning to the WorldHe starts out by discussing the story tellers. These are the shared myths & he examines how similar religion, empires, & various governing ideologies are in a variety of ways. There's a really interesting discussion on how we measure success in these systems; too often we measure them by their own yardsticks, not on anything real. ""Real"" being an entity that can feel pain.The Odd Couple - in practice, science and religion are like a husband and wife who after 500 years of marriage counselling still don’t know each other...- Most of the misunderstandings regarding science and religion result from faulty definitions of religion... people confuse religion with superstition, spirituality, belief in supernatural powers or belief in gods. Religion is none of these things...- Religion asserts that we humans are subject to a system of moral laws that we did not invent and that we cannot change...- Religion gives a complete description of the world, and offers us a well-defined contract with predetermined goals...- ...religious stories almost always include three parts:1. Ethical judgments, such as ‘human life is sacred’.2. Factual statements, such as ‘human life begins at the moment of conception’.3. A conflation of the ethical judgments with the factual statements, resulting in practical guidelines such as ‘you should never allow abortion, even a single day after conception’.- Science has no authority or ability to refute or corroborate the ethical judgments religions make. But scientists do have a lot to say about religious factual statements... He then goes on to say that the Scientific Age is also the Age of Ignorance. We learned to know that we didn't know & set about finding out. Unfortunately, the above took an awfully long time with many great examples & thoughts in between the basic premises I listed above. While I enjoy it, the ideas failed to make much of an impression until I could boil them down as above. A lot of this book does this. The Modern Covenant is about liberalism, capitalism, & the growing GDP. It is a rat race. I was surprised that he never mentioned complexity as one of the biggest balancing points, though. Instead, he concentrates on resources, energy, & knowledge. The latter is the only one growing in real terms.The Humanist Revolution: List the best innovations religions introduced in the past century or two. How about men & science? I can't think of anything for the first while I can fill pages with the last. Religion used to be creative, but now it is now entirely reactionary proving it is on its way out. The various fundamentalist movements are death throes.Atheism is on the rise, especially in modern, educated, successful nations where most only pay lip service to their fundamental religion if they espouse one. Much of the reason for this goes back to his original assertion that where gods & prayers failed to do anything about famine, plague, & war, man did. We no longer believe the god(s) are the source of inspiration, art, music, & everything else. So man is now the source of both meaning & authority, the traditional role of god(s) & religion. We believe in ourselves & our fellow man - the new religion, humanism. We're thinking for ourselves.Though in 1850 socialism was only a fringe movement, it soon gathered momentum, and changed the world in far more profound ways than the self-proclaimed messiahs of China and Sudan. If you count on national health services, pension funds and free schools, you need to thank Marx and Lenin (and Otto von Bismarck) far more than Hong Xiuquan or the Mahdi.Part III: Homo Sapiens Loses ControlCan humans go on running the world and giving it meaning?How do biotechnology and artificial intelligence threaten humanism?Who might inherit humankind, and what new religion might replace humanism?The Time Bomb in the LaboratoryIn 2016 the world is dominated by the liberal package of individualism, human rights, democracy and the free market. Yet twenty-first-century science is undermining the foundations of the liberal order…Science has found:- Free will as we've defined it doesn't really exist. We've broken our thought processes down into algorithms. Does it really matter if they run on a carbon or silicon based electro-chemical system?- We aren't ""individuals"", but ""dividuals"" - there are at least 2 of us inside - the experiencing & narrating self. The first has no memory, the latter stores the memory often in strange ways to make sense of it & it is often duration-blind.The Great Decoupling…Liberals uphold free markets and democratic elections because they believe that every human is a uniquely valuable individual, whose free choices are the ultimate source of authority. In the twenty-first century three practical developments might make this belief obsolete:1. Humans will lose their economic and military usefulness, hence the economic and political system will stop attaching much value to them.2. The system will still find value in humans collectively, but not in unique individuals.3. The system will still find value in some unique individuals, but these will be a new elite of upgraded superhumans rather than the mass of the population.This section plain terrifies me. It is too obviously happening already.- We have decoupled intelligence & consciousness. Many computer algorithms can & are doing intelligent tasks far better & faster than humans such as stock trading, baseball team picks, playing games. They're not confined to Deep Blue or Watson, a laptop will do most of the time. With Quantum Computing just around the corner, even Watson will be as outdated as the 8 bit Atari I had 25 years ago.- Guiding the masses to decisions. Ignore your political beliefs & read  this article especially the references & links to Cambridge Analytica. Public opinion shaped through Facebook memes & fake news that appeals to our prejudices which they know. With just 300 examples, there are algorithms that can pick your 'likes' more accurately than your spouse.- Personal decisions through big data! His description of how & why it could will happen makes far too much sense.(See comment 3.)Worst of all, this is the techno-humanist view, which at least still needs tolerates the vast majority of people. If robots are doing most of the work & fighting, what use are the masses? What will occupy them & keep them out of trouble? Harari doesn't mention it, but China's one-child policy shows that governments can change their populations relatively quickly while retaining their power & keeping the world at large at bay. Theirs wasn't war torn genocide, just a rational step, right? Advancing technologies will only make sterilizing & controlling large, relatively specific segments of the population easier. People as a resource. (See comment 4.)The Data ReligionDataism says that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing.This is where Harari's ability to look at huge systems really shines. He describes how we went from small, disparate data clusters as hunter-gatherers to larger data clusters that were centralized in empires. Communism failed because centralized data couldn't react as well as the decentralized capitalist system. A central authority dictating the amount of wheat to plant & loaves to bake didn't have the information or self-correction of free market forces such as a stock exchange.A critical examination of the Dataist dogma is likely to be not only the greatest scientific challenge of the twenty-first century, but also the most urgent political and economic project.His explanations are both terrifying & accurate, especially in the practical applications & trends we are now seeing. Our leaders aren't any longer. They're increasingly reacting to older & older crisis as technology races past their understanding. The DMCA lauded as such an amazing piece of legislation in 1998 immediately had to be amended when they realized they'd outlawed all computers on private & corporate networks since the original language of the bill stated that any computer that didn't show its actual IP address was illegal. That such a huge, obvious flaw could make it into law is practically criminal & yet things have only gotten worse.When religion lost its ability to lead, it became reactionary & has lost its hold. Will politics & democracy become obsolete soon? Shouldn't they? Can we honestly say that the choice between Clinton, Sanders, Johnson, or Trump made any sense? Will we even survive Kim Jong-il or Putin? (see comment 5)Censorship used to rely on blocking information flows, but now it relies on obfuscating it by deluging us with spun data as in the Cambridge Analytica example above. The scariest thing about dataism is not what it will do to us in the short term - it might really be a good thing - but that it doesn't require any humans in the long run. As Harari points out, we're better data creators & processors than chickens, but we could easily be supplanted.The dataist will point out how much more efficient & better our lives can be if we simply share our information, the more, the better for us. Intelligent algorithms can then use it. He uses his car as an example. He only uses it 1 hour per day commuting to & from work, so it is a huge expense & waste of resources. He doesn't know enough to coordinate with the millions that live around him, each of whom also own cars, to share one, but if everyone let the system always know when & where they wanted to go an intelligent algorithm could do so. The only cost would be his privacy. Ditto with medicine. (See comment 5)He ends fantastically:If we think in term of months, we had probably focus on immediate problems such as the turmoil in the Middle East, the refugee crisis in Europe and the slowing of the Chinese economy. If we think in terms of decades, then global warming, growing inequality and the disruption of the job market loom large. Yet if we take the really grand view of life, all other problems and developments are overshadowed by three interlinked processes:1. Science is converging on an all-encompassing dogma, which says that organisms are algorithms, and life is data processing.2. Intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.3. Non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves.These three processes raise three key questions, which I hope will stick in your mind long after you have finished this book:1. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?2. What’s more valuable – intelligence or consciousness?3. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?Highly recommended in both text & audio. As with his other book, this is great to listen to, but a text edition is a great way to check & ponder his many points. As you can tell, I found much to ponder here & even so, I left out a lot. Yeah, it's fantastic."

According to Yuval Noah Harari, the main reason that humans have managed to attain such a strong position in this planet is their ability to believe in ""imaginary orders"" such as countries, religion, money etc.Many believe that we have something in us that could be called a soul or consciousness or similar but it is not clear that this exists and our behavior could possibly be only a result of complex algorithms, without free will (or possibly random will but not free).It seems, humans are rapidly managing to develop algorithms that do things better.So many fields in our life are replaced. Travel agents, computer programmers and in the near future drivers, lawyers and possibly artists, composers and more. We may find ourselves in a world that we decide things like who to vote for, who to love, what to do and practically any decision with the help of algorithms.In his very distinctive and persuasive style, the author uses his vast sociological and historical knowledge and tries to predict what will be the direction that the human race will take in the 21st century. On the way, he explains how humanism and other ""religions"" changed the way humans think and may change the destination of humans.I loved this book. I am not sure that I can capture the impression this book made on me in a review and I am not really going to try.I really think that this book is a must read for all people , and specifically people who want to understand humans and human society."

Not only can we communicate, but we can also comminuticate about thing that exist only in our common imagination, such as corporations, google and god. Science does not make ethical judgements, it's not able to give meaning to life. The past few hundred years have seen a human sentered religion taking place of more traditional religions, humanism. Humanism puts the human liberty and free will first, and individualism. Gone is collectivism and here and now is how you feel about something. I never considered humanism another religion. I didn't really equate the bill of human rights with the ten commandments. Yet humanism and the internal conflicts within almost tore the world apart in the 20th century. However, individual liberty is not likely to continue. Human value is likely to be surpassed. The future of the world is an algorithm. The author intends to shock and he does. Whatever your belief system is, he is likely to shake you. It certainly shook mine, even though I also read and loved ""Sapiens: a brief history of humankind"".

He does not leave any stone unturned, and discusses anything from the impact of A.I. in our lives to the future of religion.I was captivated by the book and look forward to reading his most recent title, 21 LESSONS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.

When it comes to imagining what might come next, from singularities, man-machine hybrids, or the idea that AIs might consider us superfluous (an idea I am increasingly starting to agree with), there really isn't anything groundbreaking here.So why do I give it a four rather than a three or lower?It's entertaining, well-written, and while it doesn't scratch my itch to learn anything new, it is a fairly comprehensive backdrop of what might come next.

It let's you know the important technical advances that could have huge implications to society: specifically technologies that could end liberalism, humanism, and capitalism.It's hard to imagine a current world without one of those things. But in the not-to-distant future, all three of them could be gone.Harari makes the case that technology has, objectively, made the world a better place over time. And we shouldn't worry that the coming technologies will turn that trend around. Objectively, Harari argues, the future will be better.But the big question is: would the future be better off without humans? Do humans really matter to the future? And if we don't, what becomes of us?Like Sapiens, Homo Deus is an incredibly enlightening read."
34,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24275344-nmalpas,1,"Read the intro, skip the rest.I was intrigued by the premise of this (especially given that I love sci-fi and this promised a nonfiction treatment of some classic sci-fi themes). The introduction does indeed present some some interesting lines of thought about what human beings have achieved as a species and how things might progress. But that early promise was sorely dissappointed.Harari is fine as long as he sticks to his actual area of expertise, namely, history. Though even his historical insights are rather superficial and he goes on and on about many simple points ad nauseum. The real problem is that large parts of the book stray from history not only into other social sciences and physical sciences but most ruinously of all into philosophy, of which Harari clearly has little understanding. He falls victim to countless conceptual conceptions, his arguments are full of holes, he overstates his confusions, and shows a shocking ignorance of existing discussions in philosophy mind, social ontology, ethics, etc. But this cluelessness does not prevent him from giving what he supposes to be definite answers on a slew of very difficult and controversial issues in philosophy (like the problem of other mind and the nature of morality).Overall, most of the book reads like an undergraduate philosophy assignment - a good one mind, but not something anyone should expect to gain much insight or pleasure from, nor even something you would expect to find in a lauded book form a major publisher. If you don't have much philosophical background, you might be able to read this without getting infuriated; you might even come away thinking it was profound. But your sense of wonder or enlightenment would be a sham: you will just have taken on a bunch of delusions and been habituated to shoddy argument and conceptual analysis. (less)"

I found it unputdownable - there’s just so much food for thought in its pages and I often find myself thinking back to it when I hear of advances in science and technology with which the author’s vision of the future begins to seem ever more plausible. He describes how human nature, indeed our very humanity, could be transformed in the not very distant future due to developments in bio-technology, bio-engineering, genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence combining to create a very different sort of human being. A complete step-change for humanity and the next stage of evolution. The dizzying speed of change in scientific progress makes prediction a risky process but it seems clear, even to the most sceptical, that our world is changing and we humans along with it.

I loved how Harari talks about liberalism, communism, democracy etc as religions of modern times. He then culminates with mentioning the religion of the near future: dataism. Overall, to be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise very much thought provoking. To be discussed over wine. I wish I would have read this paired with another friend.Although very interesting, too much of it is redundant if you've already read Sapiens. If you have to choose, read only one.

47,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16325176-jiachen-guo,1,"Another disappointment from Yuval Noah Harari. All the rave about this terrific and ambitious author compelled me to read both of his works, Sapiens and Homo Deus. Both have disappointed me. I am insanely interested in both this topics and hoped to gain a thorough understanding through these two books but instead I find myself bashing the author all the time because of the unsettling amount of logical fallacies and sweeping arguments he committed in the book.In my opinion, such a book should be founded upon solid science, has considered every possible theory and leaves little room for disagreement. However, I have to say that Yuval Noah Harari is a terrible scientist and should not be allowed write ambitious science books like these for he is not qualified. Though the book is heavy with content and backed with loads of research, most of the arguments Yuval makes are with weak foundations and not convincing enough. Most of the the time I feel like I am reading an essay written by a high schooler, who has the help of google and pieced carelessly selected facts from the internet together to attempt to fool an examiner that his stand is justifiable. An example- Yuval tries to justify his stand that more people die of eating too much than by natural disasters, plagues and war by saying 'In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald's than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.' How is this not something you would expect from a high schooler's essay? So Yuval conveniently selected four isolated events that in no way can represent 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague' and 'war' with convenient statistics that just so happened to 'justify' his argument, in hope that the reader be fooled by this flawed logic. It is equally easy to select four other individual subset events of 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague', 'war' and compare the statistics to 'prove' that Yuval is wrong. Such is the logic flaws that Yuval littered his book with and makes me wonder why have I bothered reading such a carelessly treated book."

Or using Microsoft's Cortana as the example of a personal digital assistant that's going to rule our lives. I mean, maybe, but Cortana over Alexa? It's little things like that that make me question Harari's handle on the tech side of things. Additionally, when discussing the science, especially the bioscience aspects, Harari offers few actual, concrete examples beyond what I could find listening to an NPR podcast. It's a fine book for a broad, general look at the potential future of biotech and machine learning, and a better look the historical context that put us here, but it feels a bit thin to me.One other thing I disliked was the manner in which Harari seemed to act as if taking psychiatric medications for therapeutic reasons was the same as taking them for a cognitive boost. A person who takes Adderall because they have ADD is taking them in order to bring themselves up to baseline functionality and isn't gaining an advantage over someone who does not have ADD and isn't taking Aderall. Suggesting otherwise is like suggesting a person with an amputated leg gains a significant advantage from using a prosthesis over someone who has both of their legs. It's a false equivalency that I see peddled far too often, and it's BS. Overall, an interesting book, but one read with a critical eye. "

51,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This is a remarkably good book. Our world is shaped by our logos, pathos, and mythos. That's just a fancy way of saying it's our reason, feelings, and beliefs that make us who we are. This book takes all three methods that we use to understand, adds some historical perspective and explains the human experience better than almost anyone and speculates where we as a society will be going in the relatively near future. Feelings are not facts, but we use our feelings to understand and process the sensuous world that we our thrown into, and we use what we think we know based on what our past beliefs were in order to understand the present. We are always in a strange loop that never quite converges because the past keeps receding and we are always anticipating the future. This book will cite a series of many neurological experiments (oh I feel for those poor rats) which show how we create narratives based on experiences and overweigh the most previous moment disproportionately from what logic dictates.Have you ever talked to people who are part of the cult of Trump? I have. They weigh each of the most previous moments’ experience that they've heard from Rush Limbaugh or Brietbart's news or Trump's 144 characters tweet disproportionately over previous data with an exponential decay set so high that history and perspective doesn't matter to them. They also would reject the principals within this book for one other big reason. They live in a universe without doubts by outsourcing their beliefs to a book or to a cult leader thus ascertaining certainty within their mythical constructions using their gut feelings as their standard for truth. Mythos dwellers never know it's a myth while they are living within the myth and will create alternative facts or whine 'fake news' when challenged. One cannot go from the abstract to the real without first creating a narrative which is depended on other narratives and which is further depended on even more stories we tell ourselves in order to fill in the thoughts between our thoughts (or what Heidegger called 'the ontological difference'). There is something very refreshing about an author who states 'Climate Change is real' as a fact. We live under a president whose mythos states in 144 characters or less that 'Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax'. I wish those kinds of people who base truth on their emotional based certainties would read a book like this one for edification. The Enlightenment spawned liberalism and firmed up humanism. The author will say that liberalism tends to 1) emphasize the individual, 2) enable the authentic self and 3) value experiences. The author uses his straw man version of liberalism (a version of Existentialism) and inverts all three of those points within his narrative and by citing relevant neurological experiments and concludes there is 1) no individual self (Harari has a lot of Hegelian thought, but never cites him), 2) there is no such thing as an authentic self, and 3) our values are skewed by our most recent experiences to the point for which we can’t always rely on them alone (never ignore your intellect!). The author argues against free will (hence there is no such thing as an authentic self) and thinks the concept of an immortal soul is contradictory and therefore not worth considering. Humanism is defined as worshiping humans, by him (overall he really doesn’t care for the Enlightenment). A somewhat loaded definition. He's arguing that our future world's values will be based on dataism. He predicts a future where reality unorganized has been converted to data which has been turned into information then knowledge and then finally wisdom. He definitely has a pessimistic bent to his future world view. He thinks people when the computers take over will be by and large left to staring at screens all day and forced to use opiods to deaden the boredom. Perhaps that's true. I know when I was liberated at an early age from working I took to bike riding 2 hours every day, stopped drinking beer, lost 75 pounds, started eating healthy, started reading books like this one, and became obsessed about learning about the universe and grateful for everyday I had to pursue what interests me the most (and opiods and screen staring had very little appeal for me). The author also had a weird Frankfurt School philosophy point of view throughout the book. Harari is a historian and this book is not a philosophy book as much as it is a historical or sociological book. He does quote from Nietzsche frequently, but in some places this book read like ""Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom (he's of the Frankfurt School as is Leo Strauss and Saul Bellow). They just don't like Nietzsche's relativism no matter what and this book makes the absurd claim that Beethoven's music is superior to Chuck Berry's music. I'm going to end that dumb assertion by the author who claims data would prove him right by asserting a young man alive in 1958 and wanted to meet that pretty girl over there and they both are attuned with their time period and singing ""Johnny B Goode"" is a way for him to meet her. Would that not show for that young man that Chuck Berry's music is superior, regardless of a stupid computer algorithm. The author puts together a masterpiece by weaving various threads to tell about how he believes our world will become. We don't live in an atomized world (that's part of why he rejects item 1 of individualism). Each part that we know gets its understanding from the whole and belongs in the web of knowledge. That's why climate change deniers are as irrelevant as a creationist would be. Both have no concept of the nature of reality and want to atomize knowledge (each item in science fits in a spider like web (see Willard van Orman Quine for amplification) and interacts with all the pieces around it, climate deniers can’t deny all of science so they latch on to anomalies that have no relevance beyond themselves). Harari talks about how that kind of thought culminated with Descartes' 'cogito ergo sum' and a lot of this book shows how that kind of thinking is poison for progress."

“Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.”
I've picked up Homo Deus shortly after finishing Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thinking this book about future will be a kind of sequel. And it was, kind of. Still, I don't recommend reading them closely together. Homo Deus builds on the ideas and interpretations of history he detailed in Sapiens. Probably to make the two books stand-alones and not require the knowledge of the other book to understand this one, Harari repeats and rehashes a lot of the material. The text is not the same, but his points and ideas behind the text are. They are interesting and I like them, but for the first half of the book, I thought I would give it 3 stars because the repetition happened too soon for me. And then part II happened. Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.When Harari actually got to talking about the future, the different possibilities and their implications, my mind was blown again. I was thinking, crying, arguing, trembling under the blanket, and reading on. The book provoked all kinds of thought and feelings, it impacted me in a big way. Naturally, it goes to my 'favorites' shelf now.Kudos to Harari for once again showing he can write an entertaining and thought-provoking book of speculation. "
53,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32917354-rebecca-carter,4,"It is a sobering thought; more people die today from eating too much food than from eating too little. More people die from old age than from infectious diseases or plagues and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. For the first time in history humankind's three major problems that have remain unchanged from the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and to the Victorian British, have been famine, plague and war. This has now been transformed through breakthroughs in the fields of medicine, science, technology, politics and through enlightenment in consciousnesses in humans as to what is right and wrong. Of course there are plenty of cases where things still go amiss, but in comparison to how things used to be, humanity's major problems and issues for the future are going to be a new set of challenges. Maybe humankind will have to decide between economic growth or ecological stability? The same growth that has provided economic growth and abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials, also destabilises the planets ecological equilibrium. Pollution, climate change, global warming may all be having detrimental affects on the planet that humankind hasn't fully explored. The book is split up into three parts based on Harari's interpretation of history, his theory on how it led us to how humanity is in the present day, and his predictions on our future, each based on possibilities, hypothetical assumptions and philosophical speculations. Harari explains in some depth why and how we are a humanist society, which is important in understanding his beliefs as to where humanity is heading. His prediction is based on what humans will try to achieve in the twenty first century - not what it will succeed in achieving. He says that his forecast of the future may not be terribly original, however it is based on a liberal humanist approach of ideas and hopes that have dominated the world for 300 years. He argues that humanism sanctifies the life, emotions and desires of humans, so it isn't too difficult or far fetched to predict it will follow that humans will next want to significantly lengthen human lifespans, happiness and power. Take our current society based on humanism out of the equation, and humanity's future may indeed be very different, instead based on a future born of ideas and hopes of the twenty first century that we currently struggle to imagine or comprehend. The final third part of the book argues that attempting to realise this liberal humanist dream will eventually undermine its very foundations, by unleashing new post-humanist technologies and scientific discoveries. These discoveries could be the downfall of liberalism. If humans no longer control the running of the world, would the biggest threat be from biotechnology and artificial intelligence? What new religion would replace liberalism? Harari believes it would be techno religions in the form of the more conservative techno humanism and the more terrifying data religion. Techno humanism thinks that Homo sapiens, as we know it today, will not be relevant in the future but will still cling to many humanist values. It believes that we should therefore use technology to upgrade Homo sapiens into a far superior human model; homo deus. Dataism doesn't see humans as the pinnacle of creation - it worships data, not humans - and states that the universe consists of data flows, with the value of any entity or phenomenon determined by its contribution to data processing. The scary thing is that either of Hirari's proposed eventual hypothesis are possible, just as there are further scenarios that may lie in humankinds future, scenarios we as humans could not even begin to fathom due to our current limitations. If you enjoy having your personal beliefs and thoughts challenged, this book definitely fires up your electrochemical brain processes. Harari's views on history and how it shaped our world today, may open up new ways of looking at things to the reader. He dissects the past and takes us on a journey, so that we can see why humanity is a liberal humanist society today and what it could mean for our future. Harari also ponders the big questions of the meaning and the point of life. The debates and issues raised in the book are thought inspiring and certainly made me contemplate some new ideas. I can see this book being scoffed at by overly religious people, or people with closed mindsets, due to some of Harari's beliefs - such as the soul doesn't exist, the true self is imaginary, and that we fundamentally live pointless lives as data processing units. However, his arguments do make sense if you can think about it reasonably and logically. As Harari states, the scenarios in the book aren't prophesies, but possibilities. He attempts to explain how our present day conditioning came about in order to loosen its hold on our imagination and broaden our horizons. You don't have to agree with everything he writes, but it is an interesting debate and will definitely make you ponder and contemplate the many issues that humanity will ultimately face.Thanks very much to Random House UK Vintage Publishing, Yuval Noah Harari and Net Galley for a copy of this ARC in exchange for a review."
54,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,4,"Excellent, scary and stimulating look at our species and history - and our future. This should appeal to anyone who writes or reads as Harari´s thesis rests on the fact that we - homo sapiens - need to believe in things, be it money, flags, countries, companies, stories or even ourselves. Here, as well as showing how we got to where we are, he shows us how our reliance on technology, algorithms and being told what to do may prove to be our eventual undoing. What do we value more - consciousness or intelligence? Does consciousness really matter when intelligent machines - intelligent people - can do things better than us, more safely than us, and more perfectly? If you look at your phone instead of looking out of the window to see what the weather´s like, you might like to examine the gulf between our romantic views of our species and the cold reality."

Humanism (inluding democracy, human rights and the underlying notion of free will) is apparently yesterday's news, as humans are outdated algorithms that are being superseded by 'the internet of all things'. The author unreservedly advocates surrendering our privacy and autonomy to 'algorithms', as Google and Facebook already supposedly know us better than we know ourselves. Allowing Google to read our emails is a recurring example, although Google actually recently stopped doing just that. It is one of many signs Harari is oversimplifying history (for instance, idealizing capitalism and neoliberalism, which conveniently allows him to refrain from mentioning criticism of Google and Facebook who only harvest our data for the financial gain of themselves and their shareholders, instead of improving mankind; or his statement that all life forms are merely data processing systems and that all of science agrees with that view) and the current state of affairs, in order to present a narrowminded, dystopian view of the future of mankind that is likely to earn him many additional invitations to TED Talks and other well-paid speaking gigs. The last pages are puzzling: it's where Harari unexpectedly backtracks and states we are perhaps not just algorithms after all; it's where he states he really wanted to broaden our horizon instead of presenting an inescapable view of the future - although that is *exactly* what he has done. It reads as a hastily added disclaimer that is written as a defense to all the valid criticism I envisage proofreaders may have presented to him - which is more convenient than rewriting the entire book, but it does seem that that is exactly what he should have done. This the type of book that distinguishes shortcut-seeking 'thought leaders' from bona fide public intellectuals, and Harari, regrettably and unexpectedly, seems to want to set up shop in the former camp."
56,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,3,"The author begins with the argument that individual human beings have no inherent value and that there is no such thing as individualism, that we are simply a collection of chemicals and neurons. He essentially mocks liberal humanism for placing any value in people as such. He argues that the advance of technology will only make this more so. In a sense, this is an old argument. The second wave of the industrial revolution had this effect and life expectancy plummeted. I've read Homo Sapiens. A lot of repetition of it in this book, with a wordy expansion of the final chapter of Sapiens. Many of his ideas are already dated, such as the importance of Big Data.

58,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,2,"What an enormously disappointing book.I enjoyed the first half of Harari's first book,Sapiens, and looked forward to this one. As a futurist I have to read books trying to scope out what's coming next. I also hoped his wry humor would reappear.Instead, I've been trying to choose a book rating between one and two stars.To begin with, the bulk of Homo Deus is not about the future of humanity. Instead it's a breezy tour of some aspects of human history and culture. The reason for that digression (more than one half the book!) is to ground two scenarios about the future, but it doesn't work well, and ultimately wastes a lot of time. The kernel of Homo Deus is just over one hundred pages (start with chapter 9).At best that tour is potted history, reminding us that liberal democracy appeared in the late 1700s, that industrialism changed civilization, that secularization is a thing, etc. It's akin to clicking through Wikipedia. At worst Harari offers his snap judgments on different developments, which are dubious. For example, he brutalizes Marxism in typical ways (it's a religion, it's really a form of therapy, etc). There's also a long digression about animal rights which turns out to play no meaningful role in the rest of the book. After the first 100 pages of this I stopped taking notes, because I would end up with my own book in response, and I'm busy starting a very different book.When Homo Deus finally gets around to addressing its purpose (subtitle: ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"") (and that part really is brief), the text is entirely drawn from current events and popular discussion. Readers can extract the highlights from any number of bloggers or articles. Automation's becoming big? Check. Biological sciences are advancing rapidly? Check. Data is increasingly important? Yup. The internet of things looms large? Uh huh.So what's useful in it?The author offers several visions of the future wherein human civilization experiences a major transformation. A key step is the decline of ""liberalism"" (a rough grab-bag for representative democracy, some kinds of individualism, some form of capitalism, a touch of pluralism) in the face of biology and technology. The life sciences and computation have shifted us towards a new notion of people driven by genetic forces and best apprehended through data. Side effects include some loss of privacy, a setting aside of democracy (maybe? this isn't developed, hilariously), and increasing class divides. Interestingly, Harari backs away from the singularity idea.Even more interesting, and, for me, more depressing, is the book's refusal to take inequality seriously. That is, Homo Deus is very interested in how technology and life sciences could expand socio-economic inequality, and how some cultural responses could happen, but isn't concerned with actual economics or politics. There's no sense of business being interested in keeping compensation low, of regulatory capture by the financial sector, or of why unionization might have declined. Similarly the book isn't concerned about national security states; it prefers to wonder about Facebook rather than the NSA.I admit to enjoying some instances of Harari's humor. I like his paralleling of gods, states, and businesses, for instance. It's not a new idea, but I'm always glad to see anarchist concepts in the mainstream. I appreciate his thorough skepticism about religions, too.Yet overall this is one of those books which becomes easier to bear the more quickly you read it. It *might* be a fun read for secondary school students who haven't been excited about history. Otherwise, skip the thing."

Sapiens
? Remember how it brilliantly explained all of human history? Well, now Yuval Noah Harari explains some of the possibilities for humanity's future.Picking up on his thesis of humans as storytellers, he looks at the main stories we've told: religion and humanism and how they may fare in an increasingly technological world. The old certainties are built on these old stories. Can liberalism and democracy survive in a world where the biological algorithms of our bodies bring free will into question? What is our role when data and AI become ubiquitous? Assuming no easy answers - nor any certainty about his own predictions - Harari again shows why he is the new Jared Diamond."

Not only can we communicate, but we can also comminuticate about thing that exist only in our common imagination, such as corporations, google and god. Science does not make ethical judgements, it's not able to give meaning to life. The past few hundred years have seen a human sentered religion taking place of more traditional religions, humanism. Humanism puts the human liberty and free will first, and individualism. Gone is collectivism and here and now is how you feel about something. I never considered humanism another religion. I didn't really equate the bill of human rights with the ten commandments. Yet humanism and the internal conflicts within almost tore the world apart in the 20th century. However, individual liberty is not likely to continue. Human value is likely to be surpassed. The future of the world is an algorithm. The author intends to shock and he does. Whatever your belief system is, he is likely to shake you. It certainly shook mine, even though I also read and loved ""Sapiens: a brief history of humankind"".

It let's you know the important technical advances that could have huge implications to society: specifically technologies that could end liberalism, humanism, and capitalism.It's hard to imagine a current world without one of those things. But in the not-to-distant future, all three of them could be gone.Harari makes the case that technology has, objectively, made the world a better place over time. And we shouldn't worry that the coming technologies will turn that trend around. Objectively, Harari argues, the future will be better.But the big question is: would the future be better off without humans? Do humans really matter to the future? And if we don't, what becomes of us?Like Sapiens, Homo Deus is an incredibly enlightening read."
64,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24275344-nmalpas,1,"Read the intro, skip the rest.I was intrigued by the premise of this (especially given that I love sci-fi and this promised a nonfiction treatment of some classic sci-fi themes). The introduction does indeed present some some interesting lines of thought about what human beings have achieved as a species and how things might progress. But that early promise was sorely dissappointed.Harari is fine as long as he sticks to his actual area of expertise, namely, history. Though even his historical insights are rather superficial and he goes on and on about many simple points ad nauseum. The real problem is that large parts of the book stray from history not only into other social sciences and physical sciences but most ruinously of all into philosophy, of which Harari clearly has little understanding. He falls victim to countless conceptual conceptions, his arguments are full of holes, he overstates his confusions, and shows a shocking ignorance of existing discussions in philosophy mind, social ontology, ethics, etc. But this cluelessness does not prevent him from giving what he supposes to be definite answers on a slew of very difficult and controversial issues in philosophy (like the problem of other mind and the nature of morality).Overall, most of the book reads like an undergraduate philosophy assignment - a good one mind, but not something anyone should expect to gain much insight or pleasure from, nor even something you would expect to find in a lauded book form a major publisher. If you don't have much philosophical background, you might be able to read this without getting infuriated; you might even come away thinking it was profound. But your sense of wonder or enlightenment would be a sham: you will just have taken on a bunch of delusions and been habituated to shoddy argument and conceptual analysis. (less)"

Even the best of the carriages becomes obsolete once a car comes along.What will happen if P is proven to be equal to NP?What if interstellar flights becomes a reality?Absurd? In 1940s there was no computer, just seventy years later we're talking about Dataism.Even relatively realistic projects like Mars colonization or  mind control technology can change the future beyond recognition.Reading this book felt more like A Brief History of The Most Likely Versions of Tomorrow Until A Car Shows Up than what the title suggests."

I was getting worried while reading this chapter. Totally a disappointment because most contents have already appeared earlier in the last chapters of Sapiens. So, it felt like Harari is losing his charm and I was worried if he had written such an unnecessary lengthy book just to extend the last chapters of Sapiens!But I was wrong, though the first chapter was truly a disappointment, the following three parts were marvellous and amazing. Even I find it better than Sapiens :D (So, I readjusted my Sapiens rating down to 4 :p ). I could relate to its contents more --- philosophically, emotionally, and practically than the prehistoric stories of Sapiens [the only thing in Sapiens I could relate to --- is the story of capitalism]."

71,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5859680-mandy,5,"What a compelling, engaging, thought-provoking, and ultimately quite terrifying book this is. I found it unputdownable - there’s just so much food for thought in its pages and I often find myself thinking back to it when I hear of advances in science and technology with which the author’s vision of the future begins to seem ever more plausible. He describes how human nature, indeed our very humanity, could be transformed in the not very distant future due to developments in bio-technology, bio-engineering, genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence combining to create a very different sort of human being. A complete step-change for humanity and the next stage of evolution. The dizzying speed of change in scientific progress makes prediction a risky process but it seems clear, even to the most sceptical, that our world is changing and we humans along with it. Intelligent, insightful, accessible and eminently readable, this is a fascinating book which carries the reader along with its scope and vision. "
72,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,3,"A fascinating read, as Sapiens was. Unfortunately the book repeats a lot of the ideas mentioned there, at least in the first half. I loved how Harari talks about liberalism, communism, democracy etc as religions of modern times. He then culminates with mentioning the religion of the near future: dataism. Overall, to be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise very much thought provoking. To be discussed over wine. I wish I would have read this paired with another friend.Although very interesting, too much of it is redundant if you've already read Sapiens. If you have to choose, read only one. I enjoyed the other one more. This one is too speculative and it gave me anxiety. The structure of the book is also a bit on the wild side making it difficult to properly split the ideas here and there."

In this book the writer gets more philosophical and wants the reader to question themselves regarding their future. Do they want more freedom but less control over their lives or vice versa. In an age, where every bit of data about our identities, choices and expectations are out on the table for being used and saved for further analysis constantly by computers and networks; he points out to future prospects and dangers.Very enjoyable read."

""Unlike the narrating self that controls us today, Google will not make decisions on the basis of cooked-up stories, and will not be misled by cognitive short cuts and the peak-end rule. Google will actually remember every step we took and every hand we shook.""""In exchange for such devoted counselling services, we will just have to give up the idea that humans are individuals, and that each human has a free will determining what’s good, what’s beautiful and what is the meaning of life.

77,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16325176-jiachen-guo,1,"Another disappointment from Yuval Noah Harari. All the rave about this terrific and ambitious author compelled me to read both of his works, Sapiens and Homo Deus. Both have disappointed me. I am insanely interested in both this topics and hoped to gain a thorough understanding through these two books but instead I find myself bashing the author all the time because of the unsettling amount of logical fallacies and sweeping arguments he committed in the book.In my opinion, such a book should be founded upon solid science, has considered every possible theory and leaves little room for disagreement. However, I have to say that Yuval Noah Harari is a terrible scientist and should not be allowed write ambitious science books like these for he is not qualified. Though the book is heavy with content and backed with loads of research, most of the arguments Yuval makes are with weak foundations and not convincing enough. Most of the the time I feel like I am reading an essay written by a high schooler, who has the help of google and pieced carelessly selected facts from the internet together to attempt to fool an examiner that his stand is justifiable. An example- Yuval tries to justify his stand that more people die of eating too much than by natural disasters, plagues and war by saying 'In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald's than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.' How is this not something you would expect from a high schooler's essay? So Yuval conveniently selected four isolated events that in no way can represent 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague' and 'war' with convenient statistics that just so happened to 'justify' his argument, in hope that the reader be fooled by this flawed logic. It is equally easy to select four other individual subset events of 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague', 'war' and compare the statistics to 'prove' that Yuval is wrong. Such is the logic flaws that Yuval littered his book with and makes me wonder why have I bothered reading such a carelessly treated book."
78,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2870295-shaun-hutchinson,0,"I enjoyed listening to Yuval Harari discuss his book more than I enjoyed the book itself. There are some incredibly fascinating ideas here, and some well thought out predictions. Unfortunately, there are also some unsourced and easily contradicted assertions that undercut his arguments. Like that more Americans read digital books than physical. I simply can't find any source that supports that. Or using Microsoft's Cortana as the example of a personal digital assistant that's going to rule our lives. I mean, maybe, but Cortana over Alexa? It's little things like that that make me question Harari's handle on the tech side of things. Additionally, when discussing the science, especially the bioscience aspects, Harari offers few actual, concrete examples beyond what I could find listening to an NPR podcast. It's a fine book for a broad, general look at the potential future of biotech and machine learning, and a better look the historical context that put us here, but it feels a bit thin to me.One other thing I disliked was the manner in which Harari seemed to act as if taking psychiatric medications for therapeutic reasons was the same as taking them for a cognitive boost. A person who takes Adderall because they have ADD is taking them in order to bring themselves up to baseline functionality and isn't gaining an advantage over someone who does not have ADD and isn't taking Aderall. Suggesting otherwise is like suggesting a person with an amputated leg gains a significant advantage from using a prosthesis over someone who has both of their legs. It's a false equivalency that I see peddled far too often, and it's BS. Overall, an interesting book, but one read with a critical eye. "

81,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This is a remarkably good book. Our world is shaped by our logos, pathos, and mythos. That's just a fancy way of saying it's our reason, feelings, and beliefs that make us who we are. This book takes all three methods that we use to understand, adds some historical perspective and explains the human experience better than almost anyone and speculates where we as a society will be going in the relatively near future. Feelings are not facts, but we use our feelings to understand and process the sensuous world that we our thrown into, and we use what we think we know based on what our past beliefs were in order to understand the present. We are always in a strange loop that never quite converges because the past keeps receding and we are always anticipating the future. This book will cite a series of many neurological experiments (oh I feel for those poor rats) which show how we create narratives based on experiences and overweigh the most previous moment disproportionately from what logic dictates.Have you ever talked to people who are part of the cult of Trump? I have. They weigh each of the most previous moments’ experience that they've heard from Rush Limbaugh or Brietbart's news or Trump's 144 characters tweet disproportionately over previous data with an exponential decay set so high that history and perspective doesn't matter to them. They also would reject the principals within this book for one other big reason. They live in a universe without doubts by outsourcing their beliefs to a book or to a cult leader thus ascertaining certainty within their mythical constructions using their gut feelings as their standard for truth. Mythos dwellers never know it's a myth while they are living within the myth and will create alternative facts or whine 'fake news' when challenged. One cannot go from the abstract to the real without first creating a narrative which is depended on other narratives and which is further depended on even more stories we tell ourselves in order to fill in the thoughts between our thoughts (or what Heidegger called 'the ontological difference'). There is something very refreshing about an author who states 'Climate Change is real' as a fact. We live under a president whose mythos states in 144 characters or less that 'Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax'. I wish those kinds of people who base truth on their emotional based certainties would read a book like this one for edification. The Enlightenment spawned liberalism and firmed up humanism. The author will say that liberalism tends to 1) emphasize the individual, 2) enable the authentic self and 3) value experiences. The author uses his straw man version of liberalism (a version of Existentialism) and inverts all three of those points within his narrative and by citing relevant neurological experiments and concludes there is 1) no individual self (Harari has a lot of Hegelian thought, but never cites him), 2) there is no such thing as an authentic self, and 3) our values are skewed by our most recent experiences to the point for which we can’t always rely on them alone (never ignore your intellect!). The author argues against free will (hence there is no such thing as an authentic self) and thinks the concept of an immortal soul is contradictory and therefore not worth considering. Humanism is defined as worshiping humans, by him (overall he really doesn’t care for the Enlightenment). A somewhat loaded definition. He's arguing that our future world's values will be based on dataism. He predicts a future where reality unorganized has been converted to data which has been turned into information then knowledge and then finally wisdom. He definitely has a pessimistic bent to his future world view. He thinks people when the computers take over will be by and large left to staring at screens all day and forced to use opiods to deaden the boredom. Perhaps that's true. I know when I was liberated at an early age from working I took to bike riding 2 hours every day, stopped drinking beer, lost 75 pounds, started eating healthy, started reading books like this one, and became obsessed about learning about the universe and grateful for everyday I had to pursue what interests me the most (and opiods and screen staring had very little appeal for me). The author also had a weird Frankfurt School philosophy point of view throughout the book. Harari is a historian and this book is not a philosophy book as much as it is a historical or sociological book. He does quote from Nietzsche frequently, but in some places this book read like ""Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom (he's of the Frankfurt School as is Leo Strauss and Saul Bellow). They just don't like Nietzsche's relativism no matter what and this book makes the absurd claim that Beethoven's music is superior to Chuck Berry's music. I'm going to end that dumb assertion by the author who claims data would prove him right by asserting a young man alive in 1958 and wanted to meet that pretty girl over there and they both are attuned with their time period and singing ""Johnny B Goode"" is a way for him to meet her. Would that not show for that young man that Chuck Berry's music is superior, regardless of a stupid computer algorithm. The author puts together a masterpiece by weaving various threads to tell about how he believes our world will become. We don't live in an atomized world (that's part of why he rejects item 1 of individualism). Each part that we know gets its understanding from the whole and belongs in the web of knowledge. That's why climate change deniers are as irrelevant as a creationist would be. Both have no concept of the nature of reality and want to atomize knowledge (each item in science fits in a spider like web (see Willard van Orman Quine for amplification) and interacts with all the pieces around it, climate deniers can’t deny all of science so they latch on to anomalies that have no relevance beyond themselves). Harari talks about how that kind of thought culminated with Descartes' 'cogito ergo sum' and a lot of this book shows how that kind of thinking is poison for progress."

“Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.”
I've picked up Homo Deus shortly after finishing Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thinking this book about future will be a kind of sequel. And it was, kind of. Still, I don't recommend reading them closely together. Homo Deus builds on the ideas and interpretations of history he detailed in Sapiens. Probably to make the two books stand-alones and not require the knowledge of the other book to understand this one, Harari repeats and rehashes a lot of the material. The text is not the same, but his points and ideas behind the text are. They are interesting and I like them, but for the first half of the book, I thought I would give it 3 stars because the repetition happened too soon for me. And then part II happened. Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.When Harari actually got to talking about the future, the different possibilities and their implications, my mind was blown again. I was thinking, crying, arguing, trembling under the blanket, and reading on. The book provoked all kinds of thought and feelings, it impacted me in a big way. Naturally, it goes to my 'favorites' shelf now.Kudos to Harari for once again showing he can write an entertaining and thought-provoking book of speculation. "
83,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32917354-rebecca-carter,4,"It is a sobering thought; more people die today from eating too much food than from eating too little. More people die from old age than from infectious diseases or plagues and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. For the first time in history humankind's three major problems that have remain unchanged from the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and to the Victorian British, have been famine, plague and war. This has now been transformed through breakthroughs in the fields of medicine, science, technology, politics and through enlightenment in consciousnesses in humans as to what is right and wrong. Of course there are plenty of cases where things still go amiss, but in comparison to how things used to be, humanity's major problems and issues for the future are going to be a new set of challenges. Maybe humankind will have to decide between economic growth or ecological stability? The same growth that has provided economic growth and abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials, also destabilises the planets ecological equilibrium. Pollution, climate change, global warming may all be having detrimental affects on the planet that humankind hasn't fully explored. The book is split up into three parts based on Harari's interpretation of history, his theory on how it led us to how humanity is in the present day, and his predictions on our future, each based on possibilities, hypothetical assumptions and philosophical speculations. Harari explains in some depth why and how we are a humanist society, which is important in understanding his beliefs as to where humanity is heading. His prediction is based on what humans will try to achieve in the twenty first century - not what it will succeed in achieving. He says that his forecast of the future may not be terribly original, however it is based on a liberal humanist approach of ideas and hopes that have dominated the world for 300 years. He argues that humanism sanctifies the life, emotions and desires of humans, so it isn't too difficult or far fetched to predict it will follow that humans will next want to significantly lengthen human lifespans, happiness and power. Take our current society based on humanism out of the equation, and humanity's future may indeed be very different, instead based on a future born of ideas and hopes of the twenty first century that we currently struggle to imagine or comprehend. The final third part of the book argues that attempting to realise this liberal humanist dream will eventually undermine its very foundations, by unleashing new post-humanist technologies and scientific discoveries. These discoveries could be the downfall of liberalism. If humans no longer control the running of the world, would the biggest threat be from biotechnology and artificial intelligence? What new religion would replace liberalism? Harari believes it would be techno religions in the form of the more conservative techno humanism and the more terrifying data religion. Techno humanism thinks that Homo sapiens, as we know it today, will not be relevant in the future but will still cling to many humanist values. It believes that we should therefore use technology to upgrade Homo sapiens into a far superior human model; homo deus. Dataism doesn't see humans as the pinnacle of creation - it worships data, not humans - and states that the universe consists of data flows, with the value of any entity or phenomenon determined by its contribution to data processing. The scary thing is that either of Hirari's proposed eventual hypothesis are possible, just as there are further scenarios that may lie in humankinds future, scenarios we as humans could not even begin to fathom due to our current limitations. If you enjoy having your personal beliefs and thoughts challenged, this book definitely fires up your electrochemical brain processes. Harari's views on history and how it shaped our world today, may open up new ways of looking at things to the reader. He dissects the past and takes us on a journey, so that we can see why humanity is a liberal humanist society today and what it could mean for our future. Harari also ponders the big questions of the meaning and the point of life. The debates and issues raised in the book are thought inspiring and certainly made me contemplate some new ideas. I can see this book being scoffed at by overly religious people, or people with closed mindsets, due to some of Harari's beliefs - such as the soul doesn't exist, the true self is imaginary, and that we fundamentally live pointless lives as data processing units. However, his arguments do make sense if you can think about it reasonably and logically. As Harari states, the scenarios in the book aren't prophesies, but possibilities. He attempts to explain how our present day conditioning came about in order to loosen its hold on our imagination and broaden our horizons. You don't have to agree with everything he writes, but it is an interesting debate and will definitely make you ponder and contemplate the many issues that humanity will ultimately face.Thanks very much to Random House UK Vintage Publishing, Yuval Noah Harari and Net Galley for a copy of this ARC in exchange for a review."
84,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,4,"Excellent, scary and stimulating look at our species and history - and our future. This should appeal to anyone who writes or reads as Harari´s thesis rests on the fact that we - homo sapiens - need to believe in things, be it money, flags, countries, companies, stories or even ourselves. Here, as well as showing how we got to where we are, he shows us how our reliance on technology, algorithms and being told what to do may prove to be our eventual undoing. What do we value more - consciousness or intelligence? Does consciousness really matter when intelligent machines - intelligent people - can do things better than us, more safely than us, and more perfectly? If you look at your phone instead of looking out of the window to see what the weather´s like, you might like to examine the gulf between our romantic views of our species and the cold reality."

Humanism (inluding democracy, human rights and the underlying notion of free will) is apparently yesterday's news, as humans are outdated algorithms that are being superseded by 'the internet of all things'. The author unreservedly advocates surrendering our privacy and autonomy to 'algorithms', as Google and Facebook already supposedly know us better than we know ourselves. Allowing Google to read our emails is a recurring example, although Google actually recently stopped doing just that. It is one of many signs Harari is oversimplifying history (for instance, idealizing capitalism and neoliberalism, which conveniently allows him to refrain from mentioning criticism of Google and Facebook who only harvest our data for the financial gain of themselves and their shareholders, instead of improving mankind; or his statement that all life forms are merely data processing systems and that all of science agrees with that view) and the current state of affairs, in order to present a narrowminded, dystopian view of the future of mankind that is likely to earn him many additional invitations to TED Talks and other well-paid speaking gigs. The last pages are puzzling: it's where Harari unexpectedly backtracks and states we are perhaps not just algorithms after all; it's where he states he really wanted to broaden our horizon instead of presenting an inescapable view of the future - although that is *exactly* what he has done. It reads as a hastily added disclaimer that is written as a defense to all the valid criticism I envisage proofreaders may have presented to him - which is more convenient than rewriting the entire book, but it does seem that that is exactly what he should have done. This the type of book that distinguishes shortcut-seeking 'thought leaders' from bona fide public intellectuals, and Harari, regrettably and unexpectedly, seems to want to set up shop in the former camp."
86,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,3,"The author begins with the argument that individual human beings have no inherent value and that there is no such thing as individualism, that we are simply a collection of chemicals and neurons. He essentially mocks liberal humanism for placing any value in people as such. He argues that the advance of technology will only make this more so. In a sense, this is an old argument. The second wave of the industrial revolution had this effect and life expectancy plummeted. I've read Homo Sapiens. A lot of repetition of it in this book, with a wordy expansion of the final chapter of Sapiens. Many of his ideas are already dated, such as the importance of Big Data.

88,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,2,"What an enormously disappointing book.I enjoyed the first half of Harari's first book,Sapiens, and looked forward to this one. As a futurist I have to read books trying to scope out what's coming next. I also hoped his wry humor would reappear.Instead, I've been trying to choose a book rating between one and two stars.To begin with, the bulk of Homo Deus is not about the future of humanity. Instead it's a breezy tour of some aspects of human history and culture. The reason for that digression (more than one half the book!) is to ground two scenarios about the future, but it doesn't work well, and ultimately wastes a lot of time. The kernel of Homo Deus is just over one hundred pages (start with chapter 9).At best that tour is potted history, reminding us that liberal democracy appeared in the late 1700s, that industrialism changed civilization, that secularization is a thing, etc. It's akin to clicking through Wikipedia. At worst Harari offers his snap judgments on different developments, which are dubious. For example, he brutalizes Marxism in typical ways (it's a religion, it's really a form of therapy, etc). There's also a long digression about animal rights which turns out to play no meaningful role in the rest of the book. After the first 100 pages of this I stopped taking notes, because I would end up with my own book in response, and I'm busy starting a very different book.When Homo Deus finally gets around to addressing its purpose (subtitle: ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"") (and that part really is brief), the text is entirely drawn from current events and popular discussion. Readers can extract the highlights from any number of bloggers or articles. Automation's becoming big? Check. Biological sciences are advancing rapidly? Check. Data is increasingly important? Yup. The internet of things looms large? Uh huh.So what's useful in it?The author offers several visions of the future wherein human civilization experiences a major transformation. A key step is the decline of ""liberalism"" (a rough grab-bag for representative democracy, some kinds of individualism, some form of capitalism, a touch of pluralism) in the face of biology and technology. The life sciences and computation have shifted us towards a new notion of people driven by genetic forces and best apprehended through data. Side effects include some loss of privacy, a setting aside of democracy (maybe? this isn't developed, hilariously), and increasing class divides. Interestingly, Harari backs away from the singularity idea.Even more interesting, and, for me, more depressing, is the book's refusal to take inequality seriously. That is, Homo Deus is very interested in how technology and life sciences could expand socio-economic inequality, and how some cultural responses could happen, but isn't concerned with actual economics or politics. There's no sense of business being interested in keeping compensation low, of regulatory capture by the financial sector, or of why unionization might have declined. Similarly the book isn't concerned about national security states; it prefers to wonder about Facebook rather than the NSA.I admit to enjoying some instances of Harari's humor. I like his paralleling of gods, states, and businesses, for instance. It's not a new idea, but I'm always glad to see anarchist concepts in the mainstream. I appreciate his thorough skepticism about religions, too.Yet overall this is one of those books which becomes easier to bear the more quickly you read it. It *might* be a fun read for secondary school students who haven't been excited about history. Otherwise, skip the thing."

Sapiens
? Remember how it brilliantly explained all of human history? Well, now Yuval Noah Harari explains some of the possibilities for humanity's future.Picking up on his thesis of humans as storytellers, he looks at the main stories we've told: religion and humanism and how they may fare in an increasingly technological world. The old certainties are built on these old stories. Can liberalism and democracy survive in a world where the biological algorithms of our bodies bring free will into question? What is our role when data and AI become ubiquitous? Assuming no easy answers - nor any certainty about his own predictions - Harari again shows why he is the new Jared Diamond."

Not only can we communicate, but we can also comminuticate about thing that exist only in our common imagination, such as corporations, google and god. Science does not make ethical judgements, it's not able to give meaning to life. The past few hundred years have seen a human sentered religion taking place of more traditional religions, humanism. Humanism puts the human liberty and free will first, and individualism. Gone is collectivism and here and now is how you feel about something. I never considered humanism another religion. I didn't really equate the bill of human rights with the ten commandments. Yet humanism and the internal conflicts within almost tore the world apart in the 20th century. However, individual liberty is not likely to continue. Human value is likely to be surpassed. The future of the world is an algorithm. The author intends to shock and he does. Whatever your belief system is, he is likely to shake you. It certainly shook mine, even though I also read and loved ""Sapiens: a brief history of humankind"". I know now that, as I suspected, I will have been left behind within my lifetime. "

He does not leave any stone unturned, and discusses anything from the impact of A.I. in our lives to the future of religion.I was captivated by the book and look forward to reading his most recent title, 21 LESSONS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.

You're probably well versed in these ideas. Money, cultural realism, trust, and how we use technology or religion is al based on a fiction that we all accept. No problem. When it comes to imagining what might come next, from singularities, man-machine hybrids, or the idea that AIs might consider us superfluous (an idea I am increasingly starting to agree with), there really isn't anything groundbreaking here.So why do I give it a four rather than a three or lower?It's entertaining, well-written, and while it doesn't scratch my itch to learn anything new, it is a fairly comprehensive backdrop of what might come next. Of course, we're dealing with future prediction here. Most of what we assume will never come about. :)Oh, well! At least it's consensual food-for-thought. Zeitgeist stuff. Our current hopes and fears rather than reality. :)"

It let's you know the important technical advances that could have huge implications to society: specifically technologies that could end liberalism, humanism, and capitalism.It's hard to imagine a current world without one of those things. But in the not-to-distant future, all three of them could be gone.Harari makes the case that technology has, objectively, made the world a better place over time. And we shouldn't worry that the coming technologies will turn that trend around. Objectively, Harari argues, the future will be better.But the big question is: would the future be better off without humans? Do humans really matter to the future? And if we don't, what becomes of us?Like Sapiens, Homo Deus is an incredibly enlightening read."
94,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24275344-nmalpas,1,"Read the intro, skip the rest.I was intrigued by the premise of this (especially given that I love sci-fi and this promised a nonfiction treatment of some classic sci-fi themes). The introduction does indeed present some some interesting lines of thought about what human beings have achieved as a species and how things might progress. But that early promise was sorely dissappointed.Harari is fine as long as he sticks to his actual area of expertise, namely, history. Though even his historical insights are rather superficial and he goes on and on about many simple points ad nauseum. The real problem is that large parts of the book stray from history not only into other social sciences and physical sciences but most ruinously of all into philosophy, of which Harari clearly has little understanding. He falls victim to countless conceptual conceptions, his arguments are full of holes, he overstates his confusions, and shows a shocking ignorance of existing discussions in philosophy mind, social ontology, ethics, etc. But this cluelessness does not prevent him from giving what he supposes to be definite answers on a slew of very difficult and controversial issues in philosophy (like the problem of other mind and the nature of morality).Overall, most of the book reads like an undergraduate philosophy assignment - a good one mind, but not something anyone should expect to gain much insight or pleasure from, nor even something you would expect to find in a lauded book form a major publisher. If you don't have much philosophical background, you might be able to read this without getting infuriated; you might even come away thinking it was profound. But your sense of wonder or enlightenment would be a sham: you will just have taken on a bunch of delusions and been habituated to shoddy argument and conceptual analysis. (less)"

I was getting worried while reading this chapter. Totally a disappointment because most contents have already appeared earlier in the last chapters of Sapiens. So, it felt like Harari is losing his charm and I was worried if he had written such an unnecessary lengthy book just to extend the last chapters of Sapiens!But I was wrong, though the first chapter was truly a disappointment, the following three parts were marvellous and amazing. Even I find it better than Sapiens :D (So, I readjusted my Sapiens rating down to 4 :p ). I could relate to its contents more --- philosophically, emotionally, and practically than the prehistoric stories of Sapiens [the only thing in Sapiens I could relate to --- is the story of capitalism]."

I found it unputdownable - there’s just so much food for thought in its pages and I often find myself thinking back to it when I hear of advances in science and technology with which the author’s vision of the future begins to seem ever more plausible. He describes how human nature, indeed our very humanity, could be transformed in the not very distant future due to developments in bio-technology, bio-engineering, genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence combining to create a very different sort of human being. A complete step-change for humanity and the next stage of evolution. The dizzying speed of change in scientific progress makes prediction a risky process but it seems clear, even to the most sceptical, that our world is changing and we humans along with it. Intelligent, insightful, accessible and eminently readable, this is a fascinating book which carries the reader along with its scope and vision. "
102,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,3,"A fascinating read, as Sapiens was. Unfortunately the book repeats a lot of the ideas mentioned there, at least in the first half. I loved how Harari talks about liberalism, communism, democracy etc as religions of modern times. He then culminates with mentioning the religion of the near future: dataism. Overall, to be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise very much thought provoking. To be discussed over wine. I wish I would have read this paired with another friend.Although very interesting, too much of it is redundant if you've already read Sapiens. If you have to choose, read only one. I enjoyed the other one more. This one is too speculative and it gave me anxiety. The structure of the book is also a bit on the wild side making it difficult to properly split the ideas here and there."

107,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16325176-jiachen-guo,1,"Another disappointment from Yuval Noah Harari. All the rave about this terrific and ambitious author compelled me to read both of his works, Sapiens and Homo Deus. Both have disappointed me. I am insanely interested in both this topics and hoped to gain a thorough understanding through these two books but instead I find myself bashing the author all the time because of the unsettling amount of logical fallacies and sweeping arguments he committed in the book.In my opinion, such a book should be founded upon solid science, has considered every possible theory and leaves little room for disagreement. However, I have to say that Yuval Noah Harari is a terrible scientist and should not be allowed write ambitious science books like these for he is not qualified. Though the book is heavy with content and backed with loads of research, most of the arguments Yuval makes are with weak foundations and not convincing enough. Most of the the time I feel like I am reading an essay written by a high schooler, who has the help of google and pieced carelessly selected facts from the internet together to attempt to fool an examiner that his stand is justifiable. An example- Yuval tries to justify his stand that more people die of eating too much than by natural disasters, plagues and war by saying 'In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald's than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.' How is this not something you would expect from a high schooler's essay? So Yuval conveniently selected four isolated events that in no way can represent 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague' and 'war' with convenient statistics that just so happened to 'justify' his argument, in hope that the reader be fooled by this flawed logic. It is equally easy to select four other individual subset events of 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague', 'war' and compare the statistics to 'prove' that Yuval is wrong. Such is the logic flaws that Yuval littered his book with and makes me wonder why have I bothered reading such a carelessly treated book."
108,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2870295-shaun-hutchinson,0,"I enjoyed listening to Yuval Harari discuss his book more than I enjoyed the book itself. There are some incredibly fascinating ideas here, and some well thought out predictions. Unfortunately, there are also some unsourced and easily contradicted assertions that undercut his arguments. Like that more Americans read digital books than physical. I simply can't find any source that supports that. Or using Microsoft's Cortana as the example of a personal digital assistant that's going to rule our lives. I mean, maybe, but Cortana over Alexa? It's little things like that that make me question Harari's handle on the tech side of things. Additionally, when discussing the science, especially the bioscience aspects, Harari offers few actual, concrete examples beyond what I could find listening to an NPR podcast. It's a fine book for a broad, general look at the potential future of biotech and machine learning, and a better look the historical context that put us here, but it feels a bit thin to me.One other thing I disliked was the manner in which Harari seemed to act as if taking psychiatric medications for therapeutic reasons was the same as taking them for a cognitive boost. A person who takes Adderall because they have ADD is taking them in order to bring themselves up to baseline functionality and isn't gaining an advantage over someone who does not have ADD and isn't taking Aderall. Suggesting otherwise is like suggesting a person with an amputated leg gains a significant advantage from using a prosthesis over someone who has both of their legs. It's a false equivalency that I see peddled far too often, and it's BS. Overall, an interesting book, but one read with a critical eye. "

111,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This is a remarkably good book. Our world is shaped by our logos, pathos, and mythos. That's just a fancy way of saying it's our reason, feelings, and beliefs that make us who we are. This book takes all three methods that we use to understand, adds some historical perspective and explains the human experience better than almost anyone and speculates where we as a society will be going in the relatively near future. Feelings are not facts, but we use our feelings to understand and process the sensuous world that we our thrown into, and we use what we think we know based on what our past beliefs were in order to understand the present. We are always in a strange loop that never quite converges because the past keeps receding and we are always anticipating the future. This book will cite a series of many neurological experiments (oh I feel for those poor rats) which show how we create narratives based on experiences and overweigh the most previous moment disproportionately from what logic dictates.Have you ever talked to people who are part of the cult of Trump? I have. They weigh each of the most previous moments’ experience that they've heard from Rush Limbaugh or Brietbart's news or Trump's 144 characters tweet disproportionately over previous data with an exponential decay set so high that history and perspective doesn't matter to them. They also would reject the principals within this book for one other big reason. They live in a universe without doubts by outsourcing their beliefs to a book or to a cult leader thus ascertaining certainty within their mythical constructions using their gut feelings as their standard for truth. Mythos dwellers never know it's a myth while they are living within the myth and will create alternative facts or whine 'fake news' when challenged. One cannot go from the abstract to the real without first creating a narrative which is depended on other narratives and which is further depended on even more stories we tell ourselves in order to fill in the thoughts between our thoughts (or what Heidegger called 'the ontological difference'). There is something very refreshing about an author who states 'Climate Change is real' as a fact. We live under a president whose mythos states in 144 characters or less that 'Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax'. I wish those kinds of people who base truth on their emotional based certainties would read a book like this one for edification. The Enlightenment spawned liberalism and firmed up humanism. The author will say that liberalism tends to 1) emphasize the individual, 2) enable the authentic self and 3) value experiences. The author uses his straw man version of liberalism (a version of Existentialism) and inverts all three of those points within his narrative and by citing relevant neurological experiments and concludes there is 1) no individual self (Harari has a lot of Hegelian thought, but never cites him), 2) there is no such thing as an authentic self, and 3) our values are skewed by our most recent experiences to the point for which we can’t always rely on them alone (never ignore your intellect!). The author argues against free will (hence there is no such thing as an authentic self) and thinks the concept of an immortal soul is contradictory and therefore not worth considering. Humanism is defined as worshiping humans, by him (overall he really doesn’t care for the Enlightenment). A somewhat loaded definition. He's arguing that our future world's values will be based on dataism. He predicts a future where reality unorganized has been converted to data which has been turned into information then knowledge and then finally wisdom. He definitely has a pessimistic bent to his future world view. He thinks people when the computers take over will be by and large left to staring at screens all day and forced to use opiods to deaden the boredom. Perhaps that's true. I know when I was liberated at an early age from working I took to bike riding 2 hours every day, stopped drinking beer, lost 75 pounds, started eating healthy, started reading books like this one, and became obsessed about learning about the universe and grateful for everyday I had to pursue what interests me the most (and opiods and screen staring had very little appeal for me). The author also had a weird Frankfurt School philosophy point of view throughout the book. Harari is a historian and this book is not a philosophy book as much as it is a historical or sociological book. He does quote from Nietzsche frequently, but in some places this book read like ""Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom (he's of the Frankfurt School as is Leo Strauss and Saul Bellow). They just don't like Nietzsche's relativism no matter what and this book makes the absurd claim that Beethoven's music is superior to Chuck Berry's music. I'm going to end that dumb assertion by the author who claims data would prove him right by asserting a young man alive in 1958 and wanted to meet that pretty girl over there and they both are attuned with their time period and singing ""Johnny B Goode"" is a way for him to meet her. Would that not show for that young man that Chuck Berry's music is superior, regardless of a stupid computer algorithm. The author puts together a masterpiece by weaving various threads to tell about how he believes our world will become. We don't live in an atomized world (that's part of why he rejects item 1 of individualism). Each part that we know gets its understanding from the whole and belongs in the web of knowledge. That's why climate change deniers are as irrelevant as a creationist would be. Both have no concept of the nature of reality and want to atomize knowledge (each item in science fits in a spider like web (see Willard van Orman Quine for amplification) and interacts with all the pieces around it, climate deniers can’t deny all of science so they latch on to anomalies that have no relevance beyond themselves). Harari talks about how that kind of thought culminated with Descartes' 'cogito ergo sum' and a lot of this book shows how that kind of thinking is poison for progress."

“Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.”
I've picked up Homo Deus shortly after finishing Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thinking this book about future will be a kind of sequel. And it was, kind of. Still, I don't recommend reading them closely together. Homo Deus builds on the ideas and interpretations of history he detailed in Sapiens. Probably to make the two books stand-alones and not require the knowledge of the other book to understand this one, Harari repeats and rehashes a lot of the material. The text is not the same, but his points and ideas behind the text are. They are interesting and I like them, but for the first half of the book, I thought I would give it 3 stars because the repetition happened too soon for me. And then part II happened. Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.When Harari actually got to talking about the future, the different possibilities and their implications, my mind was blown again. I was thinking, crying, arguing, trembling under the blanket, and reading on. The book provoked all kinds of thought and feelings, it impacted me in a big way. Naturally, it goes to my 'favorites' shelf now.Kudos to Harari for once again showing he can write an entertaining and thought-provoking book of speculation. "
113,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32917354-rebecca-carter,4,"It is a sobering thought; more people die today from eating too much food than from eating too little. More people die from old age than from infectious diseases or plagues and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. For the first time in history humankind's three major problems that have remain unchanged from the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and to the Victorian British, have been famine, plague and war. This has now been transformed through breakthroughs in the fields of medicine, science, technology, politics and through enlightenment in consciousnesses in humans as to what is right and wrong. Of course there are plenty of cases where things still go amiss, but in comparison to how things used to be, humanity's major problems and issues for the future are going to be a new set of challenges. Maybe humankind will have to decide between economic growth or ecological stability? The same growth that has provided economic growth and abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials, also destabilises the planets ecological equilibrium. Pollution, climate change, global warming may all be having detrimental affects on the planet that humankind hasn't fully explored. The book is split up into three parts based on Harari's interpretation of history, his theory on how it led us to how humanity is in the present day, and his predictions on our future, each based on possibilities, hypothetical assumptions and philosophical speculations. Harari explains in some depth why and how we are a humanist society, which is important in understanding his beliefs as to where humanity is heading. His prediction is based on what humans will try to achieve in the twenty first century - not what it will succeed in achieving. He says that his forecast of the future may not be terribly original, however it is based on a liberal humanist approach of ideas and hopes that have dominated the world for 300 years. He argues that humanism sanctifies the life, emotions and desires of humans, so it isn't too difficult or far fetched to predict it will follow that humans will next want to significantly lengthen human lifespans, happiness and power. Take our current society based on humanism out of the equation, and humanity's future may indeed be very different, instead based on a future born of ideas and hopes of the twenty first century that we currently struggle to imagine or comprehend. The final third part of the book argues that attempting to realise this liberal humanist dream will eventually undermine its very foundations, by unleashing new post-humanist technologies and scientific discoveries. These discoveries could be the downfall of liberalism. If humans no longer control the running of the world, would the biggest threat be from biotechnology and artificial intelligence? What new religion would replace liberalism? Harari believes it would be techno religions in the form of the more conservative techno humanism and the more terrifying data religion. Techno humanism thinks that Homo sapiens, as we know it today, will not be relevant in the future but will still cling to many humanist values. It believes that we should therefore use technology to upgrade Homo sapiens into a far superior human model; homo deus. Dataism doesn't see humans as the pinnacle of creation - it worships data, not humans - and states that the universe consists of data flows, with the value of any entity or phenomenon determined by its contribution to data processing. The scary thing is that either of Hirari's proposed eventual hypothesis are possible, just as there are further scenarios that may lie in humankinds future, scenarios we as humans could not even begin to fathom due to our current limitations. If you enjoy having your personal beliefs and thoughts challenged, this book definitely fires up your electrochemical brain processes. Harari's views on history and how it shaped our world today, may open up new ways of looking at things to the reader. He dissects the past and takes us on a journey, so that we can see why humanity is a liberal humanist society today and what it could mean for our future. Harari also ponders the big questions of the meaning and the point of life. The debates and issues raised in the book are thought inspiring and certainly made me contemplate some new ideas. I can see this book being scoffed at by overly religious people, or people with closed mindsets, due to some of Harari's beliefs - such as the soul doesn't exist, the true self is imaginary, and that we fundamentally live pointless lives as data processing units. However, his arguments do make sense if you can think about it reasonably and logically. As Harari states, the scenarios in the book aren't prophesies, but possibilities. He attempts to explain how our present day conditioning came about in order to loosen its hold on our imagination and broaden our horizons. You don't have to agree with everything he writes, but it is an interesting debate and will definitely make you ponder and contemplate the many issues that humanity will ultimately face.Thanks very much to Random House UK Vintage Publishing, Yuval Noah Harari and Net Galley for a copy of this ARC in exchange for a review."

This should appeal to anyone who writes or reads as Harari´s thesis rests on the fact that we - homo sapiens - need to believe in things, be it money, flags, countries, companies, stories or even ourselves. Here, as well as showing how we got to where we are, he shows us how our reliance on technology, algorithms and being told what to do may prove to be our eventual undoing. What do we value more - consciousness or intelligence? Does consciousness really matter when intelligent machines - intelligent people - can do things better than us, more safely than us, and more perfectly? If you look at your phone instead of looking out of the window to see what the weather´s like, you might like to examine the gulf between our romantic views of our species and the cold reality."

Humanism (inluding democracy, human rights and the underlying notion of free will) is apparently yesterday's news, as humans are outdated algorithms that are being superseded by 'the internet of all things'. The author unreservedly advocates surrendering our privacy and autonomy to 'algorithms', as Google and Facebook already supposedly know us better than we know ourselves. Allowing Google to read our emails is a recurring example, although Google actually recently stopped doing just that. It is one of many signs Harari is oversimplifying history (for instance, idealizing capitalism and neoliberalism, which conveniently allows him to refrain from mentioning criticism of Google and Facebook who only harvest our data for the financial gain of themselves and their shareholders, instead of improving mankind; or his statement that all life forms are merely data processing systems and that all of science agrees with that view) and the current state of affairs, in order to present a narrowminded, dystopian view of the future of mankind that is likely to earn him many additional invitations to TED Talks and other well-paid speaking gigs. The last pages are puzzling: it's where Harari unexpectedly backtracks and states we are perhaps not just algorithms after all; it's where he states he really wanted to broaden our horizon instead of presenting an inescapable view of the future - although that is *exactly* what he has done. It reads as a hastily added disclaimer that is written as a defense to all the valid criticism I envisage proofreaders may have presented to him - which is more convenient than rewriting the entire book, but it does seem that that is exactly what he should have done. This the type of book that distinguishes shortcut-seeking 'thought leaders' from bona fide public intellectuals, and Harari, regrettably and unexpectedly, seems to want to set up shop in the former camp."

He essentially mocks liberal humanism for placing any value in people as such. He argues that the advance of technology will only make this more so. In a sense, this is an old argument. The second wave of the industrial revolution had this effect and life expectancy plummeted. I've read Homo Sapiens. A lot of repetition of it in this book, with a wordy expansion of the final chapter of Sapiens. Many of his ideas are already dated, such as the importance of Big Data. Maybe he needs to move from Tel Aviv to Silicon Valley so he won't be two or three years behind on his tech research.=====Meanwhile may I recommend this excellent new book on Artificial Intelligence.

Also, I felt the view was largely dystopian, was sometimes reminded of the world of the movie ""Matrix"". The last section was relevant but it seemed a mishmash of facts thrown to awe u alongwith some philosophy. Maybe, the pessimism got to me !Worth a read."
118,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,2,"What an enormously disappointing book.I enjoyed the first half of Harari's first book,Sapiens, and looked forward to this one. As a futurist I have to read books trying to scope out what's coming next. I also hoped his wry humor would reappear.Instead, I've been trying to choose a book rating between one and two stars.To begin with, the bulk of Homo Deus is not about the future of humanity. Instead it's a breezy tour of some aspects of human history and culture. The reason for that digression (more than one half the book!) is to ground two scenarios about the future, but it doesn't work well, and ultimately wastes a lot of time. The kernel of Homo Deus is just over one hundred pages (start with chapter 9).At best that tour is potted history, reminding us that liberal democracy appeared in the late 1700s, that industrialism changed civilization, that secularization is a thing, etc. It's akin to clicking through Wikipedia. At worst Harari offers his snap judgments on different developments, which are dubious. For example, he brutalizes Marxism in typical ways (it's a religion, it's really a form of therapy, etc). There's also a long digression about animal rights which turns out to play no meaningful role in the rest of the book. After the first 100 pages of this I stopped taking notes, because I would end up with my own book in response, and I'm busy starting a very different book.When Homo Deus finally gets around to addressing its purpose (subtitle: ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"") (and that part really is brief), the text is entirely drawn from current events and popular discussion. Readers can extract the highlights from any number of bloggers or articles. Automation's becoming big? Check. Biological sciences are advancing rapidly? Check. Data is increasingly important? Yup. The internet of things looms large? Uh huh.So what's useful in it?The author offers several visions of the future wherein human civilization experiences a major transformation. A key step is the decline of ""liberalism"" (a rough grab-bag for representative democracy, some kinds of individualism, some form of capitalism, a touch of pluralism) in the face of biology and technology. The life sciences and computation have shifted us towards a new notion of people driven by genetic forces and best apprehended through data. Side effects include some loss of privacy, a setting aside of democracy (maybe? this isn't developed, hilariously), and increasing class divides. Interestingly, Harari backs away from the singularity idea.Even more interesting, and, for me, more depressing, is the book's refusal to take inequality seriously. That is, Homo Deus is very interested in how technology and life sciences could expand socio-economic inequality, and how some cultural responses could happen, but isn't concerned with actual economics or politics. There's no sense of business being interested in keeping compensation low, of regulatory capture by the financial sector, or of why unionization might have declined. Similarly the book isn't concerned about national security states; it prefers to wonder about Facebook rather than the NSA.I admit to enjoying some instances of Harari's humor. I like his paralleling of gods, states, and businesses, for instance. It's not a new idea, but I'm always glad to see anarchist concepts in the mainstream. I appreciate his thorough skepticism about religions, too.Yet overall this is one of those books which becomes easier to bear the more quickly you read it. It *might* be a fun read for secondary school students who haven't been excited about history. Otherwise, skip the thing."

Sapiens
? Remember how it brilliantly explained all of human history? Well, now Yuval Noah Harari explains some of the possibilities for humanity's future.Picking up on his thesis of humans as storytellers, he looks at the main stories we've told: religion and humanism and how they may fare in an increasingly technological world. The old certainties are built on these old stories. Can liberalism and democracy survive in a world where the biological algorithms of our bodies bring free will into question? What is our role when data and AI become ubiquitous? Assuming no easy answers - nor any certainty about his own predictions - Harari again shows why he is the new Jared Diamond."

People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown.

Not only can we communicate, but we can also comminuticate about thing that exist only in our common imagination, such as corporations, google and god. Science does not make ethical judgements, it's not able to give meaning to life. The past few hundred years have seen a human sentered religion taking place of more traditional religions, humanism. Humanism puts the human liberty and free will first, and individualism. Gone is collectivism and here and now is how you feel about something. I never considered humanism another religion. I didn't really equate the bill of human rights with the ten commandments. Yet humanism and the internal conflicts within almost tore the world apart in the 20th century. However, individual liberty is not likely to continue. Human value is likely to be surpassed. The future of the world is an algorithm. The author intends to shock and he does. Whatever your belief system is, he is likely to shake you. It certainly shook mine, even though I also read and loved ""Sapiens: a brief history of humankind"".

When it comes to imagining what might come next, from singularities, man-machine hybrids, or the idea that AIs might consider us superfluous (an idea I am increasingly starting to agree with), there really isn't anything groundbreaking here.So why do I give it a four rather than a three or lower?It's entertaining, well-written, and while it doesn't scratch my itch to learn anything new, it is a fairly comprehensive backdrop of what might come next. Of course, we're dealing with future prediction here. Most of what we assume will never come about. :)Oh, well! At least it's consensual food-for-thought. Zeitgeist stuff.

It let's you know the important technical advances that could have huge implications to society: specifically technologies that could end liberalism, humanism, and capitalism.It's hard to imagine a current world without one of those things. But in the not-to-distant future, all three of them could be gone.Harari makes the case that technology has, objectively, made the world a better place over time. And we shouldn't worry that the coming technologies will turn that trend around. Objectively, Harari argues, the future will be better.But the big question is: would the future be better off without humans? Do humans really matter to the future? And if we don't, what becomes of us?Like Sapiens, Homo Deus is an incredibly enlightening read."
124,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24275344-nmalpas,1,"Read the intro, skip the rest.I was intrigued by the premise of this (especially given that I love sci-fi and this promised a nonfiction treatment of some classic sci-fi themes). The introduction does indeed present some some interesting lines of thought about what human beings have achieved as a species and how things might progress. But that early promise was sorely dissappointed.Harari is fine as long as he sticks to his actual area of expertise, namely, history. Though even his historical insights are rather superficial and he goes on and on about many simple points ad nauseum. The real problem is that large parts of the book stray from history not only into other social sciences and physical sciences but most ruinously of all into philosophy, of which Harari clearly has little understanding. He falls victim to countless conceptual conceptions, his arguments are full of holes, he overstates his confusions, and shows a shocking ignorance of existing discussions in philosophy mind, social ontology, ethics, etc. But this cluelessness does not prevent him from giving what he supposes to be definite answers on a slew of very difficult and controversial issues in philosophy (like the problem of other mind and the nature of morality).Overall, most of the book reads like an undergraduate philosophy assignment - a good one mind, but not something anyone should expect to gain much insight or pleasure from, nor even something you would expect to find in a lauded book form a major publisher. If you don't have much philosophical background, you might be able to read this without getting infuriated; you might even come away thinking it was profound. But your sense of wonder or enlightenment would be a sham: you will just have taken on a bunch of delusions and been habituated to shoddy argument and conceptual analysis. (less)"

I found it unputdownable - there’s just so much food for thought in its pages and I often find myself thinking back to it when I hear of advances in science and technology with which the author’s vision of the future begins to seem ever more plausible. He describes how human nature, indeed our very humanity, could be transformed in the not very distant future due to developments in bio-technology, bio-engineering, genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence combining to create a very different sort of human being. A complete step-change for humanity and the next stage of evolution. The dizzying speed of change in scientific progress makes prediction a risky process but it seems clear, even to the most sceptical, that our world is changing and we humans along with it.

I loved how Harari talks about liberalism, communism, democracy etc as religions of modern times. He then culminates with mentioning the religion of the near future: dataism. Overall, to be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise very much thought provoking. To be discussed over wine. I wish I would have read this paired with another friend.Although very interesting, too much of it is redundant if you've already read Sapiens. If you have to choose, read only one.

137,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16325176-jiachen-guo,1,"Another disappointment from Yuval Noah Harari. All the rave about this terrific and ambitious author compelled me to read both of his works, Sapiens and Homo Deus. Both have disappointed me. I am insanely interested in both this topics and hoped to gain a thorough understanding through these two books but instead I find myself bashing the author all the time because of the unsettling amount of logical fallacies and sweeping arguments he committed in the book.In my opinion, such a book should be founded upon solid science, has considered every possible theory and leaves little room for disagreement. However, I have to say that Yuval Noah Harari is a terrible scientist and should not be allowed write ambitious science books like these for he is not qualified. Though the book is heavy with content and backed with loads of research, most of the arguments Yuval makes are with weak foundations and not convincing enough. Most of the the time I feel like I am reading an essay written by a high schooler, who has the help of google and pieced carelessly selected facts from the internet together to attempt to fool an examiner that his stand is justifiable. An example- Yuval tries to justify his stand that more people die of eating too much than by natural disasters, plagues and war by saying 'In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald's than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.' How is this not something you would expect from a high schooler's essay? So Yuval conveniently selected four isolated events that in no way can represent 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague' and 'war' with convenient statistics that just so happened to 'justify' his argument, in hope that the reader be fooled by this flawed logic. It is equally easy to select four other individual subset events of 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague', 'war' and compare the statistics to 'prove' that Yuval is wrong. Such is the logic flaws that Yuval littered his book with and makes me wonder why have I bothered reading such a carelessly treated book."
138,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2870295-shaun-hutchinson,0,"I enjoyed listening to Yuval Harari discuss his book more than I enjoyed the book itself. There are some incredibly fascinating ideas here, and some well thought out predictions. Unfortunately, there are also some unsourced and easily contradicted assertions that undercut his arguments. Like that more Americans read digital books than physical. I simply can't find any source that supports that. Or using Microsoft's Cortana as the example of a personal digital assistant that's going to rule our lives. I mean, maybe, but Cortana over Alexa? It's little things like that that make me question Harari's handle on the tech side of things. Additionally, when discussing the science, especially the bioscience aspects, Harari offers few actual, concrete examples beyond what I could find listening to an NPR podcast. It's a fine book for a broad, general look at the potential future of biotech and machine learning, and a better look the historical context that put us here, but it feels a bit thin to me.One other thing I disliked was the manner in which Harari seemed to act as if taking psychiatric medications for therapeutic reasons was the same as taking them for a cognitive boost. A person who takes Adderall because they have ADD is taking them in order to bring themselves up to baseline functionality and isn't gaining an advantage over someone who does not have ADD and isn't taking Aderall. Suggesting otherwise is like suggesting a person with an amputated leg gains a significant advantage from using a prosthesis over someone who has both of their legs. It's a false equivalency that I see peddled far too often, and it's BS. Overall, an interesting book, but one read with a critical eye. "

141,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This is a remarkably good book. Our world is shaped by our logos, pathos, and mythos. That's just a fancy way of saying it's our reason, feelings, and beliefs that make us who we are. This book takes all three methods that we use to understand, adds some historical perspective and explains the human experience better than almost anyone and speculates where we as a society will be going in the relatively near future. Feelings are not facts, but we use our feelings to understand and process the sensuous world that we our thrown into, and we use what we think we know based on what our past beliefs were in order to understand the present. We are always in a strange loop that never quite converges because the past keeps receding and we are always anticipating the future. This book will cite a series of many neurological experiments (oh I feel for those poor rats) which show how we create narratives based on experiences and overweigh the most previous moment disproportionately from what logic dictates.Have you ever talked to people who are part of the cult of Trump? I have. They weigh each of the most previous moments’ experience that they've heard from Rush Limbaugh or Brietbart's news or Trump's 144 characters tweet disproportionately over previous data with an exponential decay set so high that history and perspective doesn't matter to them. They also would reject the principals within this book for one other big reason. They live in a universe without doubts by outsourcing their beliefs to a book or to a cult leader thus ascertaining certainty within their mythical constructions using their gut feelings as their standard for truth. Mythos dwellers never know it's a myth while they are living within the myth and will create alternative facts or whine 'fake news' when challenged. One cannot go from the abstract to the real without first creating a narrative which is depended on other narratives and which is further depended on even more stories we tell ourselves in order to fill in the thoughts between our thoughts (or what Heidegger called 'the ontological difference'). There is something very refreshing about an author who states 'Climate Change is real' as a fact. We live under a president whose mythos states in 144 characters or less that 'Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax'. I wish those kinds of people who base truth on their emotional based certainties would read a book like this one for edification. The Enlightenment spawned liberalism and firmed up humanism. The author will say that liberalism tends to 1) emphasize the individual, 2) enable the authentic self and 3) value experiences. The author uses his straw man version of liberalism (a version of Existentialism) and inverts all three of those points within his narrative and by citing relevant neurological experiments and concludes there is 1) no individual self (Harari has a lot of Hegelian thought, but never cites him), 2) there is no such thing as an authentic self, and 3) our values are skewed by our most recent experiences to the point for which we can’t always rely on them alone (never ignore your intellect!). The author argues against free will (hence there is no such thing as an authentic self) and thinks the concept of an immortal soul is contradictory and therefore not worth considering. Humanism is defined as worshiping humans, by him (overall he really doesn’t care for the Enlightenment). A somewhat loaded definition. He's arguing that our future world's values will be based on dataism. He predicts a future where reality unorganized has been converted to data which has been turned into information then knowledge and then finally wisdom. He definitely has a pessimistic bent to his future world view. He thinks people when the computers take over will be by and large left to staring at screens all day and forced to use opiods to deaden the boredom. Perhaps that's true. I know when I was liberated at an early age from working I took to bike riding 2 hours every day, stopped drinking beer, lost 75 pounds, started eating healthy, started reading books like this one, and became obsessed about learning about the universe and grateful for everyday I had to pursue what interests me the most (and opiods and screen staring had very little appeal for me). The author also had a weird Frankfurt School philosophy point of view throughout the book. Harari is a historian and this book is not a philosophy book as much as it is a historical or sociological book. He does quote from Nietzsche frequently, but in some places this book read like ""Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom (he's of the Frankfurt School as is Leo Strauss and Saul Bellow). They just don't like Nietzsche's relativism no matter what and this book makes the absurd claim that Beethoven's music is superior to Chuck Berry's music. I'm going to end that dumb assertion by the author who claims data would prove him right by asserting a young man alive in 1958 and wanted to meet that pretty girl over there and they both are attuned with their time period and singing ""Johnny B Goode"" is a way for him to meet her. Would that not show for that young man that Chuck Berry's music is superior, regardless of a stupid computer algorithm. The author puts together a masterpiece by weaving various threads to tell about how he believes our world will become. We don't live in an atomized world (that's part of why he rejects item 1 of individualism). Each part that we know gets its understanding from the whole and belongs in the web of knowledge. That's why climate change deniers are as irrelevant as a creationist would be. Both have no concept of the nature of reality and want to atomize knowledge (each item in science fits in a spider like web (see Willard van Orman Quine for amplification) and interacts with all the pieces around it, climate deniers can’t deny all of science so they latch on to anomalies that have no relevance beyond themselves). Harari talks about how that kind of thought culminated with Descartes' 'cogito ergo sum' and a lot of this book shows how that kind of thinking is poison for progress."

“Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.”
I've picked up Homo Deus shortly after finishing Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thinking this book about future will be a kind of sequel. And it was, kind of. Still, I don't recommend reading them closely together. Homo Deus builds on the ideas and interpretations of history he detailed in Sapiens. Probably to make the two books stand-alones and not require the knowledge of the other book to understand this one, Harari repeats and rehashes a lot of the material. The text is not the same, but his points and ideas behind the text are. They are interesting and I like them, but for the first half of the book, I thought I would give it 3 stars because the repetition happened too soon for me. And then part II happened. Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.When Harari actually got to talking about the future, the different possibilities and their implications, my mind was blown again. I was thinking, crying, arguing, trembling under the blanket, and reading on. The book provoked all kinds of thought and feelings, it impacted me in a big way. Naturally, it goes to my 'favorites' shelf now.Kudos to Harari for once again showing he can write an entertaining and thought-provoking book of speculation. "
143,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32917354-rebecca-carter,4,"It is a sobering thought; more people die today from eating too much food than from eating too little. More people die from old age than from infectious diseases or plagues and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. For the first time in history humankind's three major problems that have remain unchanged from the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and to the Victorian British, have been famine, plague and war. This has now been transformed through breakthroughs in the fields of medicine, science, technology, politics and through enlightenment in consciousnesses in humans as to what is right and wrong. Of course there are plenty of cases where things still go amiss, but in comparison to how things used to be, humanity's major problems and issues for the future are going to be a new set of challenges. Maybe humankind will have to decide between economic growth or ecological stability? The same growth that has provided economic growth and abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials, also destabilises the planets ecological equilibrium. Pollution, climate change, global warming may all be having detrimental affects on the planet that humankind hasn't fully explored. The book is split up into three parts based on Harari's interpretation of history, his theory on how it led us to how humanity is in the present day, and his predictions on our future, each based on possibilities, hypothetical assumptions and philosophical speculations. Harari explains in some depth why and how we are a humanist society, which is important in understanding his beliefs as to where humanity is heading. His prediction is based on what humans will try to achieve in the twenty first century - not what it will succeed in achieving. He says that his forecast of the future may not be terribly original, however it is based on a liberal humanist approach of ideas and hopes that have dominated the world for 300 years. He argues that humanism sanctifies the life, emotions and desires of humans, so it isn't too difficult or far fetched to predict it will follow that humans will next want to significantly lengthen human lifespans, happiness and power. Take our current society based on humanism out of the equation, and humanity's future may indeed be very different, instead based on a future born of ideas and hopes of the twenty first century that we currently struggle to imagine or comprehend. The final third part of the book argues that attempting to realise this liberal humanist dream will eventually undermine its very foundations, by unleashing new post-humanist technologies and scientific discoveries. These discoveries could be the downfall of liberalism. If humans no longer control the running of the world, would the biggest threat be from biotechnology and artificial intelligence? What new religion would replace liberalism? Harari believes it would be techno religions in the form of the more conservative techno humanism and the more terrifying data religion. Techno humanism thinks that Homo sapiens, as we know it today, will not be relevant in the future but will still cling to many humanist values. It believes that we should therefore use technology to upgrade Homo sapiens into a far superior human model; homo deus. Dataism doesn't see humans as the pinnacle of creation - it worships data, not humans - and states that the universe consists of data flows, with the value of any entity or phenomenon determined by its contribution to data processing. The scary thing is that either of Hirari's proposed eventual hypothesis are possible, just as there are further scenarios that may lie in humankinds future, scenarios we as humans could not even begin to fathom due to our current limitations. If you enjoy having your personal beliefs and thoughts challenged, this book definitely fires up your electrochemical brain processes. Harari's views on history and how it shaped our world today, may open up new ways of looking at things to the reader. He dissects the past and takes us on a journey, so that we can see why humanity is a liberal humanist society today and what it could mean for our future. Harari also ponders the big questions of the meaning and the point of life. The debates and issues raised in the book are thought inspiring and certainly made me contemplate some new ideas. I can see this book being scoffed at by overly religious people, or people with closed mindsets, due to some of Harari's beliefs - such as the soul doesn't exist, the true self is imaginary, and that we fundamentally live pointless lives as data processing units. However, his arguments do make sense if you can think about it reasonably and logically. As Harari states, the scenarios in the book aren't prophesies, but possibilities. He attempts to explain how our present day conditioning came about in order to loosen its hold on our imagination and broaden our horizons. You don't have to agree with everything he writes, but it is an interesting debate and will definitely make you ponder and contemplate the many issues that humanity will ultimately face.Thanks very much to Random House UK Vintage Publishing, Yuval Noah Harari and Net Galley for a copy of this ARC in exchange for a review."

This should appeal to anyone who writes or reads as Harari´s thesis rests on the fact that we - homo sapiens - need to believe in things, be it money, flags, countries, companies, stories or even ourselves. Here, as well as showing how we got to where we are, he shows us how our reliance on technology, algorithms and being told what to do may prove to be our eventual undoing. What do we value more - consciousness or intelligence? Does consciousness really matter when intelligent machines - intelligent people - can do things better than us, more safely than us, and more perfectly? If you look at your phone instead of looking out of the window to see what the weather´s like, you might like to examine the gulf between our romantic views of our species and the cold reality."

Humanism (inluding democracy, human rights and the underlying notion of free will) is apparently yesterday's news, as humans are outdated algorithms that are being superseded by 'the internet of all things'. The author unreservedly advocates surrendering our privacy and autonomy to 'algorithms', as Google and Facebook already supposedly know us better than we know ourselves. Allowing Google to read our emails is a recurring example, although Google actually recently stopped doing just that. It is one of many signs Harari is oversimplifying history (for instance, idealizing capitalism and neoliberalism, which conveniently allows him to refrain from mentioning criticism of Google and Facebook who only harvest our data for the financial gain of themselves and their shareholders, instead of improving mankind; or his statement that all life forms are merely data processing systems and that all of science agrees with that view) and the current state of affairs, in order to present a narrowminded, dystopian view of the future of mankind that is likely to earn him many additional invitations to TED Talks and other well-paid speaking gigs. The last pages are puzzling: it's where Harari unexpectedly backtracks and states we are perhaps not just algorithms after all; it's where he states he really wanted to broaden our horizon instead of presenting an inescapable view of the future - although that is *exactly* what he has done. It reads as a hastily added disclaimer that is written as a defense to all the valid criticism I envisage proofreaders may have presented to him - which is more convenient than rewriting the entire book, but it does seem that that is exactly what he should have done. This the type of book that distinguishes shortcut-seeking 'thought leaders' from bona fide public intellectuals, and Harari, regrettably and unexpectedly, seems to want to set up shop in the former camp."
146,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,3,"The author begins with the argument that individual human beings have no inherent value and that there is no such thing as individualism, that we are simply a collection of chemicals and neurons. He essentially mocks liberal humanism for placing any value in people as such. He argues that the advance of technology will only make this more so. In a sense, this is an old argument. The second wave of the industrial revolution had this effect and life expectancy plummeted. I've read Homo Sapiens. A lot of repetition of it in this book, with a wordy expansion of the final chapter of Sapiens. Many of his ideas are already dated, such as the importance of Big Data.

Also, I felt the view was largely dystopian, was sometimes reminded of the world of the movie ""Matrix"".

148,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,2,"What an enormously disappointing book.I enjoyed the first half of Harari's first book,Sapiens, and looked forward to this one. As a futurist I have to read books trying to scope out what's coming next. I also hoped his wry humor would reappear.Instead, I've been trying to choose a book rating between one and two stars.To begin with, the bulk of Homo Deus is not about the future of humanity. Instead it's a breezy tour of some aspects of human history and culture. The reason for that digression (more than one half the book!) is to ground two scenarios about the future, but it doesn't work well, and ultimately wastes a lot of time. The kernel of Homo Deus is just over one hundred pages (start with chapter 9).At best that tour is potted history, reminding us that liberal democracy appeared in the late 1700s, that industrialism changed civilization, that secularization is a thing, etc. It's akin to clicking through Wikipedia. At worst Harari offers his snap judgments on different developments, which are dubious. For example, he brutalizes Marxism in typical ways (it's a religion, it's really a form of therapy, etc). There's also a long digression about animal rights which turns out to play no meaningful role in the rest of the book. After the first 100 pages of this I stopped taking notes, because I would end up with my own book in response, and I'm busy starting a very different book.When Homo Deus finally gets around to addressing its purpose (subtitle: ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"") (and that part really is brief), the text is entirely drawn from current events and popular discussion. Readers can extract the highlights from any number of bloggers or articles. Automation's becoming big? Check. Biological sciences are advancing rapidly? Check. Data is increasingly important? Yup. The internet of things looms large? Uh huh.So what's useful in it?The author offers several visions of the future wherein human civilization experiences a major transformation. A key step is the decline of ""liberalism"" (a rough grab-bag for representative democracy, some kinds of individualism, some form of capitalism, a touch of pluralism) in the face of biology and technology. The life sciences and computation have shifted us towards a new notion of people driven by genetic forces and best apprehended through data. Side effects include some loss of privacy, a setting aside of democracy (maybe? this isn't developed, hilariously), and increasing class divides. Interestingly, Harari backs away from the singularity idea.Even more interesting, and, for me, more depressing, is the book's refusal to take inequality seriously. That is, Homo Deus is very interested in how technology and life sciences could expand socio-economic inequality, and how some cultural responses could happen, but isn't concerned with actual economics or politics. There's no sense of business being interested in keeping compensation low, of regulatory capture by the financial sector, or of why unionization might have declined. Similarly the book isn't concerned about national security states; it prefers to wonder about Facebook rather than the NSA.I admit to enjoying some instances of Harari's humor. I like his paralleling of gods, states, and businesses, for instance. It's not a new idea, but I'm always glad to see anarchist concepts in the mainstream. I appreciate his thorough skepticism about religions, too.Yet overall this is one of those books which becomes easier to bear the more quickly you read it. It *might* be a fun read for secondary school students who haven't been excited about history. Otherwise, skip the thing."

Sapiens
? Remember how it brilliantly explained all of human history? Well, now Yuval Noah Harari explains some of the possibilities for humanity's future.Picking up on his thesis of humans as storytellers, he looks at the main stories we've told: religion and humanism and how they may fare in an increasingly technological world. The old certainties are built on these old stories. Can liberalism and democracy survive in a world where the biological algorithms of our bodies bring free will into question? What is our role when data and AI become ubiquitous? Assuming no easy answers - nor any certainty about his own predictions - Harari again shows why he is the new Jared Diamond."

Not only can we communicate, but we can also comminuticate about thing that exist only in our common imagination, such as corporations, google and god. Science does not make ethical judgements, it's not able to give meaning to life. The past few hundred years have seen a human sentered religion taking place of more traditional religions, humanism. Humanism puts the human liberty and free will first, and individualism. Gone is collectivism and here and now is how you feel about something. I never considered humanism another religion. I didn't really equate the bill of human rights with the ten commandments. Yet humanism and the internal conflicts within almost tore the world apart in the 20th century. However, individual liberty is not likely to continue. Human value is likely to be surpassed. The future of the world is an algorithm. The author intends to shock and he does. Whatever your belief system is, he is likely to shake you. It certainly shook mine, even though I also read and loved ""Sapiens: a brief history of humankind"".

He does not leave any stone unturned, and discusses anything from the impact of A.I. in our lives to the future of religion.I was captivated by the book and look forward to reading his most recent title, 21 LESSONS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.

When it comes to imagining what might come next, from singularities, man-machine hybrids, or the idea that AIs might consider us superfluous (an idea I am increasingly starting to agree with), there really isn't anything groundbreaking here.So why do I give it a four rather than a three or lower?It's entertaining, well-written, and while it doesn't scratch my itch to learn anything new, it is a fairly comprehensive backdrop of what might come next. Of course, we're dealing with future prediction here. Most of what we assume will never come about. :)Oh, well! At least it's consensual food-for-thought. Zeitgeist stuff.

It let's you know the important technical advances that could have huge implications to society: specifically technologies that could end liberalism, humanism, and capitalism.It's hard to imagine a current world without one of those things. But in the not-to-distant future, all three of them could be gone.Harari makes the case that technology has, objectively, made the world a better place over time. And we shouldn't worry that the coming technologies will turn that trend around. Objectively, Harari argues, the future will be better.But the big question is: would the future be better off without humans? Do humans really matter to the future? And if we don't, what becomes of us?Like Sapiens, Homo Deus is an incredibly enlightening read."
154,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24275344-nmalpas,1,"Read the intro, skip the rest.I was intrigued by the premise of this (especially given that I love sci-fi and this promised a nonfiction treatment of some classic sci-fi themes). The introduction does indeed present some some interesting lines of thought about what human beings have achieved as a species and how things might progress. But that early promise was sorely dissappointed.Harari is fine as long as he sticks to his actual area of expertise, namely, history. Though even his historical insights are rather superficial and he goes on and on about many simple points ad nauseum. The real problem is that large parts of the book stray from history not only into other social sciences and physical sciences but most ruinously of all into philosophy, of which Harari clearly has little understanding. He falls victim to countless conceptual conceptions, his arguments are full of holes, he overstates his confusions, and shows a shocking ignorance of existing discussions in philosophy mind, social ontology, ethics, etc. But this cluelessness does not prevent him from giving what he supposes to be definite answers on a slew of very difficult and controversial issues in philosophy (like the problem of other mind and the nature of morality).Overall, most of the book reads like an undergraduate philosophy assignment - a good one mind, but not something anyone should expect to gain much insight or pleasure from, nor even something you would expect to find in a lauded book form a major publisher. If you don't have much philosophical background, you might be able to read this without getting infuriated; you might even come away thinking it was profound. But your sense of wonder or enlightenment would be a sham: you will just have taken on a bunch of delusions and been habituated to shoddy argument and conceptual analysis. (less)"

I found it unputdownable - there’s just so much food for thought in its pages and I often find myself thinking back to it when I hear of advances in science and technology with which the author’s vision of the future begins to seem ever more plausible. He describes how human nature, indeed our very humanity, could be transformed in the not very distant future due to developments in bio-technology, bio-engineering, genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence combining to create a very different sort of human being. A complete step-change for humanity and the next stage of evolution. The dizzying speed of change in scientific progress makes prediction a risky process but it seems clear, even to the most sceptical, that our world is changing and we humans along with it.

Overall, to be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise very much thought provoking. To be discussed over wine. I wish I would have read this paired with another friend.Although very interesting, too much of it is redundant if you've already read Sapiens. If you have to choose, read only one.

Google will actually remember every step we took and every hand we shook.""""In exchange for such devoted counselling services, we will just have to give up the idea that humans are individuals, and that each human has a free will determining what’s good, what’s beautiful and what is the meaning of life. Humans will no longer be autonomous entities directed by the stories their narrating self invents. Instead, they will be integral parts of a huge global network.""March 25, 2018 Parking here a quote from the author’s resent appearance in the NYT (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/wo...)“Trump wants to go back to the 1950s; Putin basically wants to go back to the Czarist Empire, and you have the Islamic State that wants to go back to seventh-century Arabia. Israel — they beat everybody. They want to go back 2,500 years to the age of the Bible, so we win. We have the longest-term vision backwards.”"

167,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16325176-jiachen-guo,1,"Another disappointment from Yuval Noah Harari. All the rave about this terrific and ambitious author compelled me to read both of his works, Sapiens and Homo Deus. Both have disappointed me. I am insanely interested in both this topics and hoped to gain a thorough understanding through these two books but instead I find myself bashing the author all the time because of the unsettling amount of logical fallacies and sweeping arguments he committed in the book.In my opinion, such a book should be founded upon solid science, has considered every possible theory and leaves little room for disagreement. However, I have to say that Yuval Noah Harari is a terrible scientist and should not be allowed write ambitious science books like these for he is not qualified. Though the book is heavy with content and backed with loads of research, most of the arguments Yuval makes are with weak foundations and not convincing enough. Most of the the time I feel like I am reading an essay written by a high schooler, who has the help of google and pieced carelessly selected facts from the internet together to attempt to fool an examiner that his stand is justifiable. An example- Yuval tries to justify his stand that more people die of eating too much than by natural disasters, plagues and war by saying 'In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald's than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.' How is this not something you would expect from a high schooler's essay? So Yuval conveniently selected four isolated events that in no way can represent 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague' and 'war' with convenient statistics that just so happened to 'justify' his argument, in hope that the reader be fooled by this flawed logic. It is equally easy to select four other individual subset events of 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague', 'war' and compare the statistics to 'prove' that Yuval is wrong. Such is the logic flaws that Yuval littered his book with and makes me wonder why have I bothered reading such a carelessly treated book."
168,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2870295-shaun-hutchinson,0,"I enjoyed listening to Yuval Harari discuss his book more than I enjoyed the book itself. There are some incredibly fascinating ideas here, and some well thought out predictions. Unfortunately, there are also some unsourced and easily contradicted assertions that undercut his arguments. Like that more Americans read digital books than physical. I simply can't find any source that supports that. Or using Microsoft's Cortana as the example of a personal digital assistant that's going to rule our lives. I mean, maybe, but Cortana over Alexa? It's little things like that that make me question Harari's handle on the tech side of things. Additionally, when discussing the science, especially the bioscience aspects, Harari offers few actual, concrete examples beyond what I could find listening to an NPR podcast. It's a fine book for a broad, general look at the potential future of biotech and machine learning, and a better look the historical context that put us here, but it feels a bit thin to me.One other thing I disliked was the manner in which Harari seemed to act as if taking psychiatric medications for therapeutic reasons was the same as taking them for a cognitive boost. A person who takes Adderall because they have ADD is taking them in order to bring themselves up to baseline functionality and isn't gaining an advantage over someone who does not have ADD and isn't taking Aderall. Suggesting otherwise is like suggesting a person with an amputated leg gains a significant advantage from using a prosthesis over someone who has both of their legs. It's a false equivalency that I see peddled far too often, and it's BS. Overall, an interesting book, but one read with a critical eye. "

171,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This is a remarkably good book. Our world is shaped by our logos, pathos, and mythos. That's just a fancy way of saying it's our reason, feelings, and beliefs that make us who we are. This book takes all three methods that we use to understand, adds some historical perspective and explains the human experience better than almost anyone and speculates where we as a society will be going in the relatively near future. Feelings are not facts, but we use our feelings to understand and process the sensuous world that we our thrown into, and we use what we think we know based on what our past beliefs were in order to understand the present. We are always in a strange loop that never quite converges because the past keeps receding and we are always anticipating the future. This book will cite a series of many neurological experiments (oh I feel for those poor rats) which show how we create narratives based on experiences and overweigh the most previous moment disproportionately from what logic dictates.Have you ever talked to people who are part of the cult of Trump? I have. They weigh each of the most previous moments’ experience that they've heard from Rush Limbaugh or Brietbart's news or Trump's 144 characters tweet disproportionately over previous data with an exponential decay set so high that history and perspective doesn't matter to them. They also would reject the principals within this book for one other big reason. They live in a universe without doubts by outsourcing their beliefs to a book or to a cult leader thus ascertaining certainty within their mythical constructions using their gut feelings as their standard for truth. Mythos dwellers never know it's a myth while they are living within the myth and will create alternative facts or whine 'fake news' when challenged. One cannot go from the abstract to the real without first creating a narrative which is depended on other narratives and which is further depended on even more stories we tell ourselves in order to fill in the thoughts between our thoughts (or what Heidegger called 'the ontological difference'). There is something very refreshing about an author who states 'Climate Change is real' as a fact. We live under a president whose mythos states in 144 characters or less that 'Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax'. I wish those kinds of people who base truth on their emotional based certainties would read a book like this one for edification. The Enlightenment spawned liberalism and firmed up humanism. The author will say that liberalism tends to 1) emphasize the individual, 2) enable the authentic self and 3) value experiences. The author uses his straw man version of liberalism (a version of Existentialism) and inverts all three of those points within his narrative and by citing relevant neurological experiments and concludes there is 1) no individual self (Harari has a lot of Hegelian thought, but never cites him), 2) there is no such thing as an authentic self, and 3) our values are skewed by our most recent experiences to the point for which we can’t always rely on them alone (never ignore your intellect!). The author argues against free will (hence there is no such thing as an authentic self) and thinks the concept of an immortal soul is contradictory and therefore not worth considering. Humanism is defined as worshiping humans, by him (overall he really doesn’t care for the Enlightenment). A somewhat loaded definition. He's arguing that our future world's values will be based on dataism. He predicts a future where reality unorganized has been converted to data which has been turned into information then knowledge and then finally wisdom. He definitely has a pessimistic bent to his future world view. He thinks people when the computers take over will be by and large left to staring at screens all day and forced to use opiods to deaden the boredom. Perhaps that's true. I know when I was liberated at an early age from working I took to bike riding 2 hours every day, stopped drinking beer, lost 75 pounds, started eating healthy, started reading books like this one, and became obsessed about learning about the universe and grateful for everyday I had to pursue what interests me the most (and opiods and screen staring had very little appeal for me). The author also had a weird Frankfurt School philosophy point of view throughout the book. Harari is a historian and this book is not a philosophy book as much as it is a historical or sociological book. He does quote from Nietzsche frequently, but in some places this book read like ""Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom (he's of the Frankfurt School as is Leo Strauss and Saul Bellow). They just don't like Nietzsche's relativism no matter what and this book makes the absurd claim that Beethoven's music is superior to Chuck Berry's music. I'm going to end that dumb assertion by the author who claims data would prove him right by asserting a young man alive in 1958 and wanted to meet that pretty girl over there and they both are attuned with their time period and singing ""Johnny B Goode"" is a way for him to meet her. Would that not show for that young man that Chuck Berry's music is superior, regardless of a stupid computer algorithm. The author puts together a masterpiece by weaving various threads to tell about how he believes our world will become. We don't live in an atomized world (that's part of why he rejects item 1 of individualism). Each part that we know gets its understanding from the whole and belongs in the web of knowledge. That's why climate change deniers are as irrelevant as a creationist would be. Both have no concept of the nature of reality and want to atomize knowledge (each item in science fits in a spider like web (see Willard van Orman Quine for amplification) and interacts with all the pieces around it, climate deniers can’t deny all of science so they latch on to anomalies that have no relevance beyond themselves). Harari talks about how that kind of thought culminated with Descartes' 'cogito ergo sum' and a lot of this book shows how that kind of thinking is poison for progress."

“Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.”
I've picked up Homo Deus shortly after finishing Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thinking this book about future will be a kind of sequel. And it was, kind of. Still, I don't recommend reading them closely together. Homo Deus builds on the ideas and interpretations of history he detailed in Sapiens. Probably to make the two books stand-alones and not require the knowledge of the other book to understand this one, Harari repeats and rehashes a lot of the material. The text is not the same, but his points and ideas behind the text are. They are interesting and I like them, but for the first half of the book, I thought I would give it 3 stars because the repetition happened too soon for me. And then part II happened. Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.When Harari actually got to talking about the future, the different possibilities and their implications, my mind was blown again. I was thinking, crying, arguing, trembling under the blanket, and reading on. The book provoked all kinds of thought and feelings, it impacted me in a big way. Naturally, it goes to my 'favorites' shelf now.Kudos to Harari for once again showing he can write an entertaining and thought-provoking book of speculation. "
173,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32917354-rebecca-carter,4,"It is a sobering thought; more people die today from eating too much food than from eating too little. More people die from old age than from infectious diseases or plagues and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. For the first time in history humankind's three major problems that have remain unchanged from the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and to the Victorian British, have been famine, plague and war. This has now been transformed through breakthroughs in the fields of medicine, science, technology, politics and through enlightenment in consciousnesses in humans as to what is right and wrong. Of course there are plenty of cases where things still go amiss, but in comparison to how things used to be, humanity's major problems and issues for the future are going to be a new set of challenges. Maybe humankind will have to decide between economic growth or ecological stability? The same growth that has provided economic growth and abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials, also destabilises the planets ecological equilibrium. Pollution, climate change, global warming may all be having detrimental affects on the planet that humankind hasn't fully explored. The book is split up into three parts based on Harari's interpretation of history, his theory on how it led us to how humanity is in the present day, and his predictions on our future, each based on possibilities, hypothetical assumptions and philosophical speculations. Harari explains in some depth why and how we are a humanist society, which is important in understanding his beliefs as to where humanity is heading. His prediction is based on what humans will try to achieve in the twenty first century - not what it will succeed in achieving. He says that his forecast of the future may not be terribly original, however it is based on a liberal humanist approach of ideas and hopes that have dominated the world for 300 years. He argues that humanism sanctifies the life, emotions and desires of humans, so it isn't too difficult or far fetched to predict it will follow that humans will next want to significantly lengthen human lifespans, happiness and power. Take our current society based on humanism out of the equation, and humanity's future may indeed be very different, instead based on a future born of ideas and hopes of the twenty first century that we currently struggle to imagine or comprehend. The final third part of the book argues that attempting to realise this liberal humanist dream will eventually undermine its very foundations, by unleashing new post-humanist technologies and scientific discoveries. These discoveries could be the downfall of liberalism. If humans no longer control the running of the world, would the biggest threat be from biotechnology and artificial intelligence? What new religion would replace liberalism? Harari believes it would be techno religions in the form of the more conservative techno humanism and the more terrifying data religion. Techno humanism thinks that Homo sapiens, as we know it today, will not be relevant in the future but will still cling to many humanist values. It believes that we should therefore use technology to upgrade Homo sapiens into a far superior human model; homo deus. Dataism doesn't see humans as the pinnacle of creation - it worships data, not humans - and states that the universe consists of data flows, with the value of any entity or phenomenon determined by its contribution to data processing. The scary thing is that either of Hirari's proposed eventual hypothesis are possible, just as there are further scenarios that may lie in humankinds future, scenarios we as humans could not even begin to fathom due to our current limitations. If you enjoy having your personal beliefs and thoughts challenged, this book definitely fires up your electrochemical brain processes. Harari's views on history and how it shaped our world today, may open up new ways of looking at things to the reader. He dissects the past and takes us on a journey, so that we can see why humanity is a liberal humanist society today and what it could mean for our future. Harari also ponders the big questions of the meaning and the point of life. The debates and issues raised in the book are thought inspiring and certainly made me contemplate some new ideas. I can see this book being scoffed at by overly religious people, or people with closed mindsets, due to some of Harari's beliefs - such as the soul doesn't exist, the true self is imaginary, and that we fundamentally live pointless lives as data processing units. However, his arguments do make sense if you can think about it reasonably and logically. As Harari states, the scenarios in the book aren't prophesies, but possibilities. He attempts to explain how our present day conditioning came about in order to loosen its hold on our imagination and broaden our horizons. You don't have to agree with everything he writes, but it is an interesting debate and will definitely make you ponder and contemplate the many issues that humanity will ultimately face.Thanks very much to Random House UK Vintage Publishing, Yuval Noah Harari and Net Galley for a copy of this ARC in exchange for a review."
174,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,4,"Excellent, scary and stimulating look at our species and history - and our future. This should appeal to anyone who writes or reads as Harari´s thesis rests on the fact that we - homo sapiens - need to believe in things, be it money, flags, countries, companies, stories or even ourselves. Here, as well as showing how we got to where we are, he shows us how our reliance on technology, algorithms and being told what to do may prove to be our eventual undoing. What do we value more - consciousness or intelligence? Does consciousness really matter when intelligent machines - intelligent people - can do things better than us, more safely than us, and more perfectly? If you look at your phone instead of looking out of the window to see what the weather´s like, you might like to examine the gulf between our romantic views of our species and the cold reality."

Humanism (inluding democracy, human rights and the underlying notion of free will) is apparently yesterday's news, as humans are outdated algorithms that are being superseded by 'the internet of all things'. The author unreservedly advocates surrendering our privacy and autonomy to 'algorithms', as Google and Facebook already supposedly know us better than we know ourselves. Allowing Google to read our emails is a recurring example, although Google actually recently stopped doing just that. It is one of many signs Harari is oversimplifying history (for instance, idealizing capitalism and neoliberalism, which conveniently allows him to refrain from mentioning criticism of Google and Facebook who only harvest our data for the financial gain of themselves and their shareholders, instead of improving mankind; or his statement that all life forms are merely data processing systems and that all of science agrees with that view) and the current state of affairs, in order to present a narrowminded, dystopian view of the future of mankind that is likely to earn him many additional invitations to TED Talks and other well-paid speaking gigs. The last pages are puzzling: it's where Harari unexpectedly backtracks and states we are perhaps not just algorithms after all; it's where he states he really wanted to broaden our horizon instead of presenting an inescapable view of the future - although that is *exactly* what he has done. It reads as a hastily added disclaimer that is written as a defense to all the valid criticism I envisage proofreaders may have presented to him - which is more convenient than rewriting the entire book, but it does seem that that is exactly what he should have done. This the type of book that distinguishes shortcut-seeking 'thought leaders' from bona fide public intellectuals, and Harari, regrettably and unexpectedly, seems to want to set up shop in the former camp."
176,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,3,"The author begins with the argument that individual human beings have no inherent value and that there is no such thing as individualism, that we are simply a collection of chemicals and neurons. He essentially mocks liberal humanism for placing any value in people as such. He argues that the advance of technology will only make this more so. In a sense, this is an old argument. The second wave of the industrial revolution had this effect and life expectancy plummeted. I've read Homo Sapiens. A lot of repetition of it in this book, with a wordy expansion of the final chapter of Sapiens. Many of his ideas are already dated, such as the importance of Big Data.

Also, I felt the view was largely dystopian, was sometimes reminded of the world of the movie ""Matrix"".

178,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,2,"What an enormously disappointing book.I enjoyed the first half of Harari's first book,Sapiens, and looked forward to this one. As a futurist I have to read books trying to scope out what's coming next. I also hoped his wry humor would reappear.Instead, I've been trying to choose a book rating between one and two stars.To begin with, the bulk of Homo Deus is not about the future of humanity. Instead it's a breezy tour of some aspects of human history and culture. The reason for that digression (more than one half the book!) is to ground two scenarios about the future, but it doesn't work well, and ultimately wastes a lot of time. The kernel of Homo Deus is just over one hundred pages (start with chapter 9).At best that tour is potted history, reminding us that liberal democracy appeared in the late 1700s, that industrialism changed civilization, that secularization is a thing, etc. It's akin to clicking through Wikipedia. At worst Harari offers his snap judgments on different developments, which are dubious. For example, he brutalizes Marxism in typical ways (it's a religion, it's really a form of therapy, etc). There's also a long digression about animal rights which turns out to play no meaningful role in the rest of the book. After the first 100 pages of this I stopped taking notes, because I would end up with my own book in response, and I'm busy starting a very different book.When Homo Deus finally gets around to addressing its purpose (subtitle: ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"") (and that part really is brief), the text is entirely drawn from current events and popular discussion. Readers can extract the highlights from any number of bloggers or articles. Automation's becoming big? Check. Biological sciences are advancing rapidly? Check. Data is increasingly important? Yup. The internet of things looms large? Uh huh.So what's useful in it?The author offers several visions of the future wherein human civilization experiences a major transformation. A key step is the decline of ""liberalism"" (a rough grab-bag for representative democracy, some kinds of individualism, some form of capitalism, a touch of pluralism) in the face of biology and technology. The life sciences and computation have shifted us towards a new notion of people driven by genetic forces and best apprehended through data. Side effects include some loss of privacy, a setting aside of democracy (maybe? this isn't developed, hilariously), and increasing class divides. Interestingly, Harari backs away from the singularity idea.Even more interesting, and, for me, more depressing, is the book's refusal to take inequality seriously. That is, Homo Deus is very interested in how technology and life sciences could expand socio-economic inequality, and how some cultural responses could happen, but isn't concerned with actual economics or politics. There's no sense of business being interested in keeping compensation low, of regulatory capture by the financial sector, or of why unionization might have declined. Similarly the book isn't concerned about national security states; it prefers to wonder about Facebook rather than the NSA.I admit to enjoying some instances of Harari's humor. I like his paralleling of gods, states, and businesses, for instance. It's not a new idea, but I'm always glad to see anarchist concepts in the mainstream. I appreciate his thorough skepticism about religions, too.Yet overall this is one of those books which becomes easier to bear the more quickly you read it. It *might* be a fun read for secondary school students who haven't been excited about history. Otherwise, skip the thing."

Sapiens
? Remember how it brilliantly explained all of human history? Well, now Yuval Noah Harari explains some of the possibilities for humanity's future.Picking up on his thesis of humans as storytellers, he looks at the main stories we've told: religion and humanism and how they may fare in an increasingly technological world. The old certainties are built on these old stories. Can liberalism and democracy survive in a world where the biological algorithms of our bodies bring free will into question? What is our role when data and AI become ubiquitous? Assuming no easy answers - nor any certainty about his own predictions - Harari again shows why he is the new Jared Diamond."

Not only can we communicate, but we can also comminuticate about thing that exist only in our common imagination, such as corporations, google and god. Science does not make ethical judgements, it's not able to give meaning to life. The past few hundred years have seen a human sentered religion taking place of more traditional religions, humanism. Humanism puts the human liberty and free will first, and individualism. Gone is collectivism and here and now is how you feel about something. I never considered humanism another religion. I didn't really equate the bill of human rights with the ten commandments. Yet humanism and the internal conflicts within almost tore the world apart in the 20th century. However, individual liberty is not likely to continue. Human value is likely to be surpassed. The future of the world is an algorithm. The author intends to shock and he does. Whatever your belief system is, he is likely to shake you. It certainly shook mine, even though I also read and loved ""Sapiens: a brief history of humankind"".

He does not leave any stone unturned, and discusses anything from the impact of A.I. in our lives to the future of religion.I was captivated by the book and look forward to reading his most recent title, 21 LESSONS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.

You're probably well versed in these ideas. Money, cultural realism, trust, and how we use technology or religion is al based on a fiction that we all accept. No problem. When it comes to imagining what might come next, from singularities, man-machine hybrids, or the idea that AIs might consider us superfluous (an idea I am increasingly starting to agree with), there really isn't anything groundbreaking here.So why do I give it a four rather than a three or lower?It's entertaining, well-written, and while it doesn't scratch my itch to learn anything new, it is a fairly comprehensive backdrop of what might come next. Of course, we're dealing with future prediction here. Most of what we assume will never come about. :)Oh, well! At least it's consensual food-for-thought. Zeitgeist stuff.

It let's you know the important technical advances that could have huge implications to society: specifically technologies that could end liberalism, humanism, and capitalism.It's hard to imagine a current world without one of those things. But in the not-to-distant future, all three of them could be gone.Harari makes the case that technology has, objectively, made the world a better place over time. And we shouldn't worry that the coming technologies will turn that trend around. Objectively, Harari argues, the future will be better.But the big question is: would the future be better off without humans? Do humans really matter to the future? And if we don't, what becomes of us?Like Sapiens, Homo Deus is an incredibly enlightening read."
184,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24275344-nmalpas,1,"Read the intro, skip the rest.I was intrigued by the premise of this (especially given that I love sci-fi and this promised a nonfiction treatment of some classic sci-fi themes). The introduction does indeed present some some interesting lines of thought about what human beings have achieved as a species and how things might progress. But that early promise was sorely dissappointed.Harari is fine as long as he sticks to his actual area of expertise, namely, history. Though even his historical insights are rather superficial and he goes on and on about many simple points ad nauseum. The real problem is that large parts of the book stray from history not only into other social sciences and physical sciences but most ruinously of all into philosophy, of which Harari clearly has little understanding. He falls victim to countless conceptual conceptions, his arguments are full of holes, he overstates his confusions, and shows a shocking ignorance of existing discussions in philosophy mind, social ontology, ethics, etc. But this cluelessness does not prevent him from giving what he supposes to be definite answers on a slew of very difficult and controversial issues in philosophy (like the problem of other mind and the nature of morality).Overall, most of the book reads like an undergraduate philosophy assignment - a good one mind, but not something anyone should expect to gain much insight or pleasure from, nor even something you would expect to find in a lauded book form a major publisher. If you don't have much philosophical background, you might be able to read this without getting infuriated; you might even come away thinking it was profound. But your sense of wonder or enlightenment would be a sham: you will just have taken on a bunch of delusions and been habituated to shoddy argument and conceptual analysis. (less)"

Instead of fearing asteroids, we should fear ourselves.For Homo sapiens has rewritten the rules of the game. This single ape species has managed within 70,000 years to change the global ecosystem in radical and unprecedented ways. Our impact is already on a par with that of ice ages and tectonic movements. Within a century, our impact may surpass that of the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.'Not as good as its predecessor Sapiens (which might be one of my favorite books of all time; definitely made a huge impact on me and changed my perspective on certain things), but still extremely good and interesting. I did feel like there was quite some repetition in this from Sapiens, but it didn’t disturb me too much.

I was getting worried while reading this chapter. Totally a disappointment because most contents have already appeared earlier in the last chapters of Sapiens. So, it felt like Harari is losing his charm and I was worried if he had written such an unnecessary lengthy book just to extend the last chapters of Sapiens!But I was wrong, though the first chapter was truly a disappointment, the following three parts were marvellous and amazing. Even I find it better than Sapiens :D (So, I readjusted my Sapiens rating down to 4 :p ). I could relate to its contents more --- philosophically, emotionally, and practically than the prehistoric stories of Sapiens [the only thing in Sapiens I could relate to --- is the story of capitalism]."

I found it unputdownable - there’s just so much food for thought in its pages and I often find myself thinking back to it when I hear of advances in science and technology with which the author’s vision of the future begins to seem ever more plausible. He describes how human nature, indeed our very humanity, could be transformed in the not very distant future due to developments in bio-technology, bio-engineering, genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence combining to create a very different sort of human being. A complete step-change for humanity and the next stage of evolution. The dizzying speed of change in scientific progress makes prediction a risky process but it seems clear, even to the most sceptical, that our world is changing and we humans along with it. Intelligent, insightful, accessible and eminently readable, this is a fascinating book which carries the reader along with its scope and vision. "
192,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,3,"A fascinating read, as Sapiens was. Unfortunately the book repeats a lot of the ideas mentioned there, at least in the first half. I loved how Harari talks about liberalism, communism, democracy etc as religions of modern times. He then culminates with mentioning the religion of the near future: dataism. Overall, to be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise very much thought provoking. To be discussed over wine. I wish I would have read this paired with another friend.Although very interesting, too much of it is redundant if you've already read Sapiens. If you have to choose, read only one. I enjoyed the other one more. This one is too speculative and it gave me anxiety. The structure of the book is also a bit on the wild side making it difficult to properly split the ideas here and there."

In this book the writer gets more philosophical and wants the reader to question themselves regarding their future. Do they want more freedom but less control over their lives or vice versa.

197,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16325176-jiachen-guo,1,"Another disappointment from Yuval Noah Harari. All the rave about this terrific and ambitious author compelled me to read both of his works, Sapiens and Homo Deus. Both have disappointed me. I am insanely interested in both this topics and hoped to gain a thorough understanding through these two books but instead I find myself bashing the author all the time because of the unsettling amount of logical fallacies and sweeping arguments he committed in the book.In my opinion, such a book should be founded upon solid science, has considered every possible theory and leaves little room for disagreement. However, I have to say that Yuval Noah Harari is a terrible scientist and should not be allowed write ambitious science books like these for he is not qualified. Though the book is heavy with content and backed with loads of research, most of the arguments Yuval makes are with weak foundations and not convincing enough. Most of the the time I feel like I am reading an essay written by a high schooler, who has the help of google and pieced carelessly selected facts from the internet together to attempt to fool an examiner that his stand is justifiable. An example- Yuval tries to justify his stand that more people die of eating too much than by natural disasters, plagues and war by saying 'In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald's than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.' How is this not something you would expect from a high schooler's essay? So Yuval conveniently selected four isolated events that in no way can represent 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague' and 'war' with convenient statistics that just so happened to 'justify' his argument, in hope that the reader be fooled by this flawed logic. It is equally easy to select four other individual subset events of 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague', 'war' and compare the statistics to 'prove' that Yuval is wrong. Such is the logic flaws that Yuval littered his book with and makes me wonder why have I bothered reading such a carelessly treated book."
198,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2870295-shaun-hutchinson,0,"I enjoyed listening to Yuval Harari discuss his book more than I enjoyed the book itself. There are some incredibly fascinating ideas here, and some well thought out predictions. Unfortunately, there are also some unsourced and easily contradicted assertions that undercut his arguments. Like that more Americans read digital books than physical. I simply can't find any source that supports that. Or using Microsoft's Cortana as the example of a personal digital assistant that's going to rule our lives. I mean, maybe, but Cortana over Alexa? It's little things like that that make me question Harari's handle on the tech side of things. Additionally, when discussing the science, especially the bioscience aspects, Harari offers few actual, concrete examples beyond what I could find listening to an NPR podcast. It's a fine book for a broad, general look at the potential future of biotech and machine learning, and a better look the historical context that put us here, but it feels a bit thin to me.One other thing I disliked was the manner in which Harari seemed to act as if taking psychiatric medications for therapeutic reasons was the same as taking them for a cognitive boost. A person who takes Adderall because they have ADD is taking them in order to bring themselves up to baseline functionality and isn't gaining an advantage over someone who does not have ADD and isn't taking Aderall. Suggesting otherwise is like suggesting a person with an amputated leg gains a significant advantage from using a prosthesis over someone who has both of their legs. It's a false equivalency that I see peddled far too often, and it's BS. Overall, an interesting book, but one read with a critical eye. "

201,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This is a remarkably good book. Our world is shaped by our logos, pathos, and mythos. That's just a fancy way of saying it's our reason, feelings, and beliefs that make us who we are. This book takes all three methods that we use to understand, adds some historical perspective and explains the human experience better than almost anyone and speculates where we as a society will be going in the relatively near future. Feelings are not facts, but we use our feelings to understand and process the sensuous world that we our thrown into, and we use what we think we know based on what our past beliefs were in order to understand the present. We are always in a strange loop that never quite converges because the past keeps receding and we are always anticipating the future. This book will cite a series of many neurological experiments (oh I feel for those poor rats) which show how we create narratives based on experiences and overweigh the most previous moment disproportionately from what logic dictates.Have you ever talked to people who are part of the cult of Trump? I have. They weigh each of the most previous moments’ experience that they've heard from Rush Limbaugh or Brietbart's news or Trump's 144 characters tweet disproportionately over previous data with an exponential decay set so high that history and perspective doesn't matter to them. They also would reject the principals within this book for one other big reason. They live in a universe without doubts by outsourcing their beliefs to a book or to a cult leader thus ascertaining certainty within their mythical constructions using their gut feelings as their standard for truth. Mythos dwellers never know it's a myth while they are living within the myth and will create alternative facts or whine 'fake news' when challenged. One cannot go from the abstract to the real without first creating a narrative which is depended on other narratives and which is further depended on even more stories we tell ourselves in order to fill in the thoughts between our thoughts (or what Heidegger called 'the ontological difference'). There is something very refreshing about an author who states 'Climate Change is real' as a fact. We live under a president whose mythos states in 144 characters or less that 'Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax'. I wish those kinds of people who base truth on their emotional based certainties would read a book like this one for edification. The Enlightenment spawned liberalism and firmed up humanism. The author will say that liberalism tends to 1) emphasize the individual, 2) enable the authentic self and 3) value experiences. The author uses his straw man version of liberalism (a version of Existentialism) and inverts all three of those points within his narrative and by citing relevant neurological experiments and concludes there is 1) no individual self (Harari has a lot of Hegelian thought, but never cites him), 2) there is no such thing as an authentic self, and 3) our values are skewed by our most recent experiences to the point for which we can’t always rely on them alone (never ignore your intellect!). The author argues against free will (hence there is no such thing as an authentic self) and thinks the concept of an immortal soul is contradictory and therefore not worth considering. Humanism is defined as worshiping humans, by him (overall he really doesn’t care for the Enlightenment). A somewhat loaded definition. He's arguing that our future world's values will be based on dataism. He predicts a future where reality unorganized has been converted to data which has been turned into information then knowledge and then finally wisdom. He definitely has a pessimistic bent to his future world view. He thinks people when the computers take over will be by and large left to staring at screens all day and forced to use opiods to deaden the boredom. Perhaps that's true. I know when I was liberated at an early age from working I took to bike riding 2 hours every day, stopped drinking beer, lost 75 pounds, started eating healthy, started reading books like this one, and became obsessed about learning about the universe and grateful for everyday I had to pursue what interests me the most (and opiods and screen staring had very little appeal for me). The author also had a weird Frankfurt School philosophy point of view throughout the book. Harari is a historian and this book is not a philosophy book as much as it is a historical or sociological book. He does quote from Nietzsche frequently, but in some places this book read like ""Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom (he's of the Frankfurt School as is Leo Strauss and Saul Bellow). They just don't like Nietzsche's relativism no matter what and this book makes the absurd claim that Beethoven's music is superior to Chuck Berry's music. I'm going to end that dumb assertion by the author who claims data would prove him right by asserting a young man alive in 1958 and wanted to meet that pretty girl over there and they both are attuned with their time period and singing ""Johnny B Goode"" is a way for him to meet her. Would that not show for that young man that Chuck Berry's music is superior, regardless of a stupid computer algorithm. The author puts together a masterpiece by weaving various threads to tell about how he believes our world will become. We don't live in an atomized world (that's part of why he rejects item 1 of individualism). Each part that we know gets its understanding from the whole and belongs in the web of knowledge. That's why climate change deniers are as irrelevant as a creationist would be. Both have no concept of the nature of reality and want to atomize knowledge (each item in science fits in a spider like web (see Willard van Orman Quine for amplification) and interacts with all the pieces around it, climate deniers can’t deny all of science so they latch on to anomalies that have no relevance beyond themselves). Harari talks about how that kind of thought culminated with Descartes' 'cogito ergo sum' and a lot of this book shows how that kind of thinking is poison for progress."

“Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.”
I've picked up Homo Deus shortly after finishing Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thinking this book about future will be a kind of sequel. And it was, kind of. Still, I don't recommend reading them closely together. Homo Deus builds on the ideas and interpretations of history he detailed in Sapiens. Probably to make the two books stand-alones and not require the knowledge of the other book to understand this one, Harari repeats and rehashes a lot of the material. The text is not the same, but his points and ideas behind the text are. They are interesting and I like them, but for the first half of the book, I thought I would give it 3 stars because the repetition happened too soon for me. And then part II happened. Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.When Harari actually got to talking about the future, the different possibilities and their implications, my mind was blown again. I was thinking, crying, arguing, trembling under the blanket, and reading on. The book provoked all kinds of thought and feelings, it impacted me in a big way. Naturally, it goes to my 'favorites' shelf now.Kudos to Harari for once again showing he can write an entertaining and thought-provoking book of speculation. "
203,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32917354-rebecca-carter,4,"It is a sobering thought; more people die today from eating too much food than from eating too little. More people die from old age than from infectious diseases or plagues and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. For the first time in history humankind's three major problems that have remain unchanged from the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and to the Victorian British, have been famine, plague and war. This has now been transformed through breakthroughs in the fields of medicine, science, technology, politics and through enlightenment in consciousnesses in humans as to what is right and wrong. Of course there are plenty of cases where things still go amiss, but in comparison to how things used to be, humanity's major problems and issues for the future are going to be a new set of challenges. Maybe humankind will have to decide between economic growth or ecological stability? The same growth that has provided economic growth and abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials, also destabilises the planets ecological equilibrium. Pollution, climate change, global warming may all be having detrimental affects on the planet that humankind hasn't fully explored. The book is split up into three parts based on Harari's interpretation of history, his theory on how it led us to how humanity is in the present day, and his predictions on our future, each based on possibilities, hypothetical assumptions and philosophical speculations. Harari explains in some depth why and how we are a humanist society, which is important in understanding his beliefs as to where humanity is heading. His prediction is based on what humans will try to achieve in the twenty first century - not what it will succeed in achieving. He says that his forecast of the future may not be terribly original, however it is based on a liberal humanist approach of ideas and hopes that have dominated the world for 300 years. He argues that humanism sanctifies the life, emotions and desires of humans, so it isn't too difficult or far fetched to predict it will follow that humans will next want to significantly lengthen human lifespans, happiness and power. Take our current society based on humanism out of the equation, and humanity's future may indeed be very different, instead based on a future born of ideas and hopes of the twenty first century that we currently struggle to imagine or comprehend. The final third part of the book argues that attempting to realise this liberal humanist dream will eventually undermine its very foundations, by unleashing new post-humanist technologies and scientific discoveries. These discoveries could be the downfall of liberalism. If humans no longer control the running of the world, would the biggest threat be from biotechnology and artificial intelligence? What new religion would replace liberalism? Harari believes it would be techno religions in the form of the more conservative techno humanism and the more terrifying data religion. Techno humanism thinks that Homo sapiens, as we know it today, will not be relevant in the future but will still cling to many humanist values. It believes that we should therefore use technology to upgrade Homo sapiens into a far superior human model; homo deus. Dataism doesn't see humans as the pinnacle of creation - it worships data, not humans - and states that the universe consists of data flows, with the value of any entity or phenomenon determined by its contribution to data processing. The scary thing is that either of Hirari's proposed eventual hypothesis are possible, just as there are further scenarios that may lie in humankinds future, scenarios we as humans could not even begin to fathom due to our current limitations. If you enjoy having your personal beliefs and thoughts challenged, this book definitely fires up your electrochemical brain processes. Harari's views on history and how it shaped our world today, may open up new ways of looking at things to the reader. He dissects the past and takes us on a journey, so that we can see why humanity is a liberal humanist society today and what it could mean for our future. Harari also ponders the big questions of the meaning and the point of life. The debates and issues raised in the book are thought inspiring and certainly made me contemplate some new ideas. I can see this book being scoffed at by overly religious people, or people with closed mindsets, due to some of Harari's beliefs - such as the soul doesn't exist, the true self is imaginary, and that we fundamentally live pointless lives as data processing units. However, his arguments do make sense if you can think about it reasonably and logically. As Harari states, the scenarios in the book aren't prophesies, but possibilities. He attempts to explain how our present day conditioning came about in order to loosen its hold on our imagination and broaden our horizons. You don't have to agree with everything he writes, but it is an interesting debate and will definitely make you ponder and contemplate the many issues that humanity will ultimately face.Thanks very much to Random House UK Vintage Publishing, Yuval Noah Harari and Net Galley for a copy of this ARC in exchange for a review."
204,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,4,"Excellent, scary and stimulating look at our species and history - and our future. This should appeal to anyone who writes or reads as Harari´s thesis rests on the fact that we - homo sapiens - need to believe in things, be it money, flags, countries, companies, stories or even ourselves. Here, as well as showing how we got to where we are, he shows us how our reliance on technology, algorithms and being told what to do may prove to be our eventual undoing. What do we value more - consciousness or intelligence? Does consciousness really matter when intelligent machines - intelligent people - can do things better than us, more safely than us, and more perfectly? If you look at your phone instead of looking out of the window to see what the weather´s like, you might like to examine the gulf between our romantic views of our species and the cold reality."

Humanism (inluding democracy, human rights and the underlying notion of free will) is apparently yesterday's news, as humans are outdated algorithms that are being superseded by 'the internet of all things'. The author unreservedly advocates surrendering our privacy and autonomy to 'algorithms', as Google and Facebook already supposedly know us better than we know ourselves. Allowing Google to read our emails is a recurring example, although Google actually recently stopped doing just that. It is one of many signs Harari is oversimplifying history (for instance, idealizing capitalism and neoliberalism, which conveniently allows him to refrain from mentioning criticism of Google and Facebook who only harvest our data for the financial gain of themselves and their shareholders, instead of improving mankind; or his statement that all life forms are merely data processing systems and that all of science agrees with that view) and the current state of affairs, in order to present a narrowminded, dystopian view of the future of mankind that is likely to earn him many additional invitations to TED Talks and other well-paid speaking gigs. The last pages are puzzling: it's where Harari unexpectedly backtracks and states we are perhaps not just algorithms after all; it's where he states he really wanted to broaden our horizon instead of presenting an inescapable view of the future - although that is *exactly* what he has done. It reads as a hastily added disclaimer that is written as a defense to all the valid criticism I envisage proofreaders may have presented to him - which is more convenient than rewriting the entire book, but it does seem that that is exactly what he should have done. This the type of book that distinguishes shortcut-seeking 'thought leaders' from bona fide public intellectuals, and Harari, regrettably and unexpectedly, seems to want to set up shop in the former camp."

He essentially mocks liberal humanism for placing any value in people as such. He argues that the advance of technology will only make this more so. In a sense, this is an old argument. The second wave of the industrial revolution had this effect and life expectancy plummeted. I've read Homo Sapiens. A lot of repetition of it in this book, with a wordy expansion of the final chapter of Sapiens. Many of his ideas are already dated, such as the importance of Big Data.

208,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,2,"What an enormously disappointing book.I enjoyed the first half of Harari's first book,Sapiens, and looked forward to this one. As a futurist I have to read books trying to scope out what's coming next. I also hoped his wry humor would reappear.Instead, I've been trying to choose a book rating between one and two stars.To begin with, the bulk of Homo Deus is not about the future of humanity. Instead it's a breezy tour of some aspects of human history and culture. The reason for that digression (more than one half the book!) is to ground two scenarios about the future, but it doesn't work well, and ultimately wastes a lot of time. The kernel of Homo Deus is just over one hundred pages (start with chapter 9).At best that tour is potted history, reminding us that liberal democracy appeared in the late 1700s, that industrialism changed civilization, that secularization is a thing, etc. It's akin to clicking through Wikipedia. At worst Harari offers his snap judgments on different developments, which are dubious. For example, he brutalizes Marxism in typical ways (it's a religion, it's really a form of therapy, etc). There's also a long digression about animal rights which turns out to play no meaningful role in the rest of the book. After the first 100 pages of this I stopped taking notes, because I would end up with my own book in response, and I'm busy starting a very different book.When Homo Deus finally gets around to addressing its purpose (subtitle: ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"") (and that part really is brief), the text is entirely drawn from current events and popular discussion. Readers can extract the highlights from any number of bloggers or articles. Automation's becoming big? Check. Biological sciences are advancing rapidly? Check. Data is increasingly important? Yup. The internet of things looms large? Uh huh.So what's useful in it?The author offers several visions of the future wherein human civilization experiences a major transformation. A key step is the decline of ""liberalism"" (a rough grab-bag for representative democracy, some kinds of individualism, some form of capitalism, a touch of pluralism) in the face of biology and technology. The life sciences and computation have shifted us towards a new notion of people driven by genetic forces and best apprehended through data. Side effects include some loss of privacy, a setting aside of democracy (maybe? this isn't developed, hilariously), and increasing class divides. Interestingly, Harari backs away from the singularity idea.Even more interesting, and, for me, more depressing, is the book's refusal to take inequality seriously. That is, Homo Deus is very interested in how technology and life sciences could expand socio-economic inequality, and how some cultural responses could happen, but isn't concerned with actual economics or politics. There's no sense of business being interested in keeping compensation low, of regulatory capture by the financial sector, or of why unionization might have declined. Similarly the book isn't concerned about national security states; it prefers to wonder about Facebook rather than the NSA.I admit to enjoying some instances of Harari's humor. I like his paralleling of gods, states, and businesses, for instance. It's not a new idea, but I'm always glad to see anarchist concepts in the mainstream. I appreciate his thorough skepticism about religions, too.Yet overall this is one of those books which becomes easier to bear the more quickly you read it. It *might* be a fun read for secondary school students who haven't been excited about history. Otherwise, skip the thing."

Sapiens
? Remember how it brilliantly explained all of human history? Well, now Yuval Noah Harari explains some of the possibilities for humanity's future.Picking up on his thesis of humans as storytellers, he looks at the main stories we've told: religion and humanism and how they may fare in an increasingly technological world. The old certainties are built on these old stories. Can liberalism and democracy survive in a world where the biological algorithms of our bodies bring free will into question? What is our role when data and AI become ubiquitous? Assuming no easy answers - nor any certainty about his own predictions - Harari again shows why he is the new Jared Diamond."

People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.""Knowing where we are is a prerequisite for having any idea of where we are going. Common fantasies is what put humans on top. Not only can we communicate, but we can also comminuticate about thing that exist only in our common imagination, such as corporations, google and god. Science does not make ethical judgements, it's not able to give meaning to life. The past few hundred years have seen a human sentered religion taking place of more traditional religions, humanism. Humanism puts the human liberty and free will first, and individualism. Gone is collectivism and here and now is how you feel about something. I never considered humanism another religion. I didn't really equate the bill of human rights with the ten commandments. Yet humanism and the internal conflicts within almost tore the world apart in the 20th century. However, individual liberty is not likely to continue. Human value is likely to be surpassed. The future of the world is an algorithm. The author intends to shock and he does. Whatever your belief system is, he is likely to shake you. It certainly shook mine, even though I also read and loved ""Sapiens: a brief history of humankind"". I know now that, as I suspected, I will have been left behind within my lifetime. "

He does not leave any stone unturned, and discusses anything from the impact of A.I. in our lives to the future of religion.I was captivated by the book and look forward to reading his most recent title, 21 LESSONS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.

When it comes to imagining what might come next, from singularities, man-machine hybrids, or the idea that AIs might consider us superfluous (an idea I am increasingly starting to agree with), there really isn't anything groundbreaking here.So why do I give it a four rather than a three or lower?It's entertaining, well-written, and while it doesn't scratch my itch to learn anything new, it is a fairly comprehensive backdrop of what might come next. Of course, we're dealing with future prediction here. Most of what we assume will never come about. :)Oh, well! At least it's consensual food-for-thought. Zeitgeist stuff.

It let's you know the important technical advances that could have huge implications to society: specifically technologies that could end liberalism, humanism, and capitalism.It's hard to imagine a current world without one of those things. But in the not-to-distant future, all three of them could be gone.Harari makes the case that technology has, objectively, made the world a better place over time. And we shouldn't worry that the coming technologies will turn that trend around. Objectively, Harari argues, the future will be better.But the big question is: would the future be better off without humans? Do humans really matter to the future? And if we don't, what becomes of us?Like Sapiens, Homo Deus is an incredibly enlightening read."
214,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24275344-nmalpas,1,"Read the intro, skip the rest.I was intrigued by the premise of this (especially given that I love sci-fi and this promised a nonfiction treatment of some classic sci-fi themes). The introduction does indeed present some some interesting lines of thought about what human beings have achieved as a species and how things might progress. But that early promise was sorely dissappointed.Harari is fine as long as he sticks to his actual area of expertise, namely, history. Though even his historical insights are rather superficial and he goes on and on about many simple points ad nauseum. The real problem is that large parts of the book stray from history not only into other social sciences and physical sciences but most ruinously of all into philosophy, of which Harari clearly has little understanding. He falls victim to countless conceptual conceptions, his arguments are full of holes, he overstates his confusions, and shows a shocking ignorance of existing discussions in philosophy mind, social ontology, ethics, etc. But this cluelessness does not prevent him from giving what he supposes to be definite answers on a slew of very difficult and controversial issues in philosophy (like the problem of other mind and the nature of morality).Overall, most of the book reads like an undergraduate philosophy assignment - a good one mind, but not something anyone should expect to gain much insight or pleasure from, nor even something you would expect to find in a lauded book form a major publisher. If you don't have much philosophical background, you might be able to read this without getting infuriated; you might even come away thinking it was profound. But your sense of wonder or enlightenment would be a sham: you will just have taken on a bunch of delusions and been habituated to shoddy argument and conceptual analysis. (less)"

Even I find it better than Sapiens :D (So, I readjusted my Sapiens rating down to 4 :p ).

I found it unputdownable - there’s just so much food for thought in its pages and I often find myself thinking back to it when I hear of advances in science and technology with which the author’s vision of the future begins to seem ever more plausible. He describes how human nature, indeed our very humanity, could be transformed in the not very distant future due to developments in bio-technology, bio-engineering, genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence combining to create a very different sort of human being. A complete step-change for humanity and the next stage of evolution. The dizzying speed of change in scientific progress makes prediction a risky process but it seems clear, even to the most sceptical, that our world is changing and we humans along with it. Intelligent, insightful, accessible and eminently readable, this is a fascinating book which carries the reader along with its scope and vision. "

I loved how Harari talks about liberalism, communism, democracy etc as religions of modern times. He then culminates with mentioning the religion of the near future: dataism. Overall, to be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise very much thought provoking. To be discussed over wine. I wish I would have read this paired with another friend.Although very interesting, too much of it is redundant if you've already read Sapiens. If you have to choose, read only one. I enjoyed the other one more. This one is too speculative and it gave me anxiety. The structure of the book is also a bit on the wild side making it difficult to properly split the ideas here and there."

227,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16325176-jiachen-guo,1,"Another disappointment from Yuval Noah Harari. All the rave about this terrific and ambitious author compelled me to read both of his works, Sapiens and Homo Deus. Both have disappointed me. I am insanely interested in both this topics and hoped to gain a thorough understanding through these two books but instead I find myself bashing the author all the time because of the unsettling amount of logical fallacies and sweeping arguments he committed in the book.In my opinion, such a book should be founded upon solid science, has considered every possible theory and leaves little room for disagreement. However, I have to say that Yuval Noah Harari is a terrible scientist and should not be allowed write ambitious science books like these for he is not qualified. Though the book is heavy with content and backed with loads of research, most of the arguments Yuval makes are with weak foundations and not convincing enough. Most of the the time I feel like I am reading an essay written by a high schooler, who has the help of google and pieced carelessly selected facts from the internet together to attempt to fool an examiner that his stand is justifiable. An example- Yuval tries to justify his stand that more people die of eating too much than by natural disasters, plagues and war by saying 'In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald's than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.' How is this not something you would expect from a high schooler's essay? So Yuval conveniently selected four isolated events that in no way can represent 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague' and 'war' with convenient statistics that just so happened to 'justify' his argument, in hope that the reader be fooled by this flawed logic. It is equally easy to select four other individual subset events of 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague', 'war' and compare the statistics to 'prove' that Yuval is wrong. Such is the logic flaws that Yuval littered his book with and makes me wonder why have I bothered reading such a carelessly treated book."
228,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2870295-shaun-hutchinson,0,"I enjoyed listening to Yuval Harari discuss his book more than I enjoyed the book itself. There are some incredibly fascinating ideas here, and some well thought out predictions. Unfortunately, there are also some unsourced and easily contradicted assertions that undercut his arguments. Like that more Americans read digital books than physical. I simply can't find any source that supports that. Or using Microsoft's Cortana as the example of a personal digital assistant that's going to rule our lives. I mean, maybe, but Cortana over Alexa? It's little things like that that make me question Harari's handle on the tech side of things. Additionally, when discussing the science, especially the bioscience aspects, Harari offers few actual, concrete examples beyond what I could find listening to an NPR podcast. It's a fine book for a broad, general look at the potential future of biotech and machine learning, and a better look the historical context that put us here, but it feels a bit thin to me.One other thing I disliked was the manner in which Harari seemed to act as if taking psychiatric medications for therapeutic reasons was the same as taking them for a cognitive boost. A person who takes Adderall because they have ADD is taking them in order to bring themselves up to baseline functionality and isn't gaining an advantage over someone who does not have ADD and isn't taking Aderall. Suggesting otherwise is like suggesting a person with an amputated leg gains a significant advantage from using a prosthesis over someone who has both of their legs. It's a false equivalency that I see peddled far too often, and it's BS. Overall, an interesting book, but one read with a critical eye. "

231,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This is a remarkably good book. Our world is shaped by our logos, pathos, and mythos. That's just a fancy way of saying it's our reason, feelings, and beliefs that make us who we are. This book takes all three methods that we use to understand, adds some historical perspective and explains the human experience better than almost anyone and speculates where we as a society will be going in the relatively near future. Feelings are not facts, but we use our feelings to understand and process the sensuous world that we our thrown into, and we use what we think we know based on what our past beliefs were in order to understand the present. We are always in a strange loop that never quite converges because the past keeps receding and we are always anticipating the future. This book will cite a series of many neurological experiments (oh I feel for those poor rats) which show how we create narratives based on experiences and overweigh the most previous moment disproportionately from what logic dictates.Have you ever talked to people who are part of the cult of Trump? I have. They weigh each of the most previous moments’ experience that they've heard from Rush Limbaugh or Brietbart's news or Trump's 144 characters tweet disproportionately over previous data with an exponential decay set so high that history and perspective doesn't matter to them. They also would reject the principals within this book for one other big reason. They live in a universe without doubts by outsourcing their beliefs to a book or to a cult leader thus ascertaining certainty within their mythical constructions using their gut feelings as their standard for truth. Mythos dwellers never know it's a myth while they are living within the myth and will create alternative facts or whine 'fake news' when challenged. One cannot go from the abstract to the real without first creating a narrative which is depended on other narratives and which is further depended on even more stories we tell ourselves in order to fill in the thoughts between our thoughts (or what Heidegger called 'the ontological difference'). There is something very refreshing about an author who states 'Climate Change is real' as a fact. We live under a president whose mythos states in 144 characters or less that 'Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax'. I wish those kinds of people who base truth on their emotional based certainties would read a book like this one for edification. The Enlightenment spawned liberalism and firmed up humanism. The author will say that liberalism tends to 1) emphasize the individual, 2) enable the authentic self and 3) value experiences. The author uses his straw man version of liberalism (a version of Existentialism) and inverts all three of those points within his narrative and by citing relevant neurological experiments and concludes there is 1) no individual self (Harari has a lot of Hegelian thought, but never cites him), 2) there is no such thing as an authentic self, and 3) our values are skewed by our most recent experiences to the point for which we can’t always rely on them alone (never ignore your intellect!). The author argues against free will (hence there is no such thing as an authentic self) and thinks the concept of an immortal soul is contradictory and therefore not worth considering. Humanism is defined as worshiping humans, by him (overall he really doesn’t care for the Enlightenment). A somewhat loaded definition. He's arguing that our future world's values will be based on dataism. He predicts a future where reality unorganized has been converted to data which has been turned into information then knowledge and then finally wisdom. He definitely has a pessimistic bent to his future world view. He thinks people when the computers take over will be by and large left to staring at screens all day and forced to use opiods to deaden the boredom. Perhaps that's true. I know when I was liberated at an early age from working I took to bike riding 2 hours every day, stopped drinking beer, lost 75 pounds, started eating healthy, started reading books like this one, and became obsessed about learning about the universe and grateful for everyday I had to pursue what interests me the most (and opiods and screen staring had very little appeal for me). The author also had a weird Frankfurt School philosophy point of view throughout the book. Harari is a historian and this book is not a philosophy book as much as it is a historical or sociological book. He does quote from Nietzsche frequently, but in some places this book read like ""Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom (he's of the Frankfurt School as is Leo Strauss and Saul Bellow). They just don't like Nietzsche's relativism no matter what and this book makes the absurd claim that Beethoven's music is superior to Chuck Berry's music. I'm going to end that dumb assertion by the author who claims data would prove him right by asserting a young man alive in 1958 and wanted to meet that pretty girl over there and they both are attuned with their time period and singing ""Johnny B Goode"" is a way for him to meet her. Would that not show for that young man that Chuck Berry's music is superior, regardless of a stupid computer algorithm. The author puts together a masterpiece by weaving various threads to tell about how he believes our world will become. We don't live in an atomized world (that's part of why he rejects item 1 of individualism). Each part that we know gets its understanding from the whole and belongs in the web of knowledge. That's why climate change deniers are as irrelevant as a creationist would be. Both have no concept of the nature of reality and want to atomize knowledge (each item in science fits in a spider like web (see Willard van Orman Quine for amplification) and interacts with all the pieces around it, climate deniers can’t deny all of science so they latch on to anomalies that have no relevance beyond themselves). Harari talks about how that kind of thought culminated with Descartes' 'cogito ergo sum' and a lot of this book shows how that kind of thinking is poison for progress."

“Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.”
I've picked up Homo Deus shortly after finishing Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thinking this book about future will be a kind of sequel. And it was, kind of. Still, I don't recommend reading them closely together. Homo Deus builds on the ideas and interpretations of history he detailed in Sapiens. Probably to make the two books stand-alones and not require the knowledge of the other book to understand this one, Harari repeats and rehashes a lot of the material. The text is not the same, but his points and ideas behind the text are. They are interesting and I like them, but for the first half of the book, I thought I would give it 3 stars because the repetition happened too soon for me. And then part II happened. Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.When Harari actually got to talking about the future, the different possibilities and their implications, my mind was blown again. I was thinking, crying, arguing, trembling under the blanket, and reading on. The book provoked all kinds of thought and feelings, it impacted me in a big way. Naturally, it goes to my 'favorites' shelf now.Kudos to Harari for once again showing he can write an entertaining and thought-provoking book of speculation. "
233,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32917354-rebecca-carter,4,"It is a sobering thought; more people die today from eating too much food than from eating too little. More people die from old age than from infectious diseases or plagues and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. For the first time in history humankind's three major problems that have remain unchanged from the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and to the Victorian British, have been famine, plague and war. This has now been transformed through breakthroughs in the fields of medicine, science, technology, politics and through enlightenment in consciousnesses in humans as to what is right and wrong. Of course there are plenty of cases where things still go amiss, but in comparison to how things used to be, humanity's major problems and issues for the future are going to be a new set of challenges. Maybe humankind will have to decide between economic growth or ecological stability? The same growth that has provided economic growth and abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials, also destabilises the planets ecological equilibrium. Pollution, climate change, global warming may all be having detrimental affects on the planet that humankind hasn't fully explored. The book is split up into three parts based on Harari's interpretation of history, his theory on how it led us to how humanity is in the present day, and his predictions on our future, each based on possibilities, hypothetical assumptions and philosophical speculations. Harari explains in some depth why and how we are a humanist society, which is important in understanding his beliefs as to where humanity is heading. His prediction is based on what humans will try to achieve in the twenty first century - not what it will succeed in achieving. He says that his forecast of the future may not be terribly original, however it is based on a liberal humanist approach of ideas and hopes that have dominated the world for 300 years. He argues that humanism sanctifies the life, emotions and desires of humans, so it isn't too difficult or far fetched to predict it will follow that humans will next want to significantly lengthen human lifespans, happiness and power. Take our current society based on humanism out of the equation, and humanity's future may indeed be very different, instead based on a future born of ideas and hopes of the twenty first century that we currently struggle to imagine or comprehend. The final third part of the book argues that attempting to realise this liberal humanist dream will eventually undermine its very foundations, by unleashing new post-humanist technologies and scientific discoveries. These discoveries could be the downfall of liberalism. If humans no longer control the running of the world, would the biggest threat be from biotechnology and artificial intelligence? What new religion would replace liberalism? Harari believes it would be techno religions in the form of the more conservative techno humanism and the more terrifying data religion. Techno humanism thinks that Homo sapiens, as we know it today, will not be relevant in the future but will still cling to many humanist values. It believes that we should therefore use technology to upgrade Homo sapiens into a far superior human model; homo deus. Dataism doesn't see humans as the pinnacle of creation - it worships data, not humans - and states that the universe consists of data flows, with the value of any entity or phenomenon determined by its contribution to data processing. The scary thing is that either of Hirari's proposed eventual hypothesis are possible, just as there are further scenarios that may lie in humankinds future, scenarios we as humans could not even begin to fathom due to our current limitations. If you enjoy having your personal beliefs and thoughts challenged, this book definitely fires up your electrochemical brain processes. Harari's views on history and how it shaped our world today, may open up new ways of looking at things to the reader. He dissects the past and takes us on a journey, so that we can see why humanity is a liberal humanist society today and what it could mean for our future. Harari also ponders the big questions of the meaning and the point of life. The debates and issues raised in the book are thought inspiring and certainly made me contemplate some new ideas. I can see this book being scoffed at by overly religious people, or people with closed mindsets, due to some of Harari's beliefs - such as the soul doesn't exist, the true self is imaginary, and that we fundamentally live pointless lives as data processing units. However, his arguments do make sense if you can think about it reasonably and logically. As Harari states, the scenarios in the book aren't prophesies, but possibilities. He attempts to explain how our present day conditioning came about in order to loosen its hold on our imagination and broaden our horizons. You don't have to agree with everything he writes, but it is an interesting debate and will definitely make you ponder and contemplate the many issues that humanity will ultimately face.Thanks very much to Random House UK Vintage Publishing, Yuval Noah Harari and Net Galley for a copy of this ARC in exchange for a review."

This should appeal to anyone who writes or reads as Harari´s thesis rests on the fact that we - homo sapiens - need to believe in things, be it money, flags, countries, companies, stories or even ourselves. Here, as well as showing how we got to where we are, he shows us how our reliance on technology, algorithms and being told what to do may prove to be our eventual undoing. What do we value more - consciousness or intelligence? Does consciousness really matter when intelligent machines - intelligent people - can do things better than us, more safely than us, and more perfectly? If you look at your phone instead of looking out of the window to see what the weather´s like, you might like to examine the gulf between our romantic views of our species and the cold reality."

Humanism (inluding democracy, human rights and the underlying notion of free will) is apparently yesterday's news, as humans are outdated algorithms that are being superseded by 'the internet of all things'. The author unreservedly advocates surrendering our privacy and autonomy to 'algorithms', as Google and Facebook already supposedly know us better than we know ourselves. Allowing Google to read our emails is a recurring example, although Google actually recently stopped doing just that. It is one of many signs Harari is oversimplifying history (for instance, idealizing capitalism and neoliberalism, which conveniently allows him to refrain from mentioning criticism of Google and Facebook who only harvest our data for the financial gain of themselves and their shareholders, instead of improving mankind; or his statement that all life forms are merely data processing systems and that all of science agrees with that view) and the current state of affairs, in order to present a narrowminded, dystopian view of the future of mankind that is likely to earn him many additional invitations to TED Talks and other well-paid speaking gigs. The last pages are puzzling: it's where Harari unexpectedly backtracks and states we are perhaps not just algorithms after all; it's where he states he really wanted to broaden our horizon instead of presenting an inescapable view of the future - although that is *exactly* what he has done. It reads as a hastily added disclaimer that is written as a defense to all the valid criticism I envisage proofreaders may have presented to him - which is more convenient than rewriting the entire book, but it does seem that that is exactly what he should have done. This the type of book that distinguishes shortcut-seeking 'thought leaders' from bona fide public intellectuals, and Harari, regrettably and unexpectedly, seems to want to set up shop in the former camp."
236,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,3,"The author begins with the argument that individual human beings have no inherent value and that there is no such thing as individualism, that we are simply a collection of chemicals and neurons. He essentially mocks liberal humanism for placing any value in people as such. He argues that the advance of technology will only make this more so. In a sense, this is an old argument. The second wave of the industrial revolution had this effect and life expectancy plummeted. I've read Homo Sapiens. A lot of repetition of it in this book, with a wordy expansion of the final chapter of Sapiens. Many of his ideas are already dated, such as the importance of Big Data.

Also, I felt the view was largely dystopian, was sometimes reminded of the world of the movie ""Matrix"". The last section was relevant but it seemed a mishmash of facts thrown to awe u alongwith some philosophy. Maybe, the pessimism got to me !Worth a read."
238,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,2,"What an enormously disappointing book.I enjoyed the first half of Harari's first book,Sapiens, and looked forward to this one. As a futurist I have to read books trying to scope out what's coming next. I also hoped his wry humor would reappear.Instead, I've been trying to choose a book rating between one and two stars.To begin with, the bulk of Homo Deus is not about the future of humanity. Instead it's a breezy tour of some aspects of human history and culture. The reason for that digression (more than one half the book!) is to ground two scenarios about the future, but it doesn't work well, and ultimately wastes a lot of time. The kernel of Homo Deus is just over one hundred pages (start with chapter 9).At best that tour is potted history, reminding us that liberal democracy appeared in the late 1700s, that industrialism changed civilization, that secularization is a thing, etc. It's akin to clicking through Wikipedia. At worst Harari offers his snap judgments on different developments, which are dubious. For example, he brutalizes Marxism in typical ways (it's a religion, it's really a form of therapy, etc). There's also a long digression about animal rights which turns out to play no meaningful role in the rest of the book. After the first 100 pages of this I stopped taking notes, because I would end up with my own book in response, and I'm busy starting a very different book.When Homo Deus finally gets around to addressing its purpose (subtitle: ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"") (and that part really is brief), the text is entirely drawn from current events and popular discussion. Readers can extract the highlights from any number of bloggers or articles. Automation's becoming big? Check. Biological sciences are advancing rapidly? Check. Data is increasingly important? Yup. The internet of things looms large? Uh huh.So what's useful in it?The author offers several visions of the future wherein human civilization experiences a major transformation. A key step is the decline of ""liberalism"" (a rough grab-bag for representative democracy, some kinds of individualism, some form of capitalism, a touch of pluralism) in the face of biology and technology. The life sciences and computation have shifted us towards a new notion of people driven by genetic forces and best apprehended through data. Side effects include some loss of privacy, a setting aside of democracy (maybe? this isn't developed, hilariously), and increasing class divides. Interestingly, Harari backs away from the singularity idea.Even more interesting, and, for me, more depressing, is the book's refusal to take inequality seriously. That is, Homo Deus is very interested in how technology and life sciences could expand socio-economic inequality, and how some cultural responses could happen, but isn't concerned with actual economics or politics. There's no sense of business being interested in keeping compensation low, of regulatory capture by the financial sector, or of why unionization might have declined. Similarly the book isn't concerned about national security states; it prefers to wonder about Facebook rather than the NSA.I admit to enjoying some instances of Harari's humor. I like his paralleling of gods, states, and businesses, for instance. It's not a new idea, but I'm always glad to see anarchist concepts in the mainstream. I appreciate his thorough skepticism about religions, too.Yet overall this is one of those books which becomes easier to bear the more quickly you read it. It *might* be a fun read for secondary school students who haven't been excited about history. Otherwise, skip the thing."

Sapiens
? Remember how it brilliantly explained all of human history? Well, now Yuval Noah Harari explains some of the possibilities for humanity's future.Picking up on his thesis of humans as storytellers, he looks at the main stories we've told: religion and humanism and how they may fare in an increasingly technological world. The old certainties are built on these old stories. Can liberalism and democracy survive in a world where the biological algorithms of our bodies bring free will into question? What is our role when data and AI become ubiquitous? Assuming no easy answers - nor any certainty about his own predictions - Harari again shows why he is the new Jared Diamond."

People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown.

Not only can we communicate, but we can also comminuticate about thing that exist only in our common imagination, such as corporations, google and god. Science does not make ethical judgements, it's not able to give meaning to life. The past few hundred years have seen a human sentered religion taking place of more traditional religions, humanism. Humanism puts the human liberty and free will first, and individualism. Gone is collectivism and here and now is how you feel about something. I never considered humanism another religion. I didn't really equate the bill of human rights with the ten commandments. Yet humanism and the internal conflicts within almost tore the world apart in the 20th century. However, individual liberty is not likely to continue. Human value is likely to be surpassed. The future of the world is an algorithm. The author intends to shock and he does. Whatever your belief system is, he is likely to shake you. It certainly shook mine, even though I also read and loved ""Sapiens: a brief history of humankind"".

He does not leave any stone unturned, and discusses anything from the impact of A.I. in our lives to the future of religion.I was captivated by the book and look forward to reading his most recent title, 21 LESSONS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.

You're probably well versed in these ideas. Money, cultural realism, trust, and how we use technology or religion is al based on a fiction that we all accept. No problem. When it comes to imagining what might come next, from singularities, man-machine hybrids, or the idea that AIs might consider us superfluous (an idea I am increasingly starting to agree with), there really isn't anything groundbreaking here.So why do I give it a four rather than a three or lower?It's entertaining, well-written, and while it doesn't scratch my itch to learn anything new, it is a fairly comprehensive backdrop of what might come next. Of course, we're dealing with future prediction here. Most of what we assume will never come about. :)Oh, well! At least it's consensual food-for-thought. Zeitgeist stuff.

It let's you know the important technical advances that could have huge implications to society: specifically technologies that could end liberalism, humanism, and capitalism.It's hard to imagine a current world without one of those things. But in the not-to-distant future, all three of them could be gone.Harari makes the case that technology has, objectively, made the world a better place over time. And we shouldn't worry that the coming technologies will turn that trend around. Objectively, Harari argues, the future will be better.But the big question is: would the future be better off without humans? Do humans really matter to the future? And if we don't, what becomes of us?Like Sapiens, Homo Deus is an incredibly enlightening read."
244,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24275344-nmalpas,1,"Read the intro, skip the rest.I was intrigued by the premise of this (especially given that I love sci-fi and this promised a nonfiction treatment of some classic sci-fi themes). The introduction does indeed present some some interesting lines of thought about what human beings have achieved as a species and how things might progress. But that early promise was sorely dissappointed.Harari is fine as long as he sticks to his actual area of expertise, namely, history. Though even his historical insights are rather superficial and he goes on and on about many simple points ad nauseum. The real problem is that large parts of the book stray from history not only into other social sciences and physical sciences but most ruinously of all into philosophy, of which Harari clearly has little understanding. He falls victim to countless conceptual conceptions, his arguments are full of holes, he overstates his confusions, and shows a shocking ignorance of existing discussions in philosophy mind, social ontology, ethics, etc. But this cluelessness does not prevent him from giving what he supposes to be definite answers on a slew of very difficult and controversial issues in philosophy (like the problem of other mind and the nature of morality).Overall, most of the book reads like an undergraduate philosophy assignment - a good one mind, but not something anyone should expect to gain much insight or pleasure from, nor even something you would expect to find in a lauded book form a major publisher. If you don't have much philosophical background, you might be able to read this without getting infuriated; you might even come away thinking it was profound. But your sense of wonder or enlightenment would be a sham: you will just have taken on a bunch of delusions and been habituated to shoddy argument and conceptual analysis. (less)"

I found it unputdownable - there’s just so much food for thought in its pages and I often find myself thinking back to it when I hear of advances in science and technology with which the author’s vision of the future begins to seem ever more plausible. He describes how human nature, indeed our very humanity, could be transformed in the not very distant future due to developments in bio-technology, bio-engineering, genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence combining to create a very different sort of human being. A complete step-change for humanity and the next stage of evolution. The dizzying speed of change in scientific progress makes prediction a risky process but it seems clear, even to the most sceptical, that our world is changing and we humans along with it.

Overall, to be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise very much thought provoking. To be discussed over wine. I wish I would have read this paired with another friend.Although very interesting, too much of it is redundant if you've already read Sapiens. If you have to choose, read only one.

All the rave about this terrific and ambitious author compelled me to read both of his works, Sapiens and Homo Deus. Both have disappointed me. I am insanely interested in both this topics and hoped to gain a thorough understanding through these two books but instead I find myself bashing the author all the time because of the unsettling amount of logical fallacies and sweeping arguments he committed in the book.In my opinion, such a book should be founded upon solid science, has considered every possible theory and leaves little room for disagreement. However, I have to say that Yuval Noah Harari is a terrible scientist and should not be allowed write ambitious science books like these for he is not qualified. Though the book is heavy with content and backed with loads of research, most of the arguments Yuval makes are with weak foundations and not convincing enough. Most of the the time I feel like I am reading an essay written by a high schooler, who has the help of google and pieced carelessly selected facts from the internet together to attempt to fool an examiner that his stand is justifiable. An example- Yuval tries to justify his stand that more people die of eating too much than by natural disasters, plagues and war by saying 'In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald's than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.' How is this not something you would expect from a high schooler's essay? So Yuval conveniently selected four isolated events that in no way can represent 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague' and 'war' with convenient statistics that just so happened to 'justify' his argument, in hope that the reader be fooled by this flawed logic. It is equally easy to select four other individual subset events of 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague', 'war' and compare the statistics to 'prove' that Yuval is wrong. Such is the logic flaws that Yuval littered his book with and makes me wonder why have I bothered reading such a carelessly treated book."

There are some incredibly fascinating ideas here, and some well thought out predictions. Unfortunately, there are also some unsourced and easily contradicted assertions that undercut his arguments. Like that more Americans read digital books than physical. I simply can't find any source that supports that. Or using Microsoft's Cortana as the example of a personal digital assistant that's going to rule our lives. I mean, maybe, but Cortana over Alexa? It's little things like that that make me question Harari's handle on the tech side of things. Additionally, when discussing the science, especially the bioscience aspects, Harari offers few actual, concrete examples beyond what I could find listening to an NPR podcast. It's a fine book for a broad, general look at the potential future of biotech and machine learning, and a better look the historical context that put us here, but it feels a bit thin to me.One other thing I disliked was the manner in which Harari seemed to act as if taking psychiatric medications for therapeutic reasons was the same as taking them for a cognitive boost. A person who takes Adderall because they have ADD is taking them in order to bring themselves up to baseline functionality and isn't gaining an advantage over someone who does not have ADD and isn't taking Aderall. Suggesting otherwise is like suggesting a person with an amputated leg gains a significant advantage from using a prosthesis over someone who has both of their legs. It's a false equivalency that I see peddled far too often, and it's BS. Overall, an interesting book, but one read with a critical eye. "

261,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This is a remarkably good book. Our world is shaped by our logos, pathos, and mythos. That's just a fancy way of saying it's our reason, feelings, and beliefs that make us who we are. This book takes all three methods that we use to understand, adds some historical perspective and explains the human experience better than almost anyone and speculates where we as a society will be going in the relatively near future. Feelings are not facts, but we use our feelings to understand and process the sensuous world that we our thrown into, and we use what we think we know based on what our past beliefs were in order to understand the present. We are always in a strange loop that never quite converges because the past keeps receding and we are always anticipating the future. This book will cite a series of many neurological experiments (oh I feel for those poor rats) which show how we create narratives based on experiences and overweigh the most previous moment disproportionately from what logic dictates.Have you ever talked to people who are part of the cult of Trump? I have. They weigh each of the most previous moments’ experience that they've heard from Rush Limbaugh or Brietbart's news or Trump's 144 characters tweet disproportionately over previous data with an exponential decay set so high that history and perspective doesn't matter to them. They also would reject the principals within this book for one other big reason. They live in a universe without doubts by outsourcing their beliefs to a book or to a cult leader thus ascertaining certainty within their mythical constructions using their gut feelings as their standard for truth. Mythos dwellers never know it's a myth while they are living within the myth and will create alternative facts or whine 'fake news' when challenged. One cannot go from the abstract to the real without first creating a narrative which is depended on other narratives and which is further depended on even more stories we tell ourselves in order to fill in the thoughts between our thoughts (or what Heidegger called 'the ontological difference'). There is something very refreshing about an author who states 'Climate Change is real' as a fact. We live under a president whose mythos states in 144 characters or less that 'Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax'. I wish those kinds of people who base truth on their emotional based certainties would read a book like this one for edification. The Enlightenment spawned liberalism and firmed up humanism. The author will say that liberalism tends to 1) emphasize the individual, 2) enable the authentic self and 3) value experiences. The author uses his straw man version of liberalism (a version of Existentialism) and inverts all three of those points within his narrative and by citing relevant neurological experiments and concludes there is 1) no individual self (Harari has a lot of Hegelian thought, but never cites him), 2) there is no such thing as an authentic self, and 3) our values are skewed by our most recent experiences to the point for which we can’t always rely on them alone (never ignore your intellect!). The author argues against free will (hence there is no such thing as an authentic self) and thinks the concept of an immortal soul is contradictory and therefore not worth considering. Humanism is defined as worshiping humans, by him (overall he really doesn’t care for the Enlightenment). A somewhat loaded definition. He's arguing that our future world's values will be based on dataism. He predicts a future where reality unorganized has been converted to data which has been turned into information then knowledge and then finally wisdom. He definitely has a pessimistic bent to his future world view. He thinks people when the computers take over will be by and large left to staring at screens all day and forced to use opiods to deaden the boredom. Perhaps that's true. I know when I was liberated at an early age from working I took to bike riding 2 hours every day, stopped drinking beer, lost 75 pounds, started eating healthy, started reading books like this one, and became obsessed about learning about the universe and grateful for everyday I had to pursue what interests me the most (and opiods and screen staring had very little appeal for me). The author also had a weird Frankfurt School philosophy point of view throughout the book. Harari is a historian and this book is not a philosophy book as much as it is a historical or sociological book. He does quote from Nietzsche frequently, but in some places this book read like ""Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom (he's of the Frankfurt School as is Leo Strauss and Saul Bellow). They just don't like Nietzsche's relativism no matter what and this book makes the absurd claim that Beethoven's music is superior to Chuck Berry's music. I'm going to end that dumb assertion by the author who claims data would prove him right by asserting a young man alive in 1958 and wanted to meet that pretty girl over there and they both are attuned with their time period and singing ""Johnny B Goode"" is a way for him to meet her. Would that not show for that young man that Chuck Berry's music is superior, regardless of a stupid computer algorithm. The author puts together a masterpiece by weaving various threads to tell about how he believes our world will become. We don't live in an atomized world (that's part of why he rejects item 1 of individualism). Each part that we know gets its understanding from the whole and belongs in the web of knowledge. That's why climate change deniers are as irrelevant as a creationist would be. Both have no concept of the nature of reality and want to atomize knowledge (each item in science fits in a spider like web (see Willard van Orman Quine for amplification) and interacts with all the pieces around it, climate deniers can’t deny all of science so they latch on to anomalies that have no relevance beyond themselves). Harari talks about how that kind of thought culminated with Descartes' 'cogito ergo sum' and a lot of this book shows how that kind of thinking is poison for progress."

“Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.”
I've picked up Homo Deus shortly after finishing Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thinking this book about future will be a kind of sequel. And it was, kind of. Still, I don't recommend reading them closely together. Homo Deus builds on the ideas and interpretations of history he detailed in Sapiens. Probably to make the two books stand-alones and not require the knowledge of the other book to understand this one, Harari repeats and rehashes a lot of the material. The text is not the same, but his points and ideas behind the text are. They are interesting and I like them, but for the first half of the book, I thought I would give it 3 stars because the repetition happened too soon for me. And then part II happened. Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.When Harari actually got to talking about the future, the different possibilities and their implications, my mind was blown again. I was thinking, crying, arguing, trembling under the blanket, and reading on. The book provoked all kinds of thought and feelings, it impacted me in a big way. Naturally, it goes to my 'favorites' shelf now.Kudos to Harari for once again showing he can write an entertaining and thought-provoking book of speculation. "
263,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32917354-rebecca-carter,4,"It is a sobering thought; more people die today from eating too much food than from eating too little. More people die from old age than from infectious diseases or plagues and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. For the first time in history humankind's three major problems that have remain unchanged from the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and to the Victorian British, have been famine, plague and war. This has now been transformed through breakthroughs in the fields of medicine, science, technology, politics and through enlightenment in consciousnesses in humans as to what is right and wrong. Of course there are plenty of cases where things still go amiss, but in comparison to how things used to be, humanity's major problems and issues for the future are going to be a new set of challenges. Maybe humankind will have to decide between economic growth or ecological stability? The same growth that has provided economic growth and abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials, also destabilises the planets ecological equilibrium. Pollution, climate change, global warming may all be having detrimental affects on the planet that humankind hasn't fully explored. The book is split up into three parts based on Harari's interpretation of history, his theory on how it led us to how humanity is in the present day, and his predictions on our future, each based on possibilities, hypothetical assumptions and philosophical speculations. Harari explains in some depth why and how we are a humanist society, which is important in understanding his beliefs as to where humanity is heading. His prediction is based on what humans will try to achieve in the twenty first century - not what it will succeed in achieving. He says that his forecast of the future may not be terribly original, however it is based on a liberal humanist approach of ideas and hopes that have dominated the world for 300 years. He argues that humanism sanctifies the life, emotions and desires of humans, so it isn't too difficult or far fetched to predict it will follow that humans will next want to significantly lengthen human lifespans, happiness and power. Take our current society based on humanism out of the equation, and humanity's future may indeed be very different, instead based on a future born of ideas and hopes of the twenty first century that we currently struggle to imagine or comprehend. The final third part of the book argues that attempting to realise this liberal humanist dream will eventually undermine its very foundations, by unleashing new post-humanist technologies and scientific discoveries. These discoveries could be the downfall of liberalism. If humans no longer control the running of the world, would the biggest threat be from biotechnology and artificial intelligence? What new religion would replace liberalism? Harari believes it would be techno religions in the form of the more conservative techno humanism and the more terrifying data religion. Techno humanism thinks that Homo sapiens, as we know it today, will not be relevant in the future but will still cling to many humanist values. It believes that we should therefore use technology to upgrade Homo sapiens into a far superior human model; homo deus. Dataism doesn't see humans as the pinnacle of creation - it worships data, not humans - and states that the universe consists of data flows, with the value of any entity or phenomenon determined by its contribution to data processing. The scary thing is that either of Hirari's proposed eventual hypothesis are possible, just as there are further scenarios that may lie in humankinds future, scenarios we as humans could not even begin to fathom due to our current limitations. If you enjoy having your personal beliefs and thoughts challenged, this book definitely fires up your electrochemical brain processes. Harari's views on history and how it shaped our world today, may open up new ways of looking at things to the reader. He dissects the past and takes us on a journey, so that we can see why humanity is a liberal humanist society today and what it could mean for our future. Harari also ponders the big questions of the meaning and the point of life. The debates and issues raised in the book are thought inspiring and certainly made me contemplate some new ideas. I can see this book being scoffed at by overly religious people, or people with closed mindsets, due to some of Harari's beliefs - such as the soul doesn't exist, the true self is imaginary, and that we fundamentally live pointless lives as data processing units. However, his arguments do make sense if you can think about it reasonably and logically. As Harari states, the scenarios in the book aren't prophesies, but possibilities. He attempts to explain how our present day conditioning came about in order to loosen its hold on our imagination and broaden our horizons. You don't have to agree with everything he writes, but it is an interesting debate and will definitely make you ponder and contemplate the many issues that humanity will ultimately face.Thanks very much to Random House UK Vintage Publishing, Yuval Noah Harari and Net Galley for a copy of this ARC in exchange for a review."
264,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,4,"Excellent, scary and stimulating look at our species and history - and our future. This should appeal to anyone who writes or reads as Harari´s thesis rests on the fact that we - homo sapiens - need to believe in things, be it money, flags, countries, companies, stories or even ourselves. Here, as well as showing how we got to where we are, he shows us how our reliance on technology, algorithms and being told what to do may prove to be our eventual undoing. What do we value more - consciousness or intelligence? Does consciousness really matter when intelligent machines - intelligent people - can do things better than us, more safely than us, and more perfectly? If you look at your phone instead of looking out of the window to see what the weather´s like, you might like to examine the gulf between our romantic views of our species and the cold reality."

Humanism (inluding democracy, human rights and the underlying notion of free will) is apparently yesterday's news, as humans are outdated algorithms that are being superseded by 'the internet of all things'. The author unreservedly advocates surrendering our privacy and autonomy to 'algorithms', as Google and Facebook already supposedly know us better than we know ourselves. Allowing Google to read our emails is a recurring example, although Google actually recently stopped doing just that. It is one of many signs Harari is oversimplifying history (for instance, idealizing capitalism and neoliberalism, which conveniently allows him to refrain from mentioning criticism of Google and Facebook who only harvest our data for the financial gain of themselves and their shareholders, instead of improving mankind; or his statement that all life forms are merely data processing systems and that all of science agrees with that view) and the current state of affairs, in order to present a narrowminded, dystopian view of the future of mankind that is likely to earn him many additional invitations to TED Talks and other well-paid speaking gigs. The last pages are puzzling: it's where Harari unexpectedly backtracks and states we are perhaps not just algorithms after all; it's where he states he really wanted to broaden our horizon instead of presenting an inescapable view of the future - although that is *exactly* what he has done. It reads as a hastily added disclaimer that is written as a defense to all the valid criticism I envisage proofreaders may have presented to him - which is more convenient than rewriting the entire book, but it does seem that that is exactly what he should have done. This the type of book that distinguishes shortcut-seeking 'thought leaders' from bona fide public intellectuals, and Harari, regrettably and unexpectedly, seems to want to set up shop in the former camp."
266,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,3,"The author begins with the argument that individual human beings have no inherent value and that there is no such thing as individualism, that we are simply a collection of chemicals and neurons. He essentially mocks liberal humanism for placing any value in people as such. He argues that the advance of technology will only make this more so. In a sense, this is an old argument. The second wave of the industrial revolution had this effect and life expectancy plummeted. I've read Homo Sapiens. A lot of repetition of it in this book, with a wordy expansion of the final chapter of Sapiens. Many of his ideas are already dated, such as the importance of Big Data.

268,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,2,"What an enormously disappointing book.I enjoyed the first half of Harari's first book,Sapiens, and looked forward to this one. As a futurist I have to read books trying to scope out what's coming next. I also hoped his wry humor would reappear.Instead, I've been trying to choose a book rating between one and two stars.To begin with, the bulk of Homo Deus is not about the future of humanity. Instead it's a breezy tour of some aspects of human history and culture. The reason for that digression (more than one half the book!) is to ground two scenarios about the future, but it doesn't work well, and ultimately wastes a lot of time. The kernel of Homo Deus is just over one hundred pages (start with chapter 9).At best that tour is potted history, reminding us that liberal democracy appeared in the late 1700s, that industrialism changed civilization, that secularization is a thing, etc. It's akin to clicking through Wikipedia. At worst Harari offers his snap judgments on different developments, which are dubious. For example, he brutalizes Marxism in typical ways (it's a religion, it's really a form of therapy, etc). There's also a long digression about animal rights which turns out to play no meaningful role in the rest of the book. After the first 100 pages of this I stopped taking notes, because I would end up with my own book in response, and I'm busy starting a very different book.When Homo Deus finally gets around to addressing its purpose (subtitle: ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"") (and that part really is brief), the text is entirely drawn from current events and popular discussion. Readers can extract the highlights from any number of bloggers or articles. Automation's becoming big? Check. Biological sciences are advancing rapidly? Check. Data is increasingly important? Yup. The internet of things looms large? Uh huh.So what's useful in it?The author offers several visions of the future wherein human civilization experiences a major transformation. A key step is the decline of ""liberalism"" (a rough grab-bag for representative democracy, some kinds of individualism, some form of capitalism, a touch of pluralism) in the face of biology and technology. The life sciences and computation have shifted us towards a new notion of people driven by genetic forces and best apprehended through data. Side effects include some loss of privacy, a setting aside of democracy (maybe? this isn't developed, hilariously), and increasing class divides. Interestingly, Harari backs away from the singularity idea.Even more interesting, and, for me, more depressing, is the book's refusal to take inequality seriously. That is, Homo Deus is very interested in how technology and life sciences could expand socio-economic inequality, and how some cultural responses could happen, but isn't concerned with actual economics or politics. There's no sense of business being interested in keeping compensation low, of regulatory capture by the financial sector, or of why unionization might have declined. Similarly the book isn't concerned about national security states; it prefers to wonder about Facebook rather than the NSA.I admit to enjoying some instances of Harari's humor. I like his paralleling of gods, states, and businesses, for instance. It's not a new idea, but I'm always glad to see anarchist concepts in the mainstream. I appreciate his thorough skepticism about religions, too.Yet overall this is one of those books which becomes easier to bear the more quickly you read it. It *might* be a fun read for secondary school students who haven't been excited about history. Otherwise, skip the thing."

Sapiens
? Remember how it brilliantly explained all of human history? Well, now Yuval Noah Harari explains some of the possibilities for humanity's future.Picking up on his thesis of humans as storytellers, he looks at the main stories we've told: religion and humanism and how they may fare in an increasingly technological world. The old certainties are built on these old stories. Can liberalism and democracy survive in a world where the biological algorithms of our bodies bring free will into question? What is our role when data and AI become ubiquitous? Assuming no easy answers - nor any certainty about his own predictions - Harari again shows why he is the new Jared Diamond."

Not only can we communicate, but we can also comminuticate about thing that exist only in our common imagination, such as corporations, google and god.

Humanism puts the human liberty and free will first, and individualism. Gone is collectivism and here and now is how you feel about something. I never considered humanism another religion. I didn't really equate the bill of human rights with the ten commandments. Yet humanism and the internal conflicts within almost tore the world apart in the 20th century. However, individual liberty is not likely to continue. Human value is likely to be surpassed. The future of the world is an algorithm. The author intends to shock and he does. Whatever your belief system is, he is likely to shake you. It certainly shook mine, even though I also read and loved ""Sapiens: a brief history of humankind"".

When it comes to imagining what might come next, from singularities, man-machine hybrids, or the idea that AIs might consider us superfluous (an idea I am increasingly starting to agree with), there really isn't anything groundbreaking here.So why do I give it a four rather than a three or lower?It's entertaining, well-written, and while it doesn't scratch my itch to learn anything new, it is a fairly comprehensive backdrop of what might come next.

It let's you know the important technical advances that could have huge implications to society: specifically technologies that could end liberalism, humanism, and capitalism.It's hard to imagine a current world without one of those things. But in the not-to-distant future, all three of them could be gone.Harari makes the case that technology has, objectively, made the world a better place over time. And we shouldn't worry that the coming technologies will turn that trend around. Objectively, Harari argues, the future will be better.But the big question is: would the future be better off without humans? Do humans really matter to the future? And if we don't, what becomes of us?Like Sapiens, Homo Deus is an incredibly enlightening read."
274,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24275344-nmalpas,1,"Read the intro, skip the rest.I was intrigued by the premise of this (especially given that I love sci-fi and this promised a nonfiction treatment of some classic sci-fi themes). The introduction does indeed present some some interesting lines of thought about what human beings have achieved as a species and how things might progress. But that early promise was sorely dissappointed.Harari is fine as long as he sticks to his actual area of expertise, namely, history. Though even his historical insights are rather superficial and he goes on and on about many simple points ad nauseum. The real problem is that large parts of the book stray from history not only into other social sciences and physical sciences but most ruinously of all into philosophy, of which Harari clearly has little understanding. He falls victim to countless conceptual conceptions, his arguments are full of holes, he overstates his confusions, and shows a shocking ignorance of existing discussions in philosophy mind, social ontology, ethics, etc. But this cluelessness does not prevent him from giving what he supposes to be definite answers on a slew of very difficult and controversial issues in philosophy (like the problem of other mind and the nature of morality).Overall, most of the book reads like an undergraduate philosophy assignment - a good one mind, but not something anyone should expect to gain much insight or pleasure from, nor even something you would expect to find in a lauded book form a major publisher. If you don't have much philosophical background, you might be able to read this without getting infuriated; you might even come away thinking it was profound. But your sense of wonder or enlightenment would be a sham: you will just have taken on a bunch of delusions and been habituated to shoddy argument and conceptual analysis. (less)"

I did feel like there was quite some repetition in this from Sapiens, but it didn’t disturb me too much.  '99 per cent of our decisions – including the most important life choices concerning spouses, careers and habitats – are made by the highly refined algorithms we call sensations, emotions and desires.'"

In that respect, Harari did a pretty good job.But as far as the future goes, outside science fictions, speculating is pretty pointless. Even the best of the carriages becomes obsolete once a car comes along.What will happen if P is proven to be equal to NP?What if interstellar flights becomes a reality?Absurd? In 1940s there was no computer, just seventy years later we're talking about Dataism.Even relatively realistic projects like Mars colonization or  mind control technology can change the future beyond recognition.Reading this book felt more like A Brief History of The Most Likely Versions of Tomorrow Until A Car Shows Up than what the title suggests."

I was getting worried while reading this chapter. Totally a disappointment because most contents have already appeared earlier in the last chapters of Sapiens. So, it felt like Harari is losing his charm and I was worried if he had written such an unnecessary lengthy book just to extend the last chapters of Sapiens!But I was wrong, though the first chapter was truly a disappointment, the following three parts were marvellous and amazing. Even I find it better than Sapiens :D (So, I readjusted my Sapiens rating down to 4 :p ). I could relate to its contents more --- philosophically, emotionally, and practically than the prehistoric stories of Sapiens [the only thing in Sapiens I could relate to --- is the story of capitalism]."

281,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5859680-mandy,5,"What a compelling, engaging, thought-provoking, and ultimately quite terrifying book this is. I found it unputdownable - there’s just so much food for thought in its pages and I often find myself thinking back to it when I hear of advances in science and technology with which the author’s vision of the future begins to seem ever more plausible. He describes how human nature, indeed our very humanity, could be transformed in the not very distant future due to developments in bio-technology, bio-engineering, genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence combining to create a very different sort of human being. A complete step-change for humanity and the next stage of evolution. The dizzying speed of change in scientific progress makes prediction a risky process but it seems clear, even to the most sceptical, that our world is changing and we humans along with it. Intelligent, insightful, accessible and eminently readable, this is a fascinating book which carries the reader along with its scope and vision. "
282,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10177080-lavinia,3,"A fascinating read, as Sapiens was. Unfortunately the book repeats a lot of the ideas mentioned there, at least in the first half. I loved how Harari talks about liberalism, communism, democracy etc as religions of modern times. He then culminates with mentioning the religion of the near future: dataism. Overall, to be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise very much thought provoking. To be discussed over wine. I wish I would have read this paired with another friend.Although very interesting, too much of it is redundant if you've already read Sapiens. If you have to choose, read only one. I enjoyed the other one more. This one is too speculative and it gave me anxiety. The structure of the book is also a bit on the wild side making it difficult to properly split the ideas here and there."
283,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"In his second book Y.N.Harari starts making extrapolations from todays data and inventions. In this book the writer gets more philosophical and wants the reader to question themselves regarding their future. Do they want more freedom but less control over their lives or vice versa. In an age, where every bit of data about our identities, choices and expectations are out on the table for being used and saved for further analysis constantly by computers and networks; he points out to future prospects and dangers.Very enjoyable read."

""Unlike the narrating self that controls us today, Google will not make decisions on the basis of cooked-up stories, and will not be misled by cognitive short cuts and the peak-end rule. Google will actually remember every step we took and every hand we shook.""""In exchange for such devoted counselling services, we will just have to give up the idea that humans are individuals, and that each human has a free will determining what’s good, what’s beautiful and what is the meaning of life. Humans will no longer be autonomous entities directed by the stories their narrating self invents. Instead, they will be integral parts of a huge global network.""March 25, 2018 Parking here a quote from the author’s resent appearance in the NYT (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/wo...)“Trump wants to go back to the 1950s; Putin basically wants to go back to the Czarist Empire, and you have the Islamic State that wants to go back to seventh-century Arabia.

287,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16325176-jiachen-guo,1,"Another disappointment from Yuval Noah Harari. All the rave about this terrific and ambitious author compelled me to read both of his works, Sapiens and Homo Deus. Both have disappointed me. I am insanely interested in both this topics and hoped to gain a thorough understanding through these two books but instead I find myself bashing the author all the time because of the unsettling amount of logical fallacies and sweeping arguments he committed in the book.In my opinion, such a book should be founded upon solid science, has considered every possible theory and leaves little room for disagreement. However, I have to say that Yuval Noah Harari is a terrible scientist and should not be allowed write ambitious science books like these for he is not qualified. Though the book is heavy with content and backed with loads of research, most of the arguments Yuval makes are with weak foundations and not convincing enough. Most of the the time I feel like I am reading an essay written by a high schooler, who has the help of google and pieced carelessly selected facts from the internet together to attempt to fool an examiner that his stand is justifiable. An example- Yuval tries to justify his stand that more people die of eating too much than by natural disasters, plagues and war by saying 'In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald's than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.' How is this not something you would expect from a high schooler's essay? So Yuval conveniently selected four isolated events that in no way can represent 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague' and 'war' with convenient statistics that just so happened to 'justify' his argument, in hope that the reader be fooled by this flawed logic. It is equally easy to select four other individual subset events of 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague', 'war' and compare the statistics to 'prove' that Yuval is wrong. Such is the logic flaws that Yuval littered his book with and makes me wonder why have I bothered reading such a carelessly treated book."
288,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2870295-shaun-hutchinson,0,"I enjoyed listening to Yuval Harari discuss his book more than I enjoyed the book itself. There are some incredibly fascinating ideas here, and some well thought out predictions. Unfortunately, there are also some unsourced and easily contradicted assertions that undercut his arguments. Like that more Americans read digital books than physical. I simply can't find any source that supports that. Or using Microsoft's Cortana as the example of a personal digital assistant that's going to rule our lives. I mean, maybe, but Cortana over Alexa? It's little things like that that make me question Harari's handle on the tech side of things. Additionally, when discussing the science, especially the bioscience aspects, Harari offers few actual, concrete examples beyond what I could find listening to an NPR podcast. It's a fine book for a broad, general look at the potential future of biotech and machine learning, and a better look the historical context that put us here, but it feels a bit thin to me.One other thing I disliked was the manner in which Harari seemed to act as if taking psychiatric medications for therapeutic reasons was the same as taking them for a cognitive boost. A person who takes Adderall because they have ADD is taking them in order to bring themselves up to baseline functionality and isn't gaining an advantage over someone who does not have ADD and isn't taking Aderall. Suggesting otherwise is like suggesting a person with an amputated leg gains a significant advantage from using a prosthesis over someone who has both of their legs. It's a false equivalency that I see peddled far too often, and it's BS. Overall, an interesting book, but one read with a critical eye. "

291,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This is a remarkably good book. Our world is shaped by our logos, pathos, and mythos. That's just a fancy way of saying it's our reason, feelings, and beliefs that make us who we are. This book takes all three methods that we use to understand, adds some historical perspective and explains the human experience better than almost anyone and speculates where we as a society will be going in the relatively near future. Feelings are not facts, but we use our feelings to understand and process the sensuous world that we our thrown into, and we use what we think we know based on what our past beliefs were in order to understand the present. We are always in a strange loop that never quite converges because the past keeps receding and we are always anticipating the future. This book will cite a series of many neurological experiments (oh I feel for those poor rats) which show how we create narratives based on experiences and overweigh the most previous moment disproportionately from what logic dictates.Have you ever talked to people who are part of the cult of Trump? I have. They weigh each of the most previous moments’ experience that they've heard from Rush Limbaugh or Brietbart's news or Trump's 144 characters tweet disproportionately over previous data with an exponential decay set so high that history and perspective doesn't matter to them. They also would reject the principals within this book for one other big reason. They live in a universe without doubts by outsourcing their beliefs to a book or to a cult leader thus ascertaining certainty within their mythical constructions using their gut feelings as their standard for truth. Mythos dwellers never know it's a myth while they are living within the myth and will create alternative facts or whine 'fake news' when challenged. One cannot go from the abstract to the real without first creating a narrative which is depended on other narratives and which is further depended on even more stories we tell ourselves in order to fill in the thoughts between our thoughts (or what Heidegger called 'the ontological difference'). There is something very refreshing about an author who states 'Climate Change is real' as a fact. We live under a president whose mythos states in 144 characters or less that 'Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax'. I wish those kinds of people who base truth on their emotional based certainties would read a book like this one for edification. The Enlightenment spawned liberalism and firmed up humanism. The author will say that liberalism tends to 1) emphasize the individual, 2) enable the authentic self and 3) value experiences. The author uses his straw man version of liberalism (a version of Existentialism) and inverts all three of those points within his narrative and by citing relevant neurological experiments and concludes there is 1) no individual self (Harari has a lot of Hegelian thought, but never cites him), 2) there is no such thing as an authentic self, and 3) our values are skewed by our most recent experiences to the point for which we can’t always rely on them alone (never ignore your intellect!). The author argues against free will (hence there is no such thing as an authentic self) and thinks the concept of an immortal soul is contradictory and therefore not worth considering. Humanism is defined as worshiping humans, by him (overall he really doesn’t care for the Enlightenment). A somewhat loaded definition. He's arguing that our future world's values will be based on dataism. He predicts a future where reality unorganized has been converted to data which has been turned into information then knowledge and then finally wisdom. He definitely has a pessimistic bent to his future world view. He thinks people when the computers take over will be by and large left to staring at screens all day and forced to use opiods to deaden the boredom. Perhaps that's true. I know when I was liberated at an early age from working I took to bike riding 2 hours every day, stopped drinking beer, lost 75 pounds, started eating healthy, started reading books like this one, and became obsessed about learning about the universe and grateful for everyday I had to pursue what interests me the most (and opiods and screen staring had very little appeal for me). The author also had a weird Frankfurt School philosophy point of view throughout the book. Harari is a historian and this book is not a philosophy book as much as it is a historical or sociological book. He does quote from Nietzsche frequently, but in some places this book read like ""Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom (he's of the Frankfurt School as is Leo Strauss and Saul Bellow). They just don't like Nietzsche's relativism no matter what and this book makes the absurd claim that Beethoven's music is superior to Chuck Berry's music. I'm going to end that dumb assertion by the author who claims data would prove him right by asserting a young man alive in 1958 and wanted to meet that pretty girl over there and they both are attuned with their time period and singing ""Johnny B Goode"" is a way for him to meet her. Would that not show for that young man that Chuck Berry's music is superior, regardless of a stupid computer algorithm. The author puts together a masterpiece by weaving various threads to tell about how he believes our world will become. We don't live in an atomized world (that's part of why he rejects item 1 of individualism). Each part that we know gets its understanding from the whole and belongs in the web of knowledge. That's why climate change deniers are as irrelevant as a creationist would be. Both have no concept of the nature of reality and want to atomize knowledge (each item in science fits in a spider like web (see Willard van Orman Quine for amplification) and interacts with all the pieces around it, climate deniers can’t deny all of science so they latch on to anomalies that have no relevance beyond themselves). Harari talks about how that kind of thought culminated with Descartes' 'cogito ergo sum' and a lot of this book shows how that kind of thinking is poison for progress."

“Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.”
I've picked up Homo Deus shortly after finishing Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thinking this book about future will be a kind of sequel. And it was, kind of. Still, I don't recommend reading them closely together. Homo Deus builds on the ideas and interpretations of history he detailed in Sapiens. Probably to make the two books stand-alones and not require the knowledge of the other book to understand this one, Harari repeats and rehashes a lot of the material. The text is not the same, but his points and ideas behind the text are. They are interesting and I like them, but for the first half of the book, I thought I would give it 3 stars because the repetition happened too soon for me. And then part II happened. Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.When Harari actually got to talking about the future, the different possibilities and their implications, my mind was blown again. I was thinking, crying, arguing, trembling under the blanket, and reading on. The book provoked all kinds of thought and feelings, it impacted me in a big way. Naturally, it goes to my 'favorites' shelf now.Kudos to Harari for once again showing he can write an entertaining and thought-provoking book of speculation. "
293,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32917354-rebecca-carter,4,"It is a sobering thought; more people die today from eating too much food than from eating too little. More people die from old age than from infectious diseases or plagues and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. For the first time in history humankind's three major problems that have remain unchanged from the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and to the Victorian British, have been famine, plague and war. This has now been transformed through breakthroughs in the fields of medicine, science, technology, politics and through enlightenment in consciousnesses in humans as to what is right and wrong. Of course there are plenty of cases where things still go amiss, but in comparison to how things used to be, humanity's major problems and issues for the future are going to be a new set of challenges. Maybe humankind will have to decide between economic growth or ecological stability? The same growth that has provided economic growth and abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials, also destabilises the planets ecological equilibrium. Pollution, climate change, global warming may all be having detrimental affects on the planet that humankind hasn't fully explored. The book is split up into three parts based on Harari's interpretation of history, his theory on how it led us to how humanity is in the present day, and his predictions on our future, each based on possibilities, hypothetical assumptions and philosophical speculations. Harari explains in some depth why and how we are a humanist society, which is important in understanding his beliefs as to where humanity is heading. His prediction is based on what humans will try to achieve in the twenty first century - not what it will succeed in achieving. He says that his forecast of the future may not be terribly original, however it is based on a liberal humanist approach of ideas and hopes that have dominated the world for 300 years. He argues that humanism sanctifies the life, emotions and desires of humans, so it isn't too difficult or far fetched to predict it will follow that humans will next want to significantly lengthen human lifespans, happiness and power. Take our current society based on humanism out of the equation, and humanity's future may indeed be very different, instead based on a future born of ideas and hopes of the twenty first century that we currently struggle to imagine or comprehend. The final third part of the book argues that attempting to realise this liberal humanist dream will eventually undermine its very foundations, by unleashing new post-humanist technologies and scientific discoveries. These discoveries could be the downfall of liberalism. If humans no longer control the running of the world, would the biggest threat be from biotechnology and artificial intelligence? What new religion would replace liberalism? Harari believes it would be techno religions in the form of the more conservative techno humanism and the more terrifying data religion. Techno humanism thinks that Homo sapiens, as we know it today, will not be relevant in the future but will still cling to many humanist values. It believes that we should therefore use technology to upgrade Homo sapiens into a far superior human model; homo deus. Dataism doesn't see humans as the pinnacle of creation - it worships data, not humans - and states that the universe consists of data flows, with the value of any entity or phenomenon determined by its contribution to data processing. The scary thing is that either of Hirari's proposed eventual hypothesis are possible, just as there are further scenarios that may lie in humankinds future, scenarios we as humans could not even begin to fathom due to our current limitations. If you enjoy having your personal beliefs and thoughts challenged, this book definitely fires up your electrochemical brain processes. Harari's views on history and how it shaped our world today, may open up new ways of looking at things to the reader. He dissects the past and takes us on a journey, so that we can see why humanity is a liberal humanist society today and what it could mean for our future. Harari also ponders the big questions of the meaning and the point of life. The debates and issues raised in the book are thought inspiring and certainly made me contemplate some new ideas. I can see this book being scoffed at by overly religious people, or people with closed mindsets, due to some of Harari's beliefs - such as the soul doesn't exist, the true self is imaginary, and that we fundamentally live pointless lives as data processing units. However, his arguments do make sense if you can think about it reasonably and logically. As Harari states, the scenarios in the book aren't prophesies, but possibilities. He attempts to explain how our present day conditioning came about in order to loosen its hold on our imagination and broaden our horizons. You don't have to agree with everything he writes, but it is an interesting debate and will definitely make you ponder and contemplate the many issues that humanity will ultimately face.Thanks very much to Random House UK Vintage Publishing, Yuval Noah Harari and Net Galley for a copy of this ARC in exchange for a review."
294,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,4,"Excellent, scary and stimulating look at our species and history - and our future. This should appeal to anyone who writes or reads as Harari´s thesis rests on the fact that we - homo sapiens - need to believe in things, be it money, flags, countries, companies, stories or even ourselves. Here, as well as showing how we got to where we are, he shows us how our reliance on technology, algorithms and being told what to do may prove to be our eventual undoing. What do we value more - consciousness or intelligence? Does consciousness really matter when intelligent machines - intelligent people - can do things better than us, more safely than us, and more perfectly? If you look at your phone instead of looking out of the window to see what the weather´s like, you might like to examine the gulf between our romantic views of our species and the cold reality."

Humanism (inluding democracy, human rights and the underlying notion of free will) is apparently yesterday's news, as humans are outdated algorithms that are being superseded by 'the internet of all things'. The author unreservedly advocates surrendering our privacy and autonomy to 'algorithms', as Google and Facebook already supposedly know us better than we know ourselves. Allowing Google to read our emails is a recurring example, although Google actually recently stopped doing just that. It is one of many signs Harari is oversimplifying history (for instance, idealizing capitalism and neoliberalism, which conveniently allows him to refrain from mentioning criticism of Google and Facebook who only harvest our data for the financial gain of themselves and their shareholders, instead of improving mankind; or his statement that all life forms are merely data processing systems and that all of science agrees with that view) and the current state of affairs, in order to present a narrowminded, dystopian view of the future of mankind that is likely to earn him many additional invitations to TED Talks and other well-paid speaking gigs. The last pages are puzzling: it's where Harari unexpectedly backtracks and states we are perhaps not just algorithms after all; it's where he states he really wanted to broaden our horizon instead of presenting an inescapable view of the future - although that is *exactly* what he has done. It reads as a hastily added disclaimer that is written as a defense to all the valid criticism I envisage proofreaders may have presented to him - which is more convenient than rewriting the entire book, but it does seem that that is exactly what he should have done. This the type of book that distinguishes shortcut-seeking 'thought leaders' from bona fide public intellectuals, and Harari, regrettably and unexpectedly, seems to want to set up shop in the former camp."
296,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,3,"The author begins with the argument that individual human beings have no inherent value and that there is no such thing as individualism, that we are simply a collection of chemicals and neurons. He essentially mocks liberal humanism for placing any value in people as such. He argues that the advance of technology will only make this more so. In a sense, this is an old argument. The second wave of the industrial revolution had this effect and life expectancy plummeted. I've read Homo Sapiens. A lot of repetition of it in this book, with a wordy expansion of the final chapter of Sapiens. Many of his ideas are already dated, such as the importance of Big Data.

298,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,2,"What an enormously disappointing book.I enjoyed the first half of Harari's first book,Sapiens, and looked forward to this one. As a futurist I have to read books trying to scope out what's coming next. I also hoped his wry humor would reappear.Instead, I've been trying to choose a book rating between one and two stars.To begin with, the bulk of Homo Deus is not about the future of humanity. Instead it's a breezy tour of some aspects of human history and culture. The reason for that digression (more than one half the book!) is to ground two scenarios about the future, but it doesn't work well, and ultimately wastes a lot of time. The kernel of Homo Deus is just over one hundred pages (start with chapter 9).At best that tour is potted history, reminding us that liberal democracy appeared in the late 1700s, that industrialism changed civilization, that secularization is a thing, etc. It's akin to clicking through Wikipedia. At worst Harari offers his snap judgments on different developments, which are dubious. For example, he brutalizes Marxism in typical ways (it's a religion, it's really a form of therapy, etc). There's also a long digression about animal rights which turns out to play no meaningful role in the rest of the book. After the first 100 pages of this I stopped taking notes, because I would end up with my own book in response, and I'm busy starting a very different book.When Homo Deus finally gets around to addressing its purpose (subtitle: ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"") (and that part really is brief), the text is entirely drawn from current events and popular discussion. Readers can extract the highlights from any number of bloggers or articles. Automation's becoming big? Check. Biological sciences are advancing rapidly? Check. Data is increasingly important? Yup. The internet of things looms large? Uh huh.So what's useful in it?The author offers several visions of the future wherein human civilization experiences a major transformation. A key step is the decline of ""liberalism"" (a rough grab-bag for representative democracy, some kinds of individualism, some form of capitalism, a touch of pluralism) in the face of biology and technology. The life sciences and computation have shifted us towards a new notion of people driven by genetic forces and best apprehended through data. Side effects include some loss of privacy, a setting aside of democracy (maybe? this isn't developed, hilariously), and increasing class divides. Interestingly, Harari backs away from the singularity idea.Even more interesting, and, for me, more depressing, is the book's refusal to take inequality seriously. That is, Homo Deus is very interested in how technology and life sciences could expand socio-economic inequality, and how some cultural responses could happen, but isn't concerned with actual economics or politics. There's no sense of business being interested in keeping compensation low, of regulatory capture by the financial sector, or of why unionization might have declined. Similarly the book isn't concerned about national security states; it prefers to wonder about Facebook rather than the NSA.I admit to enjoying some instances of Harari's humor. I like his paralleling of gods, states, and businesses, for instance. It's not a new idea, but I'm always glad to see anarchist concepts in the mainstream. I appreciate his thorough skepticism about religions, too.Yet overall this is one of those books which becomes easier to bear the more quickly you read it. It *might* be a fun read for secondary school students who haven't been excited about history. Otherwise, skip the thing."
299,1910701882,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,5,"Remember 
Sapiens
? Remember how it brilliantly explained all of human history? Well, now Yuval Noah Harari explains some of the possibilities for humanity's future.Picking up on his thesis of humans as storytellers, he looks at the main stories we've told: religion and humanism and how they may fare in an increasingly technological world. The old certainties are built on these old stories. Can liberalism and democracy survive in a world where the biological algorithms of our bodies bring free will into question? What is our role when data and AI become ubiquitous? Assuming no easy answers - nor any certainty about his own predictions - Harari again shows why he is the new Jared Diamond."
