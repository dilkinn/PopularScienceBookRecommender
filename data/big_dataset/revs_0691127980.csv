0,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"This is a great book about one of the most beautiful and fascinating subjects of maths: the world of imaginary/complex numbers and of complex analysis. This is a book unapologetically mathematical in contents and approach, a real math book with real math, sometimes dense and sometimes beyond the “freshman calculus” level, but it is never too difficult if you have the patience and perseverance to go through the many fascinating and intriguing examples and theorems. And if you persevere, the intellectual rewards to the reader are well worth the effort.The author manages to effectively convey, with concrete and fascinating examples, the intellectual adventure of discovery and unveiling of the beautiful world of complex numbers.Several very intriguing results are demonstrated by the author throughout the book, many of which could not be possibly be demonstrated without the usage of imaginary numbers. The author, in other words, brilliantly and consistently demonstrates what the mathematician Hadamard once said: ""The shortest path between two truths in the real domain passes through the complex domain"". The book presents fascinating examples about the physical signature for the complex roots in the plot of quadratic and cubic functions. The relationship between complex numbers and geometry, and physical solutions to real problems, is also treated quite well. The author then effectively demonstrates the sheer beauty and simplicity of the geometric interpretation of the complex numbers and of the corresponding definition of ""i"" as the rotation operator; he also shows how such interpretation, supported by the famous Le Moivre theorem, can be used to generate countless trig identities. Other beautiful results and identities are also very nicely explained by the author: examples are the famous Euler's identity, the result that ""i"" to the ""i"" gives you real numbers, the quite astonishing result that 1^pi (number ""1"" to the power of pi) - which after all is just a real number by a real power - has an infinity of distinct complex values. There is also a quite interesting chapter about the utilization of complex numbers in areas of physics such as special relativity, the derivation of Kepler's first law of elliptical orbit (and his other laws) from Newton's physics, and in electrical engineering problems. Disappointingly (and surprisingly) the fundamental character of complex numbers in quantum mechanics is not treated by the author. I was also disappointed by the fact that fractals are not treated in this book either. In chapter 6 (aptly titled ""wizard mathematics""), things get mathematically serious: the book gets into more intense but also very intriguing mathematical territory. This is very rewarding albeit somewhat slow read. The Euler's constant and the zeta function are explained in a nice and clear manner. Some of Euler's derivations, so beautifully presented by the author, can be clearly seen as the product of pure, raw genius. And the beauty of higher mathematics can be seen in its power, when we start digging into things such as the derivation of the value of pi from i, the Fresnel integrals, gamma functions extended to complex values and their relationship to the zeta functions, the Riemann hypothesis etc.These are all beautiful derivations and examples almost perfectly executed by the author, with only the very occasional minor typo or missing step or partial demonstration (for example, only a trivial case of the reflection formula is actually proved), and occasionally peculiar notational choices. However it is not a textbook and it does not pretend to be a textbook, so the occasional lack of mathematical rigor is totally forgivable, in my opinion.We finally get, in the last chapter, to the dessert of this rich and rewarding intellectual buffet: complex function theory. I strongly agree with the author when he states: ""it wasn't until my first course in complex function theory that I experienced a totally new emotion - the pure pleasure of learning mathematics that was, in and of itself, pretty."" The analysis of complex functions requires by itself at least a separate book, but the author does an egregious job in conveying the beauty of some fundamental and fascinating results within the space of the last chapter of his book. He focuses on Cauchy's first and second integral theorems. The latter theorem is particularly beautiful: the intimate connection between the value of a complex analytical function f(z) at an internal point inside a region delimited by C, and its contour integral on C, is another illustration of the very special nature of complex functions. The way the author explain Cauchy's contour integrals is just great.It is clear from the book that the author loves mathematics, appreciates its sheer beauty, and simply loves showing off beautiful equations, graphical tricks, awesome solutions and great intellectual challenges bringing out counter-intuitive and astonishing results.Overall, this is a hugely rewarding book, highly recommended to anybody who loves mathematics. A joy to read. 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars given the fascinating subject of this book and the energy and enthusiasm of the author. "
1,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4760905-ghada,5,"I've been bored with reading novels lately, so I was looking for something a bit more inspiring and challenging. This book really hit the spot!I wouldn't call it a non-fiction book per se, but something more of a supplementary book for those interested in digging deeper into a subject. Here the subject under discussion was complex numbers (specifically the imaginary number i). In the preface, the author claims that no book has ever been written on this subject alone in a non-text book form, so he took it upon himself to do so (he is an electrical engineer and was fascinated with complex numbers while growing up). Well hats off to Eng. Nahin, because he did an amazing job! The author began with a historical summary of i and the mathematical problems that it surfaced from. He then moved on to some important applications. I really enjoyed chapters 4-6, which contained some problems and uses of complex numbers. There was a chapter titled ""Wizard Mathematics""!! I had a field day with that one. The title alone was so exciting!I loved going through the proof of how according to complex number theory, the shortest distance between two points is NOT a straight line (shortcuts through hyperspace?!?... I know right!), Schellbach's method of using i^i to calculate pi, and more on the genius of Professor Euler. Even the Appendixes were rich with more problems and proofs, it makes you want to savor every page!I just wish that I had read this book while I was studying complex numbers and Cauchy's Theorems last year. It would've been easier to work out all the derivations while everything was still fresh. I think that the reader would appreciate this book more if she/he had at least some basic knowledge of complex numbers and calculus. It is definitely worth going through the mathematics yourself using pencil and paper, because let me tell you The Story of i is epic!"
2,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110709974-oxymoron,5,"Of the various books about the history and “life and times” of the major mathematical constants, I like this the best. “i” is probably the most difficult of those constants to deal with, given its abstract nature. Nahin well covers the conceptual difficulties associated with the square root of negative one, and how its occurrence in the algorithm for finding the real roots of a generalized cubic equation essentially forced the issue of finding the “meaning of i”. That starting point, followed as it was by the geometry of i struck me as an ideal way to approach its introduction and initial teaching at the high school. For anyone who is curious about i, but does not want to venture too far into the heavier mathematics, then the first three chapters will serve very well.In respect of the utility of i, Nahin mentions Steinmetz’ 1893 paper, “Complex Quantities and Their Use in Electrical Engineering”. That was one of the first applied uses of i, and Steinmetz facilitated an in-depth analysis of three-phase systems that allowed their general use for distribution and not just transmission. Hitherto polyphase systems had mostly been of the less efficient but much easier to analyse two-phase type. One could say that i, via Steinmetz’ work, is responsible for our three-phase world (recognizing that Ferraris had first described polyphase systems.) ""i"" deserves a “life and works” treatment, and Nahin has provided just that."
3,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2844127-vicki-cline,3,"I was hoping to really like this book, as it involves my favorite equation, Euler's identity, e^(i * pi) + 1 = 0.Such an elegant way to connect the five most important constants in math, along with fundamental mathematical operations. Unfortunately, the understanding of the math involved in the book, which I'm sure I used to have 50 years ago when I got my BA in math, has left me. I had to skip over most of the equations in the book (and there are a lot of them), so I don't even know if I can count this book as ""read."" But what I was able to read was interesting, especially the early history, where the concept of the square root of minus one helped solve otherwise intractable problems, but the men who figured out the methods were so reluctant to believe in it as a number (hence the designation ""imaginary"")."
4,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19718416-matt,3,"Very technical for a popular book, though admittedly most of my reference points are pop science rather than pop maths. (It's certainly no The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, but it's far more mathematical than any other pop science book I can think of, and it's much more demanding than, say, Ellenberg's excellent How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking, which is the only pop maths book I can think of off the top of my head.) In any case, I found it heavy going, and had to accept that a fair portion would go over my head unless I was willing to spend a huge amount of time and effort. So I'm not in a position to judge whether it would be enjoyable for readers with the background & intelligence to follow it closely (though I suspect that it would be). For me it was worthwhile in parts & frustrating in others. Mostly that's simply the result of my own ignorance/laziness/stupidity, but I did sometimes feel that Nahin wasn't quite sure who he was writing for: he would occasionally pause to explain a very basic concept, then in the next breath launch into a torrent of formal mathematics with little in the way of verbal guidance. (Mostly, though, he was clearly aiming at people with a fairly solid mathematical background.) There were some sections that I could have grasped a lot more quickly & easily with just slightly more hand-holding; sometimes a logical leap that would be obvious to a mathematician took me an embarassingly long time to understand. I assume something similar is true of some of the proofs I gave up on following, though others were genuinely too hard for me, and by the final chapter I was doing a lot of skim-reading. Anyway, I suspect I might have loved this book had I been a bit smarter or better educated. In reality, it was probably worth reading, but only just."
5,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897899-jason,4,"Great history and math book. You definitely need a lot of math to fully appreciate this book (if you don't have background up to trig, and preferably calculus, you'll find all but the first couple of chapters impenetrable). If you fit the pre-reqs though, it is very interesting. I found how much my math has degenerated as every now and then I just had to shrug and just move on. (I do look forward to going back and with pencil and paper trying out some of the more hairy calculations.) Now, after all that, I would say even if you don't have a strong math background, the history part is very interesting and some of the simple math concepts as they evolved are keen, so it would be worth your while to crack the book open and read the first couple chapters."
6,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/668250-jessica,1,"Yeah, yeah, I should know better than to expect much from a book on math, but I've actually read some decent ones. This one was supposed to be on layman's terms, but it was so technical that it might as well have been written in French. Nothing was explained in plain English--it was all equations and made me feel rather stupid. I'm going to be teaching math, after all, but man, it was way over my head. Not that I expect anyone to actually read it, but just in case you were tempted, don't."
7,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22356256-kyle,5,"Another excellent book by Nahin. This covers the history of using i, or the square root of negative one. It covers the subject without apologies for using mathematics, and I personally enjoy this. Nahin gives explanations of what he is doing, but he does not shy away from just showing steps. The history is also well-done and with one exception, I found it to be comprehensive and well-researched. In other words, it is another book I would recommend if you like math/physics/engineering history.The exception is the coverage of Copernicus to Kepler. Nahin gives Copernicus a lot of credit for a heliocentric model (and questions Tycho Brahe's model). My experience shows that people that do so have never really investigated or used the Ptolemaic or Copernican models. Kepler's model is the one that I think makes a better case for planets orbiting the sun being a more useful perspective. Other than this, (and Nahin barely comments on this history as it does not have much to do with the history of i), it was quite good.If you're curious about Copernican vs Ptolemaic models, they are very similar in complexity and so neither is at a computational advantage in my opinion. What the Copernican model has is an explanation for why a particular parameter that relates to an orbital radius increases as we go outward from Mercury to Neptune when you put the sun at the center. [The Ptolemaic model can put the sun at the center from a geometric perspective and the calculations are the same. In addition, there are no preferred frames in physics, so long as you take into account any extra forces, you can use non-inertial frames. So saying heliocentric is better always seemed odd to me. It's just usually simpler to use inertial frames.] In addition, Brahe had strong evidence against the heliocentric model, because they were unaware of optical effects on the apparent size of the stars through the atmosphere, so that if you calculated how big distant stars were, they were hundreds of times larger than our entire solar system, at the smallest. Brahe thought that should count against the heliocentric model, since such gigantic stars would be nothing like our sun. You might not agree with our sun being average, but this is not a crazy argument."
8,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91560761-stanley-xue,5,"First math book I read that actually had a lot of satisfying math. Only had a high school understanding of complex numbers and calculus beforehand. It was very rewarding to go through this learning experience. Nahin takes you on a journey through history from the origins of the imaginary number - surprisingly popping up when solving cubic equations, and then to Euler's contributions, case studies in using complex numbers to prove important scientific results such as Kepler's equations, and up to basic complex function theory. LOTS OF MATHS. Great for people sick of arm-wavy popular science/maths books (and don't have enough energy to wade through a university textbook). Structuring the book through historical discoveries and building up just enough of a picture of who these great mathematicians were (BUT STILL KEEPING A LOT OF MATHS AND CLEAR EXPLANATION TO NOT SOUND TOO WAFFLY) kept me engaged through the whole book. "
9,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98215836-kcl,5,Wish I had read this before taking complex analysis. Everything would have been less imaginary.
10,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2794644-nathan-glenn,0,"I'm going to hold off on rating this for now, since the Kindle edition is so messed up that I could not read a lot of the formulas.This book is a comprehensive history of the number i. It explains the history of the idea of the number itself, its geometric and interpretation, and then its applications.He says that a high school graduate who studied calculus should be fine reading it, but I wouldn't quite agree. You have to have calculus pretty fresh on your mind to just dive into this. It has some really heavy math in it, and it is good to keep in mind that it is meant as a readable history for mathematicians. The theory starts small, showing that ""imaginary"" numbers are in a number plane instead of a number line, and goes through several aspects of complex analysis including harmonic functions and contour integrals, describing interesting characters along the way. It was fun to read, but I was completely lost on the math. Quite a heavy read."
11,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/391739-kaylee,3,"It's only been three and a half years since I've been in an upper-level math class, and yet, I felt like a dunce at many points in this book.Granted, that may have been due to Nahin's decidedly engineer-fascinated-by-math style of writing (that style does exist, I swear; I grew up with my dad teaching me math in a way that can only be described as filtered through an engineer's mind); aside from my dad, the people I spoke math with were all mathematicians.I should have read this when I first received it as a gift if I wanted to fully grasp all of the equations. As it was, despite my degree in math and the insanely slow pace I took reading this, the lack of constant use of many equations and theorems shown in the book meant I recognized the name and the general idea, but was totally lost on some of his executions."
12,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5707216-erik,4,"I now realize why I took all that #@$%#$ math in University: it was to be able to read this book. Why can't school math be presented like this? Anyway, if you remember any trig or calc read this and enjoy the part where Einstein's contribution to general relativity gets explained it a way that makes sense.Edit: This is a real math book, with real math. Like, solving differential equations math. But there's a story you can follow without following every step of the calculations as long as you can intuit why the result makes sense. So it's pretty perfect."
13,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653451-ajp3,5,"one of the best mathematics books ever written. the last two chapters have significant mathematical formalism (mostly complex analysis), but up until that point almost any calculus student will understand the arguments presented. some of the most elegant and beautiful ideas are covered in this surprisingly short book. I love it and try to read it often."
14,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74776-mirela-darau,5,"I simply loved reading this book, and I was thrilled to see how mathematics worked some centuries ago! Another good thing about this book is that the author's arguments and explanations are mostly simple and can be followed..."
15,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101529-gabriel,4,"While best read by those with a pad of paper, a pencil and their fare share of mathematical knowledge, this has been a very cool read about the history of the imaginary number and how mathematicians think."
16,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3019765-david,5,"Best to have some familiarity with calculus; given that, this is a wonderful book about the historical development of mathematics involving imaginary numbers. The final chapters display some powerful ideas that lead to non-intuitive results. "
17,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16998356-rupesh-kumar,4,"Adding an imaginary number imaginary times may yield a real number. After reading this book you'll come to know what is imaginary is not actually imaginary.It is complex, isn't it?:-)A great book for those who love mathematics. "
18,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129462-lynn,1,I had no idea that the few short lessons I had on the imaginary number had such a complicated background. It was an interesting but tedious read.
19,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4315672-clark-lyons,5,The author gets his message across very well but is too practical for me.
20,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3686037-zach,0,An excellent book about the history of one of the most important developments in mathematics!
21,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69970760-david-doel,3,"The short answer -- way too much algebra and too little history.The preface to this book is a touching remembrance of the author's father and his impact on the author's decision to study electrical engineering.If you stop reading there, I believe what you will have missed is a horrific amount of algebra and a little bit of history. There are moments of interest, but too few and too many equations in between. There is no clear goal to this book unless it is to display the author's mathematical prowess.Chapter 5 includes an interesting discussion of the transition from Copernicus through Kepler and Newton moving from an earth-centered universe to a sun-centered solar system. Nahin uses imaginary numbers to show consistency between Kepler's laws and Newton's physics. That is not how Newton worked, but the section is interesting and does present the history. Most of the advances described in the book were not from using imaginary numbers; they are able to be reproduced using imaginary mathematics.If you want to brush up on your algebra and trigonometry, this book might be for you. You can just fill in the blanks the author leaves in his many derivations and I guarantee you will get lots of practice."
22,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68479993-cesar-garza,5,"Wonderful book detailing the history of brilliant men and how they came across the imaginary axis. I would never have imagined that the development (or discovery) of i came from the root of the cubic, instead of the root of the quadratic as I had previously thought.I would recommend this book to anyone who has a strong grasp over high school math, though it might be challenging if you’re cruising by on an Algebra 2 knowledge base. If this is your situation, keep a paper and pencil handy to follow along the very easy to follow logic. For people majoring in a math heavy field, this is a mathematical lightweight, which greatly contributes to its enjoyability as a casual read.Fantastic book, greatly recommend to anyone interested in math."
23,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69638259-bill-w,3,"2.5. While reading this, I couldn't help wondering who the intended audience was. It's marketed as a ""popular mathematics"" book (an oxymoron, really) but it isn't one. Cauchy's theorem is college-level math. I think that people who have studied mathematics long enough to understand this book also know enough to be bored by it. I did like the history in the book, which is why I read it. I'm rounding up my rating for Goodreads because I admire the author for his attempt to portray the human side -- the struggles and strokes of genius that lie behind the ""dry"" analysis we take for granted. This information is very important. I learned a lot from the historical anecdotes in the book. "
24,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98453470-andrew-grenfell,5,"For anyone with even a vague interest in Mathematics above secondary school, or looking to teach it - a brilliant must-read. Or a fascinating diversion for scientists/engineers who want to know more depth behind those i/j symbols they often have to juggle. Integrates the maths nicely with the history and the personal stories. Plenty of equations and some tough concepts to get your teeth into.Spoiler alert, not for those who hate algebra. Or, if you're actually afraid of Mathematics, put this book down and run away - very fast."

33,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,4,The best book on i.
34,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19658976-brett-t,2,"Of all the people who probably hide their heads at the goofs they have made, the person who named ""imaginary"" numbers is probably among them as far as the field of mathematics is concerned.So-called ""imaginary"" numbers describe the square roots of negative numbers, which are impossible to calculate using plain integers. The square root of 1, for example, is 1 because 1x1=1. But the square root of -1 seems impossible to figure, because the only way to get to -1 is to multiply two different numbers together. A negative number multiplied by another negative number leaves a positive number, not a negative one. At some point, mathematicians decided that there would be a square root of -1, and it would just be a 1 that was on another ""axis"" than the regular positive-negative line. But since the number didn't seem to have any real-world analogue like positive and negative numbers did, it somehow got hung with the tag, ""imaginary."" So today we say that the square root of negative 1 is i. The square root of -4 is 2i, and so on.Retired electrical engineering professor Paul Nahin outlines some of the development of i through the history of mathematics in An Imaginary Tale. Some early cultures refused to acknowledge the existence of a quantity that could be squared to form a negative number, and even into the Renaissance and enlightenment years the so-called ""imaginary"" numbers were considered at best unimportant. They were not useful except in specialized cases and it seemed even mathematicians had reservations about dealing with numbers that didn't represent any real quantity.Today, i and its counterparts find widespread use in many areas of math, and the only reservations that seem to continue deal mostly with the use of the word ""imaginary."" Nahin explores how important i is in many fields of engineering, especially his own. This part of the book -- about the latter two-thirds -- is heavily laden with equations and formulas and is going to be beyond most non-mathematician or non-engineer readers. He probably would have had to lengthen the book considerably to bring that subject matter within the grasp of the lay reader, but that doesn't make the string of equations and engineering language any easier to navigate. Original available here."
35,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241251-andrew,3,"For centuries, mathematicians have struggled to understand the meaning of the square root of negative one. After all, no one has ever identified a number which, when multiplied by itself, yields -1 as a result, so how could the square root exist. And yet, this result kept reappearing in problems, over and over again. Today, the square root of -1, commonly notated as i, forms the basis for complex numbers, which in turn have countless applications in science and engineering.This book provides a detailed survey of the history of this “imaginary” number and the mathematics that make use of it, as well as an exploration of some of the applications that make use of this “complex” concept. While the narrative portions of the book are sufficient to gain a general appreciation for this history, much of the book is given over to mathematical derivations and proofs, which require the user to have a solid foundation in trigonometry and calculus to follow. There is enough reasonably heavy mathematics here to require significant effort by the reader to follow all the details. (While my education included sufficient math, I have used little of it for more than two decades, so that I found myself largely unwilling to exert the effort necessary to follow all the formulas.) So, while this book does provide interesting historical context for complex numbers, it is pretty clearly not a book that is going to appeal to those without a sufficient grasp of the mathematics, which limits the audience significantly. However, for those who can work through the math, it promises to shed light on the math that so much of our science and engineering uses routinely."
36,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7188699-abhaga,4,"Lot's of mathematics, brilliant calculations and in depth history. Paul J Nahin is extremely well versed in the history of mathematics and covers even far flung corners of it. But at the same time, he is not averse to adopting modern approaches to the solution of problems if they make more sense, rather that pedantically sticking to the original.Most of the maths books introduce i starting with the equation x2+1=0 as if that is the most obvious thing in the world and mathematicians came across it and started building on it. The most interesting part of the book is where we see the earliest encounters of i and how various mathematicians dealt with it, some ignoring it, some using it cautiously while remaining perplexed and others boldly going where no one had gone before. It was a struggle of hundreds of years after which mathematicians were comfortable enough with the idea to start using it like any other tool.There is one whole chapter dedicated to show what all Euler did with complex numbers. His work is often concerned with specific problems and he was a master of symbolic manipulation and pulling mathematical tricks out of his hat. Shortly after him, mathematics started getting more formal with Gauss, Cauchy, Dirichlet and Riemann. I feel more of him in our mathematics book will make them much more lively! His computation of infinite summation of inverse squares is breathtaking.It's a shame that only one more book from Paul has an Indian edition. Now keeping an eye for old library copies to make their way to Amazon. :)"
37,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"I want to love this book, but I am currently well below the ability required for the last three chapters. I could have used a warning about how advanced this would get. I expected post-Algebra 2, maybe a little bit of Calculus, not Actively Considering a Graduate Degree.In fact, this book could be split into an 'easy' history section, followed by a much harder, post calculus 2, introduction to complex analysis required section.

The square root of 1, for example, is 1 because 1x1=1. But the square root of -1 seems impossible to figure, because the only way to get to -1 is to multiply two different numbers together. A negative number multiplied by another negative number leaves a positive number, not a negative one. At some point, mathematicians decided that there would be a square root of -1, and it would just be a 1 that was on another ""axis"" than the regular positive-negative line. But since the number didn't seem to have any real-world analogue like positive and negative numbers did, it somehow got hung with the tag, ""imaginary."" So today we say that the square root of negative 1 is i. The square root of -4 is 2i, and so on.Retired electrical engineering professor Paul Nahin outlines some of the development of i through the history of mathematics in An Imaginary Tale. Some early cultures refused to acknowledge the existence of a quantity that could be squared to form a negative number, and even into the Renaissance and enlightenment years the so-called ""imaginary"" numbers were considered at best unimportant. They were not useful except in specialized cases and it seemed even mathematicians had reservations about dealing with numbers that didn't represent any real quantity.Today, i and its counterparts find widespread use in many areas of math, and the only reservations that seem to continue deal mostly with the use of the word ""imaginary."" Nahin explores how important i is in many fields of engineering, especially his own. This part of the book -- about the latter two-thirds -- is heavily laden with equations and formulas and is going to be beyond most non-mathematician or non-engineer readers. He probably would have had to lengthen the book considerably to bring that subject matter within the grasp of the lay reader, but that doesn't make the string of equations and engineering language any easier to navigate.

65,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241251-andrew,3,"For centuries, mathematicians have struggled to understand the meaning of the square root of negative one.

Today, the square root of -1, commonly notated as i, forms the basis for complex numbers, which in turn have countless applications in science and engineering.This book provides a detailed survey of the history of this “imaginary” number and the mathematics that make use of it, as well as an exploration of some of the applications that make use of this “complex” concept.

Paul J Nahin is extremely well versed in the history of mathematics and covers even far flung corners of it. But at the same time, he is not averse to adopting modern approaches to the solution of problems if they make more sense, rather that pedantically sticking to the original.Most of the maths books introduce i starting with the equation x2+1=0 as if that is the most obvious thing in the world and mathematicians came across it and started building on it. The most interesting part of the book is where we see the earliest encounters of i and how various mathematicians dealt with it, some ignoring it, some using it cautiously while remaining perplexed and others boldly going where no one had gone before. It was a struggle of hundreds of years after which mathematicians were comfortable enough with the idea to start using it like any other tool.There is one whole chapter dedicated to show what all Euler did with complex numbers. His work is often concerned with specific problems and he was a master of symbolic manipulation and pulling mathematical tricks out of his hat. Shortly after him, mathematics started getting more formal with Gauss, Cauchy, Dirichlet and Riemann. I feel more of him in our mathematics book will make them much more lively! His computation of infinite summation of inverse squares is breathtaking.It's a shame that only one more book from Paul has an Indian edition.

124,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19658976-brett-t,2,"Of all the people who probably hide their heads at the goofs they have made, the person who named ""imaginary"" numbers is probably among them as far as the field of mathematics is concerned.So-called ""imaginary"" numbers describe the square roots of negative numbers, which are impossible to calculate using plain integers. The square root of 1, for example, is 1 because 1x1=1. But the square root of -1 seems impossible to figure, because the only way to get to -1 is to multiply two different numbers together. A negative number multiplied by another negative number leaves a positive number, not a negative one. At some point, mathematicians decided that there would be a square root of -1, and it would just be a 1 that was on another ""axis"" than the regular positive-negative line. But since the number didn't seem to have any real-world analogue like positive and negative numbers did, it somehow got hung with the tag, ""imaginary."" So today we say that the square root of negative 1 is i. The square root of -4 is 2i, and so on.Retired electrical engineering professor Paul Nahin outlines some of the development of i through the history of mathematics in An Imaginary Tale. Some early cultures refused to acknowledge the existence of a quantity that could be squared to form a negative number, and even into the Renaissance and enlightenment years the so-called ""imaginary"" numbers were considered at best unimportant. They were not useful except in specialized cases and it seemed even mathematicians had reservations about dealing with numbers that didn't represent any real quantity.Today, i and its counterparts find widespread use in many areas of math, and the only reservations that seem to continue deal mostly with the use of the word ""imaginary."" Nahin explores how important i is in many fields of engineering, especially his own. This part of the book -- about the latter two-thirds -- is heavily laden with equations and formulas and is going to be beyond most non-mathematician or non-engineer readers. He probably would have had to lengthen the book considerably to bring that subject matter within the grasp of the lay reader, but that doesn't make the string of equations and engineering language any easier to navigate. Original available here."
125,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241251-andrew,3,"For centuries, mathematicians have struggled to understand the meaning of the square root of negative one. After all, no one has ever identified a number which, when multiplied by itself, yields -1 as a result, so how could the square root exist. And yet, this result kept reappearing in problems, over and over again. Today, the square root of -1, commonly notated as i, forms the basis for complex numbers, which in turn have countless applications in science and engineering.This book provides a detailed survey of the history of this “imaginary” number and the mathematics that make use of it, as well as an exploration of some of the applications that make use of this “complex” concept. While the narrative portions of the book are sufficient to gain a general appreciation for this history, much of the book is given over to mathematical derivations and proofs, which require the user to have a solid foundation in trigonometry and calculus to follow. There is enough reasonably heavy mathematics here to require significant effort by the reader to follow all the details. (While my education included sufficient math, I have used little of it for more than two decades, so that I found myself largely unwilling to exert the effort necessary to follow all the formulas.) So, while this book does provide interesting historical context for complex numbers, it is pretty clearly not a book that is going to appeal to those without a sufficient grasp of the mathematics, which limits the audience significantly. However, for those who can work through the math, it promises to shed light on the math that so much of our science and engineering uses routinely."

The square root of 1, for example, is 1 because 1x1=1. But the square root of -1 seems impossible to figure, because the only way to get to -1 is to multiply two different numbers together. A negative number multiplied by another negative number leaves a positive number, not a negative one. At some point, mathematicians decided that there would be a square root of -1, and it would just be a 1 that was on another ""axis"" than the regular positive-negative line. But since the number didn't seem to have any real-world analogue like positive and negative numbers did, it somehow got hung with the tag, ""imaginary."" So today we say that the square root of negative 1 is i. The square root of -4 is 2i, and so on.Retired electrical engineering professor Paul Nahin outlines some of the development of i through the history of mathematics in An Imaginary Tale. Some early cultures refused to acknowledge the existence of a quantity that could be squared to form a negative number, and even into the Renaissance and enlightenment years the so-called ""imaginary"" numbers were considered at best unimportant. They were not useful except in specialized cases and it seemed even mathematicians had reservations about dealing with numbers that didn't represent any real quantity.Today, i and its counterparts find widespread use in many areas of math, and the only reservations that seem to continue deal mostly with the use of the word ""imaginary."" Nahin explores how important i is in many fields of engineering, especially his own. This part of the book -- about the latter two-thirds -- is heavily laden with equations and formulas and is going to be beyond most non-mathematician or non-engineer readers. He probably would have had to lengthen the book considerably to bring that subject matter within the grasp of the lay reader, but that doesn't make the string of equations and engineering language any easier to navigate.

214,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19658976-brett-t,2,"Of all the people who probably hide their heads at the goofs they have made, the person who named ""imaginary"" numbers is probably among them as far as the field of mathematics is concerned.So-called ""imaginary"" numbers describe the square roots of negative numbers, which are impossible to calculate using plain integers. The square root of 1, for example, is 1 because 1x1=1. But the square root of -1 seems impossible to figure, because the only way to get to -1 is to multiply two different numbers together. A negative number multiplied by another negative number leaves a positive number, not a negative one. At some point, mathematicians decided that there would be a square root of -1, and it would just be a 1 that was on another ""axis"" than the regular positive-negative line. But since the number didn't seem to have any real-world analogue like positive and negative numbers did, it somehow got hung with the tag, ""imaginary."" So today we say that the square root of negative 1 is i. The square root of -4 is 2i, and so on.Retired electrical engineering professor Paul Nahin outlines some of the development of i through the history of mathematics in An Imaginary Tale. Some early cultures refused to acknowledge the existence of a quantity that could be squared to form a negative number, and even into the Renaissance and enlightenment years the so-called ""imaginary"" numbers were considered at best unimportant. They were not useful except in specialized cases and it seemed even mathematicians had reservations about dealing with numbers that didn't represent any real quantity.Today, i and its counterparts find widespread use in many areas of math, and the only reservations that seem to continue deal mostly with the use of the word ""imaginary."" Nahin explores how important i is in many fields of engineering, especially his own. This part of the book -- about the latter two-thirds -- is heavily laden with equations and formulas and is going to be beyond most non-mathematician or non-engineer readers. He probably would have had to lengthen the book considerably to bring that subject matter within the grasp of the lay reader, but that doesn't make the string of equations and engineering language any easier to navigate.

After all, no one has ever identified a number which, when multiplied by itself, yields -1 as a result, so how could the square root exist. And yet, this result kept reappearing in problems, over and over again. Today, the square root of -1, commonly notated as i, forms the basis for complex numbers, which in turn have countless applications in science and engineering.This book provides a detailed survey of the history of this “imaginary” number and the mathematics that make use of it, as well as an exploration of some of the applications that make use of this “complex” concept. While the narrative portions of the book are sufficient to gain a general appreciation for this history, much of the book is given over to mathematical derivations and proofs, which require the user to have a solid foundation in trigonometry and calculus to follow. There is enough reasonably heavy mathematics here to require significant effort by the reader to follow all the details. (While my education included sufficient math, I have used little of it for more than two decades, so that I found myself largely unwilling to exert the effort necessary to follow all the formulas.) So, while this book does provide interesting historical context for complex numbers, it is pretty clearly not a book that is going to appeal to those without a sufficient grasp of the mathematics, which limits the audience significantly.

272,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68478217-anis-jerimy,5,"A amazing book covering all aspects of complex numbers from the very beginning, then the geometric interpretation of complex arithmetic is presented in details. The book also treats the application of complex number in electrical engineering and demonstrating Kepler fundamental laws, the gamma and zeta function are explained thoroughly too.... And finally an introduction to complex analysis... You need just high school level in math to enjoy this fabulous masterpiece"
273,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,4,The best book on i.
274,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19658976-brett-t,2,"Of all the people who probably hide their heads at the goofs they have made, the person who named ""imaginary"" numbers is probably among them as far as the field of mathematics is concerned.So-called ""imaginary"" numbers describe the square roots of negative numbers, which are impossible to calculate using plain integers. The square root of 1, for example, is 1 because 1x1=1. But the square root of -1 seems impossible to figure, because the only way to get to -1 is to multiply two different numbers together. A negative number multiplied by another negative number leaves a positive number, not a negative one. At some point, mathematicians decided that there would be a square root of -1, and it would just be a 1 that was on another ""axis"" than the regular positive-negative line. But since the number didn't seem to have any real-world analogue like positive and negative numbers did, it somehow got hung with the tag, ""imaginary."" So today we say that the square root of negative 1 is i. The square root of -4 is 2i, and so on.Retired electrical engineering professor Paul Nahin outlines some of the development of i through the history of mathematics in An Imaginary Tale. Some early cultures refused to acknowledge the existence of a quantity that could be squared to form a negative number, and even into the Renaissance and enlightenment years the so-called ""imaginary"" numbers were considered at best unimportant. They were not useful except in specialized cases and it seemed even mathematicians had reservations about dealing with numbers that didn't represent any real quantity.Today, i and its counterparts find widespread use in many areas of math, and the only reservations that seem to continue deal mostly with the use of the word ""imaginary."" Nahin explores how important i is in many fields of engineering, especially his own. This part of the book -- about the latter two-thirds -- is heavily laden with equations and formulas and is going to be beyond most non-mathematician or non-engineer readers. He probably would have had to lengthen the book considerably to bring that subject matter within the grasp of the lay reader, but that doesn't make the string of equations and engineering language any easier to navigate. Original available here."
275,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241251-andrew,3,"For centuries, mathematicians have struggled to understand the meaning of the square root of negative one. After all, no one has ever identified a number which, when multiplied by itself, yields -1 as a result, so how could the square root exist. And yet, this result kept reappearing in problems, over and over again. Today, the square root of -1, commonly notated as i, forms the basis for complex numbers, which in turn have countless applications in science and engineering.This book provides a detailed survey of the history of this “imaginary” number and the mathematics that make use of it, as well as an exploration of some of the applications that make use of this “complex” concept. While the narrative portions of the book are sufficient to gain a general appreciation for this history, much of the book is given over to mathematical derivations and proofs, which require the user to have a solid foundation in trigonometry and calculus to follow. There is enough reasonably heavy mathematics here to require significant effort by the reader to follow all the details. (While my education included sufficient math, I have used little of it for more than two decades, so that I found myself largely unwilling to exert the effort necessary to follow all the formulas.) So, while this book does provide interesting historical context for complex numbers, it is pretty clearly not a book that is going to appeal to those without a sufficient grasp of the mathematics, which limits the audience significantly. However, for those who can work through the math, it promises to shed light on the math that so much of our science and engineering uses routinely."
276,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7188699-abhaga,4,"Lot's of mathematics, brilliant calculations and in depth history. Paul J Nahin is extremely well versed in the history of mathematics and covers even far flung corners of it. But at the same time, he is not averse to adopting modern approaches to the solution of problems if they make more sense, rather that pedantically sticking to the original.Most of the maths books introduce i starting with the equation x2+1=0 as if that is the most obvious thing in the world and mathematicians came across it and started building on it. The most interesting part of the book is where we see the earliest encounters of i and how various mathematicians dealt with it, some ignoring it, some using it cautiously while remaining perplexed and others boldly going where no one had gone before. It was a struggle of hundreds of years after which mathematicians were comfortable enough with the idea to start using it like any other tool.There is one whole chapter dedicated to show what all Euler did with complex numbers. His work is often concerned with specific problems and he was a master of symbolic manipulation and pulling mathematical tricks out of his hat. Shortly after him, mathematics started getting more formal with Gauss, Cauchy, Dirichlet and Riemann. I feel more of him in our mathematics book will make them much more lively! His computation of infinite summation of inverse squares is breathtaking.It's a shame that only one more book from Paul has an Indian edition. Now keeping an eye for old library copies to make their way to Amazon. :)"
277,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"I want to love this book, but I am currently well below the ability required for the last three chapters. I could have used a warning about how advanced this would get. I expected post-Algebra 2, maybe a little bit of Calculus, not Actively Considering a Graduate Degree.In fact, this book could be split into an 'easy' history section, followed by a much harder, post calculus 2, introduction to complex analysis required section. I just got lost in the all of the supposedly straight-forward integrations and lost the point of the text. Some of the results appeared interesting, but I have no idea what they meant! I was especially frustrated in chapters six and seven, where the author repeatedly stated that the current problem requires the reader to accept as true theorems which will be demonstrated in the next section/chapter. Really? You can' trust provide the proofs in order? Would it have been that hard to start with Green's Theorem and then prove Cauchy's First Integration Theorem and THEN prove Cauchy's first result? The math was hard enough without it being backwards!However, this book has encouraged me to work through a text on complex analysis, if only so I can come back to this, go through the end, and NOT feel like an imbecile. "
278,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,4,"When I went to the Cincinnati Public Library web site to request An Imaginary Tale, it was checked out, so I had to put a hold on it. For this and other reasons I thought this would be a ""popular history"" book, with some equations scattered throughout. I was right about the content but wrong about the mix: An Imaginary Tale is about half history and half mathematics textbook. I found this book reminding me of a lot of math that I had mostly forgotten, since I am very seldom called upon to do contour integrals these days. It also filled me in on some math I had never seen, such as the gem that, ""...1^pi -- a real number to a real power -- has an infinity of distinct complex values..."" Mind: blown. Pick up this book only if double integrals, circuit diagrams, and plots in the complex plane won't cause you to break out in a cold sweat. Oh, and that hold on the book? I have renewed it twice now with no issues, so clearly there are only two people in the greater Cincinnati area reading such books for fun. "
279,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4764429-liz,2,"I read this with the thought that it would be a history of imaginary numbers (it was) and their applications (ehhhh). The author starts out with an intro that says any student who has taken high school calculus should be able to follow the math of the book. Definitely not. I mean, I could have followed the included calculations but I chose not to because it was simply unnecessary to show the entire derivation of formulas. Tell me ABOUT them and where they came from. That's what I was hoping this book would be. Maybe it's unfair to judge a book on what you wanted it to be, but. Here we are. Too calculation heavy, I wanted more history and DESCRIPTIONS of applications. Although I did learn enough to be able to give my students a bit more background on complex numbers when we get to them. "
280,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik,3,"Lots of fun, written by an electrical engineer, and correspondingly practical in its outlook. Excellent worked examples and excellent history all the way up to Euler, Wessel and Cauchy. There is one serious oversight which is the lack of attention to the important connection between algebra (i.e. of rotations and geometric extensions) and complex numbers. Indeed these days the 'i' part of a complex number is just a directed bivector. Hamilton is mentioned in a brief few pages, without even a mention of the Brougham Bridge equations, Clifford not at all and Grassmann not at all. Also the 'ict' is dispensable in relativity, contrary to what the author says."
281,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4038792-rick,5,"I will admit to having to read this three times. I will also admit that when I was first introduced to ""i"" in high school I closed my text and turned my back on the teacher. What compelled me here was the growing realization that, however counter-intuitive the square root of negative one may be, it appears again and again in apparently dissimilar contexts as the only way to a practical solution for certain problems. Or to put it as the author does, we have to move from the real through the imaginary in order to return to the real. I like being forced to see something that was obscure to me before. This book definitely did that."
282,0691127980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26715035-goldstein,1,"If you don't have a great mathematical mind, but care about math, this is a massively difficult text.His claim that you can read it with basic math skills is at best a delusion. Every page seems to have at least 2 math problems and I couldn't figure out even what I didn't know about the problems by the third chapter (not the full third chapter)So, I have given up on this book until my skills in calculus and algebraic proofs are about 10 to 100 times better."

I learned a lot, but this is really not the kind of thing I want to be reading in my downtime these days, so it was hard to get through it.
