0,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"To any Young Earth Creationist who happens to be reading this reviewFirst, thank you for getting this far. It's to your credit: you're willing to find out something about what the other side has to say. You're probably expecting I'll tell you to read Dawkins's latest book. In fact, I'm not going to do that. Don't read this book. Dawkins is disrespectful and arrogant about Young Earth Creationism, and he will only annoy you. Instead, I suggest that you might want to look at Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. When Darwin wrote it, pretty much everyone in the world was a Young Earth Creationist. Darwin had a great deal of sympathy for the Creationist position, and one of his own favorite books, which influenced him deeply, was the Creationist classic Natural Theology, by William Paley. Despite all this, Darwin found arguments which soon convinced a large part of his audience that their ideas about Young Earth Creationism were wrong.Dawkins continually quotes Darwin. He shows that even though Darwin didn't understand how evolution works - no one knew about DNA yet, or even the basics of genetic theory - the evidence at his disposal produced an overwhelming case that evolution must be the the root cause of the huge diversity of observed species. The clearest and most unanswerable part of the argument is the geographical distribution of the different kinds of animals. Just stop and think for a moment about the single fact that sloths are only to be found in South America. If the story of the Biblical Flood were true, then those slow-moving, tree-dwelling sloths would somehow have had to migrate from Mount Ararat to Brazil in a few thousand years, leaving no colonies anywhere en route. Darwin's Victorian audience thought carefully about the sloths, and could not find a sensible answer. It was even more impossible for them to explain, not just that kangaroos only exist in Australia, but that many similar species - wallabies, koalas, wombats and other marsupials - also only exist in Australia. There were a thousand more pieces of evidence, and they gave up. Darwin did not try to humiliate them, and he honestly admitted that there were important parts of the story he did not yet understand. Even with those provisos, the case was unanswerable. Since Darwin's time, nearly all of the missing parts of his argument have been filled in, as Dawkins explains here. But that's less important. As I said, start with Darwin. He's writing politely and respectfully for people like you, who are skeptical about evolution and want to be shown good reasons to believe it, and he is remarkably convincing. "
1,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1212747-a-j,4,"There's a general feeling out there about Richard Dawkins that he's a little too shrill, a little too hard on people, and perhaps a tad too full of himself. I've had a couple of these thoughts from time to time, though not the last one, and would almost catch myself nodding in agreement until I put myself in the man's shoes. Professor Dawkins is brilliant with a capital B. He is fanatically devoted to science and his particular subject, evolutionary biology. He has spent his life researching and exploring the elegant mysteries and pathways of life on our lonely blue world. And what does he get in return? 44% of Americans––granted he's British––think that the earth and everything in it was specially created about ten thousand years ago, that man roamed the earth with dinosaurs, and that the whole of biology and evolutionary history are to be supplanted by a fairy tale about a couple of teenagers who were convinced by a talking snake to eat an enchanted apple. This state of affairs would be repugnant enough if it was a privately held fantasy; instead what Dawkins gets is constant bombardment from imbeciles who want creation 'science' 'theory' taught alongside evolution in schools, as if there was some competition between the two. By air, land, sea, or Trojan Horse (Intelligent Design, so called), biologists are incessantly having to deal with misrepresentation and ignorance on a profound and disturbing scale.I personally, however, can't be too harsh. Not only was I once a creationist; I was the worst kind of creationist, a young earth creationist. Not only was I a young earth creationist; I was the worst sort of young earth creationist, a Kent Hovindiite. I was to science was the Philistines were to the Hebrews, what the Empire was to the Rebellion, what that kid with down syndrome is to Einstein. What I can do, though, is say with complete certainty is that education, not argument, is the antidote to creationism. Ignorance isn't a crime, and usually people aren't ignorant on purpose. For your average layman, it's not his fault that science education standards are so poor, or that lying snake oil salesmen like Ken Ham successfully peddle bullshit for a living.Having considered all that, I'm fairly convinced that your typical creationist response to this book will be a glassy stare and a trickle of drool. Part of this will be the enormous amount of nonsense, misrepresentations, misunderstandings, outdated arguments, falsehoods, and outright lies that have until now occupied the six inches of space between their ears. Trying to explain the complexities of biology to someone who thinks that Big Bang Cosmology is 'darwinism' is a higher mountain than Dawkins book is likely able to climb. A lot of bad wiring had to be completely redone even for me to follow the major themes of this book, and I've put a lot of effort into it. The second drawback is a personal weakness of Dawkins' writing. It's unfocussed, not particularly well organized, and it lacks the ferocious punch of amateur youtubers like Thunderf00t and Aronra (whose video series 'The Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism' is balls-out awesome). Granted, the history of life on our planet and all the myriad means that we have of understanding it is not a topic suited to one book. I still maintain that the chapters could have been better ordered and more centered around a particular point, as opposed to the more conversational sprawl that is Dawkins' style. I find him a better speaker-communicator than writer-communicator, but a better writer than orator, if that makes any sense. Despite that, I appreciate the effort, passion, and the expertise that Professor Dawkins brings to this book. It is in its way a powerful examination of this subject, and riddled with amazing discoveries and evidences that while they only manage to show a fragment of the deluge that is the evidence for evolution, still enriches the mind and helps non-scientists to explore the wonders of the natural world.""Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact...That didn't have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn't. It didn't have to be true, but it is....Evolution is the only game in town, the greatest show on earth."""
2,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424509-diana,2,"Two disclaimers before I begin my review:1. I am an atheist.2. I am a molecular biologist.So, I am clearly not the target audience. That being said, I really wanted to like this book. I am so happy that there are people out there who are speaking out in defense of evolution and (although not in this book) atheism, and as such I want to support Richard Dawkins. However, the best way I can sum up my feelings about the book is to say that it resembles a very long version of an undergraduate's final paper on evolution. Many arguments are not at all clear or well made, the diagram labeling is irregular or completely non-existent, and he does not seem to grasp how to effectively use figures to add to the text. He contradicts himself at least once (but pretty majorly), but it seems that this is due more to a faulty simplification of the scientific explanation that to a lack of knowledge. Ultimately, that's what it comes down to for me: all of the faults I found in the book should not have been there, because I KNOW that HE KNOWS BETTER. Not to mention that his goal would have been better served had he saved all of his half-assed, baseless speculations for beers with the fellas and used the space in the book to include more evidence for evolution. For example, one thing he did not address at all is morality/altruism, which would have been very relevant for creationists (who ARE his target audience) and for which there are some really interesting theories. Finally, while I understand the frustration, condescending anger is not generally a great tool for convincing people, regardless of how wrong they are."
3,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879634-maria,5,"With the help of drawings, photos, cartoons, tables, diagrams & notes, an emphasis on extremely lucid step-by-step explanations, examples, iteration & reiteration & plenty of humor, R Dawkins shows that we are indeed so lucky to be witness to the Greatest Show on Earth -- this wonderful book is addressed not only to those interested in our natural world (and who'll maybe wish they'd majored in biology) but more particularly to the creationists and proponents of ""intelligent design"" -- as evidence for evolution it's one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. It's a beautifully detailed and concisely written effort (albeit a bit repetitious at times) that's full of extraordinary facts both serious and silly, a real experience. It's TERRIBLY witty. It filled me with joy. It should be read by everyone everywhere. "
4,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67532575-kevin-shepherd,5,"I can not emphasize enough how much I admire and respect Richard Dawkins. His books are veritable university courses on biology, anthropology and natural history, this one is no exception. If there's a knock on The Greatest Show On Earth, it's that you cannot read it when you're tired or sleepy. Richard is so passionate about his vocation that he sometimes forgets that some of us don't have his stamina, much less his vocabulary.Dawkins excels at anticipating counter arguments, probably because he hears them frequently, and he is quick to offer rock solid scientific evidence to bolster his bullet points. He also has a knack for coming at issues from various angles. Just when you think two pages of zoology have sufficiently put a topic to rest: BAM! here comes a paragraph of chemistry for good measure. This is what I love about Dawkins. He is adamantly opposed to ignorance. This is not a tome for the obtuse or faint of heart. This is a study in academic truth."
5,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"An educational masterpiece of popular science, this is a brilliant, riveting page-turner written with eloquence, passion and competence.I am almost embarrassed to admit that I waited until now to read this shining book, which comprises so many themes in disparate but related areas in the realms of biology, anthropology, natural history, molecular chemistry and, of course, evolution theory.I am at a real loss to express how rewarding this reading experience has proved to be: after only 10% of the book I would not have hesitated to very highly recommend it to anybody interested in how life has evolved on this Planet. And, after less than 20% of the book, I was completely hooked: yes, many items discussed by Dawkins are public common knowledge, but the author puts everything all beautifully and passionately together in a riveting, compelling and highly coherent narrative that does not fail to illustrate the beauty and the unmatched thrill of the process of scientific inquiry. In particular, the case for evolution is proved with such an overwhelming overabundance of highly converging evidence, that only the most blinkered stupidity or close-mindedness can enable anybody to still promote a Creationist ideology in 2019. Some reviewers have criticized the barbed witticism and the occasionally acerbic attacks on Creationism carried out by the author in a sustained and forceful manner. I personally think these criticisms are unwarranted, and I actually found that Dawkins is always well justified and quite balanced and moderate in his approach: in this world of political correctness, too many people are scared to call a spade a spade and I think that the sheer obtuseness, stupidity and ignorance that pervade many anti-science Creationist attitudes should be named and denounced for what they are and for the danger that they represent to the future of the next generations. Dawkins' disdain for Creationism and its fundamental ideological opposition to science, and for its ""counter-arguments"" to evolution theory, is always completely warranted.Actually, i would have loved to see Dawkins highlight more explicitly how science is an integrated, coherent, cross-sustaining whole, similar to a gigantic epistemological crossword, and that you can't just pick and choose only the parts that do not conflict with your own religious or philosophical prejudices. This is precisely why climate change deniers, or ""history-deniers"" (using the apt term adopted by Dawkins to define Creationists) are not just dangerous for their own misguided ""theories"", but also because they implicitly jeopardize the position and progress of science ""in toto"". It is ironic that, given such an undeniable successes of modern science, even staunch Creationists hesitate to carry out a frontal attack on science, as some of them have at least some residual sense of ridicule: they prefer instead to promote pseudo-scientific misconceptions, (ab)using scientific terminology, or to promote the suggestion (like in the case of climate change) that the scientific community is divided on the issue. These attempts are as dangerous as any frontal explicit attack on science. Similarly dangerous, and similarly cowardly in their attempt to disguise the underlying ideology, are some of the s0-called ""academic freedom"" bills, which permit teachers to introduce creationist material into science classes. Science, truth and the natural world could not give a fig about the delusional ravings of ideologically inspired legislators: Nature is what it is, regardless of how we wish it to be. And Creationism, which has the same scientific credentials as Harry Potter, simply does not belong in a science class. However, having said all of this, I would not want to convey the incorrect impression that this book is mainly aimed at polemical aims: on the contrary, all arguments are presented in a coherent, lucid, highly informative and very persuasive way, and the elements of criticism are more than balanced by the book's constructive side, as the author has a real gift for lucidly treating some not-so-straightforward topics in a way any layman with a modicum of prior scientific education can very easily understand. The last chapter of the book is very sobering, illustrating how almost half the Americans (42%, according to a 2008 poll) reject evolution and believe that the Universe, the Earth and all current forms of life were created less than 10,000 years ago. Sadly, things cannot have improved much since, especially in the sad spectacle represented by today's post-truth and anti-science Trump's America, and this is all the reason to publish and promote books by the likes of Dawkins (the real solution would be to fundamentally overhaul and rebuild the public educational system, as there must be something terribly wrong and dysfunctional in a system that generates a population of which half believe in a ""Young Earth"" - but this is a different subject, I guess).Totally recommended, this book should be made compulsory reading in all high schools. 5 stars.PS: a couple of quotes from the book:- it would be nice if those who oppose evolution would take a tiny bit of trouble to learn the merest rudiments of what it is that they are opposing- (as a consequence of the Young Earth Creationist views)  stars whose distance from us is more than a few thousand light years must have been created with ready-made light beams stretching almost all the way to us  "
6,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"What a stunning read. I have read several books by Dawkins, mostly concerning evolution, and I think this was the easiest to understand. This is partly because I skipped the most difficult bits! For instance I am never going to know how carbon dating is done - but I can live with that. For the most part the book was hugely readable and deeply fascinating. The one thing that marred my pleasure slightly was the stress throughout on proving the theory of evolution to creationists, but then he would give us the statistics about how many creationists there are in the world......and his preoccupation became understandable.I will end with some notes of the delights I found in the book - most of them taken verbatim from the book. (view spoiler)[
  *GENESThese don't mix like paint (which would create a middling average half way between our two parents....and if it did, all variation would rapidly disappear.) Instead genes passing on is like the shuffling and re-shuffling of a card pack. Genes don't blend, they shuffle. You could say they are shuffled badly, with groups of cards sticking together for several generations of shuffling, before chance happens to split them.Any one of your eggs (or sperms if you are male) contains either your father's version of a particular gene or your mother's version, not a blend of the two. And that particular gene came from one (& only one) of your four grandparents, and from one (& only one) of your eight grandparents.* GENE POOLSThese are created in environments of all different shapes, sizes and outlook. Islands, valleys surrounded by mountains which animals can't cross, areas of a certain climate etc. Gene pools are sculpted when humans interfere, eg when dog breeders breed bulldogs to encourage certain attributes.* HYBRIDSThis involves a deliberate violation of the gene pool....eg the Labradoodle is a hybrid between a standard poodle and a Labrador retriever.Some people are trying to breed labradoodles directly with other labradoodles, and to get them to breed true. At present second generation labradoodles recombine to produce more variety than pre-bred dogs are supposed to show. This is how many 'pure' breeds started - they went through an intermediate stage of high variation, subsequently trimmed down through generations of careful breeding, so that a proper purebreed began to regularly appear.*A SINGLE MAJOR MUTATIONSometimes new breeds of dogs get their start with the adoption of a single major mutation. In nature large mutations seldom survive eg basset hounds and dachshunds with very short legs acquired them in a singe step with the genetic mutation called achondroplasia, a classic example of a large mutation unlikely to survive in the wild. *BREEDING FOR SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES AND TALENTSFor instance dogs that can herd sheep, race, or pull sledges, or even 'point'. We could do the same for human beings too - though ethically this could pose a problem...........................................................................WAYS OF MEASURING TIME........*DENDROCHRONOLOGY - THE STUDY OF TREE RINGS.Tree rings show whether it was a good lush year or a year of drought. These form into recognisable patterns eg a bunch of trees living between 1950 - 1970 will share the same patterns of drought and plenty for that period. You can overlap tree rings this way, and create a library of tree rings going back through history eg.Tree 1 1950 - 2016Tree 2 1930 - 1990 With tree 2, you have as a reference the patterns laid down with tree 1, from 1950 - 1990, so you can work out that the earlier rings in tree 2 make a pattern for 1930-1950. You can do the same thing with trees 3 and 4.....steadily going further back through history with each tree. This way dendrochronoligists can date trees back over thousands of years, (theoretically it should work back over millions of years. You don't have to cut a tree down to measure its rings, you can just take a plug from the tree.*THE SEDIMENT IN GLACIAL LAKES (VARVES)This lays down strata from season to season, and year to year.*CORAL REEFSThis has annual growth rings, like trees.*RADIOACTIVE CLOCKS	1) There are a lot of them to choose from2) They cover time from centuries to thousands of millions of years.3) They have a margin of error of 1%4) Layers or strata of rock get their names from the fossils we find in them.CumbrianOrdovicianSilurianDevonianCarboniferousPermianTriassicJurassicCretaceousEtc.and you get sub-categories eg Upper Jurassic, Middle Jurassic and Lower Jurassic.5) You can use radioactive dating of rocks to place a date on them.Carbon is the element most indispensable to life - it enters the food web via photosynthesis in plants and from then on to living creatures.Carbon dating is the most common form of dating. It was invented in the 1940s. It tells us that the earth is 4.6 billions years old.....................................................................*CONSERVAPEDIAThe notoriously misleading imitation of Wikipedia, It has a creationist editor - a lawyer called Andrew Schlafly.*SPEED OF EVOLUTIONThis can be slow or fast. The former is illustrated by Limulus (the horseshoe crab), which is sometimes called a living fossil. The latter is illustrated by bacterial strains, which have with great speed evolved a resistance to antibiotics.*THE MISSING LINKThis has several meanings.1) Gaps in the fossil record - eras shown in rock strata where there were no fossils. This is because the animals around then were not good fossil material, for instance they didn't have hard, mineralized skeletons.2) The Piltdown HoaxMany people were seeking a link between man and other primates. Eventually someone 'found' Piltdown Man - but it was a hoax. In the intervening time since the hoax we have found numerous fossils that link modern humans to the common ancestor we share with chimpanzees. Interestingly there are as yet no fossils - as yet - linking that ancestor (which was neither chimpanzee nor human) to modern chimpanzees....but there are other ways of proving our connection to chimps.* OUT OF THE SEAAll animals originated in the sea, and some, like whales, manatees and dugongs went back into the water. They never developed gills, and still breathe air. Others like seals and sea lions went part way back to the sea.Hippos are quite closely related to whales, or at least to the ancestor of whales who walked on the land. Pigs are related to them too.The most recent ancestor of all fish is shared by many non-fish too. Humans and other land vertebrates are descended from lobe-finned fish. We share an ancestor with coelacanthus and lungfish.*THE WAY WE BUILD OUR BODIES FROM EMBRYOSWe do not do this from a blueprint or some sort of instructions from an architectural design. We do it more organically, like the dance of a flock of starlings, swooping beautifully together, but without a leader. There are thousands of birds but they never collide. They behave as a single individual - wheeling and turning as one. The edges of the flocks are sharply defined. The density is the same throughout the flick, but the starlings have no choreographer and no leader. This is how embryology works.It is all done by local rules.It is done at various levels, but especially the level of a single cell.Influences that go on within the developing cells.....Genes on proteinsGenes on genesProteins on the expression of genesProteins on proteinsMembranesChemical gradientsPhysical and chemical guide rails in embryos.Hormones (& other mediators of action at a distance.)Labelled cells seeking other with identical or complementary labels.(Nobody understand the whole picture, and nobody needs to....)* HOMOLOGYThe study of how bones in mammals correspond across the species - however different they are eg comparing a human hand with a bat wing, or horse's hoof.* SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCEThe vertebrate skeleton is invariant across all vertebrates - while individual bones differ.The crustaceans exoskeleton is invariant across all crustaceans while the individual 'tubes' vary.The DNA code is invariant across all living creatures, while the individual genes themselves vary. Not just the genetic code itself, but the whole gene/protein system for running life is the same in animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, archaea and viruses. What varies is what is written in the code....not the code itself...........................................................WAYS OF TESTING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MAMMALS......*TESTING THE CLOSENESS/DISTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MAMMALS BY INJECTING RABBITS WITH PROTEINS AND INSPECTING THE STRENGTH OF THE ANTIBODIES PRODUCED IN RESPONSE.The idea of this upsets me so I am not going to describe it more than this, but I feel it must be mentioned as it is of importance...not least because it showed how closely humans are related to chimpanzees.DNA HYBRIDIZATIONAnother bit of the book I skipped. It is how scientists worked out there there is 98% genetic similarity between humans and chimpanzees. The technique involves heat and melting points.READING THE SEQUENCE OF LETTERS IN THE GENES THEMSELVESThis is a more recent method, and more expensive. You measure the similarity between a pair of matching genes from difference species.................................................................*THE HUMAN BODY IS A SERIES OF MODIFIED IMPERFECTIONSThis is a clear sign of the fact that we evolved. Improvements could only come about by making ad hoc modifications to what is already there. We are burdened with all sorts of historical relics, anomalies and inperfections.Interestingly, an improvement is quite likely to evolve not from the old organ which previously did a job, but from something completely different, which performed a completely different function....eg when our fish ancestors took to breathing air they didn't modify their gills to make a lung - instead they modified a pouch in the gut.*MANKIND HAS ONLY RECENTLY BECOME UPRIGHT.We have been land animals for about 400 million years. We have walked on our hind legs for only about 1% of that time.Habitually walking on two legs as we do, had far-reaching ramifications all over the body, which entailed lots of compensatory adjustments. the reason that so many of us get back pain is because we weren't originally designed to walk upright.*WHEN WE SEE THE OUTSIDE OF ANIMALS WE SEE ELEGANT DESIGN, WHEN WE SEE THEM DISSECTED WE SEE A MESS.This is because of the history of how our bodies have adapted to our changing shapes, lifestyles and postures.*THE ARMS RACEThe fastest animals in the world are cheetahs, lions and several species of antelope ie predators and their prey. They have both evolved to run very fast in relations to one another, one to pursue, one to escape. But nature knows when to stop. Increased speed creates thin, vulnerable legs....so there has been a cut off point, where further speed has been penalised. (Faster animals have not survived/bred.) Antelopes would not run as fast as they do were they not chased by fast predators, instead they would shunt more energy into making babies, or laying down more fat for the winter.*NATURAL SELECTION(To me this seems to contradict the paragraph above...)This will favour the most competitive individuals, right up to the moment when the last one dies. It can drive a population to extinction, whilst constantly favouring, to the bitter end, those competitive genes that are destined to be the last to go extinct.*NATURAL SELECTION AND GENE SURVIVALThis is all about the survival of self-replicating DNA, be it in an elephant, or in the virus that is making you sneeze with the common cold. The ultimate message is ""duplicate me"".

7,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin,5,"Richard Dawkins has taken his seat along with Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan as a great populist of science. In all of his science books and especially in The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence For Evolution, He has taken a complex subject and presented it with clarity to a population that usually gets lost in the seemingly foreign language of most scientists. Yet he does not ""dumb down"" neither. He has a gift for beautifully explaining difficult topics in a way a layman can understand. He saves his famous disdain, which was in abundant display in The God Delusion, for only when it is deserved. Much is made of Dawkins' supposed arrogance yet when he writes something that can be seen as arrogance, it is more of a sense of amazement that his fellow man can totally dismiss the evidence of evolution. There is a hilarious transcript of this in the book where Dawkins patiently sets out the evidence of intermediate fossils, and where this evidence can be seen, to a Creationist and the Creationist totally ignores it saying ""Show me the evidence"" like a mantra. Dawkins states he is aiming this book at the people who believe in creationism, which according to recent polls is 40 percent of the American population. I doubt that those people will give this book the time of day. Yet I also think that the 40 percent number includes a good number of people who on ""on the fence"" so to speak, those who simply haven't seen the evidence for evolution presented in such a clear and understandable manner. I think that is a reasonable audience for this book along with the ones, like me, who have a reasonable knowledge of evolution but wish to learn more. "

9,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1442466-kris-madaus,5,"Wow! This is definitely one of those books that makes you look at the world a little differently after reading. Richard Dawkins writes so well on the subject. He is extremely thorough in his description of the fact of evolution, but he doesn't dumb down his explanations either. If you are interested in a particular subject, he often references places you can go to continue the story. He paints a beautiful picture of how evolution really works and why that helps you appreciate this amazing world we live in just a little more.I won't get into some of the details he shares, but based on the facts that Dawkins reveals in his appendix about the exceedingly high percentage of people that believe in a creationist view, I thing every high school student should have to read this book. But it doesn't matter what you believe. The evidence shared in this book is fascinating. Long term lab experiments that shows us evolution before our very eyes, sea turtles that evolved from the sea to land to sea to land to sea again, our distant ancestor named the lungfish, how DNA and mitochondria are used to trace ancestors, the evidence for evolution across all branches of science - it is all simply intriguing.I appreciate people like Dawkins that can share such amazing things. I especially appreciate how he is more than willing to face creationists head on. If you don't believe in evolution, look at the evidence and then see if you feel the same way afterward - that is, if you are truly interested in answers to the big questions of life. You can say that Dawkins seems a bit aggressive in his books at times, but think about it this way. If you had a group of people constantly questioning questioning that the earth revolves around the sun, and you collected layers and layers of evidence to answer the question beyond reasonable doubt, but they still believe the sun revolved around the earth after all of the years of research, wouldn't you be a bit frustrated too? Dawkins is not only confronting creationists. He is confronting irrationality. Irrationality affects our quality of life. I commend Dawkins for saying enough is enough. He doesn't sugar coat the issue. He says is like it is.Excellent book!"

11,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2849443-catie,5,"Dawkins arguments for evolution are elegant and, in some cases, simply breath-taking. As a psychology professor myself, and as one who has had to contend with ""history deniers"" for years, I especially liked his description of Lenski's research on the evolution of bacteria. Although facts have always been denied by those who claim Intelligent Design as a valid explanation for all nature, Dawkins painstakingly and elegantly lays out unassailable facts in support of the theory of evolution. He stakes his claim early in the book (""...evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt....That said, I doubt seriouly that his book will challenge those who view evolution as only a theory, precisely because they would never open their minds to such a text as this!

12,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2113792-tag-riggs,2,"After reading this book, I quickly realized that it was targeted for a particular audience--the choir complete with holy robes and clapping hands shouting, ""...Preach it brother Dawkins, preach it my brother, Evolution AMEN!, Hallelujah!"" I honestly think that it is required that you be a Dawkinite and part of the Dawkins Tabernacle Choir in order for you to take this book seriously. I was fully expecting some kind of scientific treatise yet it ended up being like a bunch of guys on the dock laughing and drinking beer talking about how the big one got away. It is amazing how he comes forth in every chapter in bold declarative sentences without justifications or support (support other than being anomalous tautologies) to conclude in mealy mouthed suppositions and suggestions.I have done a chapter by chapter review on my Facebook page so if interested, you may look for my opinions over there. For a guy who claimed many books on evolution under his belt yet forgot to give evidence to all his previous ones until TGSOE (He even admits this), I am amazed at what people are willing to believe simply because someone says it to be thus. Dumbing down has reached a new low on this one. I cannot see how anyone who approaches the subject from a scholarly viewpoint can take this book seriously."

In 4 billion years we went from a single cell to a fully developed human, and now each of us has repreated it in the 9 months we are in the womb of our mother. The wonder of epigenisis without a blueprint!But the funniest part in it was his quote of Monty Pythons 'All things dull and ugly':All things dull and uglyAll creatures short and squatAll things rude and nastyThe Lord God made the lotEach little snake that poisonsEach little wasp that stingsHe made their brutish venomHe made their horrid wingsAll things sick and cancerousAll evil great and smallAll things foul and dangerousThe Lord God made them allEach nasty little hornetEach beastly little squidWho made the spiky urchin?Who made the sharks?

15,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7130641-cherie,5,"Richard Dawkins has crafted a masterpiece dedicated to explaining evolution in a way that the layman can understand, providing excellent examples of evidence from fossil evidence to observable evidence, genetic evidence, and so on. My personal favorite chapter was on the geographic distribution of animals and speciation. It is really like an extraordinary puzzle that fits together so beautifully. Richard Dawkins uses the detective analogy to describe the study of evolution. And I can't think of anything more fitting. Because of course we weren't there and we can't see macro evolution in action, but we can see the clues (evidence) left behind and see that evolution is indeed a fact of nature. I thought it was excellently paced. Richard Dawkins takes it slow at first, leading up from artificial and sexual selection to get the reader accustomed to the idea of natural selection. Then before he talks about fossil evidence he first makes sure the reader understands how dating methods work and how accurate they are. It's just fantastic, I learned so much and it was very interesting. Richard Dawkins writes with a passion and devotion that is difficult to understand for creationists. They ask how an atheist can be filled with awe and wonder with life if they believe it was all an accident. The answer is because nature in its entirety is chaotic and unusual... It's cruel and harsh, and very uncaring... But it's also beautiful and magnificent and completely fascinating. To say it all was created by a god is a mockery of the complexity that is shown in life. This should honestly be required reading. So many people lack a basic understanding of evolution or even a respect of science in general. I have already recommended this book to several friends and some creationists that I've debated, but I encourage everybody to read this at some point in their life. "
16,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,5,"I wish I'd had engaging and interesting texts like this to read when I had to take science classes in high school. I always wanted to like science so much, but I always got bogged down in minutae, in questions the text or teachers didn't address, and in the boredom of rote memorization. This book really made me like biology. Not only does it explain concepts in an intelligent and cohesive way, it has pictures! Color pictures, even. Much like the ones I stared at in biology or earth science instead of paragraphs of text. It absolutely engaged my visual approach to learning.I really enjoyed the way various bits of evidence for evolution were put forth, and weaved into other parts. This book has so much information beyond just the fossil record, it's awesome. Many disciplines of science, from paleontology to astronomy to genetics, are pulled in to all establish evidence for the evolutionary theory. And Richard Dawkins writes in such an engaging manner. I really enjoyed this one."
17,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"Oh, Dawkins. Tell me more of evolution, please. Speak to me of genes and their ways. Teach me things about the world. I could read this stuff for hours. I am endlessly fascinated and the more I understand of evolution, the more I am aware of how unbelievably lucky I am that I exist, that anything exists, that I can learn about it."
18,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51061124-bruce-hatton,5,"Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins is one of those rare scientists who is capable of addressing his specific area of science to the layperson (and I certainly am such – biology wasn’t even on the syllabus at my school) in a lucid and enlightening manner without ever having to “dumb down”. His unwavering enthusiasm for the subject is evident throughout, as is his often wicked sense of humour.This certainly isn’t a book one can rush through. However, I found a careful study revealed many of the wonders of evolution by natural selection and explained why there were so many “flawed designs” (including humans) as individual creatures very gradually adapted in order to survive changing environments.The reading process is helped enormously by plenty of illustrations, diagrams and some beautiful colour photographs. Each chapter had its own breathtaking revelations. Although it took me a while to get through, overall I found this an extremely enlightening and rewarding read."

In fact, Dawkins -who is notorious for his criticism of religion- goes on and lists a number of British #bishops and public figures who call for teaching of evolution in publicly-funded schools.I recommend reading Dawkins book first since he explains what is evolution and natural selection in detail before moving to the evidence while Coyne presents a lot of evidences and details.For books that try to reconcile between religion and evolution, I hear that ""Finding Darwin's God"" & ""The Language of God"" are good, although I haven't read them yet."
20,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"This was written to inform those who believe in evolution how to counter the arguments of those who don't. It hasn't been worth the effort in my experience. Young Earth Creationists (YEC) who believe that the world is only as old as their version of their bible tells them it is (The term apparently applies to people in all branches of the Abrahamic religions plus a few others.) are so dedicated to their intentional ignorance that changing their minds is impossible. They have THE ANSWER & it doesn't matter if it doesn't make a lick of sense & continually contradicts itself. They'll still use cell phones & praise their god(s). None of it was surprising since I'm surrounded by them. Dawkins, who lives in the UK, even mentions the Ark Park & Creationist Museum which are both in my state & not too far away. Shudder. Anyway, that thread of the narrative got pretty old for me & it lost a star for that. Probably a personal problem.I found his explanations in the workings of evolution really interesting, though. Even though I've read several of his books, he's come up with new areas & explanations that make sense of some truly remarkable adaptations.Here are the chapters from the Wikipedia entry:The book is divided into 13 chapters spanning over 400 pages, and includes an appendix called ""The history-deniers"" in the end material. Only a theory? (nature of scientific theory and fallibility) Dogs, cows and cabbages (artificial selection) The primrose path to macro-evolution Silence and slow time (age of the Earth and the geologic time scale) Before our very eyes (examples of evolution observed) Missing link? What do you mean, 'missing'? (the fossil record) Missing persons? Missing no longer (human evolution) You did it yourself in nine months (a statement attributed to J. B. S. Haldane; discusses developmental biology) The ark of the continents (biogeography and plate tectonics) The tree of cousinship (the tree of life, homology and analogy) History written all over us (vestigiality and unintelligent design) Arms races and 'evolutionary theodicy' (coevolution and evolutionary arms races) There is grandeur in this view of life (based on the final passage of On the Origin of Species)I read this as an audiobook narrated by Dawkins & Lalla Ward. They're a great team. Really make the words pop. Highly recommended."
21,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"What a wonderful book! I've enjoyed several other books by Richard Dawkins, and this is his best. The chapter named ""History Written All Over Us"" could have been called, ""Unintelligent Design"". It is just one of many arguments, why evolution is a proven theory. Dawkins makes a point that a good scientific theory must be falsibiable. That means, that if certain evidence were ever collected, or observations made, then one must conclude that the theory is false. He describes how if fossils were ever found in the wrong geological strata, one would immediately have to conclude that evolution is false. But although tons of fossils have been discovered all over the world, not a single one has ever been found in the wrong geological layer."
22,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,5,"So, I admire Dawkins as both a scientist and a writer. His passion for science and the endless search for truth is infectious and his talent for writing magnificent prose is noteable.I had the pleasure to go see him speak at the Center for Inquiry in D.C., and also got to mingle with him before the show (a fun story for sure). Needless to say, he was amazing. I know some people think he is an angry atheist, but I think they are missing the point, and he does a great job of making his point at the beginning of this book. A very worthwhile read for anyone curious about evolution. So much information yet very readable."
23,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,4,"This isn't the best introductory book I've read on evolution, Dawkins loves to insult the people who don't hold his views, goes way to far sometimes to get his point across and has a tendency to ramble on and mention interesting but irrelevant stuff. Once you get past the flaws this actually is a pretty good book, oddly by the end some of those qualities I hated about the book in the beginning, I started to appreciate more in the end (I kind of enjoy the almost pointless side stories and facts). When I started reading this book, I put it down for a while because I got tired of the creationist rants, which apparently the high number of people who deny evolution is why this book is written. Dawkins even goes as far as comparing an evolution denier as the equivalent of someone denying the existence of the roman civilization or even worse a holocaust denier. I'm sorry but lacking the understanding or denying evolution is nothing like denying the holocaust. For one thing we've never really witnessed one animal evolving into another completely different species, meaning one ""kind"" into another ""kind"", in our lifetime (which is far too short of a time scale) or even more a bacteria evolving into a mammal, this doesn't mean evolution is false (its not), but it is far different than denying the holocaust. Anyways eventually I picked the book back up and it was far better as I got further into it. Also expect to hear the word “history-deniers” every few pages, I guess he wants us to remember just how terrible the evolution deniers are. Since this book is written to convince the 40% of American who deny evolution, Dawkins should realize by now that insulting your target audience isn't the best way to get them to listen to you. If anything his books do more help to the young earth creationist movement and intelligent design. The subtitle of this book is “The Evidence for Evolution”, which is kind of an unfitting title, I found that Coyne's Why Evolution is True contains far more evidence in far fewer pages and is overall a better introduction to evolution. You see Dawkins often goes off on rants which do not to move the evidence along. For example in a chapter he discusses the age of the earth, he spends several pages discussing getting the age from tree rings. You see you can match the width of tree rings with others and go back to earlier dates, but then he says that the chain of tree rings goes back 11,000 years only, well the pages he spent on this argument do nothing to convince a young earth creationist of the age of the earth, in fact the argument works in their favor. The book is full of these little side notes and stories which causes the page numbers to go up, but the relevant information doesn't follow. Also expect tons of foot notes with mostly rants about TV shows he wants to be on, his childhood, or why we should call the Beijing Man, the Peking fossil, ect.I know I've complained some but don't get me wrong, this book, once you look past the flaws, is still very interesting and worth reading (assuming that you're not a creationist). Many of the side stories which I complained about are actually interesting if you don’t mind frequent diversions and he goes into DNA a little more than the other non DNA specific evolution books I've read. So in the end I do think its pretty good, just not as a first book on evolution. "
24,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45702383-a-l-buehrer,2," I have to see both sides. I’m really not content to only read what reconfirms what I already believe. Even if I doubt that anything could change my mind on a subject (sometimes facts are facts) I want to be able to see what the other person sees and understand how they think.  I was in this objective sportsmanly mood when I picked this book up. By the end of chapter one I was struggling to maintain that attitude. Why? Because Dawkins has absolutely no interest in playing fair. I like to think that even people who disagree with me can still be intelligent intellectually honest people. Dawkins clearly doesn’t. I took issue with a lot more than just the science in this book. Overall, it was well constructed—I think he went over the subjects that he needed to cover. But…I don’t know. Maybe I’m out-growing pop science, but for me, he wasted so much time on prose explaining obvious things, and trying to keep us poor non-scientists interested.  I didn’t notice his writing voice in The Selfish Gene. I vastly prefer that book. The Selfish Gene had something that actually took some page-time to explain. In this book his style felt like somebody desperately trying to write a lot of words. A lot of chains of adjectives and repeated ideas. I found myself skimming large sections because he had made his point and it was time to start connecting it to the next one, but he was in no hurry. He did a lot of things I never would have done writing a similar book. He claimed in the beginning he was writing for both evolutionists who wanted to combat their stupid creationist relatives at family gatherings and for creationists themselves. I can confirm he was not writing this book with any thought for the possibility that the second group would read him at all. He doesn’t believe in creationists enough to think they would ever dare to read something that might shake their faith. Neither does he ever show any respect for his opposition. He constantly refers to evolution skeptics as “history-deniers” and stereotypes them as willfully scientifically illiterate and emotionally hysterical.  Never once in the course of the book does Dawkins acknowledge that there are fully-educated, fully-rational scientists that don’t read the evidence the way he does. He consistently juxtaposes “scientists” and “history-deniers” as mutually exclusive groups. Never once does he even mention a debate or exchange between himself and real ID scientists. His anecdotes are limited to face-offs with journalists and random people on the street.  The biggest downfall of the book stems from the fact that—unlike some of us—Dawkins makes no effort to understand his opposition. This manifests as the most glaring scientific mistake in the whole book: he wastes a huge amount of time proving microevolution. News flash: educated creationists believe in microevolution. Microevolution is simply variation that arises from shuffling genetic information. (Dawkins doesn’t think I, as a creationist, know what “information” is. He can be wrong.) Macroevolution requires significant amounts of new genetic information and is much more problematic. Macroevolution is the process that, over billions of years, turns worms to humans. This is what we need you to prove, Dawkins. Anyway. I read this. "

I kept delaying reading his books and the loss was mine. For beneath that thin veneer or cynicism, lies a man deeply in love with science and fellow human-beings. BTW, this was my 4th book by him.In this book, Dawkins first explains the problem - almost 40% of Americans and a comparable number of developed-world Europeans believe in creationism and reject evolution. And then step-by-step, he takes the major arguments against evolution and sets out to dismantle them with detailed examples and explanations. Infact, as I already think evolution is true and was trying to understand it better, it sometimes felt as though he was being too detailed. But, perhaps this approach suited his primary audience of creationists.In particular would mention Chapter 4 - that describes the Lenski experiment on evolution in detail and it was truly mind-blowing to read about evolution in action."
26,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12484910-charbel,4," Evolution is one of my favourite subjects, and it saddens me how many people refuse to see the beauty of it, let alone give it a chance. I've never been one to push my opinions on others, and I consider myself an open minded person, but I feel that people don't believe in evolution, simply because they don't want to believe in it.   However, I am happy to say that once again Richard Dawkins has presented the unifying theory of evolution convincingly. Unfortunately, the only people that would be willing to read this with an open mind are evolution enthusiasts, like myself.  This book is charismatic, scientific and a brilliant read. I would definitely recommend this to those interested in evolutionary bioligy. And on a personal note, I look forward to reading my next Dawkins book."

This is a wonderful book that richly describes, in immense details, the wonder that is evolution. Here is a book that really shows the awe of science, and nature and how the world has become the great cornucopia of life that it has become. "
28,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Richard Dawkins is, from my point of view, a fairly unpleasant man even when I agree with him. He sets out to make this book an explanation of how evolution works (but for that, I would go with Coyne’s Why Evolution is True), and why it is the correct explanation for various phenomena we can observe around us. It’s not as bad as The God Delusion for anti-theist statements, though there are a few speckled in there, and he makes a fairly good line of argument.Of course, since I think evolution is an obvious conclusion, so I’m not exactly the audience he was hoping to convince — and it’s likely I didn’t notice instances of his usual arrogant attitude that would bother someone who doesn’t already believe in the same things. I think you’re probably safer with Coyne’s book.Or this set of logical steps:1. There are creatures who are better adapted to their environment than others of the same species.Because they are better adapted, they will be more successful in survival and, consequently, breeding.2. These traits, when heritable, can be passed on the creature’s offspring — and they can have many offspring.3. These offspring will be better adapted, and will meet others who are also well adapted to breed with.4. Good adaptations accumulate over the course of generations.5. The environment is not stable and changes over time. Adaptation is necessary to allow a species to survive in the same area, and species do survive in the same area.6. Over a long period of time, enough changes will accumulate that individuals of that species would not be able to breed with the original species, or with a branch of the species that adapted differently.7. Evolution via natural selection has necessarily occurred.Plus extra evidence like shared DNA, the fact that we can artificially (and in a very short space of time) cause a species to evolve by selecting traits we want (e.g. high milk yield in cows), and the fossil record which contains plenty of examples of transitional fossils… You don’t need Dawkins; go back to Darwin. Even without the evidence we have now, he saw the necessary chain of events, and he was much more sympathetic to other views, and meticulous about his evidence.Nonetheless, Dawkins’ book is clear and pretty well-written; I just don’t like his attitude, and I don’t think he will reach the desired audience.Originally posted here."
29,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins The Greatest Show on Earth is another solid book in a series of books by Richard Dawkins.

No one better at combining evolutionary biology knowledge and communication than Dawkins. 4. Great illustrations. 5. Co-evolution explained. 6.

A bibliography worthy of the author. Negatives: 1. I get the sense this book was a bit rushed because it doesn't have the same eloquence as previous books. 2. Not as concise as it should have been. In summary, this is a very solid book. It's not the best book on evolution for the masses that distinction goes to Mr. Coyne, ""Why Evolution Is True"" but excellent nonetheless. Recommendations include: ""Your Inner Fish..."" by Neil Shubin, ""The Making of the Fittest"" by Sean B. Carroll, and ""Relics of Eden..."" by Daniel J. Fairbanks."
30,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,2,"I feel like I've had a Dawkins overload; maybe that's why I wasn't all that thrilled with this book, although some parts are very interesting (the part about dating from rings on trees and that sort of thing.) But his tone in arguing with believers in literal Biblical creation is annoying and condesending. Although I am firmly convinced of Darwin's theory, I think it's possible that religious writings such as the Bible (I am not all that familiar with any other holy books, I'm afraid) can be excused and interpreted by understanding the obvious: that people at the time of the writing did not have the knowledge we now have, and they made sense of things in the only way they knew how. Creating the earth in 6 days was meaningless at the time because what defines a day in the birth of the solar system? I can't come up with any science to rationalize the rib story, but as far as the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that's a pretty obvious reference to the origins of human consciousness, as in, they became self-aware and realized they were (gasp) naked. I doubt there was any snake involved but possibly the snake is a metaphor for evil/cunning; at any rate, I would not be surprised if the trouble was started by a woman.Dawkins makes no attempt at any understanding of his opponents, which is fine I guess, but to me, a good book looks at both sides."
31,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,4,"This work has to be a thorn in the side to all creationists. Dawkins refutes the most frequently put forward theories and sometimes simple lies and fairy tales of the modern creationists with clear evidence from an evolutionary standpoint.He provides several explanations for each example given from the animal and plant world and clearly explains why ""Darwin was right"".I found it unbelievable that, according to official surveys, so many people seriously believe that the world we know with all its diversity was only created 10,000 years ago."
32,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6794439-marius-masalar,3,"This is a challenging book to assess. My first question, upon finishing it, is ""who is this for?""The science is too involved for a scientifically illiterate fundamentalist creationist audience, the sardonic tone likewise off-putting to them, and the atheists like me who share his broad perspective hardly need a hand-held walk through the garden of nature's wonders and weirdnesses.Then again, maybe we do: it should be emphasised that this book makes for a fantastic full spectrum look at the subject of evolutionary theory, one complete with some excellent analogies, stunning facts, and wise correlations. Anyone with a high school level understanding of biology will be more than equipped to follow along and learn.Unfortunately, Dawkins' extensive expertise in the subject matter often falls prey to his fairly direct sense of humour, expressed via a mocking tone that does more to further the stereotype of him as a shrill British ponce than to reveal his truer nature as a passionate humanist.Inevitably, I am drawn to wonder what the inimitable Christopher Hitchens would have done with a similar task, equipped with Dawkins' subject expertise. I suspect his subtler wit, fantastically evocative writing, and sophisticated understanding of debate would have produced a finer work.Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend The Greatest Show On Earth to anyone who seeks a peerless introduction to the current state of evolutionary theory, or to a thicker-skinned creationist seeking to inform themselves about the opposing side in the debate about the origins of life."
33,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,5,"Dawkins latest book finally tackles creationism in a not-so-head-on collision. Always vowing to never answer a challenge directly, Dawkins does it in the best way he possibly could, by demonstrating why evolution is true.He seemingly leaves no stone uncovered in the challenge, often tackling direct claims made by creationists and demonstrating why they are false. He also covers how speciation has been observed and the whole ""show me your transitional fossils"" non-argument is handled masterfully. By demonstrating selective breeding of plants and animals by humans, he shows how easily and quickly humans have created new species within a couple of generations.Illustrated with images, colour plates and excellent description, Dawkins knows how to hold the reader's attention and to explain even the most complex scientific terms in easy to understand language. I'm not sure why this book was written though. In 2009, Jerry Coyne released ""Why Evolution is True"" which though I have not yet read, I imagine covers many similar themes and evidences.The other issue is of course that this book is NOT going to be read by the very people it is directed at. Creationists, despite their protests of ""teaching the controversy"" and ""academic freedom"", are not interested in understanding what evolution is. Those who are going to buy it and read it are those already convinced by the evidence for an old earth, natural selection and evolution by common descent, so the question must be asked in the words of Daniel Dennett... cui bono?See more book reviews at my blog"
34,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: ""'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution."" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the ""intelligent design"" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point."
35,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"Ironically a book on evolution would be a chimera of textbook, polemic, and panegyric it does none of those things particularly well. Too informal to be authoritative and too casual to be something one could refer someone to this book fits into the wide middle of Dawkins book which are summed up as ""nice but someone else has done it better"".Dawkins' books seem to grow out a nagging urge to yell something at the world and ""the point"" is poorly spread across sprawling chapters that reference across each other suggesting the book could have been better organized. The color plate system makes it easy to ""spoil"" section as it's not obvious what picture is being referred to.One section does stand head-and-shoulders above others in the discussion of dating tools. I never realized that tree-ring dating was as powerful as shown here, providing us a 12 millenia time-line in some places. If you can get it from your library or otherwise without cost, reading these sections is a good usage of ones time in providing a condensed pile of methodologies to pass to the uninformed. "

It ranks right up there with Climbing Mount Improbable and River out of Eden. Dawkins writes beautifully, especially for a scientist, with a combination of erudition and wit. I have a fairly strong background in science, but I don't think that this book would be too much of a slog for the intelligent humanities-based reader. The book's subtitle is The Evidence for Evolution, and the case he makes is cogent and convincing (although he's definitely preaching to the choir with this reader.)"

He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the ""theory"" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design. The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design. Sic Transit Intelligent Design.It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.Enough about evolution. What about the book?In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.For myself I suggest the following.The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievement"

The benefit of reading it is that Richard Dawkins covers all of the major areas, and so can fill in a few of the blanks that all of us have to one extent or the other. It covers the fossil record in depth, showing the relationships between living things past and present, and has a good discussion on “missing links.” He makes the point that the only reason we can divide the fossil record into different species is because of the gaps in that record. The slow changes over evolutionary time would have been imperceptible to anyone seeing the plants or animals while they were alive, and at no point could an observer have looked at something and said that it was a different species than its parents. In fact, the normal variation within the species would have been greater than any individual incremental evolutionary change. Only because of the breaks in the fossil record can we recognize the slow changes over time.Carbon-14, is the standard dating technique for plants and animals having lived within the past 50,000 years, but I did not know where it came from, and found Dawkins’ explanation quite interesting.Carbon-14 is special because it is continually being made by cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere. Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the atmosphere and its mass number is 14, the same as carbon-14’s. The difference is that carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons…. Cosmic ray particles are capable of hitting a proton in a nitrogen nucleus and converting it to a neutron. When this happens, the atom becomes carbon-14, carbon being one lower than nitrogen in the periodic table.Although we normally think of evolutionary time as taking place over millennia, Dawkins describes several experiments that showed major changes can happen very quickly. There was a fascinating experiment that tracked the changes in bacteria over many generation as they differentiated from their parent stock. There was also an experiment on zebra fish which showed that, in the absence of predators, the males evolved bright colors to attract females, but with predators present they quickly evolved duller spotted patterns to mimic the color of the stream bottom.He also makes a good point about sexual reproduction, in that when a living creature is conceived, it is only a “blending” of mother and father when looked at from a high level. At the DNA level, however, what gets passed are genes, which are either/or: any particular gene either comes from one parent or it comes from the other. They are never a blend of the two, although sometimes, for several reasons, they can pick up a mutation. There is an old Creationist argument that natural selection could not work because any new beneficial traits would be swamped as they blended into the existing traits of the general population, but if genes pass down intact, the helpful ones could spread.In his discussion of how modern molecular genetics has helped understand evolution, Dawkins makes an interesting point when explaining how scientists determine how closely related two species are:The human/dog cell should theoretically have an identical resemblance score to the chimpanzee/dog cell because humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same degree of relation to dogs. It should be identical, too, to the monkey/dog cell and the lemur/dog cell. This is because humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and lemurs are all connected to the dog via their common ancestor, an early primate (which probably looked a bit like a lemur). One of evolution’s most powerful arguments is that life evolved only once. This is a well known statement, but Dawkins makes it after he has brought to bear a great deal of evidence from many different fields of study, and when he finally presents it the reader gets a sense of its majesty. We are all truly connected, from the simplest bacteria to the most complicated creatures.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Richard Dawkins book if he didn’t take some well deserved swipes at Creationists. Were it not for their baleful influence on science and education, there would be something pathetically funny about them: they believe because they believe because they believe, and no amount of evidence or logic will change their minds. It reminded me of the saying that faith is not an argument, but the absence of arguments.I enjoyed this book. Because I already had a layman’s understanding of evolution, I wasn’t sure how much I would learn from it, but it was definitely worth the time. It filled in a number of gaps in my understanding, and expanded on the areas I was familiar with. It makes a strong case for evolution being, as the title says, the greatest show on earth."
40,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,3,"Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, in the same league as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Neil deGrasse Tyson. What stands out in the works of these people is their unwavering loyalty to Truth and Reason. They are not the sort of persons that can take an affront to Knowledge lying down. All of them are outright atheists that don’t mince words when it comes to attacking the superstitious and stupid religious beliefs. This is the third work of Dawkins that I am reading, after having gone through ‘The God Delusion’ and ‘The Magic of Reality’. Dawkins continues in the same vein as in those two books, but this book is turning the heat up for the ‘Creationists’ – those that believe that a god created this universe, our planet and all the life forms that populate it, within the last 10000 years or so. Dawkins builds a citadel from which the Evolutionists – those of us that believe that the planet Earth is about 4.6 billion years and all the life forms that we see in front of our eyes today evolved through natural genetic modification – can fight the ignorance of the ‘Creationists’. And, what a citadel has he built! I don’t think that a staunch believer of the religious version of ‘Creation’ will be moved by this book well enough to reverse his/her views, but this book will nevertheless end up causing a dent in his/her belief. Be it plants, animals or the multitude of bacterial and vermin life forms, Dawkins pulls them all up to stand as witness to the survival of their ancestors in the long gone past and their evolution by ‘natural selection’. Dawkins also arms all the ‘Evolutionists’ and ‘Darwinists’ with enough arsenal to fight back the stupid questions raised by the ‘Creationists’. ‘If men evolved from monkeys why are there monkeys still around?’, for example.But one thing that I couldn’t stomach in this book is that, while trying to build a citadel of facts and arguments strong enough to be unassailable by the ‘Creationists’, Dawkins seems to have become too obsessed with the details to the extent of ignoring the normal, laymen like me that couldn’t grasp science beyond a certain level, at least for now. You need to have a fair knowledge of genes to understand the book. In the previous two books, I found the words of Dawkins having a smooth flow. The same is lacking here. His random jumping between the topics and cross-referencing details in other chapters and even in his other books doesn’t make matters easy either. A good book to read, if you prefer reading books that are slow and heavy. Though this lacks the usual flow and wit of Richard Dawkins, it is a worthy shot in the arm if you are someone that ends up arguing with the ‘Believers’ every now and then."
41,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The Greatest Show On Earth: The Evidence for Evolution""I like most, but not all, of Richard Dawkins' books, especially ones such as ""The Selfish Gene"" where he is adding real new insights into how evolution works (and doesn't work). I gave his book-before-last, ""The God Delusion"", a pass, because it appeared to have all the charm and insight of a typical Internet rant. Dawkins is at his best when he talks about the topics he loves (biology), and at his worst when he talks about the topics he hates (religion).Fortunately, in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", he mostly sticks to what he loves. He describes this book as a sort of, ""oh, I should have said"", in which he goes back to describe the basic facts about evolution. In ""The Selfish Gene"", ""The Blind Watchmaker"", ""Climbing Mount Improbable"", and his other evolution-related books, he was taking it as given and discussing the more subtle aspects which are not covered in basic discussions. For this reason, I was not certain if I wanted to read this books, since, you know, I already took high school biology.The reality is, though, that Dawkins knows (or has at his disposal) an astonishing and delightful range of biological facts and short stories, from primates (current and extinct), dinosaurs, worms, a Monty Python parody of ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" (ok that one's not exactly biology), crab bodies imagined as rubber-sheet transformations of one another, and on and on.In particular I can commend Dawkins for his use of graphics. The technology used for making books in the 19th and 20th century led to an entirely regrettable reliance on exclusively print texts, which computer-controlled printing is only slowly undoing. In addition to the wonderful color insets, Dawkins has graphs, line drawings, and other imagery sprinkled liberally through the book. The greatest part of the history of books included pictures with the words; let's hope Dawkins becomes less of an exception in the 21st century.In addition, let's hope he sticks to topics he loves in future books. He's much more fun to read that way."
42,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277727-emily,0,"Richard Dawkins has set out to challenge Creationists with his new book ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."" As someone who was taught evolution by one of the most hardcore nuns in my Catholic school, I've always found Creationism somewhat baffling. Isn't ""faith"" believing in spite of evidence? Not pretending the evidence doesn't exist? In my personal canon, I rather like the idea that the ""clay"" God made Adam out of in the Bible is actually RNA. All live evolved from this, not just human life. I suppose this is neither here nor there. But it doesn't seem hard to reoncile evolution with God to me. If you created a universe, wouldn't you come up with some process by which the world could govern itself instead of having to deal with every little problem? I think you would. Anyway, Dawkins says this book is intended to convince Creationists that they are wrong. I don't think it will do that. They will just ignore this book as they ignore the rest of his work. I'm not sure there is any book that can be written that would convince people who are already certain, but it's not this one. (Perhaps if someone who was on the fence wrote a memoir about examining the evidence?) Dawkins's tone is a bit too superior. I listened to this on CD and I rather thought he was silently adding ""those idiots"" whenever he said ""history deniers"" (the phrase he uses for Creationists). Those who disagree are more like to shut the book before reading a whole chapter. So I think the main audience for this book will be people who already believe in Evolution who want to start fights with Creationists on the Internet. "
43,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,3,"This book does a decent job of explaning evolution, though I have two criticisms: First, the format suffers organizationally. The book is written as a rebuttal to creationist arguments, but Dawkins addresses those arguments by interspersing them, in no coherent order, within affirmative evidence for evolution. A bettter way to format the book would have been to model it after a good legal brief. Present the affirmative case for evolution first, then address creationist counterarguments second. Second, Dawkin exhibits unnecesary hostility toward those who believe in creationism. There is no good reason to be so disrespectful of their beliefs. To him, it's as if teaching children creationism is one of the world's greatest evils. At worst, however, teaching children creationism is only teaching them a false belief. Moreover, while many Americans (and others) believe in creationism, most (even by his own account) do not. The trend, if anything, is toward believing in evolution, so there's no reason to get so worked up about it. Dawkin's defensiveness and hostility actually render his book less persuasive, because he comes across as a radical, or extremist. For example, Dawkins repeats the phrase ""evolution is a fact"" perhaps several dozen times, as if saying it will necessarily make it so. If evolution if a fact, say it once and move on. In sum, a more level-headed approach would not only have made the book more persausive, but also a more enjoyable read. "
44,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"44% of Americans believe that humans were created by god about ten thousand years ago. I admire that Richard Dawkins' stamina in fighting the good fight but he's not going about it very effectively. He sounds pretentious. He uses technical terms quite frequently, to the point that I can barely keep up (and I have reasonable background in the area already). He repeatedly insults and mocks people who do not accept what he sees to be completely self-evident. The argument is not strung together too neatly and his time/resource allocation is also slightly questionable. You can feel his pain and sympathize, but if he wanted to be more effective he would have to surrender some of his ego first, which I don't think he can do very well.I personally read this book because I was curious to see what evidence from the animal kingdom Dawkins would select as his best ammunition and how he would structure the argument. I emerged slightly disappointed: by the tone, the flow, the structure, and the selection. If there is someone out there who would like to learn more about evolution I would instead recommend looking at some very well-produced videos on YouTube."
45,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4745220-alicja,5,"rating: 5/5It was sometimes a tough read but it presents the evidence for evolution in a clear and concise manner that is accessible to non-biologists. Although, I did have to google search some concepts because I didn't remember enough biology 101 foundations from undergrad (the embryology chapter killed me! but thankfully I've revived since). So, if you are evolution theory ignorant (because what I remember from high school and basic bio in college has pretty much left my brain by now), this is a great read to pick up and brush up those corners of your brain. And Dawkins tends to stick more to the biology is this one, rather than condescending (as much) to the religious which is generally my criticism for any atheist works of his, so yup... read it. "
46,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35090771-guat-n,5,"As the title suggests, this book is about evolution, but the author goes through a little geology, embryology, anatomy, paleontology, computer simulations, real-life experiments, amino acids and radioactive decay to support his arguments, which is a bonus.Otro punto a favor es que mientras leía este libro, me acordaba constantemente de este video y se me alegraba el día."
47,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,4,"Very thorough and compelling evidence for the case of evolution, but I feel that Mr. Dawkins would have gotten his point across in a much more convincing fashion if he had left out the constant jabs at religion. I agree with him that it's pretty disheartening that so many people just out right reject evolution, without observing ANY evidence, but you also can't tell unbelievers that they are basically stupid because of their religion and expect people to care to listen to your argument.

53,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31260727-josiah,4,"As a creationist, I disagree with a lot of the ways that Dawkins interprets scientific studies and don't agree with most of his conclusions, but I have to give credit where credit is due: this is, by and large, a good argument for macro-evolution. He lays out complex scientific topics in easy-enough ways for a layperson to understand, explains things in entertaining ways at times, and uses a variety of studies and arguments to make his case. I think his scientific arguments are flawed (see this book), but he also makes some good points at times and I can appreciate certain arguments while disagreeing with them.That being said, while I could respect Dawkins when he was talking about science, his arguments were laughably bad when it came to philosophy. Dawkins tries to seriously argue that the presence of pain in gazelles disproves a creator, the fact that trees try to ""compete"" with each other for who can be the tallest disproves a creator, and the fact that predators don't prey ""optimally"" disproves a creator, among other things. His lack of understanding for what the intelligent design movement argues and his college-freshman-level understanding of philosophy hurt his credibility in my book. For someone who makes a big deal about non-scientists misinterpreting science, he really should be more careful before delving into philosophy as a non-philosopher.Overall, I appreciated reading this book to better understand scientific arguments against the creationist/intelligent design positions. Didn't persuade me, but it was well-argued (sans the philosophy bits).Rating: 3.5-4 Stars (Good)."

55,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Back in the 60‘s, the Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species and Descent of Man was probably the single greatest inspiration for me to study biology and eventually get a degree in that major. I was not an atheist back in those days. I’m not sure I am totally one today? I have many, many problems with organized religion. I cannot nor will I ever believe that I could be a member of such a community. However, I have not given up on the idea that there might not be some intelligent design to things. It’s just not the intelligence of Richard Dawkins.Think about it, Richard. I’ll bet that you believe their is a high probability that there is life and possibly even intelligence somewhere else in the universe. Would it be intelligence as we know it do you suppose?Publishers Weekly commented, ""If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book [GSoE] he should pick up.” The review then goes on to say that “Dawkins remains a superb translator of complex scientific concepts....he has a way of making the drollest details feel like a revelation."" I support the first part of that review but not the second. I think that Charles Darwin was that person who could so superbly articulate and make clear complex, scientific concepts. Richard Dawkins has a problem.The author of The Greatest Show on Earth, Richard Dawkins, is a self-described militant atheist. For me, therein lies the “greatest” problem with this book and others he has written. I have no problem with Dawkins’ atheism. I understand his militancy. But all of that, particularly rapped up in vehement emotion seems incongruent with a book on science. Unless perhaps in the study of behaviorism, science loses its authenticity in the presence of emotion. It ceases to be legitimate science and begins to sound more like the “circus” he is trying to debunk. In most of his books, Dawkins makes a passionate argument against the influence of religion around the teaching of evolution. Or maybe one should say the influence of religion on Not teaching evolution. I understand that and I completely support his thesis. However, for the same reason, I just do not believe that his anti-religious rants belong in a book that purports to teach science any more than speculation on creationism belongs in the classroom. Both seem to cheapen the discipline of science itself. As hard as Dawkins tries to separate Church, State and secular education, it is in this trying that his books lose their scientific punch. There was a lot to like about GSoE. Reading about evolution again, I relived with much of the same excitement I had had back in those days when, as that teenager, I was introduced to evolution. But all of Dawkins’ bashing and defensiveness diminishes the sheer enjoyment of reading and reveling in the beauty that is Charles Darwin all by himself. What Dawkins has to say about separating Church and State and education needs desperately to be said and needs to be listened to. A book all about that and without all the biology would be fine. It would make more sense and probably be more widely read. One book, Richard, maybe one book of the ilk of GSoE would make sense, but an entire library devoted to this? Come on..... Sounds almost like a crusade that you would argue against so ardently. Discover magazine called Richard Dawkins ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" for his “fierce and effective defense of evolution.” I believe that speaks a disservice to the genus canids. In today’s world, anyone with half a brain knows that evolution requires no more of defense than that of the heliocentric solar system. But yes, our schools and curricula do need defense from religious zealots. Let’s just keep the fact of evolution separate from the theory that it’s not. The socio-political and religious arguments for teaching creationism to the exclusion or at least the demeaning of evolution are strong, large and looming enough targets to go after on their own. The breath and depth of science in this book only muddys up that water. Do I care that a recent Gallup poll concluded that 44 percent of Americans believed a god created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years and that beliefs in Europe are not much different? You bet I care. I just do not think folks like Dawkins are going to change that thinking with books like this. You want to know about evolution? Read Charles Darwin first. Go to the master himself. He is totally approachable and his science reads like beautiful prose. You want religious influences out of public schools, join the PTA or vote for the right candidate. In its totality, I subscribe to all that Dawkins posits. It's only the messenger that I'd like to kill."
56,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Although Dawkins doesn't seem to realize that you can't reason someone away from a position they don't hold by reason, so trying to arm people to counter the arguments of evolution 'skeptics' is a futile endeavor; however, getting a lot of the gaps filled in about evolution is a fascinating subject for us dilettantes who accept that science isn't intentionally lying to us and are interested in how the accepted science came to be accepted.Yes, those are ironic quotes around the word skeptics, because metaphorically waving ones hands and repeating nuh-uh isn't really skepticism, it's willful ignorance.So, sure, one may hear from science deniers that evolution isn't science because you can't test it in a lab. People that claim that are both wrong about the necessity of a lab to test a hypothesis, and the claim that evolution hasn't been tested in a lab. There are experiments where evolution has been demonstrated in a lab - bacteria that have multiple generations in a day, so that evolutionary timelines are years instead of millennia. And the bacteria adapt. Is this good to read about because it will help you convince somebody who's invested in not believing evolution? Of course not. You can't change anybody's mind. Only they can, and if they've predetermined they won't change their mind you're wasting your time. But it's cool as heck. The experiment, that is. And Dawkins explains it, perfectly striking the balance between making it accessible to the layperson, without leaving out substance.Is the anecdote wherein a denier, who couldn't accept that random mutations could advance from a single cell to a complete human, with a nervous system, miles of blood vessels, sight, hearing, etc., might arise in billions of years, was confronted with the observation that she accomplished it herself in nine months, going to even begin to sway someone who's dug in their heels? Duh no. But the chapter about how we're metaphorical origami rather than constructions from blueprints elucidates so much, and makes the observations that humans have gills early in embryonic development, as birds have teeth and bony tails, make sense. These aren't flukes, they're expected observations of undesigned results of millions of random prototypes.So, please don't tell Dawkins I said this, because I hate to crush a dream, but the book works for unintended reasons. It's a great survey course in evolution. It cannot work to sway your extended family at Thanksgiving because they aren't genuinely interested in allowing their minds to be changed. And one thing dumb ol' evolution hasn't accomplished yet is allowing objective evidence to force someone to change their minds. Apparently there's no competitive advantage in it."

Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution. Evolution is a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere. Though logic-choppers rule the town,* some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.”Dawkins is persistent and rightly so. Why would you disprove something that is true? If you are a creationist, do give Dawkins a chance. You might rethink your views. Enough of all this.The book begins with ‘theory’. What we do mean when use this word in a sentence? What do creationists mean when they use this word? The difference is major and explained wonderfully with the true meaning. Dawkins goes on to follow evolution from earlier times, depending on the species. Why are there so many different breeds of dogs suddenly when there were only a few back in the 18-19th centuries? Questions like this and many more are answered. We have come a long way from Darwin’s Origin of Species. More things are known today than Darwin knew back then when he was writing his masterpiece. ”Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips . . . continue the list as long as desired. That didn’t have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn’t. It didn’t have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it”Highly recommended."
58,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340159-amanda,4,"Approaching this with an education (albeit only just over half an undergrad degree for now) in evolutionary biology was a rather different experience, I would imagine, than approaching it with minimal knowledge of the subject matter. As it stands, I liked the book; I thought it was well put together and used some really classic as well as some really new and exciting examples of experiments that have been done and discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of evolution. But I also have some complaints and differences of opinion with it. The book seems to be a bit bipolar in terms of its intended audience. Obviously Dawkins wants to write for his usual fan base/ the generally curious and somewhat scientifically literate public. But another major aim of the book is to try and educate creationists. So it ends up switching back and forth between explaining the simplest of things (common sense stuff for anyone who's ever taken grade 9 or 10 science) and assuming you know them already. The end result is that the text patronizes even the layman reader while alienating the scientifically illiterate creationist who will not be able to grasp the concepts completely.Now, there are a few things I take issue with in terms of how he explains certain evolutionary concepts, but these are mostly nitty gritty details that I think could be worded to better convey the information without creating common misconceptions and thus aren't really worth focusing on too much. He doesn't really do evolutionary forces other than natural selection much justice (specifically random genetic drift), but as a friend of mine said: ""Just getting the idea of natural selection across to creationists is a challenge; bring out genetic drift and the shit will start to fly. One step at a time, here!""I think my major issue with the book pops up in the introduction. After explaining the scientific use of the word ""theory"" and contrasting it with the colloquial use, Dawkins decides that in order to avoid misconceptions, it would be best to use a different term. So he decides to make up a word. He borrows the mathematical term ""theorem"" and purposes misspells it ""theorum"". The ""theorum"" of evolution. He could just have easily referred to it as the fact of evolution, which is what he actually does for the rest of the book, only mentioning ""theorum"" once or twice more near the end. The whole thing is an exercise in futility and doesn't really do anything towards his goal of promoting scientific literacy. It just makes him sound silly. Although I suppose that ""theorum"" does sound better than if he were to purposely misspell ""law"" as ""luw"" of evolution.In spite of all the criticisms I've put forward, it actually is a good summary of evolutionary theory and deserves to be widely read. If we could make textbooks as engaging as this, I suspect that many more people would understand evolution and be less susceptible to creationist misinformation."
59,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is most certainly one of the best, most entertaining, and most interesting non-fiction books I’ve ever read. There is of course no doubt in this world anymore about Richard Dawkins’ amazing capabilities to put together a comprehensive, concise, yet thorough text on evolution that makes one want to keep reading, in search of even more interesting facts than the last few he’s brought forth.Dawkins describes this book as the ‘missing link’ in the impressive chain of books he’s written up until now: The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is meant as a book on the evidence for evolution, instead of being very much about the theory itself. And of course, as a highly intelligent evolutionary biologist, Dawkins more than succeeds in presenting evidence for evolution, using photos on coloured pages, diagrams, illustrations, and many other visual aids next to his own written word.He writes with humour and wit about all the amazingly interesting examples of evolution he puts forth, many of which were yet unknown to me, and shows how much passion and enthusiasm he has for this field. Reading this book made me almost feel giddy at times, and definitely brought me joy. Dawkins gives the reader a lot in this book: he doesn’t only provide evidence on evolution, but he also tackles a few arguments of creationists on evolution (the point where he stresses that the fossil record actually isn’t even needed as evidence for evolution is particularly strong, especially because it seems so overlooked). Critique on Dawkins and his work has sometimes been about his aggressive tone or his tendency to continue beating down creationists; I didn’t consider this to be a problem in The Greatest Show on Earth, nor did I think Dawkins was aggressive in any way. The creationists’ views are valid and contemporary in the discussion on the evidence of evolution, and I didn’t feel as if he was purposefully dragging them into this book.I would most certainly highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, with no exceptions. It’s a lovely, engaging, and interesting book that’s most definitely well-worth a read."
60,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,2,"I feel like I've had a Dawkins overload; maybe that's why I wasn't all that thrilled with this book, although some parts are very interesting (the part about dating from rings on trees and that sort of thing.) But his tone in arguing with believers in literal Biblical creation is annoying and condesending. Although I am firmly convinced of Darwin's theory, I think it's possible that religious writings such as the Bible (I am not all that familiar with any other holy books, I'm afraid) can be excused and interpreted by understanding the obvious: that people at the time of the writing did not have the knowledge we now have, and they made sense of things in the only way they knew how. Creating the earth in 6 days was meaningless at the time because what defines a day in the birth of the solar system? I can't come up with any science to rationalize the rib story, but as far as the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that's a pretty obvious reference to the origins of human consciousness, as in, they became self-aware and realized they were (gasp) naked. I doubt there was any snake involved but possibly the snake is a metaphor for evil/cunning; at any rate, I would not be surprised if the trouble was started by a woman.Dawkins makes no attempt at any understanding of his opponents, which is fine I guess, but to me, a good book looks at both sides."
61,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,4,"This work has to be a thorn in the side to all creationists. Dawkins refutes the most frequently put forward theories and sometimes simple lies and fairy tales of the modern creationists with clear evidence from an evolutionary standpoint.He provides several explanations for each example given from the animal and plant world and clearly explains why ""Darwin was right"".I found it unbelievable that, according to official surveys, so many people seriously believe that the world we know with all its diversity was only created 10,000 years ago."
62,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6794439-marius-masalar,3,"This is a challenging book to assess. My first question, upon finishing it, is ""who is this for?""The science is too involved for a scientifically illiterate fundamentalist creationist audience, the sardonic tone likewise off-putting to them, and the atheists like me who share his broad perspective hardly need a hand-held walk through the garden of nature's wonders and weirdnesses.Then again, maybe we do: it should be emphasised that this book makes for a fantastic full spectrum look at the subject of evolutionary theory, one complete with some excellent analogies, stunning facts, and wise correlations. Anyone with a high school level understanding of biology will be more than equipped to follow along and learn.Unfortunately, Dawkins' extensive expertise in the subject matter often falls prey to his fairly direct sense of humour, expressed via a mocking tone that does more to further the stereotype of him as a shrill British ponce than to reveal his truer nature as a passionate humanist.Inevitably, I am drawn to wonder what the inimitable Christopher Hitchens would have done with a similar task, equipped with Dawkins' subject expertise. I suspect his subtler wit, fantastically evocative writing, and sophisticated understanding of debate would have produced a finer work.Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend The Greatest Show On Earth to anyone who seeks a peerless introduction to the current state of evolutionary theory, or to a thicker-skinned creationist seeking to inform themselves about the opposing side in the debate about the origins of life."
63,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,5,"Dawkins latest book finally tackles creationism in a not-so-head-on collision. Always vowing to never answer a challenge directly, Dawkins does it in the best way he possibly could, by demonstrating why evolution is true.He seemingly leaves no stone uncovered in the challenge, often tackling direct claims made by creationists and demonstrating why they are false. He also covers how speciation has been observed and the whole ""show me your transitional fossils"" non-argument is handled masterfully. By demonstrating selective breeding of plants and animals by humans, he shows how easily and quickly humans have created new species within a couple of generations.Illustrated with images, colour plates and excellent description, Dawkins knows how to hold the reader's attention and to explain even the most complex scientific terms in easy to understand language. I'm not sure why this book was written though. In 2009, Jerry Coyne released ""Why Evolution is True"" which though I have not yet read, I imagine covers many similar themes and evidences.The other issue is of course that this book is NOT going to be read by the very people it is directed at. Creationists, despite their protests of ""teaching the controversy"" and ""academic freedom"", are not interested in understanding what evolution is. Those who are going to buy it and read it are those already convinced by the evidence for an old earth, natural selection and evolution by common descent, so the question must be asked in the words of Daniel Dennett... cui bono?See more book reviews at my blog"
64,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: ""'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution."" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the ""intelligent design"" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point."
65,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"Ironically a book on evolution would be a chimera of textbook, polemic, and panegyric it does none of those things particularly well. Too informal to be authoritative and too casual to be something one could refer someone to this book fits into the wide middle of Dawkins book which are summed up as ""nice but someone else has done it better"".Dawkins' books seem to grow out a nagging urge to yell something at the world and ""the point"" is poorly spread across sprawling chapters that reference across each other suggesting the book could have been better organized. The color plate system makes it easy to ""spoil"" section as it's not obvious what picture is being referred to.One section does stand head-and-shoulders above others in the discussion of dating tools. I never realized that tree-ring dating was as powerful as shown here, providing us a 12 millenia time-line in some places. If you can get it from your library or otherwise without cost, reading these sections is a good usage of ones time in providing a condensed pile of methodologies to pass to the uninformed. "

It ranks right up there with Climbing Mount Improbable and River out of Eden. Dawkins writes beautifully, especially for a scientist, with a combination of erudition and wit. I have a fairly strong background in science, but I don't think that this book would be too much of a slog for the intelligent humanities-based reader. The book's subtitle is The Evidence for Evolution, and the case he makes is cogent and convincing (although he's definitely preaching to the choir with this reader.)"

68,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"Unfortunately Richard Dawkins preceded this book with the book, The God Delusion. He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the ""theory"" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design. The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design. Sic Transit Intelligent Design.It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.Enough about evolution. What about the book?In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.For myself I suggest the following.The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievement"
69,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"Most educated people know the basics of evolution, so some of the topics covered in the book will already be familiar. The benefit of reading it is that Richard Dawkins covers all of the major areas, and so can fill in a few of the blanks that all of us have to one extent or the other. It covers the fossil record in depth, showing the relationships between living things past and present, and has a good discussion on “missing links.” He makes the point that the only reason we can divide the fossil record into different species is because of the gaps in that record. The slow changes over evolutionary time would have been imperceptible to anyone seeing the plants or animals while they were alive, and at no point could an observer have looked at something and said that it was a different species than its parents. In fact, the normal variation within the species would have been greater than any individual incremental evolutionary change. Only because of the breaks in the fossil record can we recognize the slow changes over time.Carbon-14, is the standard dating technique for plants and animals having lived within the past 50,000 years, but I did not know where it came from, and found Dawkins’ explanation quite interesting.Carbon-14 is special because it is continually being made by cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere. Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the atmosphere and its mass number is 14, the same as carbon-14’s. The difference is that carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons…. Cosmic ray particles are capable of hitting a proton in a nitrogen nucleus and converting it to a neutron. When this happens, the atom becomes carbon-14, carbon being one lower than nitrogen in the periodic table.Although we normally think of evolutionary time as taking place over millennia, Dawkins describes several experiments that showed major changes can happen very quickly. There was a fascinating experiment that tracked the changes in bacteria over many generation as they differentiated from their parent stock. There was also an experiment on zebra fish which showed that, in the absence of predators, the males evolved bright colors to attract females, but with predators present they quickly evolved duller spotted patterns to mimic the color of the stream bottom.He also makes a good point about sexual reproduction, in that when a living creature is conceived, it is only a “blending” of mother and father when looked at from a high level. At the DNA level, however, what gets passed are genes, which are either/or: any particular gene either comes from one parent or it comes from the other. They are never a blend of the two, although sometimes, for several reasons, they can pick up a mutation. There is an old Creationist argument that natural selection could not work because any new beneficial traits would be swamped as they blended into the existing traits of the general population, but if genes pass down intact, the helpful ones could spread.In his discussion of how modern molecular genetics has helped understand evolution, Dawkins makes an interesting point when explaining how scientists determine how closely related two species are:The human/dog cell should theoretically have an identical resemblance score to the chimpanzee/dog cell because humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same degree of relation to dogs. It should be identical, too, to the monkey/dog cell and the lemur/dog cell. This is because humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and lemurs are all connected to the dog via their common ancestor, an early primate (which probably looked a bit like a lemur). One of evolution’s most powerful arguments is that life evolved only once. This is a well known statement, but Dawkins makes it after he has brought to bear a great deal of evidence from many different fields of study, and when he finally presents it the reader gets a sense of its majesty. We are all truly connected, from the simplest bacteria to the most complicated creatures.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Richard Dawkins book if he didn’t take some well deserved swipes at Creationists. Were it not for their baleful influence on science and education, there would be something pathetically funny about them: they believe because they believe because they believe, and no amount of evidence or logic will change their minds. It reminded me of the saying that faith is not an argument, but the absence of arguments.I enjoyed this book. Because I already had a layman’s understanding of evolution, I wasn’t sure how much I would learn from it, but it was definitely worth the time. It filled in a number of gaps in my understanding, and expanded on the areas I was familiar with. It makes a strong case for evolution being, as the title says, the greatest show on earth."
70,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,3,"Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, in the same league as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Neil deGrasse Tyson. What stands out in the works of these people is their unwavering loyalty to Truth and Reason. They are not the sort of persons that can take an affront to Knowledge lying down. All of them are outright atheists that don’t mince words when it comes to attacking the superstitious and stupid religious beliefs. This is the third work of Dawkins that I am reading, after having gone through ‘The God Delusion’ and ‘The Magic of Reality’. Dawkins continues in the same vein as in those two books, but this book is turning the heat up for the ‘Creationists’ – those that believe that a god created this universe, our planet and all the life forms that populate it, within the last 10000 years or so. Dawkins builds a citadel from which the Evolutionists – those of us that believe that the planet Earth is about 4.6 billion years and all the life forms that we see in front of our eyes today evolved through natural genetic modification – can fight the ignorance of the ‘Creationists’. And, what a citadel has he built! I don’t think that a staunch believer of the religious version of ‘Creation’ will be moved by this book well enough to reverse his/her views, but this book will nevertheless end up causing a dent in his/her belief. Be it plants, animals or the multitude of bacterial and vermin life forms, Dawkins pulls them all up to stand as witness to the survival of their ancestors in the long gone past and their evolution by ‘natural selection’. Dawkins also arms all the ‘Evolutionists’ and ‘Darwinists’ with enough arsenal to fight back the stupid questions raised by the ‘Creationists’. ‘If men evolved from monkeys why are there monkeys still around?’, for example.But one thing that I couldn’t stomach in this book is that, while trying to build a citadel of facts and arguments strong enough to be unassailable by the ‘Creationists’, Dawkins seems to have become too obsessed with the details to the extent of ignoring the normal, laymen like me that couldn’t grasp science beyond a certain level, at least for now. You need to have a fair knowledge of genes to understand the book. In the previous two books, I found the words of Dawkins having a smooth flow. The same is lacking here. His random jumping between the topics and cross-referencing details in other chapters and even in his other books doesn’t make matters easy either. A good book to read, if you prefer reading books that are slow and heavy. Though this lacks the usual flow and wit of Richard Dawkins, it is a worthy shot in the arm if you are someone that ends up arguing with the ‘Believers’ every now and then."
71,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The Greatest Show On Earth: The Evidence for Evolution""I like most, but not all, of Richard Dawkins' books, especially ones such as ""The Selfish Gene"" where he is adding real new insights into how evolution works (and doesn't work). I gave his book-before-last, ""The God Delusion"", a pass, because it appeared to have all the charm and insight of a typical Internet rant. Dawkins is at his best when he talks about the topics he loves (biology), and at his worst when he talks about the topics he hates (religion).Fortunately, in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", he mostly sticks to what he loves. He describes this book as a sort of, ""oh, I should have said"", in which he goes back to describe the basic facts about evolution. In ""The Selfish Gene"", ""The Blind Watchmaker"", ""Climbing Mount Improbable"", and his other evolution-related books, he was taking it as given and discussing the more subtle aspects which are not covered in basic discussions. For this reason, I was not certain if I wanted to read this books, since, you know, I already took high school biology.The reality is, though, that Dawkins knows (or has at his disposal) an astonishing and delightful range of biological facts and short stories, from primates (current and extinct), dinosaurs, worms, a Monty Python parody of ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" (ok that one's not exactly biology), crab bodies imagined as rubber-sheet transformations of one another, and on and on.In particular I can commend Dawkins for his use of graphics. The technology used for making books in the 19th and 20th century led to an entirely regrettable reliance on exclusively print texts, which computer-controlled printing is only slowly undoing. In addition to the wonderful color insets, Dawkins has graphs, line drawings, and other imagery sprinkled liberally through the book. The greatest part of the history of books included pictures with the words; let's hope Dawkins becomes less of an exception in the 21st century.In addition, let's hope he sticks to topics he loves in future books. He's much more fun to read that way."
72,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277727-emily,0,"Richard Dawkins has set out to challenge Creationists with his new book ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."" As someone who was taught evolution by one of the most hardcore nuns in my Catholic school, I've always found Creationism somewhat baffling. Isn't ""faith"" believing in spite of evidence? Not pretending the evidence doesn't exist? In my personal canon, I rather like the idea that the ""clay"" God made Adam out of in the Bible is actually RNA. All live evolved from this, not just human life. I suppose this is neither here nor there. But it doesn't seem hard to reoncile evolution with God to me. If you created a universe, wouldn't you come up with some process by which the world could govern itself instead of having to deal with every little problem? I think you would. Anyway, Dawkins says this book is intended to convince Creationists that they are wrong. I don't think it will do that. They will just ignore this book as they ignore the rest of his work. I'm not sure there is any book that can be written that would convince people who are already certain, but it's not this one. (Perhaps if someone who was on the fence wrote a memoir about examining the evidence?) Dawkins's tone is a bit too superior. I listened to this on CD and I rather thought he was silently adding ""those idiots"" whenever he said ""history deniers"" (the phrase he uses for Creationists). Those who disagree are more like to shut the book before reading a whole chapter. So I think the main audience for this book will be people who already believe in Evolution who want to start fights with Creationists on the Internet. "
73,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,3,"This book does a decent job of explaning evolution, though I have two criticisms: First, the format suffers organizationally. The book is written as a rebuttal to creationist arguments, but Dawkins addresses those arguments by interspersing them, in no coherent order, within affirmative evidence for evolution. A bettter way to format the book would have been to model it after a good legal brief. Present the affirmative case for evolution first, then address creationist counterarguments second. Second, Dawkin exhibits unnecesary hostility toward those who believe in creationism. There is no good reason to be so disrespectful of their beliefs. To him, it's as if teaching children creationism is one of the world's greatest evils. At worst, however, teaching children creationism is only teaching them a false belief. Moreover, while many Americans (and others) believe in creationism, most (even by his own account) do not. The trend, if anything, is toward believing in evolution, so there's no reason to get so worked up about it. Dawkin's defensiveness and hostility actually render his book less persuasive, because he comes across as a radical, or extremist. For example, Dawkins repeats the phrase ""evolution is a fact"" perhaps several dozen times, as if saying it will necessarily make it so. If evolution if a fact, say it once and move on. In sum, a more level-headed approach would not only have made the book more persausive, but also a more enjoyable read. "
74,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"44% of Americans believe that humans were created by god about ten thousand years ago. I admire that Richard Dawkins' stamina in fighting the good fight but he's not going about it very effectively. He sounds pretentious. He uses technical terms quite frequently, to the point that I can barely keep up (and I have reasonable background in the area already). He repeatedly insults and mocks people who do not accept what he sees to be completely self-evident. The argument is not strung together too neatly and his time/resource allocation is also slightly questionable. You can feel his pain and sympathize, but if he wanted to be more effective he would have to surrender some of his ego first, which I don't think he can do very well.I personally read this book because I was curious to see what evidence from the animal kingdom Dawkins would select as his best ammunition and how he would structure the argument. I emerged slightly disappointed: by the tone, the flow, the structure, and the selection. If there is someone out there who would like to learn more about evolution I would instead recommend looking at some very well-produced videos on YouTube."

Although, I did have to google search some concepts because I didn't remember enough biology 101 foundations from undergrad (the embryology chapter killed me! but thankfully I've revived since). So, if you are evolution theory ignorant (because what I remember from high school and basic bio in college has pretty much left my brain by now), this is a great read to pick up and brush up those corners of your brain. And Dawkins tends to stick more to the biology is this one, rather than condescending (as much) to the religious which is generally my criticism for any atheist works of his, so yup... read it. "

I agree with him that it's pretty disheartening that so many people just out right reject evolution, without observing ANY evidence, but you also can't tell unbelievers that they are basically stupid because of their religion and expect people to care to listen to your argument.

He lays out complex scientific topics in easy-enough ways for a layperson to understand, explains things in entertaining ways at times, and uses a variety of studies and arguments to make his case. I think his scientific arguments are flawed (see this book), but he also makes some good points at times and I can appreciate certain arguments while disagreeing with them.That being said, while I could respect Dawkins when he was talking about science, his arguments were laughably bad when it came to philosophy. Dawkins tries to seriously argue that the presence of pain in gazelles disproves a creator, the fact that trees try to ""compete"" with each other for who can be the tallest disproves a creator, and the fact that predators don't prey ""optimally"" disproves a creator, among other things. His lack of understanding for what the intelligent design movement argues and his college-freshman-level understanding of philosophy hurt his credibility in my book. For someone who makes a big deal about non-scientists misinterpreting science, he really should be more careful before delving into philosophy as a non-philosopher.Overall, I appreciated reading this book to better understand scientific arguments against the creationist/intelligent design positions. Didn't persuade me, but it was well-argued (sans the philosophy bits).Rating: 3.5-4 Stars (Good)."

85,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Back in the 60‘s, the Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species and Descent of Man was probably the single greatest inspiration for me to study biology and eventually get a degree in that major. I was not an atheist back in those days. I’m not sure I am totally one today? I have many, many problems with organized religion. I cannot nor will I ever believe that I could be a member of such a community. However, I have not given up on the idea that there might not be some intelligent design to things. It’s just not the intelligence of Richard Dawkins.Think about it, Richard. I’ll bet that you believe their is a high probability that there is life and possibly even intelligence somewhere else in the universe. Would it be intelligence as we know it do you suppose?Publishers Weekly commented, ""If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book [GSoE] he should pick up.” The review then goes on to say that “Dawkins remains a superb translator of complex scientific concepts....he has a way of making the drollest details feel like a revelation."" I support the first part of that review but not the second. I think that Charles Darwin was that person who could so superbly articulate and make clear complex, scientific concepts. Richard Dawkins has a problem.The author of The Greatest Show on Earth, Richard Dawkins, is a self-described militant atheist. For me, therein lies the “greatest” problem with this book and others he has written. I have no problem with Dawkins’ atheism. I understand his militancy. But all of that, particularly rapped up in vehement emotion seems incongruent with a book on science. Unless perhaps in the study of behaviorism, science loses its authenticity in the presence of emotion. It ceases to be legitimate science and begins to sound more like the “circus” he is trying to debunk. In most of his books, Dawkins makes a passionate argument against the influence of religion around the teaching of evolution. Or maybe one should say the influence of religion on Not teaching evolution. I understand that and I completely support his thesis. However, for the same reason, I just do not believe that his anti-religious rants belong in a book that purports to teach science any more than speculation on creationism belongs in the classroom. Both seem to cheapen the discipline of science itself. As hard as Dawkins tries to separate Church, State and secular education, it is in this trying that his books lose their scientific punch. There was a lot to like about GSoE. Reading about evolution again, I relived with much of the same excitement I had had back in those days when, as that teenager, I was introduced to evolution. But all of Dawkins’ bashing and defensiveness diminishes the sheer enjoyment of reading and reveling in the beauty that is Charles Darwin all by himself. What Dawkins has to say about separating Church and State and education needs desperately to be said and needs to be listened to. A book all about that and without all the biology would be fine. It would make more sense and probably be more widely read. One book, Richard, maybe one book of the ilk of GSoE would make sense, but an entire library devoted to this? Come on..... Sounds almost like a crusade that you would argue against so ardently. Discover magazine called Richard Dawkins ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" for his “fierce and effective defense of evolution.” I believe that speaks a disservice to the genus canids. In today’s world, anyone with half a brain knows that evolution requires no more of defense than that of the heliocentric solar system. But yes, our schools and curricula do need defense from religious zealots. Let’s just keep the fact of evolution separate from the theory that it’s not. The socio-political and religious arguments for teaching creationism to the exclusion or at least the demeaning of evolution are strong, large and looming enough targets to go after on their own. The breath and depth of science in this book only muddys up that water. Do I care that a recent Gallup poll concluded that 44 percent of Americans believed a god created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years and that beliefs in Europe are not much different? You bet I care. I just do not think folks like Dawkins are going to change that thinking with books like this. You want to know about evolution? Read Charles Darwin first. Go to the master himself. He is totally approachable and his science reads like beautiful prose. You want religious influences out of public schools, join the PTA or vote for the right candidate. In its totality, I subscribe to all that Dawkins posits. It's only the messenger that I'd like to kill."
86,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Although Dawkins doesn't seem to realize that you can't reason someone away from a position they don't hold by reason, so trying to arm people to counter the arguments of evolution 'skeptics' is a futile endeavor; however, getting a lot of the gaps filled in about evolution is a fascinating subject for us dilettantes who accept that science isn't intentionally lying to us and are interested in how the accepted science came to be accepted.Yes, those are ironic quotes around the word skeptics, because metaphorically waving ones hands and repeating nuh-uh isn't really skepticism, it's willful ignorance.So, sure, one may hear from science deniers that evolution isn't science because you can't test it in a lab. People that claim that are both wrong about the necessity of a lab to test a hypothesis, and the claim that evolution hasn't been tested in a lab. There are experiments where evolution has been demonstrated in a lab - bacteria that have multiple generations in a day, so that evolutionary timelines are years instead of millennia. And the bacteria adapt. Is this good to read about because it will help you convince somebody who's invested in not believing evolution? Of course not. You can't change anybody's mind. Only they can, and if they've predetermined they won't change their mind you're wasting your time. But it's cool as heck. The experiment, that is. And Dawkins explains it, perfectly striking the balance between making it accessible to the layperson, without leaving out substance.Is the anecdote wherein a denier, who couldn't accept that random mutations could advance from a single cell to a complete human, with a nervous system, miles of blood vessels, sight, hearing, etc., might arise in billions of years, was confronted with the observation that she accomplished it herself in nine months, going to even begin to sway someone who's dug in their heels? Duh no. But the chapter about how we're metaphorical origami rather than constructions from blueprints elucidates so much, and makes the observations that humans have gills early in embryonic development, as birds have teeth and bony tails, make sense. These aren't flukes, they're expected observations of undesigned results of millions of random prototypes.So, please don't tell Dawkins I said this, because I hate to crush a dream, but the book works for unintended reasons. It's a great survey course in evolution. It cannot work to sway your extended family at Thanksgiving because they aren't genuinely interested in allowing their minds to be changed. And one thing dumb ol' evolution hasn't accomplished yet is allowing objective evidence to force someone to change their minds. Apparently there's no competitive advantage in it."

Why is it so difficult to believe in the evidence shoved in your face but just way too easy to believe in naked beings eating forbidden fruit and unleashing horrors in the world? A conversation with my dear mother or a close friend can make anyone fly off the handle. Senseless logic is in abundance. I am a very patient person except when it comes religion. I see no reason why I should be.A brilliant article in September by a well-known science professor about religion and science led to him receiving death threats. Yes, that is the ugly world we live in, a sad truth. Freedom of expression, of speech these rights belong to every person as long as they don’t use it. That’s how it works now a days.  ”The history-deniers themselves are among those that I am trying to reach in this book.”So listen carefully.”As for the claim that evolution has never been ‘proved’, proof is a notion that scientists have been intimidated into mistrusting. Influential philosophers tell us we can’t prove anything in science. Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution. Evolution is a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere. Though logic-choppers rule the town,* some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.”Dawkins is persistent and rightly so. Why would you disprove something that is true? If you are a creationist, do give Dawkins a chance. You might rethink your views. Enough of all this.The book begins with ‘theory’. What we do mean when use this word in a sentence? What do creationists mean when they use this word? The difference is major and explained wonderfully with the true meaning. Dawkins goes on to follow evolution from earlier times, depending on the species. Why are there so many different breeds of dogs suddenly when there were only a few back in the 18-19th centuries? Questions like this and many more are answered. We have come a long way from Darwin’s Origin of Species. More things are known today than Darwin knew back then when he was writing his masterpiece. ”Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips . . . continue the list as long as desired. That didn’t have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn’t. It didn’t have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it”Highly recommended."
88,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340159-amanda,4,"Approaching this with an education (albeit only just over half an undergrad degree for now) in evolutionary biology was a rather different experience, I would imagine, than approaching it with minimal knowledge of the subject matter. As it stands, I liked the book; I thought it was well put together and used some really classic as well as some really new and exciting examples of experiments that have been done and discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of evolution. But I also have some complaints and differences of opinion with it. The book seems to be a bit bipolar in terms of its intended audience. Obviously Dawkins wants to write for his usual fan base/ the generally curious and somewhat scientifically literate public. But another major aim of the book is to try and educate creationists. So it ends up switching back and forth between explaining the simplest of things (common sense stuff for anyone who's ever taken grade 9 or 10 science) and assuming you know them already. The end result is that the text patronizes even the layman reader while alienating the scientifically illiterate creationist who will not be able to grasp the concepts completely.Now, there are a few things I take issue with in terms of how he explains certain evolutionary concepts, but these are mostly nitty gritty details that I think could be worded to better convey the information without creating common misconceptions and thus aren't really worth focusing on too much. He doesn't really do evolutionary forces other than natural selection much justice (specifically random genetic drift), but as a friend of mine said: ""Just getting the idea of natural selection across to creationists is a challenge; bring out genetic drift and the shit will start to fly. One step at a time, here!""I think my major issue with the book pops up in the introduction. After explaining the scientific use of the word ""theory"" and contrasting it with the colloquial use, Dawkins decides that in order to avoid misconceptions, it would be best to use a different term. So he decides to make up a word. He borrows the mathematical term ""theorem"" and purposes misspells it ""theorum"". The ""theorum"" of evolution. He could just have easily referred to it as the fact of evolution, which is what he actually does for the rest of the book, only mentioning ""theorum"" once or twice more near the end. The whole thing is an exercise in futility and doesn't really do anything towards his goal of promoting scientific literacy. It just makes him sound silly. Although I suppose that ""theorum"" does sound better than if he were to purposely misspell ""law"" as ""luw"" of evolution.In spite of all the criticisms I've put forward, it actually is a good summary of evolutionary theory and deserves to be widely read. If we could make textbooks as engaging as this, I suspect that many more people would understand evolution and be less susceptible to creationist misinformation."
89,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is most certainly one of the best, most entertaining, and most interesting non-fiction books I’ve ever read. There is of course no doubt in this world anymore about Richard Dawkins’ amazing capabilities to put together a comprehensive, concise, yet thorough text on evolution that makes one want to keep reading, in search of even more interesting facts than the last few he’s brought forth.Dawkins describes this book as the ‘missing link’ in the impressive chain of books he’s written up until now: The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is meant as a book on the evidence for evolution, instead of being very much about the theory itself. And of course, as a highly intelligent evolutionary biologist, Dawkins more than succeeds in presenting evidence for evolution, using photos on coloured pages, diagrams, illustrations, and many other visual aids next to his own written word.He writes with humour and wit about all the amazingly interesting examples of evolution he puts forth, many of which were yet unknown to me, and shows how much passion and enthusiasm he has for this field. Reading this book made me almost feel giddy at times, and definitely brought me joy. Dawkins gives the reader a lot in this book: he doesn’t only provide evidence on evolution, but he also tackles a few arguments of creationists on evolution (the point where he stresses that the fossil record actually isn’t even needed as evidence for evolution is particularly strong, especially because it seems so overlooked). Critique on Dawkins and his work has sometimes been about his aggressive tone or his tendency to continue beating down creationists; I didn’t consider this to be a problem in The Greatest Show on Earth, nor did I think Dawkins was aggressive in any way. The creationists’ views are valid and contemporary in the discussion on the evidence of evolution, and I didn’t feel as if he was purposefully dragging them into this book.I would most certainly highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, with no exceptions. It’s a lovely, engaging, and interesting book that’s most definitely well-worth a read."

But his tone in arguing with believers in literal Biblical creation is annoying and condesending. Although I am firmly convinced of Darwin's theory, I think it's possible that religious writings such as the Bible (I am not all that familiar with any other holy books, I'm afraid) can be excused and interpreted by understanding the obvious: that people at the time of the writing did not have the knowledge we now have, and they made sense of things in the only way they knew how. Creating the earth in 6 days was meaningless at the time because what defines a day in the birth of the solar system? I can't come up with any science to rationalize the rib story, but as far as the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that's a pretty obvious reference to the origins of human consciousness, as in, they became self-aware and realized they were (gasp) naked. I doubt there was any snake involved but possibly the snake is a metaphor for evil/cunning; at any rate, I would not be surprised if the trouble was started by a woman.Dawkins makes no attempt at any understanding of his opponents, which is fine I guess, but to me, a good book looks at both sides."
91,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,4,"This work has to be a thorn in the side to all creationists. Dawkins refutes the most frequently put forward theories and sometimes simple lies and fairy tales of the modern creationists with clear evidence from an evolutionary standpoint.He provides several explanations for each example given from the animal and plant world and clearly explains why ""Darwin was right"".I found it unbelievable that, according to official surveys, so many people seriously believe that the world we know with all its diversity was only created 10,000 years ago."
92,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6794439-marius-masalar,3,"This is a challenging book to assess. My first question, upon finishing it, is ""who is this for?""The science is too involved for a scientifically illiterate fundamentalist creationist audience, the sardonic tone likewise off-putting to them, and the atheists like me who share his broad perspective hardly need a hand-held walk through the garden of nature's wonders and weirdnesses.Then again, maybe we do: it should be emphasised that this book makes for a fantastic full spectrum look at the subject of evolutionary theory, one complete with some excellent analogies, stunning facts, and wise correlations. Anyone with a high school level understanding of biology will be more than equipped to follow along and learn.Unfortunately, Dawkins' extensive expertise in the subject matter often falls prey to his fairly direct sense of humour, expressed via a mocking tone that does more to further the stereotype of him as a shrill British ponce than to reveal his truer nature as a passionate humanist.Inevitably, I am drawn to wonder what the inimitable Christopher Hitchens would have done with a similar task, equipped with Dawkins' subject expertise. I suspect his subtler wit, fantastically evocative writing, and sophisticated understanding of debate would have produced a finer work.Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend The Greatest Show On Earth to anyone who seeks a peerless introduction to the current state of evolutionary theory, or to a thicker-skinned creationist seeking to inform themselves about the opposing side in the debate about the origins of life."
93,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,5,"Dawkins latest book finally tackles creationism in a not-so-head-on collision. Always vowing to never answer a challenge directly, Dawkins does it in the best way he possibly could, by demonstrating why evolution is true.He seemingly leaves no stone uncovered in the challenge, often tackling direct claims made by creationists and demonstrating why they are false. He also covers how speciation has been observed and the whole ""show me your transitional fossils"" non-argument is handled masterfully. By demonstrating selective breeding of plants and animals by humans, he shows how easily and quickly humans have created new species within a couple of generations.Illustrated with images, colour plates and excellent description, Dawkins knows how to hold the reader's attention and to explain even the most complex scientific terms in easy to understand language. I'm not sure why this book was written though. In 2009, Jerry Coyne released ""Why Evolution is True"" which though I have not yet read, I imagine covers many similar themes and evidences.The other issue is of course that this book is NOT going to be read by the very people it is directed at. Creationists, despite their protests of ""teaching the controversy"" and ""academic freedom"", are not interested in understanding what evolution is. Those who are going to buy it and read it are those already convinced by the evidence for an old earth, natural selection and evolution by common descent, so the question must be asked in the words of Daniel Dennett... cui bono?See more book reviews at my blog"
94,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: ""'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution."" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the ""intelligent design"" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point."

Too informal to be authoritative and too casual to be something one could refer someone to this book fits into the wide middle of Dawkins book which are summed up as ""nice but someone else has done it better"".Dawkins' books seem to grow out a nagging urge to yell something at the world and ""the point"" is poorly spread across sprawling chapters that reference across each other suggesting the book could have been better organized. The color plate system makes it easy to ""spoil"" section as it's not obvious what picture is being referred to.One section does stand head-and-shoulders above others in the discussion of dating tools. I never realized that tree-ring dating was as powerful as shown here, providing us a 12 millenia time-line in some places.

I have a fairly strong background in science, but I don't think that this book would be too much of a slog for the intelligent humanities-based reader.

98,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"Unfortunately Richard Dawkins preceded this book with the book, The God Delusion. He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the ""theory"" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design. The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design. Sic Transit Intelligent Design.It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.Enough about evolution. What about the book?In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.For myself I suggest the following.The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievement"

The benefit of reading it is that Richard Dawkins covers all of the major areas, and so can fill in a few of the blanks that all of us have to one extent or the other. It covers the fossil record in depth, showing the relationships between living things past and present, and has a good discussion on “missing links.” He makes the point that the only reason we can divide the fossil record into different species is because of the gaps in that record. The slow changes over evolutionary time would have been imperceptible to anyone seeing the plants or animals while they were alive, and at no point could an observer have looked at something and said that it was a different species than its parents. In fact, the normal variation within the species would have been greater than any individual incremental evolutionary change. Only because of the breaks in the fossil record can we recognize the slow changes over time.Carbon-14, is the standard dating technique for plants and animals having lived within the past 50,000 years, but I did not know where it came from, and found Dawkins’ explanation quite interesting.Carbon-14 is special because it is continually being made by cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere. Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the atmosphere and its mass number is 14, the same as carbon-14’s. The difference is that carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons…. Cosmic ray particles are capable of hitting a proton in a nitrogen nucleus and converting it to a neutron. When this happens, the atom becomes carbon-14, carbon being one lower than nitrogen in the periodic table.Although we normally think of evolutionary time as taking place over millennia, Dawkins describes several experiments that showed major changes can happen very quickly. There was a fascinating experiment that tracked the changes in bacteria over many generation as they differentiated from their parent stock. There was also an experiment on zebra fish which showed that, in the absence of predators, the males evolved bright colors to attract females, but with predators present they quickly evolved duller spotted patterns to mimic the color of the stream bottom.He also makes a good point about sexual reproduction, in that when a living creature is conceived, it is only a “blending” of mother and father when looked at from a high level. At the DNA level, however, what gets passed are genes, which are either/or: any particular gene either comes from one parent or it comes from the other. They are never a blend of the two, although sometimes, for several reasons, they can pick up a mutation. There is an old Creationist argument that natural selection could not work because any new beneficial traits would be swamped as they blended into the existing traits of the general population, but if genes pass down intact, the helpful ones could spread.In his discussion of how modern molecular genetics has helped understand evolution, Dawkins makes an interesting point when explaining how scientists determine how closely related two species are:The human/dog cell should theoretically have an identical resemblance score to the chimpanzee/dog cell because humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same degree of relation to dogs. It should be identical, too, to the monkey/dog cell and the lemur/dog cell. This is because humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and lemurs are all connected to the dog via their common ancestor, an early primate (which probably looked a bit like a lemur). One of evolution’s most powerful arguments is that life evolved only once. This is a well known statement, but Dawkins makes it after he has brought to bear a great deal of evidence from many different fields of study, and when he finally presents it the reader gets a sense of its majesty. We are all truly connected, from the simplest bacteria to the most complicated creatures.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Richard Dawkins book if he didn’t take some well deserved swipes at Creationists. Were it not for their baleful influence on science and education, there would be something pathetically funny about them: they believe because they believe because they believe, and no amount of evidence or logic will change their minds. It reminded me of the saying that faith is not an argument, but the absence of arguments.I enjoyed this book. Because I already had a layman’s understanding of evolution, I wasn’t sure how much I would learn from it, but it was definitely worth the time. It filled in a number of gaps in my understanding, and expanded on the areas I was familiar with. It makes a strong case for evolution being, as the title says, the greatest show on earth."
100,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,3,"Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, in the same league as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Neil deGrasse Tyson. What stands out in the works of these people is their unwavering loyalty to Truth and Reason. They are not the sort of persons that can take an affront to Knowledge lying down. All of them are outright atheists that don’t mince words when it comes to attacking the superstitious and stupid religious beliefs. This is the third work of Dawkins that I am reading, after having gone through ‘The God Delusion’ and ‘The Magic of Reality’. Dawkins continues in the same vein as in those two books, but this book is turning the heat up for the ‘Creationists’ – those that believe that a god created this universe, our planet and all the life forms that populate it, within the last 10000 years or so. Dawkins builds a citadel from which the Evolutionists – those of us that believe that the planet Earth is about 4.6 billion years and all the life forms that we see in front of our eyes today evolved through natural genetic modification – can fight the ignorance of the ‘Creationists’. And, what a citadel has he built! I don’t think that a staunch believer of the religious version of ‘Creation’ will be moved by this book well enough to reverse his/her views, but this book will nevertheless end up causing a dent in his/her belief. Be it plants, animals or the multitude of bacterial and vermin life forms, Dawkins pulls them all up to stand as witness to the survival of their ancestors in the long gone past and their evolution by ‘natural selection’. Dawkins also arms all the ‘Evolutionists’ and ‘Darwinists’ with enough arsenal to fight back the stupid questions raised by the ‘Creationists’. ‘If men evolved from monkeys why are there monkeys still around?’, for example.But one thing that I couldn’t stomach in this book is that, while trying to build a citadel of facts and arguments strong enough to be unassailable by the ‘Creationists’, Dawkins seems to have become too obsessed with the details to the extent of ignoring the normal, laymen like me that couldn’t grasp science beyond a certain level, at least for now. You need to have a fair knowledge of genes to understand the book. In the previous two books, I found the words of Dawkins having a smooth flow. The same is lacking here. His random jumping between the topics and cross-referencing details in other chapters and even in his other books doesn’t make matters easy either. A good book to read, if you prefer reading books that are slow and heavy. Though this lacks the usual flow and wit of Richard Dawkins, it is a worthy shot in the arm if you are someone that ends up arguing with the ‘Believers’ every now and then."
101,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The Greatest Show On Earth: The Evidence for Evolution""I like most, but not all, of Richard Dawkins' books, especially ones such as ""The Selfish Gene"" where he is adding real new insights into how evolution works (and doesn't work). I gave his book-before-last, ""The God Delusion"", a pass, because it appeared to have all the charm and insight of a typical Internet rant. Dawkins is at his best when he talks about the topics he loves (biology), and at his worst when he talks about the topics he hates (religion).Fortunately, in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", he mostly sticks to what he loves. He describes this book as a sort of, ""oh, I should have said"", in which he goes back to describe the basic facts about evolution. In ""The Selfish Gene"", ""The Blind Watchmaker"", ""Climbing Mount Improbable"", and his other evolution-related books, he was taking it as given and discussing the more subtle aspects which are not covered in basic discussions. For this reason, I was not certain if I wanted to read this books, since, you know, I already took high school biology.The reality is, though, that Dawkins knows (or has at his disposal) an astonishing and delightful range of biological facts and short stories, from primates (current and extinct), dinosaurs, worms, a Monty Python parody of ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" (ok that one's not exactly biology), crab bodies imagined as rubber-sheet transformations of one another, and on and on.In particular I can commend Dawkins for his use of graphics. The technology used for making books in the 19th and 20th century led to an entirely regrettable reliance on exclusively print texts, which computer-controlled printing is only slowly undoing. In addition to the wonderful color insets, Dawkins has graphs, line drawings, and other imagery sprinkled liberally through the book. The greatest part of the history of books included pictures with the words; let's hope Dawkins becomes less of an exception in the 21st century.In addition, let's hope he sticks to topics he loves in future books. He's much more fun to read that way."
102,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277727-emily,0,"Richard Dawkins has set out to challenge Creationists with his new book ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."" As someone who was taught evolution by one of the most hardcore nuns in my Catholic school, I've always found Creationism somewhat baffling. Isn't ""faith"" believing in spite of evidence? Not pretending the evidence doesn't exist? In my personal canon, I rather like the idea that the ""clay"" God made Adam out of in the Bible is actually RNA. All live evolved from this, not just human life. I suppose this is neither here nor there. But it doesn't seem hard to reoncile evolution with God to me. If you created a universe, wouldn't you come up with some process by which the world could govern itself instead of having to deal with every little problem? I think you would. Anyway, Dawkins says this book is intended to convince Creationists that they are wrong. I don't think it will do that. They will just ignore this book as they ignore the rest of his work. I'm not sure there is any book that can be written that would convince people who are already certain, but it's not this one. (Perhaps if someone who was on the fence wrote a memoir about examining the evidence?) Dawkins's tone is a bit too superior. I listened to this on CD and I rather thought he was silently adding ""those idiots"" whenever he said ""history deniers"" (the phrase he uses for Creationists). Those who disagree are more like to shut the book before reading a whole chapter. So I think the main audience for this book will be people who already believe in Evolution who want to start fights with Creationists on the Internet. "
103,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,3,"This book does a decent job of explaning evolution, though I have two criticisms: First, the format suffers organizationally. The book is written as a rebuttal to creationist arguments, but Dawkins addresses those arguments by interspersing them, in no coherent order, within affirmative evidence for evolution. A bettter way to format the book would have been to model it after a good legal brief. Present the affirmative case for evolution first, then address creationist counterarguments second. Second, Dawkin exhibits unnecesary hostility toward those who believe in creationism. There is no good reason to be so disrespectful of their beliefs. To him, it's as if teaching children creationism is one of the world's greatest evils. At worst, however, teaching children creationism is only teaching them a false belief. Moreover, while many Americans (and others) believe in creationism, most (even by his own account) do not. The trend, if anything, is toward believing in evolution, so there's no reason to get so worked up about it. Dawkin's defensiveness and hostility actually render his book less persuasive, because he comes across as a radical, or extremist. For example, Dawkins repeats the phrase ""evolution is a fact"" perhaps several dozen times, as if saying it will necessarily make it so. If evolution if a fact, say it once and move on. In sum, a more level-headed approach would not only have made the book more persausive, but also a more enjoyable read. "
104,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"44% of Americans believe that humans were created by god about ten thousand years ago. I admire that Richard Dawkins' stamina in fighting the good fight but he's not going about it very effectively. He sounds pretentious. He uses technical terms quite frequently, to the point that I can barely keep up (and I have reasonable background in the area already). He repeatedly insults and mocks people who do not accept what he sees to be completely self-evident. The argument is not strung together too neatly and his time/resource allocation is also slightly questionable. You can feel his pain and sympathize, but if he wanted to be more effective he would have to surrender some of his ego first, which I don't think he can do very well.I personally read this book because I was curious to see what evidence from the animal kingdom Dawkins would select as his best ammunition and how he would structure the argument. I emerged slightly disappointed: by the tone, the flow, the structure, and the selection. If there is someone out there who would like to learn more about evolution I would instead recommend looking at some very well-produced videos on YouTube."
105,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4745220-alicja,5,"rating: 5/5It was sometimes a tough read but it presents the evidence for evolution in a clear and concise manner that is accessible to non-biologists. Although, I did have to google search some concepts because I didn't remember enough biology 101 foundations from undergrad (the embryology chapter killed me! but thankfully I've revived since). So, if you are evolution theory ignorant (because what I remember from high school and basic bio in college has pretty much left my brain by now), this is a great read to pick up and brush up those corners of your brain. And Dawkins tends to stick more to the biology is this one, rather than condescending (as much) to the religious which is generally my criticism for any atheist works of his, so yup... read it. "
106,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35090771-guat-n,5,"As the title suggests, this book is about evolution, but the author goes through a little geology, embryology, anatomy, paleontology, computer simulations, real-life experiments, amino acids and radioactive decay to support his arguments, which is a bonus.Otro punto a favor es que mientras leía este libro, me acordaba constantemente de este video y se me alegraba el día."
107,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,4,"Very thorough and compelling evidence for the case of evolution, but I feel that Mr. Dawkins would have gotten his point across in a much more convincing fashion if he had left out the constant jabs at religion. I agree with him that it's pretty disheartening that so many people just out right reject evolution, without observing ANY evidence, but you also can't tell unbelievers that they are basically stupid because of their religion and expect people to care to listen to your argument.

113,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31260727-josiah,4,"As a creationist, I disagree with a lot of the ways that Dawkins interprets scientific studies and don't agree with most of his conclusions, but I have to give credit where credit is due: this is, by and large, a good argument for macro-evolution. He lays out complex scientific topics in easy-enough ways for a layperson to understand, explains things in entertaining ways at times, and uses a variety of studies and arguments to make his case. I think his scientific arguments are flawed (see this book), but he also makes some good points at times and I can appreciate certain arguments while disagreeing with them.That being said, while I could respect Dawkins when he was talking about science, his arguments were laughably bad when it came to philosophy. Dawkins tries to seriously argue that the presence of pain in gazelles disproves a creator, the fact that trees try to ""compete"" with each other for who can be the tallest disproves a creator, and the fact that predators don't prey ""optimally"" disproves a creator, among other things. His lack of understanding for what the intelligent design movement argues and his college-freshman-level understanding of philosophy hurt his credibility in my book. For someone who makes a big deal about non-scientists misinterpreting science, he really should be more careful before delving into philosophy as a non-philosopher.Overall, I appreciated reading this book to better understand scientific arguments against the creationist/intelligent design positions. Didn't persuade me, but it was well-argued (sans the philosophy bits).Rating: 3.5-4 Stars (Good)."

115,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Back in the 60‘s, the Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species and Descent of Man was probably the single greatest inspiration for me to study biology and eventually get a degree in that major. I was not an atheist back in those days. I’m not sure I am totally one today? I have many, many problems with organized religion. I cannot nor will I ever believe that I could be a member of such a community. However, I have not given up on the idea that there might not be some intelligent design to things. It’s just not the intelligence of Richard Dawkins.Think about it, Richard. I’ll bet that you believe their is a high probability that there is life and possibly even intelligence somewhere else in the universe. Would it be intelligence as we know it do you suppose?Publishers Weekly commented, ""If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book [GSoE] he should pick up.” The review then goes on to say that “Dawkins remains a superb translator of complex scientific concepts....he has a way of making the drollest details feel like a revelation."" I support the first part of that review but not the second. I think that Charles Darwin was that person who could so superbly articulate and make clear complex, scientific concepts. Richard Dawkins has a problem.The author of The Greatest Show on Earth, Richard Dawkins, is a self-described militant atheist. For me, therein lies the “greatest” problem with this book and others he has written. I have no problem with Dawkins’ atheism. I understand his militancy. But all of that, particularly rapped up in vehement emotion seems incongruent with a book on science. Unless perhaps in the study of behaviorism, science loses its authenticity in the presence of emotion. It ceases to be legitimate science and begins to sound more like the “circus” he is trying to debunk. In most of his books, Dawkins makes a passionate argument against the influence of religion around the teaching of evolution. Or maybe one should say the influence of religion on Not teaching evolution. I understand that and I completely support his thesis. However, for the same reason, I just do not believe that his anti-religious rants belong in a book that purports to teach science any more than speculation on creationism belongs in the classroom. Both seem to cheapen the discipline of science itself. As hard as Dawkins tries to separate Church, State and secular education, it is in this trying that his books lose their scientific punch. There was a lot to like about GSoE. Reading about evolution again, I relived with much of the same excitement I had had back in those days when, as that teenager, I was introduced to evolution. But all of Dawkins’ bashing and defensiveness diminishes the sheer enjoyment of reading and reveling in the beauty that is Charles Darwin all by himself. What Dawkins has to say about separating Church and State and education needs desperately to be said and needs to be listened to. A book all about that and without all the biology would be fine. It would make more sense and probably be more widely read. One book, Richard, maybe one book of the ilk of GSoE would make sense, but an entire library devoted to this? Come on..... Sounds almost like a crusade that you would argue against so ardently. Discover magazine called Richard Dawkins ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" for his “fierce and effective defense of evolution.” I believe that speaks a disservice to the genus canids. In today’s world, anyone with half a brain knows that evolution requires no more of defense than that of the heliocentric solar system. But yes, our schools and curricula do need defense from religious zealots. Let’s just keep the fact of evolution separate from the theory that it’s not. The socio-political and religious arguments for teaching creationism to the exclusion or at least the demeaning of evolution are strong, large and looming enough targets to go after on their own. The breath and depth of science in this book only muddys up that water. Do I care that a recent Gallup poll concluded that 44 percent of Americans believed a god created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years and that beliefs in Europe are not much different? You bet I care. I just do not think folks like Dawkins are going to change that thinking with books like this. You want to know about evolution? Read Charles Darwin first. Go to the master himself. He is totally approachable and his science reads like beautiful prose. You want religious influences out of public schools, join the PTA or vote for the right candidate. In its totality, I subscribe to all that Dawkins posits. It's only the messenger that I'd like to kill."
116,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Although Dawkins doesn't seem to realize that you can't reason someone away from a position they don't hold by reason, so trying to arm people to counter the arguments of evolution 'skeptics' is a futile endeavor; however, getting a lot of the gaps filled in about evolution is a fascinating subject for us dilettantes who accept that science isn't intentionally lying to us and are interested in how the accepted science came to be accepted.Yes, those are ironic quotes around the word skeptics, because metaphorically waving ones hands and repeating nuh-uh isn't really skepticism, it's willful ignorance.So, sure, one may hear from science deniers that evolution isn't science because you can't test it in a lab. People that claim that are both wrong about the necessity of a lab to test a hypothesis, and the claim that evolution hasn't been tested in a lab. There are experiments where evolution has been demonstrated in a lab - bacteria that have multiple generations in a day, so that evolutionary timelines are years instead of millennia. And the bacteria adapt. Is this good to read about because it will help you convince somebody who's invested in not believing evolution? Of course not. You can't change anybody's mind. Only they can, and if they've predetermined they won't change their mind you're wasting your time. But it's cool as heck. The experiment, that is. And Dawkins explains it, perfectly striking the balance between making it accessible to the layperson, without leaving out substance.Is the anecdote wherein a denier, who couldn't accept that random mutations could advance from a single cell to a complete human, with a nervous system, miles of blood vessels, sight, hearing, etc., might arise in billions of years, was confronted with the observation that she accomplished it herself in nine months, going to even begin to sway someone who's dug in their heels? Duh no. But the chapter about how we're metaphorical origami rather than constructions from blueprints elucidates so much, and makes the observations that humans have gills early in embryonic development, as birds have teeth and bony tails, make sense. These aren't flukes, they're expected observations of undesigned results of millions of random prototypes.So, please don't tell Dawkins I said this, because I hate to crush a dream, but the book works for unintended reasons. It's a great survey course in evolution. It cannot work to sway your extended family at Thanksgiving because they aren't genuinely interested in allowing their minds to be changed. And one thing dumb ol' evolution hasn't accomplished yet is allowing objective evidence to force someone to change their minds. Apparently there's no competitive advantage in it."

Why is it so difficult to believe in the evidence shoved in your face but just way too easy to believe in naked beings eating forbidden fruit and unleashing horrors in the world? A conversation with my dear mother or a close friend can make anyone fly off the handle. Senseless logic is in abundance. I am a very patient person except when it comes religion. I see no reason why I should be.A brilliant article in September by a well-known science professor about religion and science led to him receiving death threats. Yes, that is the ugly world we live in, a sad truth. Freedom of expression, of speech these rights belong to every person as long as they don’t use it. That’s how it works now a days.  ”The history-deniers themselves are among those that I am trying to reach in this book.”So listen carefully.”As for the claim that evolution has never been ‘proved’, proof is a notion that scientists have been intimidated into mistrusting. Influential philosophers tell us we can’t prove anything in science. Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution. Evolution is a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere. Though logic-choppers rule the town,* some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.”Dawkins is persistent and rightly so. Why would you disprove something that is true? If you are a creationist, do give Dawkins a chance. You might rethink your views. Enough of all this.The book begins with ‘theory’. What we do mean when use this word in a sentence? What do creationists mean when they use this word? The difference is major and explained wonderfully with the true meaning. Dawkins goes on to follow evolution from earlier times, depending on the species. Why are there so many different breeds of dogs suddenly when there were only a few back in the 18-19th centuries? Questions like this and many more are answered. We have come a long way from Darwin’s Origin of Species. More things are known today than Darwin knew back then when he was writing his masterpiece. ”Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips . . . continue the list as long as desired. That didn’t have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn’t. It didn’t have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it”Highly recommended."
118,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340159-amanda,4,"Approaching this with an education (albeit only just over half an undergrad degree for now) in evolutionary biology was a rather different experience, I would imagine, than approaching it with minimal knowledge of the subject matter. As it stands, I liked the book; I thought it was well put together and used some really classic as well as some really new and exciting examples of experiments that have been done and discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of evolution. But I also have some complaints and differences of opinion with it. The book seems to be a bit bipolar in terms of its intended audience. Obviously Dawkins wants to write for his usual fan base/ the generally curious and somewhat scientifically literate public. But another major aim of the book is to try and educate creationists. So it ends up switching back and forth between explaining the simplest of things (common sense stuff for anyone who's ever taken grade 9 or 10 science) and assuming you know them already. The end result is that the text patronizes even the layman reader while alienating the scientifically illiterate creationist who will not be able to grasp the concepts completely.Now, there are a few things I take issue with in terms of how he explains certain evolutionary concepts, but these are mostly nitty gritty details that I think could be worded to better convey the information without creating common misconceptions and thus aren't really worth focusing on too much. He doesn't really do evolutionary forces other than natural selection much justice (specifically random genetic drift), but as a friend of mine said: ""Just getting the idea of natural selection across to creationists is a challenge; bring out genetic drift and the shit will start to fly. One step at a time, here!""I think my major issue with the book pops up in the introduction. After explaining the scientific use of the word ""theory"" and contrasting it with the colloquial use, Dawkins decides that in order to avoid misconceptions, it would be best to use a different term. So he decides to make up a word. He borrows the mathematical term ""theorem"" and purposes misspells it ""theorum"". The ""theorum"" of evolution. He could just have easily referred to it as the fact of evolution, which is what he actually does for the rest of the book, only mentioning ""theorum"" once or twice more near the end. The whole thing is an exercise in futility and doesn't really do anything towards his goal of promoting scientific literacy. It just makes him sound silly. Although I suppose that ""theorum"" does sound better than if he were to purposely misspell ""law"" as ""luw"" of evolution.In spite of all the criticisms I've put forward, it actually is a good summary of evolutionary theory and deserves to be widely read. If we could make textbooks as engaging as this, I suspect that many more people would understand evolution and be less susceptible to creationist misinformation."
119,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is most certainly one of the best, most entertaining, and most interesting non-fiction books I’ve ever read. There is of course no doubt in this world anymore about Richard Dawkins’ amazing capabilities to put together a comprehensive, concise, yet thorough text on evolution that makes one want to keep reading, in search of even more interesting facts than the last few he’s brought forth.Dawkins describes this book as the ‘missing link’ in the impressive chain of books he’s written up until now: The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is meant as a book on the evidence for evolution, instead of being very much about the theory itself. And of course, as a highly intelligent evolutionary biologist, Dawkins more than succeeds in presenting evidence for evolution, using photos on coloured pages, diagrams, illustrations, and many other visual aids next to his own written word.He writes with humour and wit about all the amazingly interesting examples of evolution he puts forth, many of which were yet unknown to me, and shows how much passion and enthusiasm he has for this field. Reading this book made me almost feel giddy at times, and definitely brought me joy. Dawkins gives the reader a lot in this book: he doesn’t only provide evidence on evolution, but he also tackles a few arguments of creationists on evolution (the point where he stresses that the fossil record actually isn’t even needed as evidence for evolution is particularly strong, especially because it seems so overlooked). Critique on Dawkins and his work has sometimes been about his aggressive tone or his tendency to continue beating down creationists; I didn’t consider this to be a problem in The Greatest Show on Earth, nor did I think Dawkins was aggressive in any way. The creationists’ views are valid and contemporary in the discussion on the evidence of evolution, and I didn’t feel as if he was purposefully dragging them into this book.I would most certainly highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, with no exceptions. It’s a lovely, engaging, and interesting book that’s most definitely well-worth a read."

But his tone in arguing with believers in literal Biblical creation is annoying and condesending. Although I am firmly convinced of Darwin's theory, I think it's possible that religious writings such as the Bible (I am not all that familiar with any other holy books, I'm afraid) can be excused and interpreted by understanding the obvious: that people at the time of the writing did not have the knowledge we now have, and they made sense of things in the only way they knew how. Creating the earth in 6 days was meaningless at the time because what defines a day in the birth of the solar system? I can't come up with any science to rationalize the rib story, but as far as the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that's a pretty obvious reference to the origins of human consciousness, as in, they became self-aware and realized they were (gasp) naked. I doubt there was any snake involved but possibly the snake is a metaphor for evil/cunning; at any rate, I would not be surprised if the trouble was started by a woman.Dawkins makes no attempt at any understanding of his opponents, which is fine I guess, but to me, a good book looks at both sides."
121,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,4,"This work has to be a thorn in the side to all creationists. Dawkins refutes the most frequently put forward theories and sometimes simple lies and fairy tales of the modern creationists with clear evidence from an evolutionary standpoint.He provides several explanations for each example given from the animal and plant world and clearly explains why ""Darwin was right"".I found it unbelievable that, according to official surveys, so many people seriously believe that the world we know with all its diversity was only created 10,000 years ago."

My first question, upon finishing it, is ""who is this for?""The science is too involved for a scientifically illiterate fundamentalist creationist audience, the sardonic tone likewise off-putting to them, and the atheists like me who share his broad perspective hardly need a hand-held walk through the garden of nature's wonders and weirdnesses.Then again, maybe we do: it should be emphasised that this book makes for a fantastic full spectrum look at the subject of evolutionary theory, one complete with some excellent analogies, stunning facts, and wise correlations. Anyone with a high school level understanding of biology will be more than equipped to follow along and learn.Unfortunately, Dawkins' extensive expertise in the subject matter often falls prey to his fairly direct sense of humour, expressed via a mocking tone that does more to further the stereotype of him as a shrill British ponce than to reveal his truer nature as a passionate humanist.Inevitably, I am drawn to wonder what the inimitable Christopher Hitchens would have done with a similar task, equipped with Dawkins' subject expertise. I suspect his subtler wit, fantastically evocative writing, and sophisticated understanding of debate would have produced a finer work.Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend The Greatest Show On Earth to anyone who seeks a peerless introduction to the current state of evolutionary theory, or to a thicker-skinned creationist seeking to inform themselves about the opposing side in the debate about the origins of life."
123,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,5,"Dawkins latest book finally tackles creationism in a not-so-head-on collision. Always vowing to never answer a challenge directly, Dawkins does it in the best way he possibly could, by demonstrating why evolution is true.He seemingly leaves no stone uncovered in the challenge, often tackling direct claims made by creationists and demonstrating why they are false. He also covers how speciation has been observed and the whole ""show me your transitional fossils"" non-argument is handled masterfully. By demonstrating selective breeding of plants and animals by humans, he shows how easily and quickly humans have created new species within a couple of generations.Illustrated with images, colour plates and excellent description, Dawkins knows how to hold the reader's attention and to explain even the most complex scientific terms in easy to understand language. I'm not sure why this book was written though. In 2009, Jerry Coyne released ""Why Evolution is True"" which though I have not yet read, I imagine covers many similar themes and evidences.The other issue is of course that this book is NOT going to be read by the very people it is directed at. Creationists, despite their protests of ""teaching the controversy"" and ""academic freedom"", are not interested in understanding what evolution is. Those who are going to buy it and read it are those already convinced by the evidence for an old earth, natural selection and evolution by common descent, so the question must be asked in the words of Daniel Dennett... cui bono?See more book reviews at my blog"
124,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: ""'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution."" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the ""intelligent design"" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point."
125,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"Ironically a book on evolution would be a chimera of textbook, polemic, and panegyric it does none of those things particularly well. Too informal to be authoritative and too casual to be something one could refer someone to this book fits into the wide middle of Dawkins book which are summed up as ""nice but someone else has done it better"".Dawkins' books seem to grow out a nagging urge to yell something at the world and ""the point"" is poorly spread across sprawling chapters that reference across each other suggesting the book could have been better organized. The color plate system makes it easy to ""spoil"" section as it's not obvious what picture is being referred to.One section does stand head-and-shoulders above others in the discussion of dating tools. I never realized that tree-ring dating was as powerful as shown here, providing us a 12 millenia time-line in some places. If you can get it from your library or otherwise without cost, reading these sections is a good usage of ones time in providing a condensed pile of methodologies to pass to the uninformed. "

It ranks right up there with Climbing Mount Improbable and River out of Eden. Dawkins writes beautifully, especially for a scientist, with a combination of erudition and wit. I have a fairly strong background in science, but I don't think that this book would be too much of a slog for the intelligent humanities-based reader. The book's subtitle is The Evidence for Evolution, and the case he makes is cogent and convincing (although he's definitely preaching to the choir with this reader.)"

128,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"Unfortunately Richard Dawkins preceded this book with the book, The God Delusion. He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the ""theory"" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design. The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design. Sic Transit Intelligent Design.It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.Enough about evolution. What about the book?In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.For myself I suggest the following.The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievement"
129,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"Most educated people know the basics of evolution, so some of the topics covered in the book will already be familiar. The benefit of reading it is that Richard Dawkins covers all of the major areas, and so can fill in a few of the blanks that all of us have to one extent or the other. It covers the fossil record in depth, showing the relationships between living things past and present, and has a good discussion on “missing links.” He makes the point that the only reason we can divide the fossil record into different species is because of the gaps in that record. The slow changes over evolutionary time would have been imperceptible to anyone seeing the plants or animals while they were alive, and at no point could an observer have looked at something and said that it was a different species than its parents. In fact, the normal variation within the species would have been greater than any individual incremental evolutionary change. Only because of the breaks in the fossil record can we recognize the slow changes over time.Carbon-14, is the standard dating technique for plants and animals having lived within the past 50,000 years, but I did not know where it came from, and found Dawkins’ explanation quite interesting.Carbon-14 is special because it is continually being made by cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere. Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the atmosphere and its mass number is 14, the same as carbon-14’s. The difference is that carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons…. Cosmic ray particles are capable of hitting a proton in a nitrogen nucleus and converting it to a neutron. When this happens, the atom becomes carbon-14, carbon being one lower than nitrogen in the periodic table.Although we normally think of evolutionary time as taking place over millennia, Dawkins describes several experiments that showed major changes can happen very quickly. There was a fascinating experiment that tracked the changes in bacteria over many generation as they differentiated from their parent stock. There was also an experiment on zebra fish which showed that, in the absence of predators, the males evolved bright colors to attract females, but with predators present they quickly evolved duller spotted patterns to mimic the color of the stream bottom.He also makes a good point about sexual reproduction, in that when a living creature is conceived, it is only a “blending” of mother and father when looked at from a high level. At the DNA level, however, what gets passed are genes, which are either/or: any particular gene either comes from one parent or it comes from the other. They are never a blend of the two, although sometimes, for several reasons, they can pick up a mutation. There is an old Creationist argument that natural selection could not work because any new beneficial traits would be swamped as they blended into the existing traits of the general population, but if genes pass down intact, the helpful ones could spread.In his discussion of how modern molecular genetics has helped understand evolution, Dawkins makes an interesting point when explaining how scientists determine how closely related two species are:The human/dog cell should theoretically have an identical resemblance score to the chimpanzee/dog cell because humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same degree of relation to dogs. It should be identical, too, to the monkey/dog cell and the lemur/dog cell. This is because humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and lemurs are all connected to the dog via their common ancestor, an early primate (which probably looked a bit like a lemur). One of evolution’s most powerful arguments is that life evolved only once. This is a well known statement, but Dawkins makes it after he has brought to bear a great deal of evidence from many different fields of study, and when he finally presents it the reader gets a sense of its majesty. We are all truly connected, from the simplest bacteria to the most complicated creatures.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Richard Dawkins book if he didn’t take some well deserved swipes at Creationists. Were it not for their baleful influence on science and education, there would be something pathetically funny about them: they believe because they believe because they believe, and no amount of evidence or logic will change their minds. It reminded me of the saying that faith is not an argument, but the absence of arguments.I enjoyed this book. Because I already had a layman’s understanding of evolution, I wasn’t sure how much I would learn from it, but it was definitely worth the time. It filled in a number of gaps in my understanding, and expanded on the areas I was familiar with. It makes a strong case for evolution being, as the title says, the greatest show on earth."
130,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,3,"Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, in the same league as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Neil deGrasse Tyson. What stands out in the works of these people is their unwavering loyalty to Truth and Reason. They are not the sort of persons that can take an affront to Knowledge lying down. All of them are outright atheists that don’t mince words when it comes to attacking the superstitious and stupid religious beliefs. This is the third work of Dawkins that I am reading, after having gone through ‘The God Delusion’ and ‘The Magic of Reality’. Dawkins continues in the same vein as in those two books, but this book is turning the heat up for the ‘Creationists’ – those that believe that a god created this universe, our planet and all the life forms that populate it, within the last 10000 years or so. Dawkins builds a citadel from which the Evolutionists – those of us that believe that the planet Earth is about 4.6 billion years and all the life forms that we see in front of our eyes today evolved through natural genetic modification – can fight the ignorance of the ‘Creationists’. And, what a citadel has he built! I don’t think that a staunch believer of the religious version of ‘Creation’ will be moved by this book well enough to reverse his/her views, but this book will nevertheless end up causing a dent in his/her belief. Be it plants, animals or the multitude of bacterial and vermin life forms, Dawkins pulls them all up to stand as witness to the survival of their ancestors in the long gone past and their evolution by ‘natural selection’. Dawkins also arms all the ‘Evolutionists’ and ‘Darwinists’ with enough arsenal to fight back the stupid questions raised by the ‘Creationists’. ‘If men evolved from monkeys why are there monkeys still around?’, for example.But one thing that I couldn’t stomach in this book is that, while trying to build a citadel of facts and arguments strong enough to be unassailable by the ‘Creationists’, Dawkins seems to have become too obsessed with the details to the extent of ignoring the normal, laymen like me that couldn’t grasp science beyond a certain level, at least for now. You need to have a fair knowledge of genes to understand the book. In the previous two books, I found the words of Dawkins having a smooth flow. The same is lacking here. His random jumping between the topics and cross-referencing details in other chapters and even in his other books doesn’t make matters easy either. A good book to read, if you prefer reading books that are slow and heavy. Though this lacks the usual flow and wit of Richard Dawkins, it is a worthy shot in the arm if you are someone that ends up arguing with the ‘Believers’ every now and then."
131,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The Greatest Show On Earth: The Evidence for Evolution""I like most, but not all, of Richard Dawkins' books, especially ones such as ""The Selfish Gene"" where he is adding real new insights into how evolution works (and doesn't work). I gave his book-before-last, ""The God Delusion"", a pass, because it appeared to have all the charm and insight of a typical Internet rant. Dawkins is at his best when he talks about the topics he loves (biology), and at his worst when he talks about the topics he hates (religion).Fortunately, in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", he mostly sticks to what he loves. He describes this book as a sort of, ""oh, I should have said"", in which he goes back to describe the basic facts about evolution. In ""The Selfish Gene"", ""The Blind Watchmaker"", ""Climbing Mount Improbable"", and his other evolution-related books, he was taking it as given and discussing the more subtle aspects which are not covered in basic discussions. For this reason, I was not certain if I wanted to read this books, since, you know, I already took high school biology.The reality is, though, that Dawkins knows (or has at his disposal) an astonishing and delightful range of biological facts and short stories, from primates (current and extinct), dinosaurs, worms, a Monty Python parody of ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" (ok that one's not exactly biology), crab bodies imagined as rubber-sheet transformations of one another, and on and on.In particular I can commend Dawkins for his use of graphics. The technology used for making books in the 19th and 20th century led to an entirely regrettable reliance on exclusively print texts, which computer-controlled printing is only slowly undoing. In addition to the wonderful color insets, Dawkins has graphs, line drawings, and other imagery sprinkled liberally through the book. The greatest part of the history of books included pictures with the words; let's hope Dawkins becomes less of an exception in the 21st century.In addition, let's hope he sticks to topics he loves in future books. He's much more fun to read that way."
132,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277727-emily,0,"Richard Dawkins has set out to challenge Creationists with his new book ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."" As someone who was taught evolution by one of the most hardcore nuns in my Catholic school, I've always found Creationism somewhat baffling. Isn't ""faith"" believing in spite of evidence? Not pretending the evidence doesn't exist? In my personal canon, I rather like the idea that the ""clay"" God made Adam out of in the Bible is actually RNA. All live evolved from this, not just human life. I suppose this is neither here nor there. But it doesn't seem hard to reoncile evolution with God to me. If you created a universe, wouldn't you come up with some process by which the world could govern itself instead of having to deal with every little problem? I think you would. Anyway, Dawkins says this book is intended to convince Creationists that they are wrong. I don't think it will do that. They will just ignore this book as they ignore the rest of his work. I'm not sure there is any book that can be written that would convince people who are already certain, but it's not this one. (Perhaps if someone who was on the fence wrote a memoir about examining the evidence?) Dawkins's tone is a bit too superior. I listened to this on CD and I rather thought he was silently adding ""those idiots"" whenever he said ""history deniers"" (the phrase he uses for Creationists). Those who disagree are more like to shut the book before reading a whole chapter. So I think the main audience for this book will be people who already believe in Evolution who want to start fights with Creationists on the Internet. "
133,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,3,"This book does a decent job of explaning evolution, though I have two criticisms: First, the format suffers organizationally. The book is written as a rebuttal to creationist arguments, but Dawkins addresses those arguments by interspersing them, in no coherent order, within affirmative evidence for evolution. A bettter way to format the book would have been to model it after a good legal brief. Present the affirmative case for evolution first, then address creationist counterarguments second. Second, Dawkin exhibits unnecesary hostility toward those who believe in creationism. There is no good reason to be so disrespectful of their beliefs. To him, it's as if teaching children creationism is one of the world's greatest evils. At worst, however, teaching children creationism is only teaching them a false belief. Moreover, while many Americans (and others) believe in creationism, most (even by his own account) do not. The trend, if anything, is toward believing in evolution, so there's no reason to get so worked up about it. Dawkin's defensiveness and hostility actually render his book less persuasive, because he comes across as a radical, or extremist. For example, Dawkins repeats the phrase ""evolution is a fact"" perhaps several dozen times, as if saying it will necessarily make it so. If evolution if a fact, say it once and move on. In sum, a more level-headed approach would not only have made the book more persausive, but also a more enjoyable read. "

I admire that Richard Dawkins' stamina in fighting the good fight but he's not going about it very effectively. He sounds pretentious. He uses technical terms quite frequently, to the point that I can barely keep up (and I have reasonable background in the area already). He repeatedly insults and mocks people who do not accept what he sees to be completely self-evident. The argument is not strung together too neatly and his time/resource allocation is also slightly questionable. You can feel his pain and sympathize, but if he wanted to be more effective he would have to surrender some of his ego first, which I don't think he can do very well.I personally read this book because I was curious to see what evidence from the animal kingdom Dawkins would select as his best ammunition and how he would structure the argument. I emerged slightly disappointed: by the tone, the flow, the structure, and the selection. If there is someone out there who would like to learn more about evolution I would instead recommend looking at some very well-produced videos on YouTube."

Although, I did have to google search some concepts because I didn't remember enough biology 101 foundations from undergrad (the embryology chapter killed me! but thankfully I've revived since). So, if you are evolution theory ignorant (because what I remember from high school and basic bio in college has pretty much left my brain by now), this is a great read to pick up and brush up those corners of your brain. And Dawkins tends to stick more to the biology is this one, rather than condescending (as much) to the religious which is generally my criticism for any atheist works of his, so yup... read it. "

I agree with him that it's pretty disheartening that so many people just out right reject evolution, without observing ANY evidence, but you also can't tell unbelievers that they are basically stupid because of their religion and expect people to care to listen to your argument.

143,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31260727-josiah,4,"As a creationist, I disagree with a lot of the ways that Dawkins interprets scientific studies and don't agree with most of his conclusions, but I have to give credit where credit is due: this is, by and large, a good argument for macro-evolution. He lays out complex scientific topics in easy-enough ways for a layperson to understand, explains things in entertaining ways at times, and uses a variety of studies and arguments to make his case. I think his scientific arguments are flawed (see this book), but he also makes some good points at times and I can appreciate certain arguments while disagreeing with them.That being said, while I could respect Dawkins when he was talking about science, his arguments were laughably bad when it came to philosophy. Dawkins tries to seriously argue that the presence of pain in gazelles disproves a creator, the fact that trees try to ""compete"" with each other for who can be the tallest disproves a creator, and the fact that predators don't prey ""optimally"" disproves a creator, among other things. His lack of understanding for what the intelligent design movement argues and his college-freshman-level understanding of philosophy hurt his credibility in my book. For someone who makes a big deal about non-scientists misinterpreting science, he really should be more careful before delving into philosophy as a non-philosopher.Overall, I appreciated reading this book to better understand scientific arguments against the creationist/intelligent design positions. Didn't persuade me, but it was well-argued (sans the philosophy bits).Rating: 3.5-4 Stars (Good)."

145,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Back in the 60‘s, the Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species and Descent of Man was probably the single greatest inspiration for me to study biology and eventually get a degree in that major. I was not an atheist back in those days. I’m not sure I am totally one today? I have many, many problems with organized religion. I cannot nor will I ever believe that I could be a member of such a community. However, I have not given up on the idea that there might not be some intelligent design to things. It’s just not the intelligence of Richard Dawkins.Think about it, Richard. I’ll bet that you believe their is a high probability that there is life and possibly even intelligence somewhere else in the universe. Would it be intelligence as we know it do you suppose?Publishers Weekly commented, ""If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book [GSoE] he should pick up.” The review then goes on to say that “Dawkins remains a superb translator of complex scientific concepts....he has a way of making the drollest details feel like a revelation."" I support the first part of that review but not the second. I think that Charles Darwin was that person who could so superbly articulate and make clear complex, scientific concepts. Richard Dawkins has a problem.The author of The Greatest Show on Earth, Richard Dawkins, is a self-described militant atheist. For me, therein lies the “greatest” problem with this book and others he has written. I have no problem with Dawkins’ atheism. I understand his militancy. But all of that, particularly rapped up in vehement emotion seems incongruent with a book on science. Unless perhaps in the study of behaviorism, science loses its authenticity in the presence of emotion. It ceases to be legitimate science and begins to sound more like the “circus” he is trying to debunk. In most of his books, Dawkins makes a passionate argument against the influence of religion around the teaching of evolution. Or maybe one should say the influence of religion on Not teaching evolution. I understand that and I completely support his thesis. However, for the same reason, I just do not believe that his anti-religious rants belong in a book that purports to teach science any more than speculation on creationism belongs in the classroom. Both seem to cheapen the discipline of science itself. As hard as Dawkins tries to separate Church, State and secular education, it is in this trying that his books lose their scientific punch. There was a lot to like about GSoE. Reading about evolution again, I relived with much of the same excitement I had had back in those days when, as that teenager, I was introduced to evolution. But all of Dawkins’ bashing and defensiveness diminishes the sheer enjoyment of reading and reveling in the beauty that is Charles Darwin all by himself. What Dawkins has to say about separating Church and State and education needs desperately to be said and needs to be listened to. A book all about that and without all the biology would be fine. It would make more sense and probably be more widely read. One book, Richard, maybe one book of the ilk of GSoE would make sense, but an entire library devoted to this? Come on..... Sounds almost like a crusade that you would argue against so ardently. Discover magazine called Richard Dawkins ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" for his “fierce and effective defense of evolution.” I believe that speaks a disservice to the genus canids. In today’s world, anyone with half a brain knows that evolution requires no more of defense than that of the heliocentric solar system. But yes, our schools and curricula do need defense from religious zealots. Let’s just keep the fact of evolution separate from the theory that it’s not. The socio-political and religious arguments for teaching creationism to the exclusion or at least the demeaning of evolution are strong, large and looming enough targets to go after on their own. The breath and depth of science in this book only muddys up that water. Do I care that a recent Gallup poll concluded that 44 percent of Americans believed a god created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years and that beliefs in Europe are not much different? You bet I care. I just do not think folks like Dawkins are going to change that thinking with books like this. You want to know about evolution? Read Charles Darwin first. Go to the master himself. He is totally approachable and his science reads like beautiful prose. You want religious influences out of public schools, join the PTA or vote for the right candidate. In its totality, I subscribe to all that Dawkins posits. It's only the messenger that I'd like to kill."
146,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Although Dawkins doesn't seem to realize that you can't reason someone away from a position they don't hold by reason, so trying to arm people to counter the arguments of evolution 'skeptics' is a futile endeavor; however, getting a lot of the gaps filled in about evolution is a fascinating subject for us dilettantes who accept that science isn't intentionally lying to us and are interested in how the accepted science came to be accepted.Yes, those are ironic quotes around the word skeptics, because metaphorically waving ones hands and repeating nuh-uh isn't really skepticism, it's willful ignorance.So, sure, one may hear from science deniers that evolution isn't science because you can't test it in a lab. People that claim that are both wrong about the necessity of a lab to test a hypothesis, and the claim that evolution hasn't been tested in a lab. There are experiments where evolution has been demonstrated in a lab - bacteria that have multiple generations in a day, so that evolutionary timelines are years instead of millennia. And the bacteria adapt. Is this good to read about because it will help you convince somebody who's invested in not believing evolution? Of course not. You can't change anybody's mind. Only they can, and if they've predetermined they won't change their mind you're wasting your time. But it's cool as heck. The experiment, that is. And Dawkins explains it, perfectly striking the balance between making it accessible to the layperson, without leaving out substance.Is the anecdote wherein a denier, who couldn't accept that random mutations could advance from a single cell to a complete human, with a nervous system, miles of blood vessels, sight, hearing, etc., might arise in billions of years, was confronted with the observation that she accomplished it herself in nine months, going to even begin to sway someone who's dug in their heels? Duh no. But the chapter about how we're metaphorical origami rather than constructions from blueprints elucidates so much, and makes the observations that humans have gills early in embryonic development, as birds have teeth and bony tails, make sense. These aren't flukes, they're expected observations of undesigned results of millions of random prototypes.So, please don't tell Dawkins I said this, because I hate to crush a dream, but the book works for unintended reasons. It's a great survey course in evolution. It cannot work to sway your extended family at Thanksgiving because they aren't genuinely interested in allowing their minds to be changed. And one thing dumb ol' evolution hasn't accomplished yet is allowing objective evidence to force someone to change their minds. Apparently there's no competitive advantage in it."

Why is it so difficult to believe in the evidence shoved in your face but just way too easy to believe in naked beings eating forbidden fruit and unleashing horrors in the world? A conversation with my dear mother or a close friend can make anyone fly off the handle. Senseless logic is in abundance. I am a very patient person except when it comes religion. I see no reason why I should be.A brilliant article in September by a well-known science professor about religion and science led to him receiving death threats. Yes, that is the ugly world we live in, a sad truth. Freedom of expression, of speech these rights belong to every person as long as they don’t use it. That’s how it works now a days.  ”The history-deniers themselves are among those that I am trying to reach in this book.”So listen carefully.”As for the claim that evolution has never been ‘proved’, proof is a notion that scientists have been intimidated into mistrusting. Influential philosophers tell us we can’t prove anything in science. Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution. Evolution is a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere. Though logic-choppers rule the town,* some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.”Dawkins is persistent and rightly so. Why would you disprove something that is true? If you are a creationist, do give Dawkins a chance. You might rethink your views. Enough of all this.The book begins with ‘theory’. What we do mean when use this word in a sentence? What do creationists mean when they use this word? The difference is major and explained wonderfully with the true meaning. Dawkins goes on to follow evolution from earlier times, depending on the species. Why are there so many different breeds of dogs suddenly when there were only a few back in the 18-19th centuries? Questions like this and many more are answered. We have come a long way from Darwin’s Origin of Species. More things are known today than Darwin knew back then when he was writing his masterpiece. ”Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips . . . continue the list as long as desired. That didn’t have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn’t. It didn’t have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it”Highly recommended."
148,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340159-amanda,4,"Approaching this with an education (albeit only just over half an undergrad degree for now) in evolutionary biology was a rather different experience, I would imagine, than approaching it with minimal knowledge of the subject matter. As it stands, I liked the book; I thought it was well put together and used some really classic as well as some really new and exciting examples of experiments that have been done and discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of evolution. But I also have some complaints and differences of opinion with it. The book seems to be a bit bipolar in terms of its intended audience. Obviously Dawkins wants to write for his usual fan base/ the generally curious and somewhat scientifically literate public. But another major aim of the book is to try and educate creationists. So it ends up switching back and forth between explaining the simplest of things (common sense stuff for anyone who's ever taken grade 9 or 10 science) and assuming you know them already. The end result is that the text patronizes even the layman reader while alienating the scientifically illiterate creationist who will not be able to grasp the concepts completely.Now, there are a few things I take issue with in terms of how he explains certain evolutionary concepts, but these are mostly nitty gritty details that I think could be worded to better convey the information without creating common misconceptions and thus aren't really worth focusing on too much. He doesn't really do evolutionary forces other than natural selection much justice (specifically random genetic drift), but as a friend of mine said: ""Just getting the idea of natural selection across to creationists is a challenge; bring out genetic drift and the shit will start to fly. One step at a time, here!""I think my major issue with the book pops up in the introduction. After explaining the scientific use of the word ""theory"" and contrasting it with the colloquial use, Dawkins decides that in order to avoid misconceptions, it would be best to use a different term. So he decides to make up a word. He borrows the mathematical term ""theorem"" and purposes misspells it ""theorum"". The ""theorum"" of evolution. He could just have easily referred to it as the fact of evolution, which is what he actually does for the rest of the book, only mentioning ""theorum"" once or twice more near the end. The whole thing is an exercise in futility and doesn't really do anything towards his goal of promoting scientific literacy. It just makes him sound silly. Although I suppose that ""theorum"" does sound better than if he were to purposely misspell ""law"" as ""luw"" of evolution.In spite of all the criticisms I've put forward, it actually is a good summary of evolutionary theory and deserves to be widely read. If we could make textbooks as engaging as this, I suspect that many more people would understand evolution and be less susceptible to creationist misinformation."
149,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is most certainly one of the best, most entertaining, and most interesting non-fiction books I’ve ever read. There is of course no doubt in this world anymore about Richard Dawkins’ amazing capabilities to put together a comprehensive, concise, yet thorough text on evolution that makes one want to keep reading, in search of even more interesting facts than the last few he’s brought forth.Dawkins describes this book as the ‘missing link’ in the impressive chain of books he’s written up until now: The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is meant as a book on the evidence for evolution, instead of being very much about the theory itself. And of course, as a highly intelligent evolutionary biologist, Dawkins more than succeeds in presenting evidence for evolution, using photos on coloured pages, diagrams, illustrations, and many other visual aids next to his own written word.He writes with humour and wit about all the amazingly interesting examples of evolution he puts forth, many of which were yet unknown to me, and shows how much passion and enthusiasm he has for this field. Reading this book made me almost feel giddy at times, and definitely brought me joy. Dawkins gives the reader a lot in this book: he doesn’t only provide evidence on evolution, but he also tackles a few arguments of creationists on evolution (the point where he stresses that the fossil record actually isn’t even needed as evidence for evolution is particularly strong, especially because it seems so overlooked). Critique on Dawkins and his work has sometimes been about his aggressive tone or his tendency to continue beating down creationists; I didn’t consider this to be a problem in The Greatest Show on Earth, nor did I think Dawkins was aggressive in any way. The creationists’ views are valid and contemporary in the discussion on the evidence of evolution, and I didn’t feel as if he was purposefully dragging them into this book.I would most certainly highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, with no exceptions. It’s a lovely, engaging, and interesting book that’s most definitely well-worth a read."
150,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,2,"I feel like I've had a Dawkins overload; maybe that's why I wasn't all that thrilled with this book, although some parts are very interesting (the part about dating from rings on trees and that sort of thing.) But his tone in arguing with believers in literal Biblical creation is annoying and condesending. Although I am firmly convinced of Darwin's theory, I think it's possible that religious writings such as the Bible (I am not all that familiar with any other holy books, I'm afraid) can be excused and interpreted by understanding the obvious: that people at the time of the writing did not have the knowledge we now have, and they made sense of things in the only way they knew how. Creating the earth in 6 days was meaningless at the time because what defines a day in the birth of the solar system? I can't come up with any science to rationalize the rib story, but as far as the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that's a pretty obvious reference to the origins of human consciousness, as in, they became self-aware and realized they were (gasp) naked. I doubt there was any snake involved but possibly the snake is a metaphor for evil/cunning; at any rate, I would not be surprised if the trouble was started by a woman.Dawkins makes no attempt at any understanding of his opponents, which is fine I guess, but to me, a good book looks at both sides."
151,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,4,"This work has to be a thorn in the side to all creationists. Dawkins refutes the most frequently put forward theories and sometimes simple lies and fairy tales of the modern creationists with clear evidence from an evolutionary standpoint.He provides several explanations for each example given from the animal and plant world and clearly explains why ""Darwin was right"".I found it unbelievable that, according to official surveys, so many people seriously believe that the world we know with all its diversity was only created 10,000 years ago."
152,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6794439-marius-masalar,3,"This is a challenging book to assess. My first question, upon finishing it, is ""who is this for?""The science is too involved for a scientifically illiterate fundamentalist creationist audience, the sardonic tone likewise off-putting to them, and the atheists like me who share his broad perspective hardly need a hand-held walk through the garden of nature's wonders and weirdnesses.Then again, maybe we do: it should be emphasised that this book makes for a fantastic full spectrum look at the subject of evolutionary theory, one complete with some excellent analogies, stunning facts, and wise correlations. Anyone with a high school level understanding of biology will be more than equipped to follow along and learn.Unfortunately, Dawkins' extensive expertise in the subject matter often falls prey to his fairly direct sense of humour, expressed via a mocking tone that does more to further the stereotype of him as a shrill British ponce than to reveal his truer nature as a passionate humanist.Inevitably, I am drawn to wonder what the inimitable Christopher Hitchens would have done with a similar task, equipped with Dawkins' subject expertise. I suspect his subtler wit, fantastically evocative writing, and sophisticated understanding of debate would have produced a finer work.Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend The Greatest Show On Earth to anyone who seeks a peerless introduction to the current state of evolutionary theory, or to a thicker-skinned creationist seeking to inform themselves about the opposing side in the debate about the origins of life."
153,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,5,"Dawkins latest book finally tackles creationism in a not-so-head-on collision. Always vowing to never answer a challenge directly, Dawkins does it in the best way he possibly could, by demonstrating why evolution is true.He seemingly leaves no stone uncovered in the challenge, often tackling direct claims made by creationists and demonstrating why they are false. He also covers how speciation has been observed and the whole ""show me your transitional fossils"" non-argument is handled masterfully. By demonstrating selective breeding of plants and animals by humans, he shows how easily and quickly humans have created new species within a couple of generations.Illustrated with images, colour plates and excellent description, Dawkins knows how to hold the reader's attention and to explain even the most complex scientific terms in easy to understand language. I'm not sure why this book was written though. In 2009, Jerry Coyne released ""Why Evolution is True"" which though I have not yet read, I imagine covers many similar themes and evidences.The other issue is of course that this book is NOT going to be read by the very people it is directed at. Creationists, despite their protests of ""teaching the controversy"" and ""academic freedom"", are not interested in understanding what evolution is. Those who are going to buy it and read it are those already convinced by the evidence for an old earth, natural selection and evolution by common descent, so the question must be asked in the words of Daniel Dennett... cui bono?See more book reviews at my blog"
154,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: ""'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution."" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the ""intelligent design"" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point."
155,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"Ironically a book on evolution would be a chimera of textbook, polemic, and panegyric it does none of those things particularly well. Too informal to be authoritative and too casual to be something one could refer someone to this book fits into the wide middle of Dawkins book which are summed up as ""nice but someone else has done it better"".Dawkins' books seem to grow out a nagging urge to yell something at the world and ""the point"" is poorly spread across sprawling chapters that reference across each other suggesting the book could have been better organized. The color plate system makes it easy to ""spoil"" section as it's not obvious what picture is being referred to.One section does stand head-and-shoulders above others in the discussion of dating tools. I never realized that tree-ring dating was as powerful as shown here, providing us a 12 millenia time-line in some places. If you can get it from your library or otherwise without cost, reading these sections is a good usage of ones time in providing a condensed pile of methodologies to pass to the uninformed. "

It ranks right up there with Climbing Mount Improbable and River out of Eden. Dawkins writes beautifully, especially for a scientist, with a combination of erudition and wit. I have a fairly strong background in science, but I don't think that this book would be too much of a slog for the intelligent humanities-based reader. The book's subtitle is The Evidence for Evolution, and the case he makes is cogent and convincing (although he's definitely preaching to the choir with this reader.)"

158,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"Unfortunately Richard Dawkins preceded this book with the book, The God Delusion. He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the ""theory"" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design. The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design. Sic Transit Intelligent Design.It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.Enough about evolution. What about the book?In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.For myself I suggest the following.The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievement"

The benefit of reading it is that Richard Dawkins covers all of the major areas, and so can fill in a few of the blanks that all of us have to one extent or the other. It covers the fossil record in depth, showing the relationships between living things past and present, and has a good discussion on “missing links.” He makes the point that the only reason we can divide the fossil record into different species is because of the gaps in that record. The slow changes over evolutionary time would have been imperceptible to anyone seeing the plants or animals while they were alive, and at no point could an observer have looked at something and said that it was a different species than its parents. In fact, the normal variation within the species would have been greater than any individual incremental evolutionary change. Only because of the breaks in the fossil record can we recognize the slow changes over time.Carbon-14, is the standard dating technique for plants and animals having lived within the past 50,000 years, but I did not know where it came from, and found Dawkins’ explanation quite interesting.Carbon-14 is special because it is continually being made by cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere. Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the atmosphere and its mass number is 14, the same as carbon-14’s. The difference is that carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons…. Cosmic ray particles are capable of hitting a proton in a nitrogen nucleus and converting it to a neutron. When this happens, the atom becomes carbon-14, carbon being one lower than nitrogen in the periodic table.Although we normally think of evolutionary time as taking place over millennia, Dawkins describes several experiments that showed major changes can happen very quickly. There was a fascinating experiment that tracked the changes in bacteria over many generation as they differentiated from their parent stock. There was also an experiment on zebra fish which showed that, in the absence of predators, the males evolved bright colors to attract females, but with predators present they quickly evolved duller spotted patterns to mimic the color of the stream bottom.He also makes a good point about sexual reproduction, in that when a living creature is conceived, it is only a “blending” of mother and father when looked at from a high level. At the DNA level, however, what gets passed are genes, which are either/or: any particular gene either comes from one parent or it comes from the other. They are never a blend of the two, although sometimes, for several reasons, they can pick up a mutation. There is an old Creationist argument that natural selection could not work because any new beneficial traits would be swamped as they blended into the existing traits of the general population, but if genes pass down intact, the helpful ones could spread.In his discussion of how modern molecular genetics has helped understand evolution, Dawkins makes an interesting point when explaining how scientists determine how closely related two species are:The human/dog cell should theoretically have an identical resemblance score to the chimpanzee/dog cell because humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same degree of relation to dogs. It should be identical, too, to the monkey/dog cell and the lemur/dog cell. This is because humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and lemurs are all connected to the dog via their common ancestor, an early primate (which probably looked a bit like a lemur). One of evolution’s most powerful arguments is that life evolved only once. This is a well known statement, but Dawkins makes it after he has brought to bear a great deal of evidence from many different fields of study, and when he finally presents it the reader gets a sense of its majesty. We are all truly connected, from the simplest bacteria to the most complicated creatures.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Richard Dawkins book if he didn’t take some well deserved swipes at Creationists. Were it not for their baleful influence on science and education, there would be something pathetically funny about them: they believe because they believe because they believe, and no amount of evidence or logic will change their minds. It reminded me of the saying that faith is not an argument, but the absence of arguments.I enjoyed this book. Because I already had a layman’s understanding of evolution, I wasn’t sure how much I would learn from it, but it was definitely worth the time. It filled in a number of gaps in my understanding, and expanded on the areas I was familiar with. It makes a strong case for evolution being, as the title says, the greatest show on earth."
160,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,3,"Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, in the same league as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Neil deGrasse Tyson. What stands out in the works of these people is their unwavering loyalty to Truth and Reason. They are not the sort of persons that can take an affront to Knowledge lying down. All of them are outright atheists that don’t mince words when it comes to attacking the superstitious and stupid religious beliefs. This is the third work of Dawkins that I am reading, after having gone through ‘The God Delusion’ and ‘The Magic of Reality’. Dawkins continues in the same vein as in those two books, but this book is turning the heat up for the ‘Creationists’ – those that believe that a god created this universe, our planet and all the life forms that populate it, within the last 10000 years or so. Dawkins builds a citadel from which the Evolutionists – those of us that believe that the planet Earth is about 4.6 billion years and all the life forms that we see in front of our eyes today evolved through natural genetic modification – can fight the ignorance of the ‘Creationists’. And, what a citadel has he built! I don’t think that a staunch believer of the religious version of ‘Creation’ will be moved by this book well enough to reverse his/her views, but this book will nevertheless end up causing a dent in his/her belief. Be it plants, animals or the multitude of bacterial and vermin life forms, Dawkins pulls them all up to stand as witness to the survival of their ancestors in the long gone past and their evolution by ‘natural selection’. Dawkins also arms all the ‘Evolutionists’ and ‘Darwinists’ with enough arsenal to fight back the stupid questions raised by the ‘Creationists’. ‘If men evolved from monkeys why are there monkeys still around?’, for example.But one thing that I couldn’t stomach in this book is that, while trying to build a citadel of facts and arguments strong enough to be unassailable by the ‘Creationists’, Dawkins seems to have become too obsessed with the details to the extent of ignoring the normal, laymen like me that couldn’t grasp science beyond a certain level, at least for now. You need to have a fair knowledge of genes to understand the book. In the previous two books, I found the words of Dawkins having a smooth flow. The same is lacking here. His random jumping between the topics and cross-referencing details in other chapters and even in his other books doesn’t make matters easy either. A good book to read, if you prefer reading books that are slow and heavy. Though this lacks the usual flow and wit of Richard Dawkins, it is a worthy shot in the arm if you are someone that ends up arguing with the ‘Believers’ every now and then."
161,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The Greatest Show On Earth: The Evidence for Evolution""I like most, but not all, of Richard Dawkins' books, especially ones such as ""The Selfish Gene"" where he is adding real new insights into how evolution works (and doesn't work). I gave his book-before-last, ""The God Delusion"", a pass, because it appeared to have all the charm and insight of a typical Internet rant. Dawkins is at his best when he talks about the topics he loves (biology), and at his worst when he talks about the topics he hates (religion).Fortunately, in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", he mostly sticks to what he loves. He describes this book as a sort of, ""oh, I should have said"", in which he goes back to describe the basic facts about evolution. In ""The Selfish Gene"", ""The Blind Watchmaker"", ""Climbing Mount Improbable"", and his other evolution-related books, he was taking it as given and discussing the more subtle aspects which are not covered in basic discussions. For this reason, I was not certain if I wanted to read this books, since, you know, I already took high school biology.The reality is, though, that Dawkins knows (or has at his disposal) an astonishing and delightful range of biological facts and short stories, from primates (current and extinct), dinosaurs, worms, a Monty Python parody of ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" (ok that one's not exactly biology), crab bodies imagined as rubber-sheet transformations of one another, and on and on.In particular I can commend Dawkins for his use of graphics. The technology used for making books in the 19th and 20th century led to an entirely regrettable reliance on exclusively print texts, which computer-controlled printing is only slowly undoing. In addition to the wonderful color insets, Dawkins has graphs, line drawings, and other imagery sprinkled liberally through the book. The greatest part of the history of books included pictures with the words; let's hope Dawkins becomes less of an exception in the 21st century.In addition, let's hope he sticks to topics he loves in future books. He's much more fun to read that way."
162,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277727-emily,0,"Richard Dawkins has set out to challenge Creationists with his new book ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."" As someone who was taught evolution by one of the most hardcore nuns in my Catholic school, I've always found Creationism somewhat baffling. Isn't ""faith"" believing in spite of evidence? Not pretending the evidence doesn't exist? In my personal canon, I rather like the idea that the ""clay"" God made Adam out of in the Bible is actually RNA. All live evolved from this, not just human life. I suppose this is neither here nor there. But it doesn't seem hard to reoncile evolution with God to me. If you created a universe, wouldn't you come up with some process by which the world could govern itself instead of having to deal with every little problem? I think you would. Anyway, Dawkins says this book is intended to convince Creationists that they are wrong. I don't think it will do that. They will just ignore this book as they ignore the rest of his work. I'm not sure there is any book that can be written that would convince people who are already certain, but it's not this one. (Perhaps if someone who was on the fence wrote a memoir about examining the evidence?) Dawkins's tone is a bit too superior. I listened to this on CD and I rather thought he was silently adding ""those idiots"" whenever he said ""history deniers"" (the phrase he uses for Creationists). Those who disagree are more like to shut the book before reading a whole chapter. So I think the main audience for this book will be people who already believe in Evolution who want to start fights with Creationists on the Internet. "
163,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,3,"This book does a decent job of explaning evolution, though I have two criticisms: First, the format suffers organizationally. The book is written as a rebuttal to creationist arguments, but Dawkins addresses those arguments by interspersing them, in no coherent order, within affirmative evidence for evolution. A bettter way to format the book would have been to model it after a good legal brief. Present the affirmative case for evolution first, then address creationist counterarguments second. Second, Dawkin exhibits unnecesary hostility toward those who believe in creationism. There is no good reason to be so disrespectful of their beliefs. To him, it's as if teaching children creationism is one of the world's greatest evils. At worst, however, teaching children creationism is only teaching them a false belief. Moreover, while many Americans (and others) believe in creationism, most (even by his own account) do not. The trend, if anything, is toward believing in evolution, so there's no reason to get so worked up about it. Dawkin's defensiveness and hostility actually render his book less persuasive, because he comes across as a radical, or extremist. For example, Dawkins repeats the phrase ""evolution is a fact"" perhaps several dozen times, as if saying it will necessarily make it so. If evolution if a fact, say it once and move on. In sum, a more level-headed approach would not only have made the book more persausive, but also a more enjoyable read. "
164,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"44% of Americans believe that humans were created by god about ten thousand years ago. I admire that Richard Dawkins' stamina in fighting the good fight but he's not going about it very effectively. He sounds pretentious. He uses technical terms quite frequently, to the point that I can barely keep up (and I have reasonable background in the area already). He repeatedly insults and mocks people who do not accept what he sees to be completely self-evident. The argument is not strung together too neatly and his time/resource allocation is also slightly questionable. You can feel his pain and sympathize, but if he wanted to be more effective he would have to surrender some of his ego first, which I don't think he can do very well.I personally read this book because I was curious to see what evidence from the animal kingdom Dawkins would select as his best ammunition and how he would structure the argument. I emerged slightly disappointed: by the tone, the flow, the structure, and the selection. If there is someone out there who would like to learn more about evolution I would instead recommend looking at some very well-produced videos on YouTube."
165,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4745220-alicja,5,"rating: 5/5It was sometimes a tough read but it presents the evidence for evolution in a clear and concise manner that is accessible to non-biologists. Although, I did have to google search some concepts because I didn't remember enough biology 101 foundations from undergrad (the embryology chapter killed me! but thankfully I've revived since). So, if you are evolution theory ignorant (because what I remember from high school and basic bio in college has pretty much left my brain by now), this is a great read to pick up and brush up those corners of your brain. And Dawkins tends to stick more to the biology is this one, rather than condescending (as much) to the religious which is generally my criticism for any atheist works of his, so yup... read it. "

167,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,4,"Very thorough and compelling evidence for the case of evolution, but I feel that Mr. Dawkins would have gotten his point across in a much more convincing fashion if he had left out the constant jabs at religion. I agree with him that it's pretty disheartening that so many people just out right reject evolution, without observing ANY evidence, but you also can't tell unbelievers that they are basically stupid because of their religion and expect people to care to listen to your argument.

173,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31260727-josiah,4,"As a creationist, I disagree with a lot of the ways that Dawkins interprets scientific studies and don't agree with most of his conclusions, but I have to give credit where credit is due: this is, by and large, a good argument for macro-evolution. He lays out complex scientific topics in easy-enough ways for a layperson to understand, explains things in entertaining ways at times, and uses a variety of studies and arguments to make his case. I think his scientific arguments are flawed (see this book), but he also makes some good points at times and I can appreciate certain arguments while disagreeing with them.That being said, while I could respect Dawkins when he was talking about science, his arguments were laughably bad when it came to philosophy. Dawkins tries to seriously argue that the presence of pain in gazelles disproves a creator, the fact that trees try to ""compete"" with each other for who can be the tallest disproves a creator, and the fact that predators don't prey ""optimally"" disproves a creator, among other things. His lack of understanding for what the intelligent design movement argues and his college-freshman-level understanding of philosophy hurt his credibility in my book. For someone who makes a big deal about non-scientists misinterpreting science, he really should be more careful before delving into philosophy as a non-philosopher.Overall, I appreciated reading this book to better understand scientific arguments against the creationist/intelligent design positions. Didn't persuade me, but it was well-argued (sans the philosophy bits).Rating: 3.5-4 Stars (Good)."

175,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Back in the 60‘s, the Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species and Descent of Man was probably the single greatest inspiration for me to study biology and eventually get a degree in that major. I was not an atheist back in those days. I’m not sure I am totally one today? I have many, many problems with organized religion. I cannot nor will I ever believe that I could be a member of such a community. However, I have not given up on the idea that there might not be some intelligent design to things. It’s just not the intelligence of Richard Dawkins.Think about it, Richard. I’ll bet that you believe their is a high probability that there is life and possibly even intelligence somewhere else in the universe. Would it be intelligence as we know it do you suppose?Publishers Weekly commented, ""If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book [GSoE] he should pick up.” The review then goes on to say that “Dawkins remains a superb translator of complex scientific concepts....he has a way of making the drollest details feel like a revelation."" I support the first part of that review but not the second. I think that Charles Darwin was that person who could so superbly articulate and make clear complex, scientific concepts. Richard Dawkins has a problem.The author of The Greatest Show on Earth, Richard Dawkins, is a self-described militant atheist. For me, therein lies the “greatest” problem with this book and others he has written. I have no problem with Dawkins’ atheism. I understand his militancy. But all of that, particularly rapped up in vehement emotion seems incongruent with a book on science. Unless perhaps in the study of behaviorism, science loses its authenticity in the presence of emotion. It ceases to be legitimate science and begins to sound more like the “circus” he is trying to debunk. In most of his books, Dawkins makes a passionate argument against the influence of religion around the teaching of evolution. Or maybe one should say the influence of religion on Not teaching evolution. I understand that and I completely support his thesis. However, for the same reason, I just do not believe that his anti-religious rants belong in a book that purports to teach science any more than speculation on creationism belongs in the classroom. Both seem to cheapen the discipline of science itself. As hard as Dawkins tries to separate Church, State and secular education, it is in this trying that his books lose their scientific punch. There was a lot to like about GSoE. Reading about evolution again, I relived with much of the same excitement I had had back in those days when, as that teenager, I was introduced to evolution. But all of Dawkins’ bashing and defensiveness diminishes the sheer enjoyment of reading and reveling in the beauty that is Charles Darwin all by himself. What Dawkins has to say about separating Church and State and education needs desperately to be said and needs to be listened to. A book all about that and without all the biology would be fine. It would make more sense and probably be more widely read. One book, Richard, maybe one book of the ilk of GSoE would make sense, but an entire library devoted to this? Come on..... Sounds almost like a crusade that you would argue against so ardently. Discover magazine called Richard Dawkins ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" for his “fierce and effective defense of evolution.” I believe that speaks a disservice to the genus canids. In today’s world, anyone with half a brain knows that evolution requires no more of defense than that of the heliocentric solar system. But yes, our schools and curricula do need defense from religious zealots. Let’s just keep the fact of evolution separate from the theory that it’s not. The socio-political and religious arguments for teaching creationism to the exclusion or at least the demeaning of evolution are strong, large and looming enough targets to go after on their own. The breath and depth of science in this book only muddys up that water. Do I care that a recent Gallup poll concluded that 44 percent of Americans believed a god created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years and that beliefs in Europe are not much different? You bet I care. I just do not think folks like Dawkins are going to change that thinking with books like this. You want to know about evolution? Read Charles Darwin first. Go to the master himself. He is totally approachable and his science reads like beautiful prose. You want religious influences out of public schools, join the PTA or vote for the right candidate. In its totality, I subscribe to all that Dawkins posits. It's only the messenger that I'd like to kill."
176,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Although Dawkins doesn't seem to realize that you can't reason someone away from a position they don't hold by reason, so trying to arm people to counter the arguments of evolution 'skeptics' is a futile endeavor; however, getting a lot of the gaps filled in about evolution is a fascinating subject for us dilettantes who accept that science isn't intentionally lying to us and are interested in how the accepted science came to be accepted.Yes, those are ironic quotes around the word skeptics, because metaphorically waving ones hands and repeating nuh-uh isn't really skepticism, it's willful ignorance.So, sure, one may hear from science deniers that evolution isn't science because you can't test it in a lab. People that claim that are both wrong about the necessity of a lab to test a hypothesis, and the claim that evolution hasn't been tested in a lab. There are experiments where evolution has been demonstrated in a lab - bacteria that have multiple generations in a day, so that evolutionary timelines are years instead of millennia. And the bacteria adapt. Is this good to read about because it will help you convince somebody who's invested in not believing evolution? Of course not. You can't change anybody's mind. Only they can, and if they've predetermined they won't change their mind you're wasting your time. But it's cool as heck. The experiment, that is. And Dawkins explains it, perfectly striking the balance between making it accessible to the layperson, without leaving out substance.Is the anecdote wherein a denier, who couldn't accept that random mutations could advance from a single cell to a complete human, with a nervous system, miles of blood vessels, sight, hearing, etc., might arise in billions of years, was confronted with the observation that she accomplished it herself in nine months, going to even begin to sway someone who's dug in their heels? Duh no. But the chapter about how we're metaphorical origami rather than constructions from blueprints elucidates so much, and makes the observations that humans have gills early in embryonic development, as birds have teeth and bony tails, make sense. These aren't flukes, they're expected observations of undesigned results of millions of random prototypes.So, please don't tell Dawkins I said this, because I hate to crush a dream, but the book works for unintended reasons. It's a great survey course in evolution. It cannot work to sway your extended family at Thanksgiving because they aren't genuinely interested in allowing their minds to be changed. And one thing dumb ol' evolution hasn't accomplished yet is allowing objective evidence to force someone to change their minds. Apparently there's no competitive advantage in it."

Why is it so difficult to believe in the evidence shoved in your face but just way too easy to believe in naked beings eating forbidden fruit and unleashing horrors in the world? A conversation with my dear mother or a close friend can make anyone fly off the handle. Senseless logic is in abundance. I am a very patient person except when it comes religion. I see no reason why I should be.A brilliant article in September by a well-known science professor about religion and science led to him receiving death threats. Yes, that is the ugly world we live in, a sad truth. Freedom of expression, of speech these rights belong to every person as long as they don’t use it. That’s how it works now a days.  ”The history-deniers themselves are among those that I am trying to reach in this book.”So listen carefully.”As for the claim that evolution has never been ‘proved’, proof is a notion that scientists have been intimidated into mistrusting. Influential philosophers tell us we can’t prove anything in science. Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution. Evolution is a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere. Though logic-choppers rule the town,* some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.”Dawkins is persistent and rightly so. Why would you disprove something that is true? If you are a creationist, do give Dawkins a chance. You might rethink your views. Enough of all this.The book begins with ‘theory’. What we do mean when use this word in a sentence? What do creationists mean when they use this word? The difference is major and explained wonderfully with the true meaning. Dawkins goes on to follow evolution from earlier times, depending on the species. Why are there so many different breeds of dogs suddenly when there were only a few back in the 18-19th centuries? Questions like this and many more are answered. We have come a long way from Darwin’s Origin of Species. More things are known today than Darwin knew back then when he was writing his masterpiece. ”Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips . . . continue the list as long as desired. That didn’t have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn’t. It didn’t have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it”Highly recommended."

As it stands, I liked the book; I thought it was well put together and used some really classic as well as some really new and exciting examples of experiments that have been done and discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of evolution. But I also have some complaints and differences of opinion with it. The book seems to be a bit bipolar in terms of its intended audience. Obviously Dawkins wants to write for his usual fan base/ the generally curious and somewhat scientifically literate public. But another major aim of the book is to try and educate creationists. So it ends up switching back and forth between explaining the simplest of things (common sense stuff for anyone who's ever taken grade 9 or 10 science) and assuming you know them already. The end result is that the text patronizes even the layman reader while alienating the scientifically illiterate creationist who will not be able to grasp the concepts completely.Now, there are a few things I take issue with in terms of how he explains certain evolutionary concepts, but these are mostly nitty gritty details that I think could be worded to better convey the information without creating common misconceptions and thus aren't really worth focusing on too much. He doesn't really do evolutionary forces other than natural selection much justice (specifically random genetic drift), but as a friend of mine said: ""Just getting the idea of natural selection across to creationists is a challenge; bring out genetic drift and the shit will start to fly. One step at a time, here!""I think my major issue with the book pops up in the introduction. After explaining the scientific use of the word ""theory"" and contrasting it with the colloquial use, Dawkins decides that in order to avoid misconceptions, it would be best to use a different term. So he decides to make up a word. He borrows the mathematical term ""theorem"" and purposes misspells it ""theorum"". The ""theorum"" of evolution. He could just have easily referred to it as the fact of evolution, which is what he actually does for the rest of the book, only mentioning ""theorum"" once or twice more near the end. The whole thing is an exercise in futility and doesn't really do anything towards his goal of promoting scientific literacy. It just makes him sound silly. Although I suppose that ""theorum"" does sound better than if he were to purposely misspell ""law"" as ""luw"" of evolution.In spite of all the criticisms I've put forward, it actually is a good summary of evolutionary theory and deserves to be widely read. If we could make textbooks as engaging as this, I suspect that many more people would understand evolution and be less susceptible to creationist misinformation."

There is of course no doubt in this world anymore about Richard Dawkins’ amazing capabilities to put together a comprehensive, concise, yet thorough text on evolution that makes one want to keep reading, in search of even more interesting facts than the last few he’s brought forth.Dawkins describes this book as the ‘missing link’ in the impressive chain of books he’s written up until now: The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is meant as a book on the evidence for evolution, instead of being very much about the theory itself. And of course, as a highly intelligent evolutionary biologist, Dawkins more than succeeds in presenting evidence for evolution, using photos on coloured pages, diagrams, illustrations, and many other visual aids next to his own written word.He writes with humour and wit about all the amazingly interesting examples of evolution he puts forth, many of which were yet unknown to me, and shows how much passion and enthusiasm he has for this field. Reading this book made me almost feel giddy at times, and definitely brought me joy. Dawkins gives the reader a lot in this book: he doesn’t only provide evidence on evolution, but he also tackles a few arguments of creationists on evolution (the point where he stresses that the fossil record actually isn’t even needed as evidence for evolution is particularly strong, especially because it seems so overlooked). Critique on Dawkins and his work has sometimes been about his aggressive tone or his tendency to continue beating down creationists; I didn’t consider this to be a problem in The Greatest Show on Earth, nor did I think Dawkins was aggressive in any way. The creationists’ views are valid and contemporary in the discussion on the evidence of evolution, and I didn’t feel as if he was purposefully dragging them into this book.I would most certainly highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, with no exceptions. It’s a lovely, engaging, and interesting book that’s most definitely well-worth a read."

But his tone in arguing with believers in literal Biblical creation is annoying and condesending. Although I am firmly convinced of Darwin's theory, I think it's possible that religious writings such as the Bible (I am not all that familiar with any other holy books, I'm afraid) can be excused and interpreted by understanding the obvious: that people at the time of the writing did not have the knowledge we now have, and they made sense of things in the only way they knew how. Creating the earth in 6 days was meaningless at the time because what defines a day in the birth of the solar system? I can't come up with any science to rationalize the rib story, but as far as the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that's a pretty obvious reference to the origins of human consciousness, as in, they became self-aware and realized they were (gasp) naked. I doubt there was any snake involved but possibly the snake is a metaphor for evil/cunning; at any rate, I would not be surprised if the trouble was started by a woman.Dawkins makes no attempt at any understanding of his opponents, which is fine I guess, but to me, a good book looks at both sides."
181,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,4,"This work has to be a thorn in the side to all creationists. Dawkins refutes the most frequently put forward theories and sometimes simple lies and fairy tales of the modern creationists with clear evidence from an evolutionary standpoint.He provides several explanations for each example given from the animal and plant world and clearly explains why ""Darwin was right"".I found it unbelievable that, according to official surveys, so many people seriously believe that the world we know with all its diversity was only created 10,000 years ago."

My first question, upon finishing it, is ""who is this for?""The science is too involved for a scientifically illiterate fundamentalist creationist audience, the sardonic tone likewise off-putting to them, and the atheists like me who share his broad perspective hardly need a hand-held walk through the garden of nature's wonders and weirdnesses.Then again, maybe we do: it should be emphasised that this book makes for a fantastic full spectrum look at the subject of evolutionary theory, one complete with some excellent analogies, stunning facts, and wise correlations. Anyone with a high school level understanding of biology will be more than equipped to follow along and learn.Unfortunately, Dawkins' extensive expertise in the subject matter often falls prey to his fairly direct sense of humour, expressed via a mocking tone that does more to further the stereotype of him as a shrill British ponce than to reveal his truer nature as a passionate humanist.Inevitably, I am drawn to wonder what the inimitable Christopher Hitchens would have done with a similar task, equipped with Dawkins' subject expertise. I suspect his subtler wit, fantastically evocative writing, and sophisticated understanding of debate would have produced a finer work.Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend The Greatest Show On Earth to anyone who seeks a peerless introduction to the current state of evolutionary theory, or to a thicker-skinned creationist seeking to inform themselves about the opposing side in the debate about the origins of life."
183,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,5,"Dawkins latest book finally tackles creationism in a not-so-head-on collision. Always vowing to never answer a challenge directly, Dawkins does it in the best way he possibly could, by demonstrating why evolution is true.He seemingly leaves no stone uncovered in the challenge, often tackling direct claims made by creationists and demonstrating why they are false. He also covers how speciation has been observed and the whole ""show me your transitional fossils"" non-argument is handled masterfully. By demonstrating selective breeding of plants and animals by humans, he shows how easily and quickly humans have created new species within a couple of generations.Illustrated with images, colour plates and excellent description, Dawkins knows how to hold the reader's attention and to explain even the most complex scientific terms in easy to understand language. I'm not sure why this book was written though. In 2009, Jerry Coyne released ""Why Evolution is True"" which though I have not yet read, I imagine covers many similar themes and evidences.The other issue is of course that this book is NOT going to be read by the very people it is directed at. Creationists, despite their protests of ""teaching the controversy"" and ""academic freedom"", are not interested in understanding what evolution is. Those who are going to buy it and read it are those already convinced by the evidence for an old earth, natural selection and evolution by common descent, so the question must be asked in the words of Daniel Dennett... cui bono?See more book reviews at my blog"
184,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: ""'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution."" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the ""intelligent design"" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point."

Too informal to be authoritative and too casual to be something one could refer someone to this book fits into the wide middle of Dawkins book which are summed up as ""nice but someone else has done it better"".Dawkins' books seem to grow out a nagging urge to yell something at the world and ""the point"" is poorly spread across sprawling chapters that reference across each other suggesting the book could have been better organized. The color plate system makes it easy to ""spoil"" section as it's not obvious what picture is being referred to.One section does stand head-and-shoulders above others in the discussion of dating tools. I never realized that tree-ring dating was as powerful as shown here, providing us a 12 millenia time-line in some places. If you can get it from your library or otherwise without cost, reading these sections is a good usage of ones time in providing a condensed pile of methodologies to pass to the uninformed. "

I have a fairly strong background in science, but I don't think that this book would be too much of a slog for the intelligent humanities-based reader. The book's subtitle is The Evidence for Evolution, and the case he makes is cogent and convincing (although he's definitely preaching to the choir with this reader.)"

188,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"Unfortunately Richard Dawkins preceded this book with the book, The God Delusion. He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the ""theory"" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design. The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design. Sic Transit Intelligent Design.It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.Enough about evolution. What about the book?In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.For myself I suggest the following.The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievement"
189,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"Most educated people know the basics of evolution, so some of the topics covered in the book will already be familiar. The benefit of reading it is that Richard Dawkins covers all of the major areas, and so can fill in a few of the blanks that all of us have to one extent or the other. It covers the fossil record in depth, showing the relationships between living things past and present, and has a good discussion on “missing links.” He makes the point that the only reason we can divide the fossil record into different species is because of the gaps in that record. The slow changes over evolutionary time would have been imperceptible to anyone seeing the plants or animals while they were alive, and at no point could an observer have looked at something and said that it was a different species than its parents. In fact, the normal variation within the species would have been greater than any individual incremental evolutionary change. Only because of the breaks in the fossil record can we recognize the slow changes over time.Carbon-14, is the standard dating technique for plants and animals having lived within the past 50,000 years, but I did not know where it came from, and found Dawkins’ explanation quite interesting.Carbon-14 is special because it is continually being made by cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere. Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the atmosphere and its mass number is 14, the same as carbon-14’s. The difference is that carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons…. Cosmic ray particles are capable of hitting a proton in a nitrogen nucleus and converting it to a neutron. When this happens, the atom becomes carbon-14, carbon being one lower than nitrogen in the periodic table.Although we normally think of evolutionary time as taking place over millennia, Dawkins describes several experiments that showed major changes can happen very quickly. There was a fascinating experiment that tracked the changes in bacteria over many generation as they differentiated from their parent stock. There was also an experiment on zebra fish which showed that, in the absence of predators, the males evolved bright colors to attract females, but with predators present they quickly evolved duller spotted patterns to mimic the color of the stream bottom.He also makes a good point about sexual reproduction, in that when a living creature is conceived, it is only a “blending” of mother and father when looked at from a high level. At the DNA level, however, what gets passed are genes, which are either/or: any particular gene either comes from one parent or it comes from the other. They are never a blend of the two, although sometimes, for several reasons, they can pick up a mutation. There is an old Creationist argument that natural selection could not work because any new beneficial traits would be swamped as they blended into the existing traits of the general population, but if genes pass down intact, the helpful ones could spread.In his discussion of how modern molecular genetics has helped understand evolution, Dawkins makes an interesting point when explaining how scientists determine how closely related two species are:The human/dog cell should theoretically have an identical resemblance score to the chimpanzee/dog cell because humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same degree of relation to dogs. It should be identical, too, to the monkey/dog cell and the lemur/dog cell. This is because humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and lemurs are all connected to the dog via their common ancestor, an early primate (which probably looked a bit like a lemur). One of evolution’s most powerful arguments is that life evolved only once. This is a well known statement, but Dawkins makes it after he has brought to bear a great deal of evidence from many different fields of study, and when he finally presents it the reader gets a sense of its majesty. We are all truly connected, from the simplest bacteria to the most complicated creatures.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Richard Dawkins book if he didn’t take some well deserved swipes at Creationists. Were it not for their baleful influence on science and education, there would be something pathetically funny about them: they believe because they believe because they believe, and no amount of evidence or logic will change their minds. It reminded me of the saying that faith is not an argument, but the absence of arguments.I enjoyed this book. Because I already had a layman’s understanding of evolution, I wasn’t sure how much I would learn from it, but it was definitely worth the time. It filled in a number of gaps in my understanding, and expanded on the areas I was familiar with. It makes a strong case for evolution being, as the title says, the greatest show on earth."
190,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,3,"Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, in the same league as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Neil deGrasse Tyson. What stands out in the works of these people is their unwavering loyalty to Truth and Reason. They are not the sort of persons that can take an affront to Knowledge lying down. All of them are outright atheists that don’t mince words when it comes to attacking the superstitious and stupid religious beliefs. This is the third work of Dawkins that I am reading, after having gone through ‘The God Delusion’ and ‘The Magic of Reality’. Dawkins continues in the same vein as in those two books, but this book is turning the heat up for the ‘Creationists’ – those that believe that a god created this universe, our planet and all the life forms that populate it, within the last 10000 years or so. Dawkins builds a citadel from which the Evolutionists – those of us that believe that the planet Earth is about 4.6 billion years and all the life forms that we see in front of our eyes today evolved through natural genetic modification – can fight the ignorance of the ‘Creationists’. And, what a citadel has he built! I don’t think that a staunch believer of the religious version of ‘Creation’ will be moved by this book well enough to reverse his/her views, but this book will nevertheless end up causing a dent in his/her belief. Be it plants, animals or the multitude of bacterial and vermin life forms, Dawkins pulls them all up to stand as witness to the survival of their ancestors in the long gone past and their evolution by ‘natural selection’. Dawkins also arms all the ‘Evolutionists’ and ‘Darwinists’ with enough arsenal to fight back the stupid questions raised by the ‘Creationists’. ‘If men evolved from monkeys why are there monkeys still around?’, for example.But one thing that I couldn’t stomach in this book is that, while trying to build a citadel of facts and arguments strong enough to be unassailable by the ‘Creationists’, Dawkins seems to have become too obsessed with the details to the extent of ignoring the normal, laymen like me that couldn’t grasp science beyond a certain level, at least for now. You need to have a fair knowledge of genes to understand the book. In the previous two books, I found the words of Dawkins having a smooth flow. The same is lacking here. His random jumping between the topics and cross-referencing details in other chapters and even in his other books doesn’t make matters easy either. A good book to read, if you prefer reading books that are slow and heavy. Though this lacks the usual flow and wit of Richard Dawkins, it is a worthy shot in the arm if you are someone that ends up arguing with the ‘Believers’ every now and then."
191,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The Greatest Show On Earth: The Evidence for Evolution""I like most, but not all, of Richard Dawkins' books, especially ones such as ""The Selfish Gene"" where he is adding real new insights into how evolution works (and doesn't work). I gave his book-before-last, ""The God Delusion"", a pass, because it appeared to have all the charm and insight of a typical Internet rant. Dawkins is at his best when he talks about the topics he loves (biology), and at his worst when he talks about the topics he hates (religion).Fortunately, in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", he mostly sticks to what he loves. He describes this book as a sort of, ""oh, I should have said"", in which he goes back to describe the basic facts about evolution. In ""The Selfish Gene"", ""The Blind Watchmaker"", ""Climbing Mount Improbable"", and his other evolution-related books, he was taking it as given and discussing the more subtle aspects which are not covered in basic discussions. For this reason, I was not certain if I wanted to read this books, since, you know, I already took high school biology.The reality is, though, that Dawkins knows (or has at his disposal) an astonishing and delightful range of biological facts and short stories, from primates (current and extinct), dinosaurs, worms, a Monty Python parody of ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" (ok that one's not exactly biology), crab bodies imagined as rubber-sheet transformations of one another, and on and on.In particular I can commend Dawkins for his use of graphics. The technology used for making books in the 19th and 20th century led to an entirely regrettable reliance on exclusively print texts, which computer-controlled printing is only slowly undoing. In addition to the wonderful color insets, Dawkins has graphs, line drawings, and other imagery sprinkled liberally through the book. The greatest part of the history of books included pictures with the words; let's hope Dawkins becomes less of an exception in the 21st century.In addition, let's hope he sticks to topics he loves in future books. He's much more fun to read that way."
192,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277727-emily,0,"Richard Dawkins has set out to challenge Creationists with his new book ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."" As someone who was taught evolution by one of the most hardcore nuns in my Catholic school, I've always found Creationism somewhat baffling. Isn't ""faith"" believing in spite of evidence? Not pretending the evidence doesn't exist? In my personal canon, I rather like the idea that the ""clay"" God made Adam out of in the Bible is actually RNA. All live evolved from this, not just human life. I suppose this is neither here nor there. But it doesn't seem hard to reoncile evolution with God to me. If you created a universe, wouldn't you come up with some process by which the world could govern itself instead of having to deal with every little problem? I think you would. Anyway, Dawkins says this book is intended to convince Creationists that they are wrong. I don't think it will do that. They will just ignore this book as they ignore the rest of his work. I'm not sure there is any book that can be written that would convince people who are already certain, but it's not this one. (Perhaps if someone who was on the fence wrote a memoir about examining the evidence?) Dawkins's tone is a bit too superior. I listened to this on CD and I rather thought he was silently adding ""those idiots"" whenever he said ""history deniers"" (the phrase he uses for Creationists). Those who disagree are more like to shut the book before reading a whole chapter. So I think the main audience for this book will be people who already believe in Evolution who want to start fights with Creationists on the Internet. "
193,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,3,"This book does a decent job of explaning evolution, though I have two criticisms: First, the format suffers organizationally. The book is written as a rebuttal to creationist arguments, but Dawkins addresses those arguments by interspersing them, in no coherent order, within affirmative evidence for evolution. A bettter way to format the book would have been to model it after a good legal brief. Present the affirmative case for evolution first, then address creationist counterarguments second. Second, Dawkin exhibits unnecesary hostility toward those who believe in creationism. There is no good reason to be so disrespectful of their beliefs. To him, it's as if teaching children creationism is one of the world's greatest evils. At worst, however, teaching children creationism is only teaching them a false belief. Moreover, while many Americans (and others) believe in creationism, most (even by his own account) do not. The trend, if anything, is toward believing in evolution, so there's no reason to get so worked up about it. Dawkin's defensiveness and hostility actually render his book less persuasive, because he comes across as a radical, or extremist. For example, Dawkins repeats the phrase ""evolution is a fact"" perhaps several dozen times, as if saying it will necessarily make it so. If evolution if a fact, say it once and move on. In sum, a more level-headed approach would not only have made the book more persausive, but also a more enjoyable read. "
194,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"44% of Americans believe that humans were created by god about ten thousand years ago. I admire that Richard Dawkins' stamina in fighting the good fight but he's not going about it very effectively. He sounds pretentious. He uses technical terms quite frequently, to the point that I can barely keep up (and I have reasonable background in the area already). He repeatedly insults and mocks people who do not accept what he sees to be completely self-evident. The argument is not strung together too neatly and his time/resource allocation is also slightly questionable. You can feel his pain and sympathize, but if he wanted to be more effective he would have to surrender some of his ego first, which I don't think he can do very well.I personally read this book because I was curious to see what evidence from the animal kingdom Dawkins would select as his best ammunition and how he would structure the argument. I emerged slightly disappointed: by the tone, the flow, the structure, and the selection. If there is someone out there who would like to learn more about evolution I would instead recommend looking at some very well-produced videos on YouTube."

Although, I did have to google search some concepts because I didn't remember enough biology 101 foundations from undergrad (the embryology chapter killed me! but thankfully I've revived since). So, if you are evolution theory ignorant (because what I remember from high school and basic bio in college has pretty much left my brain by now), this is a great read to pick up and brush up those corners of your brain. And Dawkins tends to stick more to the biology is this one, rather than condescending (as much) to the religious which is generally my criticism for any atheist works of his, so yup... read it. "

203,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31260727-josiah,4,"As a creationist, I disagree with a lot of the ways that Dawkins interprets scientific studies and don't agree with most of his conclusions, but I have to give credit where credit is due: this is, by and large, a good argument for macro-evolution. He lays out complex scientific topics in easy-enough ways for a layperson to understand, explains things in entertaining ways at times, and uses a variety of studies and arguments to make his case. I think his scientific arguments are flawed (see this book), but he also makes some good points at times and I can appreciate certain arguments while disagreeing with them.That being said, while I could respect Dawkins when he was talking about science, his arguments were laughably bad when it came to philosophy. Dawkins tries to seriously argue that the presence of pain in gazelles disproves a creator, the fact that trees try to ""compete"" with each other for who can be the tallest disproves a creator, and the fact that predators don't prey ""optimally"" disproves a creator, among other things. His lack of understanding for what the intelligent design movement argues and his college-freshman-level understanding of philosophy hurt his credibility in my book. For someone who makes a big deal about non-scientists misinterpreting science, he really should be more careful before delving into philosophy as a non-philosopher.Overall, I appreciated reading this book to better understand scientific arguments against the creationist/intelligent design positions. Didn't persuade me, but it was well-argued (sans the philosophy bits).Rating: 3.5-4 Stars (Good)."
204,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88159193-igor,0,"Second book by Dawkins that I have stopped in the beginning.Although I do not disagree with him, I really do not like his tone and 'style'."
205,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Back in the 60‘s, the Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species and Descent of Man was probably the single greatest inspiration for me to study biology and eventually get a degree in that major. I was not an atheist back in those days. I’m not sure I am totally one today? I have many, many problems with organized religion. I cannot nor will I ever believe that I could be a member of such a community. However, I have not given up on the idea that there might not be some intelligent design to things. It’s just not the intelligence of Richard Dawkins.Think about it, Richard. I’ll bet that you believe their is a high probability that there is life and possibly even intelligence somewhere else in the universe. Would it be intelligence as we know it do you suppose?Publishers Weekly commented, ""If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book [GSoE] he should pick up.” The review then goes on to say that “Dawkins remains a superb translator of complex scientific concepts....he has a way of making the drollest details feel like a revelation."" I support the first part of that review but not the second. I think that Charles Darwin was that person who could so superbly articulate and make clear complex, scientific concepts. Richard Dawkins has a problem.The author of The Greatest Show on Earth, Richard Dawkins, is a self-described militant atheist. For me, therein lies the “greatest” problem with this book and others he has written. I have no problem with Dawkins’ atheism. I understand his militancy. But all of that, particularly rapped up in vehement emotion seems incongruent with a book on science. Unless perhaps in the study of behaviorism, science loses its authenticity in the presence of emotion. It ceases to be legitimate science and begins to sound more like the “circus” he is trying to debunk. In most of his books, Dawkins makes a passionate argument against the influence of religion around the teaching of evolution. Or maybe one should say the influence of religion on Not teaching evolution. I understand that and I completely support his thesis. However, for the same reason, I just do not believe that his anti-religious rants belong in a book that purports to teach science any more than speculation on creationism belongs in the classroom. Both seem to cheapen the discipline of science itself. As hard as Dawkins tries to separate Church, State and secular education, it is in this trying that his books lose their scientific punch. There was a lot to like about GSoE. Reading about evolution again, I relived with much of the same excitement I had had back in those days when, as that teenager, I was introduced to evolution. But all of Dawkins’ bashing and defensiveness diminishes the sheer enjoyment of reading and reveling in the beauty that is Charles Darwin all by himself. What Dawkins has to say about separating Church and State and education needs desperately to be said and needs to be listened to. A book all about that and without all the biology would be fine. It would make more sense and probably be more widely read. One book, Richard, maybe one book of the ilk of GSoE would make sense, but an entire library devoted to this? Come on..... Sounds almost like a crusade that you would argue against so ardently. Discover magazine called Richard Dawkins ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" for his “fierce and effective defense of evolution.” I believe that speaks a disservice to the genus canids. In today’s world, anyone with half a brain knows that evolution requires no more of defense than that of the heliocentric solar system. But yes, our schools and curricula do need defense from religious zealots. Let’s just keep the fact of evolution separate from the theory that it’s not. The socio-political and religious arguments for teaching creationism to the exclusion or at least the demeaning of evolution are strong, large and looming enough targets to go after on their own. The breath and depth of science in this book only muddys up that water. Do I care that a recent Gallup poll concluded that 44 percent of Americans believed a god created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years and that beliefs in Europe are not much different? You bet I care. I just do not think folks like Dawkins are going to change that thinking with books like this. You want to know about evolution? Read Charles Darwin first. Go to the master himself. He is totally approachable and his science reads like beautiful prose. You want religious influences out of public schools, join the PTA or vote for the right candidate. In its totality, I subscribe to all that Dawkins posits. It's only the messenger that I'd like to kill."
206,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Although Dawkins doesn't seem to realize that you can't reason someone away from a position they don't hold by reason, so trying to arm people to counter the arguments of evolution 'skeptics' is a futile endeavor; however, getting a lot of the gaps filled in about evolution is a fascinating subject for us dilettantes who accept that science isn't intentionally lying to us and are interested in how the accepted science came to be accepted.Yes, those are ironic quotes around the word skeptics, because metaphorically waving ones hands and repeating nuh-uh isn't really skepticism, it's willful ignorance.So, sure, one may hear from science deniers that evolution isn't science because you can't test it in a lab. People that claim that are both wrong about the necessity of a lab to test a hypothesis, and the claim that evolution hasn't been tested in a lab. There are experiments where evolution has been demonstrated in a lab - bacteria that have multiple generations in a day, so that evolutionary timelines are years instead of millennia. And the bacteria adapt. Is this good to read about because it will help you convince somebody who's invested in not believing evolution? Of course not. You can't change anybody's mind. Only they can, and if they've predetermined they won't change their mind you're wasting your time. But it's cool as heck. The experiment, that is. And Dawkins explains it, perfectly striking the balance between making it accessible to the layperson, without leaving out substance.Is the anecdote wherein a denier, who couldn't accept that random mutations could advance from a single cell to a complete human, with a nervous system, miles of blood vessels, sight, hearing, etc., might arise in billions of years, was confronted with the observation that she accomplished it herself in nine months, going to even begin to sway someone who's dug in their heels? Duh no. But the chapter about how we're metaphorical origami rather than constructions from blueprints elucidates so much, and makes the observations that humans have gills early in embryonic development, as birds have teeth and bony tails, make sense. These aren't flukes, they're expected observations of undesigned results of millions of random prototypes.So, please don't tell Dawkins I said this, because I hate to crush a dream, but the book works for unintended reasons. It's a great survey course in evolution. It cannot work to sway your extended family at Thanksgiving because they aren't genuinely interested in allowing their minds to be changed. And one thing dumb ol' evolution hasn't accomplished yet is allowing objective evidence to force someone to change their minds. Apparently there's no competitive advantage in it."
207,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6656236-meena,5,"He’s frustrated, he’s angry and he’s had quite enough. I echo his sentiments exactly. Why is it so difficult to believe in the evidence shoved in your face but just way too easy to believe in naked beings eating forbidden fruit and unleashing horrors in the world? A conversation with my dear mother or a close friend can make anyone fly off the handle. Senseless logic is in abundance. I am a very patient person except when it comes religion. I see no reason why I should be.A brilliant article in September by a well-known science professor about religion and science led to him receiving death threats. Yes, that is the ugly world we live in, a sad truth. Freedom of expression, of speech these rights belong to every person as long as they don’t use it. That’s how it works now a days.  ”The history-deniers themselves are among those that I am trying to reach in this book.”So listen carefully.”As for the claim that evolution has never been ‘proved’, proof is a notion that scientists have been intimidated into mistrusting. Influential philosophers tell us we can’t prove anything in science. Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution. Evolution is a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere. Though logic-choppers rule the town,* some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.”Dawkins is persistent and rightly so. Why would you disprove something that is true? If you are a creationist, do give Dawkins a chance. You might rethink your views. Enough of all this.The book begins with ‘theory’. What we do mean when use this word in a sentence? What do creationists mean when they use this word? The difference is major and explained wonderfully with the true meaning. Dawkins goes on to follow evolution from earlier times, depending on the species. Why are there so many different breeds of dogs suddenly when there were only a few back in the 18-19th centuries? Questions like this and many more are answered. We have come a long way from Darwin’s Origin of Species. More things are known today than Darwin knew back then when he was writing his masterpiece. ”Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips . . . continue the list as long as desired. That didn’t have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn’t. It didn’t have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it”Highly recommended."
208,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340159-amanda,4,"Approaching this with an education (albeit only just over half an undergrad degree for now) in evolutionary biology was a rather different experience, I would imagine, than approaching it with minimal knowledge of the subject matter. As it stands, I liked the book; I thought it was well put together and used some really classic as well as some really new and exciting examples of experiments that have been done and discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of evolution. But I also have some complaints and differences of opinion with it. The book seems to be a bit bipolar in terms of its intended audience. Obviously Dawkins wants to write for his usual fan base/ the generally curious and somewhat scientifically literate public. But another major aim of the book is to try and educate creationists. So it ends up switching back and forth between explaining the simplest of things (common sense stuff for anyone who's ever taken grade 9 or 10 science) and assuming you know them already. The end result is that the text patronizes even the layman reader while alienating the scientifically illiterate creationist who will not be able to grasp the concepts completely.Now, there are a few things I take issue with in terms of how he explains certain evolutionary concepts, but these are mostly nitty gritty details that I think could be worded to better convey the information without creating common misconceptions and thus aren't really worth focusing on too much. He doesn't really do evolutionary forces other than natural selection much justice (specifically random genetic drift), but as a friend of mine said: ""Just getting the idea of natural selection across to creationists is a challenge; bring out genetic drift and the shit will start to fly. One step at a time, here!""I think my major issue with the book pops up in the introduction. After explaining the scientific use of the word ""theory"" and contrasting it with the colloquial use, Dawkins decides that in order to avoid misconceptions, it would be best to use a different term. So he decides to make up a word. He borrows the mathematical term ""theorem"" and purposes misspells it ""theorum"". The ""theorum"" of evolution. He could just have easily referred to it as the fact of evolution, which is what he actually does for the rest of the book, only mentioning ""theorum"" once or twice more near the end. The whole thing is an exercise in futility and doesn't really do anything towards his goal of promoting scientific literacy. It just makes him sound silly. Although I suppose that ""theorum"" does sound better than if he were to purposely misspell ""law"" as ""luw"" of evolution.In spite of all the criticisms I've put forward, it actually is a good summary of evolutionary theory and deserves to be widely read. If we could make textbooks as engaging as this, I suspect that many more people would understand evolution and be less susceptible to creationist misinformation."
209,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is most certainly one of the best, most entertaining, and most interesting non-fiction books I’ve ever read. There is of course no doubt in this world anymore about Richard Dawkins’ amazing capabilities to put together a comprehensive, concise, yet thorough text on evolution that makes one want to keep reading, in search of even more interesting facts than the last few he’s brought forth.Dawkins describes this book as the ‘missing link’ in the impressive chain of books he’s written up until now: The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is meant as a book on the evidence for evolution, instead of being very much about the theory itself. And of course, as a highly intelligent evolutionary biologist, Dawkins more than succeeds in presenting evidence for evolution, using photos on coloured pages, diagrams, illustrations, and many other visual aids next to his own written word.He writes with humour and wit about all the amazingly interesting examples of evolution he puts forth, many of which were yet unknown to me, and shows how much passion and enthusiasm he has for this field. Reading this book made me almost feel giddy at times, and definitely brought me joy. Dawkins gives the reader a lot in this book: he doesn’t only provide evidence on evolution, but he also tackles a few arguments of creationists on evolution (the point where he stresses that the fossil record actually isn’t even needed as evidence for evolution is particularly strong, especially because it seems so overlooked). Critique on Dawkins and his work has sometimes been about his aggressive tone or his tendency to continue beating down creationists; I didn’t consider this to be a problem in The Greatest Show on Earth, nor did I think Dawkins was aggressive in any way. The creationists’ views are valid and contemporary in the discussion on the evidence of evolution, and I didn’t feel as if he was purposefully dragging them into this book.I would most certainly highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, with no exceptions. It’s a lovely, engaging, and interesting book that’s most definitely well-worth a read."
210,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,2,"I feel like I've had a Dawkins overload; maybe that's why I wasn't all that thrilled with this book, although some parts are very interesting (the part about dating from rings on trees and that sort of thing.) But his tone in arguing with believers in literal Biblical creation is annoying and condesending. Although I am firmly convinced of Darwin's theory, I think it's possible that religious writings such as the Bible (I am not all that familiar with any other holy books, I'm afraid) can be excused and interpreted by understanding the obvious: that people at the time of the writing did not have the knowledge we now have, and they made sense of things in the only way they knew how. Creating the earth in 6 days was meaningless at the time because what defines a day in the birth of the solar system? I can't come up with any science to rationalize the rib story, but as far as the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that's a pretty obvious reference to the origins of human consciousness, as in, they became self-aware and realized they were (gasp) naked. I doubt there was any snake involved but possibly the snake is a metaphor for evil/cunning; at any rate, I would not be surprised if the trouble was started by a woman.Dawkins makes no attempt at any understanding of his opponents, which is fine I guess, but to me, a good book looks at both sides."
211,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,4,"This work has to be a thorn in the side to all creationists. Dawkins refutes the most frequently put forward theories and sometimes simple lies and fairy tales of the modern creationists with clear evidence from an evolutionary standpoint.He provides several explanations for each example given from the animal and plant world and clearly explains why ""Darwin was right"".I found it unbelievable that, according to official surveys, so many people seriously believe that the world we know with all its diversity was only created 10,000 years ago."
212,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6794439-marius-masalar,3,"This is a challenging book to assess. My first question, upon finishing it, is ""who is this for?""The science is too involved for a scientifically illiterate fundamentalist creationist audience, the sardonic tone likewise off-putting to them, and the atheists like me who share his broad perspective hardly need a hand-held walk through the garden of nature's wonders and weirdnesses.Then again, maybe we do: it should be emphasised that this book makes for a fantastic full spectrum look at the subject of evolutionary theory, one complete with some excellent analogies, stunning facts, and wise correlations. Anyone with a high school level understanding of biology will be more than equipped to follow along and learn.Unfortunately, Dawkins' extensive expertise in the subject matter often falls prey to his fairly direct sense of humour, expressed via a mocking tone that does more to further the stereotype of him as a shrill British ponce than to reveal his truer nature as a passionate humanist.Inevitably, I am drawn to wonder what the inimitable Christopher Hitchens would have done with a similar task, equipped with Dawkins' subject expertise. I suspect his subtler wit, fantastically evocative writing, and sophisticated understanding of debate would have produced a finer work.Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend The Greatest Show On Earth to anyone who seeks a peerless introduction to the current state of evolutionary theory, or to a thicker-skinned creationist seeking to inform themselves about the opposing side in the debate about the origins of life."
213,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,5,"Dawkins latest book finally tackles creationism in a not-so-head-on collision. Always vowing to never answer a challenge directly, Dawkins does it in the best way he possibly could, by demonstrating why evolution is true.He seemingly leaves no stone uncovered in the challenge, often tackling direct claims made by creationists and demonstrating why they are false. He also covers how speciation has been observed and the whole ""show me your transitional fossils"" non-argument is handled masterfully. By demonstrating selective breeding of plants and animals by humans, he shows how easily and quickly humans have created new species within a couple of generations.Illustrated with images, colour plates and excellent description, Dawkins knows how to hold the reader's attention and to explain even the most complex scientific terms in easy to understand language. I'm not sure why this book was written though. In 2009, Jerry Coyne released ""Why Evolution is True"" which though I have not yet read, I imagine covers many similar themes and evidences.The other issue is of course that this book is NOT going to be read by the very people it is directed at. Creationists, despite their protests of ""teaching the controversy"" and ""academic freedom"", are not interested in understanding what evolution is. Those who are going to buy it and read it are those already convinced by the evidence for an old earth, natural selection and evolution by common descent, so the question must be asked in the words of Daniel Dennett... cui bono?See more book reviews at my blog"
214,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: ""'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution."" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the ""intelligent design"" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point."
215,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"Ironically a book on evolution would be a chimera of textbook, polemic, and panegyric it does none of those things particularly well. Too informal to be authoritative and too casual to be something one could refer someone to this book fits into the wide middle of Dawkins book which are summed up as ""nice but someone else has done it better"".Dawkins' books seem to grow out a nagging urge to yell something at the world and ""the point"" is poorly spread across sprawling chapters that reference across each other suggesting the book could have been better organized. The color plate system makes it easy to ""spoil"" section as it's not obvious what picture is being referred to.One section does stand head-and-shoulders above others in the discussion of dating tools. I never realized that tree-ring dating was as powerful as shown here, providing us a 12 millenia time-line in some places. If you can get it from your library or otherwise without cost, reading these sections is a good usage of ones time in providing a condensed pile of methodologies to pass to the uninformed. "

It ranks right up there with Climbing Mount Improbable and River out of Eden. Dawkins writes beautifully, especially for a scientist, with a combination of erudition and wit. I have a fairly strong background in science, but I don't think that this book would be too much of a slog for the intelligent humanities-based reader. The book's subtitle is The Evidence for Evolution, and the case he makes is cogent and convincing (although he's definitely preaching to the choir with this reader.)"

218,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"Unfortunately Richard Dawkins preceded this book with the book, The God Delusion. He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the ""theory"" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design. The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design. Sic Transit Intelligent Design.It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.Enough about evolution. What about the book?In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.For myself I suggest the following.The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievement"
219,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"Most educated people know the basics of evolution, so some of the topics covered in the book will already be familiar. The benefit of reading it is that Richard Dawkins covers all of the major areas, and so can fill in a few of the blanks that all of us have to one extent or the other. It covers the fossil record in depth, showing the relationships between living things past and present, and has a good discussion on “missing links.” He makes the point that the only reason we can divide the fossil record into different species is because of the gaps in that record. The slow changes over evolutionary time would have been imperceptible to anyone seeing the plants or animals while they were alive, and at no point could an observer have looked at something and said that it was a different species than its parents. In fact, the normal variation within the species would have been greater than any individual incremental evolutionary change. Only because of the breaks in the fossil record can we recognize the slow changes over time.Carbon-14, is the standard dating technique for plants and animals having lived within the past 50,000 years, but I did not know where it came from, and found Dawkins’ explanation quite interesting.Carbon-14 is special because it is continually being made by cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere. Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the atmosphere and its mass number is 14, the same as carbon-14’s. The difference is that carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons…. Cosmic ray particles are capable of hitting a proton in a nitrogen nucleus and converting it to a neutron. When this happens, the atom becomes carbon-14, carbon being one lower than nitrogen in the periodic table.Although we normally think of evolutionary time as taking place over millennia, Dawkins describes several experiments that showed major changes can happen very quickly. There was a fascinating experiment that tracked the changes in bacteria over many generation as they differentiated from their parent stock. There was also an experiment on zebra fish which showed that, in the absence of predators, the males evolved bright colors to attract females, but with predators present they quickly evolved duller spotted patterns to mimic the color of the stream bottom.He also makes a good point about sexual reproduction, in that when a living creature is conceived, it is only a “blending” of mother and father when looked at from a high level. At the DNA level, however, what gets passed are genes, which are either/or: any particular gene either comes from one parent or it comes from the other. They are never a blend of the two, although sometimes, for several reasons, they can pick up a mutation. There is an old Creationist argument that natural selection could not work because any new beneficial traits would be swamped as they blended into the existing traits of the general population, but if genes pass down intact, the helpful ones could spread.In his discussion of how modern molecular genetics has helped understand evolution, Dawkins makes an interesting point when explaining how scientists determine how closely related two species are:The human/dog cell should theoretically have an identical resemblance score to the chimpanzee/dog cell because humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same degree of relation to dogs. It should be identical, too, to the monkey/dog cell and the lemur/dog cell. This is because humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and lemurs are all connected to the dog via their common ancestor, an early primate (which probably looked a bit like a lemur). One of evolution’s most powerful arguments is that life evolved only once. This is a well known statement, but Dawkins makes it after he has brought to bear a great deal of evidence from many different fields of study, and when he finally presents it the reader gets a sense of its majesty. We are all truly connected, from the simplest bacteria to the most complicated creatures.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Richard Dawkins book if he didn’t take some well deserved swipes at Creationists. Were it not for their baleful influence on science and education, there would be something pathetically funny about them: they believe because they believe because they believe, and no amount of evidence or logic will change their minds. It reminded me of the saying that faith is not an argument, but the absence of arguments.I enjoyed this book. Because I already had a layman’s understanding of evolution, I wasn’t sure how much I would learn from it, but it was definitely worth the time. It filled in a number of gaps in my understanding, and expanded on the areas I was familiar with. It makes a strong case for evolution being, as the title says, the greatest show on earth."
220,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,3,"Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, in the same league as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Neil deGrasse Tyson. What stands out in the works of these people is their unwavering loyalty to Truth and Reason. They are not the sort of persons that can take an affront to Knowledge lying down. All of them are outright atheists that don’t mince words when it comes to attacking the superstitious and stupid religious beliefs. This is the third work of Dawkins that I am reading, after having gone through ‘The God Delusion’ and ‘The Magic of Reality’. Dawkins continues in the same vein as in those two books, but this book is turning the heat up for the ‘Creationists’ – those that believe that a god created this universe, our planet and all the life forms that populate it, within the last 10000 years or so. Dawkins builds a citadel from which the Evolutionists – those of us that believe that the planet Earth is about 4.6 billion years and all the life forms that we see in front of our eyes today evolved through natural genetic modification – can fight the ignorance of the ‘Creationists’. And, what a citadel has he built! I don’t think that a staunch believer of the religious version of ‘Creation’ will be moved by this book well enough to reverse his/her views, but this book will nevertheless end up causing a dent in his/her belief. Be it plants, animals or the multitude of bacterial and vermin life forms, Dawkins pulls them all up to stand as witness to the survival of their ancestors in the long gone past and their evolution by ‘natural selection’. Dawkins also arms all the ‘Evolutionists’ and ‘Darwinists’ with enough arsenal to fight back the stupid questions raised by the ‘Creationists’. ‘If men evolved from monkeys why are there monkeys still around?’, for example.But one thing that I couldn’t stomach in this book is that, while trying to build a citadel of facts and arguments strong enough to be unassailable by the ‘Creationists’, Dawkins seems to have become too obsessed with the details to the extent of ignoring the normal, laymen like me that couldn’t grasp science beyond a certain level, at least for now. You need to have a fair knowledge of genes to understand the book. In the previous two books, I found the words of Dawkins having a smooth flow. The same is lacking here. His random jumping between the topics and cross-referencing details in other chapters and even in his other books doesn’t make matters easy either. A good book to read, if you prefer reading books that are slow and heavy. Though this lacks the usual flow and wit of Richard Dawkins, it is a worthy shot in the arm if you are someone that ends up arguing with the ‘Believers’ every now and then."
221,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The Greatest Show On Earth: The Evidence for Evolution""I like most, but not all, of Richard Dawkins' books, especially ones such as ""The Selfish Gene"" where he is adding real new insights into how evolution works (and doesn't work). I gave his book-before-last, ""The God Delusion"", a pass, because it appeared to have all the charm and insight of a typical Internet rant. Dawkins is at his best when he talks about the topics he loves (biology), and at his worst when he talks about the topics he hates (religion).Fortunately, in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", he mostly sticks to what he loves. He describes this book as a sort of, ""oh, I should have said"", in which he goes back to describe the basic facts about evolution. In ""The Selfish Gene"", ""The Blind Watchmaker"", ""Climbing Mount Improbable"", and his other evolution-related books, he was taking it as given and discussing the more subtle aspects which are not covered in basic discussions. For this reason, I was not certain if I wanted to read this books, since, you know, I already took high school biology.The reality is, though, that Dawkins knows (or has at his disposal) an astonishing and delightful range of biological facts and short stories, from primates (current and extinct), dinosaurs, worms, a Monty Python parody of ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" (ok that one's not exactly biology), crab bodies imagined as rubber-sheet transformations of one another, and on and on.In particular I can commend Dawkins for his use of graphics. The technology used for making books in the 19th and 20th century led to an entirely regrettable reliance on exclusively print texts, which computer-controlled printing is only slowly undoing. In addition to the wonderful color insets, Dawkins has graphs, line drawings, and other imagery sprinkled liberally through the book. The greatest part of the history of books included pictures with the words; let's hope Dawkins becomes less of an exception in the 21st century.In addition, let's hope he sticks to topics he loves in future books. He's much more fun to read that way."
222,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277727-emily,0,"Richard Dawkins has set out to challenge Creationists with his new book ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."" As someone who was taught evolution by one of the most hardcore nuns in my Catholic school, I've always found Creationism somewhat baffling. Isn't ""faith"" believing in spite of evidence? Not pretending the evidence doesn't exist? In my personal canon, I rather like the idea that the ""clay"" God made Adam out of in the Bible is actually RNA. All live evolved from this, not just human life. I suppose this is neither here nor there. But it doesn't seem hard to reoncile evolution with God to me. If you created a universe, wouldn't you come up with some process by which the world could govern itself instead of having to deal with every little problem? I think you would. Anyway, Dawkins says this book is intended to convince Creationists that they are wrong. I don't think it will do that. They will just ignore this book as they ignore the rest of his work. I'm not sure there is any book that can be written that would convince people who are already certain, but it's not this one. (Perhaps if someone who was on the fence wrote a memoir about examining the evidence?) Dawkins's tone is a bit too superior. I listened to this on CD and I rather thought he was silently adding ""those idiots"" whenever he said ""history deniers"" (the phrase he uses for Creationists). Those who disagree are more like to shut the book before reading a whole chapter. So I think the main audience for this book will be people who already believe in Evolution who want to start fights with Creationists on the Internet. "
223,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,3,"This book does a decent job of explaning evolution, though I have two criticisms: First, the format suffers organizationally. The book is written as a rebuttal to creationist arguments, but Dawkins addresses those arguments by interspersing them, in no coherent order, within affirmative evidence for evolution. A bettter way to format the book would have been to model it after a good legal brief. Present the affirmative case for evolution first, then address creationist counterarguments second. Second, Dawkin exhibits unnecesary hostility toward those who believe in creationism. There is no good reason to be so disrespectful of their beliefs. To him, it's as if teaching children creationism is one of the world's greatest evils. At worst, however, teaching children creationism is only teaching them a false belief. Moreover, while many Americans (and others) believe in creationism, most (even by his own account) do not. The trend, if anything, is toward believing in evolution, so there's no reason to get so worked up about it. Dawkin's defensiveness and hostility actually render his book less persuasive, because he comes across as a radical, or extremist. For example, Dawkins repeats the phrase ""evolution is a fact"" perhaps several dozen times, as if saying it will necessarily make it so. If evolution if a fact, say it once and move on. In sum, a more level-headed approach would not only have made the book more persausive, but also a more enjoyable read. "
224,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"44% of Americans believe that humans were created by god about ten thousand years ago. I admire that Richard Dawkins' stamina in fighting the good fight but he's not going about it very effectively. He sounds pretentious. He uses technical terms quite frequently, to the point that I can barely keep up (and I have reasonable background in the area already). He repeatedly insults and mocks people who do not accept what he sees to be completely self-evident. The argument is not strung together too neatly and his time/resource allocation is also slightly questionable. You can feel his pain and sympathize, but if he wanted to be more effective he would have to surrender some of his ego first, which I don't think he can do very well.I personally read this book because I was curious to see what evidence from the animal kingdom Dawkins would select as his best ammunition and how he would structure the argument. I emerged slightly disappointed: by the tone, the flow, the structure, and the selection. If there is someone out there who would like to learn more about evolution I would instead recommend looking at some very well-produced videos on YouTube."
225,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4745220-alicja,5,"rating: 5/5It was sometimes a tough read but it presents the evidence for evolution in a clear and concise manner that is accessible to non-biologists. Although, I did have to google search some concepts because I didn't remember enough biology 101 foundations from undergrad (the embryology chapter killed me! but thankfully I've revived since). So, if you are evolution theory ignorant (because what I remember from high school and basic bio in college has pretty much left my brain by now), this is a great read to pick up and brush up those corners of your brain. And Dawkins tends to stick more to the biology is this one, rather than condescending (as much) to the religious which is generally my criticism for any atheist works of his, so yup... read it. "

I agree with him that it's pretty disheartening that so many people just out right reject evolution, without observing ANY evidence, but you also can't tell unbelievers that they are basically stupid because of their religion and expect people to care to listen to your argument.

233,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31260727-josiah,4,"As a creationist, I disagree with a lot of the ways that Dawkins interprets scientific studies and don't agree with most of his conclusions, but I have to give credit where credit is due: this is, by and large, a good argument for macro-evolution. He lays out complex scientific topics in easy-enough ways for a layperson to understand, explains things in entertaining ways at times, and uses a variety of studies and arguments to make his case. I think his scientific arguments are flawed (see this book), but he also makes some good points at times and I can appreciate certain arguments while disagreeing with them.That being said, while I could respect Dawkins when he was talking about science, his arguments were laughably bad when it came to philosophy. Dawkins tries to seriously argue that the presence of pain in gazelles disproves a creator, the fact that trees try to ""compete"" with each other for who can be the tallest disproves a creator, and the fact that predators don't prey ""optimally"" disproves a creator, among other things. His lack of understanding for what the intelligent design movement argues and his college-freshman-level understanding of philosophy hurt his credibility in my book. For someone who makes a big deal about non-scientists misinterpreting science, he really should be more careful before delving into philosophy as a non-philosopher.Overall, I appreciated reading this book to better understand scientific arguments against the creationist/intelligent design positions. Didn't persuade me, but it was well-argued (sans the philosophy bits).Rating: 3.5-4 Stars (Good)."

235,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Back in the 60‘s, the Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species and Descent of Man was probably the single greatest inspiration for me to study biology and eventually get a degree in that major. I was not an atheist back in those days. I’m not sure I am totally one today? I have many, many problems with organized religion. I cannot nor will I ever believe that I could be a member of such a community. However, I have not given up on the idea that there might not be some intelligent design to things. It’s just not the intelligence of Richard Dawkins.Think about it, Richard. I’ll bet that you believe their is a high probability that there is life and possibly even intelligence somewhere else in the universe. Would it be intelligence as we know it do you suppose?Publishers Weekly commented, ""If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book [GSoE] he should pick up.” The review then goes on to say that “Dawkins remains a superb translator of complex scientific concepts....he has a way of making the drollest details feel like a revelation."" I support the first part of that review but not the second. I think that Charles Darwin was that person who could so superbly articulate and make clear complex, scientific concepts. Richard Dawkins has a problem.The author of The Greatest Show on Earth, Richard Dawkins, is a self-described militant atheist. For me, therein lies the “greatest” problem with this book and others he has written. I have no problem with Dawkins’ atheism. I understand his militancy. But all of that, particularly rapped up in vehement emotion seems incongruent with a book on science. Unless perhaps in the study of behaviorism, science loses its authenticity in the presence of emotion. It ceases to be legitimate science and begins to sound more like the “circus” he is trying to debunk. In most of his books, Dawkins makes a passionate argument against the influence of religion around the teaching of evolution. Or maybe one should say the influence of religion on Not teaching evolution. I understand that and I completely support his thesis. However, for the same reason, I just do not believe that his anti-religious rants belong in a book that purports to teach science any more than speculation on creationism belongs in the classroom. Both seem to cheapen the discipline of science itself. As hard as Dawkins tries to separate Church, State and secular education, it is in this trying that his books lose their scientific punch. There was a lot to like about GSoE. Reading about evolution again, I relived with much of the same excitement I had had back in those days when, as that teenager, I was introduced to evolution. But all of Dawkins’ bashing and defensiveness diminishes the sheer enjoyment of reading and reveling in the beauty that is Charles Darwin all by himself. What Dawkins has to say about separating Church and State and education needs desperately to be said and needs to be listened to. A book all about that and without all the biology would be fine. It would make more sense and probably be more widely read. One book, Richard, maybe one book of the ilk of GSoE would make sense, but an entire library devoted to this? Come on..... Sounds almost like a crusade that you would argue against so ardently. Discover magazine called Richard Dawkins ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" for his “fierce and effective defense of evolution.” I believe that speaks a disservice to the genus canids. In today’s world, anyone with half a brain knows that evolution requires no more of defense than that of the heliocentric solar system. But yes, our schools and curricula do need defense from religious zealots. Let’s just keep the fact of evolution separate from the theory that it’s not. The socio-political and religious arguments for teaching creationism to the exclusion or at least the demeaning of evolution are strong, large and looming enough targets to go after on their own. The breath and depth of science in this book only muddys up that water. Do I care that a recent Gallup poll concluded that 44 percent of Americans believed a god created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years and that beliefs in Europe are not much different? You bet I care. I just do not think folks like Dawkins are going to change that thinking with books like this. You want to know about evolution? Read Charles Darwin first. Go to the master himself. He is totally approachable and his science reads like beautiful prose. You want religious influences out of public schools, join the PTA or vote for the right candidate. In its totality, I subscribe to all that Dawkins posits. It's only the messenger that I'd like to kill."
236,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Although Dawkins doesn't seem to realize that you can't reason someone away from a position they don't hold by reason, so trying to arm people to counter the arguments of evolution 'skeptics' is a futile endeavor; however, getting a lot of the gaps filled in about evolution is a fascinating subject for us dilettantes who accept that science isn't intentionally lying to us and are interested in how the accepted science came to be accepted.Yes, those are ironic quotes around the word skeptics, because metaphorically waving ones hands and repeating nuh-uh isn't really skepticism, it's willful ignorance.So, sure, one may hear from science deniers that evolution isn't science because you can't test it in a lab. People that claim that are both wrong about the necessity of a lab to test a hypothesis, and the claim that evolution hasn't been tested in a lab. There are experiments where evolution has been demonstrated in a lab - bacteria that have multiple generations in a day, so that evolutionary timelines are years instead of millennia. And the bacteria adapt. Is this good to read about because it will help you convince somebody who's invested in not believing evolution? Of course not. You can't change anybody's mind. Only they can, and if they've predetermined they won't change their mind you're wasting your time. But it's cool as heck. The experiment, that is. And Dawkins explains it, perfectly striking the balance between making it accessible to the layperson, without leaving out substance.Is the anecdote wherein a denier, who couldn't accept that random mutations could advance from a single cell to a complete human, with a nervous system, miles of blood vessels, sight, hearing, etc., might arise in billions of years, was confronted with the observation that she accomplished it herself in nine months, going to even begin to sway someone who's dug in their heels? Duh no. But the chapter about how we're metaphorical origami rather than constructions from blueprints elucidates so much, and makes the observations that humans have gills early in embryonic development, as birds have teeth and bony tails, make sense. These aren't flukes, they're expected observations of undesigned results of millions of random prototypes.So, please don't tell Dawkins I said this, because I hate to crush a dream, but the book works for unintended reasons. It's a great survey course in evolution. It cannot work to sway your extended family at Thanksgiving because they aren't genuinely interested in allowing their minds to be changed. And one thing dumb ol' evolution hasn't accomplished yet is allowing objective evidence to force someone to change their minds. Apparently there's no competitive advantage in it."

Why is it so difficult to believe in the evidence shoved in your face but just way too easy to believe in naked beings eating forbidden fruit and unleashing horrors in the world? A conversation with my dear mother or a close friend can make anyone fly off the handle. Senseless logic is in abundance. I am a very patient person except when it comes religion. I see no reason why I should be.A brilliant article in September by a well-known science professor about religion and science led to him receiving death threats. Yes, that is the ugly world we live in, a sad truth. Freedom of expression, of speech these rights belong to every person as long as they don’t use it. That’s how it works now a days.  ”The history-deniers themselves are among those that I am trying to reach in this book.”So listen carefully.”As for the claim that evolution has never been ‘proved’, proof is a notion that scientists have been intimidated into mistrusting. Influential philosophers tell us we can’t prove anything in science. Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution. Evolution is a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere. Though logic-choppers rule the town,* some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.”Dawkins is persistent and rightly so. Why would you disprove something that is true? If you are a creationist, do give Dawkins a chance. You might rethink your views. Enough of all this.The book begins with ‘theory’. What we do mean when use this word in a sentence? What do creationists mean when they use this word? The difference is major and explained wonderfully with the true meaning. Dawkins goes on to follow evolution from earlier times, depending on the species. Why are there so many different breeds of dogs suddenly when there were only a few back in the 18-19th centuries? Questions like this and many more are answered. We have come a long way from Darwin’s Origin of Species. More things are known today than Darwin knew back then when he was writing his masterpiece. ”Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips . . . continue the list as long as desired. That didn’t have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn’t. It didn’t have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it”Highly recommended."
238,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340159-amanda,4,"Approaching this with an education (albeit only just over half an undergrad degree for now) in evolutionary biology was a rather different experience, I would imagine, than approaching it with minimal knowledge of the subject matter. As it stands, I liked the book; I thought it was well put together and used some really classic as well as some really new and exciting examples of experiments that have been done and discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of evolution. But I also have some complaints and differences of opinion with it. The book seems to be a bit bipolar in terms of its intended audience. Obviously Dawkins wants to write for his usual fan base/ the generally curious and somewhat scientifically literate public. But another major aim of the book is to try and educate creationists. So it ends up switching back and forth between explaining the simplest of things (common sense stuff for anyone who's ever taken grade 9 or 10 science) and assuming you know them already. The end result is that the text patronizes even the layman reader while alienating the scientifically illiterate creationist who will not be able to grasp the concepts completely.Now, there are a few things I take issue with in terms of how he explains certain evolutionary concepts, but these are mostly nitty gritty details that I think could be worded to better convey the information without creating common misconceptions and thus aren't really worth focusing on too much. He doesn't really do evolutionary forces other than natural selection much justice (specifically random genetic drift), but as a friend of mine said: ""Just getting the idea of natural selection across to creationists is a challenge; bring out genetic drift and the shit will start to fly. One step at a time, here!""I think my major issue with the book pops up in the introduction. After explaining the scientific use of the word ""theory"" and contrasting it with the colloquial use, Dawkins decides that in order to avoid misconceptions, it would be best to use a different term. So he decides to make up a word. He borrows the mathematical term ""theorem"" and purposes misspells it ""theorum"". The ""theorum"" of evolution. He could just have easily referred to it as the fact of evolution, which is what he actually does for the rest of the book, only mentioning ""theorum"" once or twice more near the end. The whole thing is an exercise in futility and doesn't really do anything towards his goal of promoting scientific literacy. It just makes him sound silly. Although I suppose that ""theorum"" does sound better than if he were to purposely misspell ""law"" as ""luw"" of evolution.In spite of all the criticisms I've put forward, it actually is a good summary of evolutionary theory and deserves to be widely read. If we could make textbooks as engaging as this, I suspect that many more people would understand evolution and be less susceptible to creationist misinformation."
239,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is most certainly one of the best, most entertaining, and most interesting non-fiction books I’ve ever read. There is of course no doubt in this world anymore about Richard Dawkins’ amazing capabilities to put together a comprehensive, concise, yet thorough text on evolution that makes one want to keep reading, in search of even more interesting facts than the last few he’s brought forth.Dawkins describes this book as the ‘missing link’ in the impressive chain of books he’s written up until now: The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is meant as a book on the evidence for evolution, instead of being very much about the theory itself. And of course, as a highly intelligent evolutionary biologist, Dawkins more than succeeds in presenting evidence for evolution, using photos on coloured pages, diagrams, illustrations, and many other visual aids next to his own written word.He writes with humour and wit about all the amazingly interesting examples of evolution he puts forth, many of which were yet unknown to me, and shows how much passion and enthusiasm he has for this field. Reading this book made me almost feel giddy at times, and definitely brought me joy. Dawkins gives the reader a lot in this book: he doesn’t only provide evidence on evolution, but he also tackles a few arguments of creationists on evolution (the point where he stresses that the fossil record actually isn’t even needed as evidence for evolution is particularly strong, especially because it seems so overlooked). Critique on Dawkins and his work has sometimes been about his aggressive tone or his tendency to continue beating down creationists; I didn’t consider this to be a problem in The Greatest Show on Earth, nor did I think Dawkins was aggressive in any way. The creationists’ views are valid and contemporary in the discussion on the evidence of evolution, and I didn’t feel as if he was purposefully dragging them into this book.I would most certainly highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, with no exceptions. It’s a lovely, engaging, and interesting book that’s most definitely well-worth a read."
240,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,2,"I feel like I've had a Dawkins overload; maybe that's why I wasn't all that thrilled with this book, although some parts are very interesting (the part about dating from rings on trees and that sort of thing.) But his tone in arguing with believers in literal Biblical creation is annoying and condesending. Although I am firmly convinced of Darwin's theory, I think it's possible that religious writings such as the Bible (I am not all that familiar with any other holy books, I'm afraid) can be excused and interpreted by understanding the obvious: that people at the time of the writing did not have the knowledge we now have, and they made sense of things in the only way they knew how. Creating the earth in 6 days was meaningless at the time because what defines a day in the birth of the solar system? I can't come up with any science to rationalize the rib story, but as far as the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that's a pretty obvious reference to the origins of human consciousness, as in, they became self-aware and realized they were (gasp) naked. I doubt there was any snake involved but possibly the snake is a metaphor for evil/cunning; at any rate, I would not be surprised if the trouble was started by a woman.Dawkins makes no attempt at any understanding of his opponents, which is fine I guess, but to me, a good book looks at both sides."
241,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,4,"This work has to be a thorn in the side to all creationists. Dawkins refutes the most frequently put forward theories and sometimes simple lies and fairy tales of the modern creationists with clear evidence from an evolutionary standpoint.He provides several explanations for each example given from the animal and plant world and clearly explains why ""Darwin was right"".I found it unbelievable that, according to official surveys, so many people seriously believe that the world we know with all its diversity was only created 10,000 years ago."
242,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6794439-marius-masalar,3,"This is a challenging book to assess. My first question, upon finishing it, is ""who is this for?""The science is too involved for a scientifically illiterate fundamentalist creationist audience, the sardonic tone likewise off-putting to them, and the atheists like me who share his broad perspective hardly need a hand-held walk through the garden of nature's wonders and weirdnesses.Then again, maybe we do: it should be emphasised that this book makes for a fantastic full spectrum look at the subject of evolutionary theory, one complete with some excellent analogies, stunning facts, and wise correlations. Anyone with a high school level understanding of biology will be more than equipped to follow along and learn.Unfortunately, Dawkins' extensive expertise in the subject matter often falls prey to his fairly direct sense of humour, expressed via a mocking tone that does more to further the stereotype of him as a shrill British ponce than to reveal his truer nature as a passionate humanist.Inevitably, I am drawn to wonder what the inimitable Christopher Hitchens would have done with a similar task, equipped with Dawkins' subject expertise. I suspect his subtler wit, fantastically evocative writing, and sophisticated understanding of debate would have produced a finer work.Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend The Greatest Show On Earth to anyone who seeks a peerless introduction to the current state of evolutionary theory, or to a thicker-skinned creationist seeking to inform themselves about the opposing side in the debate about the origins of life."
243,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,5,"Dawkins latest book finally tackles creationism in a not-so-head-on collision. Always vowing to never answer a challenge directly, Dawkins does it in the best way he possibly could, by demonstrating why evolution is true.He seemingly leaves no stone uncovered in the challenge, often tackling direct claims made by creationists and demonstrating why they are false. He also covers how speciation has been observed and the whole ""show me your transitional fossils"" non-argument is handled masterfully. By demonstrating selective breeding of plants and animals by humans, he shows how easily and quickly humans have created new species within a couple of generations.Illustrated with images, colour plates and excellent description, Dawkins knows how to hold the reader's attention and to explain even the most complex scientific terms in easy to understand language. I'm not sure why this book was written though. In 2009, Jerry Coyne released ""Why Evolution is True"" which though I have not yet read, I imagine covers many similar themes and evidences.The other issue is of course that this book is NOT going to be read by the very people it is directed at. Creationists, despite their protests of ""teaching the controversy"" and ""academic freedom"", are not interested in understanding what evolution is. Those who are going to buy it and read it are those already convinced by the evidence for an old earth, natural selection and evolution by common descent, so the question must be asked in the words of Daniel Dennett... cui bono?See more book reviews at my blog"
244,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: ""'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution."" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the ""intelligent design"" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point."
245,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"Ironically a book on evolution would be a chimera of textbook, polemic, and panegyric it does none of those things particularly well. Too informal to be authoritative and too casual to be something one could refer someone to this book fits into the wide middle of Dawkins book which are summed up as ""nice but someone else has done it better"".Dawkins' books seem to grow out a nagging urge to yell something at the world and ""the point"" is poorly spread across sprawling chapters that reference across each other suggesting the book could have been better organized. The color plate system makes it easy to ""spoil"" section as it's not obvious what picture is being referred to.One section does stand head-and-shoulders above others in the discussion of dating tools. I never realized that tree-ring dating was as powerful as shown here, providing us a 12 millenia time-line in some places. If you can get it from your library or otherwise without cost, reading these sections is a good usage of ones time in providing a condensed pile of methodologies to pass to the uninformed. "

It ranks right up there with Climbing Mount Improbable and River out of Eden. Dawkins writes beautifully, especially for a scientist, with a combination of erudition and wit. I have a fairly strong background in science, but I don't think that this book would be too much of a slog for the intelligent humanities-based reader. The book's subtitle is The Evidence for Evolution, and the case he makes is cogent and convincing (although he's definitely preaching to the choir with this reader.)"

248,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"Unfortunately Richard Dawkins preceded this book with the book, The God Delusion. He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the ""theory"" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design. The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design. Sic Transit Intelligent Design.It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.Enough about evolution. What about the book?In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.For myself I suggest the following.The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievement"
249,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"Most educated people know the basics of evolution, so some of the topics covered in the book will already be familiar. The benefit of reading it is that Richard Dawkins covers all of the major areas, and so can fill in a few of the blanks that all of us have to one extent or the other. It covers the fossil record in depth, showing the relationships between living things past and present, and has a good discussion on “missing links.” He makes the point that the only reason we can divide the fossil record into different species is because of the gaps in that record. The slow changes over evolutionary time would have been imperceptible to anyone seeing the plants or animals while they were alive, and at no point could an observer have looked at something and said that it was a different species than its parents. In fact, the normal variation within the species would have been greater than any individual incremental evolutionary change. Only because of the breaks in the fossil record can we recognize the slow changes over time.Carbon-14, is the standard dating technique for plants and animals having lived within the past 50,000 years, but I did not know where it came from, and found Dawkins’ explanation quite interesting.Carbon-14 is special because it is continually being made by cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere. Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the atmosphere and its mass number is 14, the same as carbon-14’s. The difference is that carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons…. Cosmic ray particles are capable of hitting a proton in a nitrogen nucleus and converting it to a neutron. When this happens, the atom becomes carbon-14, carbon being one lower than nitrogen in the periodic table.Although we normally think of evolutionary time as taking place over millennia, Dawkins describes several experiments that showed major changes can happen very quickly. There was a fascinating experiment that tracked the changes in bacteria over many generation as they differentiated from their parent stock. There was also an experiment on zebra fish which showed that, in the absence of predators, the males evolved bright colors to attract females, but with predators present they quickly evolved duller spotted patterns to mimic the color of the stream bottom.He also makes a good point about sexual reproduction, in that when a living creature is conceived, it is only a “blending” of mother and father when looked at from a high level. At the DNA level, however, what gets passed are genes, which are either/or: any particular gene either comes from one parent or it comes from the other. They are never a blend of the two, although sometimes, for several reasons, they can pick up a mutation. There is an old Creationist argument that natural selection could not work because any new beneficial traits would be swamped as they blended into the existing traits of the general population, but if genes pass down intact, the helpful ones could spread.In his discussion of how modern molecular genetics has helped understand evolution, Dawkins makes an interesting point when explaining how scientists determine how closely related two species are:The human/dog cell should theoretically have an identical resemblance score to the chimpanzee/dog cell because humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same degree of relation to dogs. It should be identical, too, to the monkey/dog cell and the lemur/dog cell. This is because humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and lemurs are all connected to the dog via their common ancestor, an early primate (which probably looked a bit like a lemur). One of evolution’s most powerful arguments is that life evolved only once. This is a well known statement, but Dawkins makes it after he has brought to bear a great deal of evidence from many different fields of study, and when he finally presents it the reader gets a sense of its majesty. We are all truly connected, from the simplest bacteria to the most complicated creatures.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Richard Dawkins book if he didn’t take some well deserved swipes at Creationists. Were it not for their baleful influence on science and education, there would be something pathetically funny about them: they believe because they believe because they believe, and no amount of evidence or logic will change their minds. It reminded me of the saying that faith is not an argument, but the absence of arguments.I enjoyed this book. Because I already had a layman’s understanding of evolution, I wasn’t sure how much I would learn from it, but it was definitely worth the time. It filled in a number of gaps in my understanding, and expanded on the areas I was familiar with. It makes a strong case for evolution being, as the title says, the greatest show on earth."
250,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,3,"Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, in the same league as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Neil deGrasse Tyson. What stands out in the works of these people is their unwavering loyalty to Truth and Reason. They are not the sort of persons that can take an affront to Knowledge lying down. All of them are outright atheists that don’t mince words when it comes to attacking the superstitious and stupid religious beliefs. This is the third work of Dawkins that I am reading, after having gone through ‘The God Delusion’ and ‘The Magic of Reality’. Dawkins continues in the same vein as in those two books, but this book is turning the heat up for the ‘Creationists’ – those that believe that a god created this universe, our planet and all the life forms that populate it, within the last 10000 years or so. Dawkins builds a citadel from which the Evolutionists – those of us that believe that the planet Earth is about 4.6 billion years and all the life forms that we see in front of our eyes today evolved through natural genetic modification – can fight the ignorance of the ‘Creationists’. And, what a citadel has he built! I don’t think that a staunch believer of the religious version of ‘Creation’ will be moved by this book well enough to reverse his/her views, but this book will nevertheless end up causing a dent in his/her belief. Be it plants, animals or the multitude of bacterial and vermin life forms, Dawkins pulls them all up to stand as witness to the survival of their ancestors in the long gone past and their evolution by ‘natural selection’. Dawkins also arms all the ‘Evolutionists’ and ‘Darwinists’ with enough arsenal to fight back the stupid questions raised by the ‘Creationists’. ‘If men evolved from monkeys why are there monkeys still around?’, for example.But one thing that I couldn’t stomach in this book is that, while trying to build a citadel of facts and arguments strong enough to be unassailable by the ‘Creationists’, Dawkins seems to have become too obsessed with the details to the extent of ignoring the normal, laymen like me that couldn’t grasp science beyond a certain level, at least for now. You need to have a fair knowledge of genes to understand the book. In the previous two books, I found the words of Dawkins having a smooth flow. The same is lacking here. His random jumping between the topics and cross-referencing details in other chapters and even in his other books doesn’t make matters easy either. A good book to read, if you prefer reading books that are slow and heavy. Though this lacks the usual flow and wit of Richard Dawkins, it is a worthy shot in the arm if you are someone that ends up arguing with the ‘Believers’ every now and then."
251,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The Greatest Show On Earth: The Evidence for Evolution""I like most, but not all, of Richard Dawkins' books, especially ones such as ""The Selfish Gene"" where he is adding real new insights into how evolution works (and doesn't work). I gave his book-before-last, ""The God Delusion"", a pass, because it appeared to have all the charm and insight of a typical Internet rant. Dawkins is at his best when he talks about the topics he loves (biology), and at his worst when he talks about the topics he hates (religion).Fortunately, in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", he mostly sticks to what he loves. He describes this book as a sort of, ""oh, I should have said"", in which he goes back to describe the basic facts about evolution. In ""The Selfish Gene"", ""The Blind Watchmaker"", ""Climbing Mount Improbable"", and his other evolution-related books, he was taking it as given and discussing the more subtle aspects which are not covered in basic discussions. For this reason, I was not certain if I wanted to read this books, since, you know, I already took high school biology.The reality is, though, that Dawkins knows (or has at his disposal) an astonishing and delightful range of biological facts and short stories, from primates (current and extinct), dinosaurs, worms, a Monty Python parody of ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" (ok that one's not exactly biology), crab bodies imagined as rubber-sheet transformations of one another, and on and on.In particular I can commend Dawkins for his use of graphics. The technology used for making books in the 19th and 20th century led to an entirely regrettable reliance on exclusively print texts, which computer-controlled printing is only slowly undoing. In addition to the wonderful color insets, Dawkins has graphs, line drawings, and other imagery sprinkled liberally through the book. The greatest part of the history of books included pictures with the words; let's hope Dawkins becomes less of an exception in the 21st century.In addition, let's hope he sticks to topics he loves in future books. He's much more fun to read that way."
252,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277727-emily,0,"Richard Dawkins has set out to challenge Creationists with his new book ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."" As someone who was taught evolution by one of the most hardcore nuns in my Catholic school, I've always found Creationism somewhat baffling. Isn't ""faith"" believing in spite of evidence? Not pretending the evidence doesn't exist? In my personal canon, I rather like the idea that the ""clay"" God made Adam out of in the Bible is actually RNA. All live evolved from this, not just human life. I suppose this is neither here nor there. But it doesn't seem hard to reoncile evolution with God to me. If you created a universe, wouldn't you come up with some process by which the world could govern itself instead of having to deal with every little problem? I think you would. Anyway, Dawkins says this book is intended to convince Creationists that they are wrong. I don't think it will do that. They will just ignore this book as they ignore the rest of his work. I'm not sure there is any book that can be written that would convince people who are already certain, but it's not this one. (Perhaps if someone who was on the fence wrote a memoir about examining the evidence?) Dawkins's tone is a bit too superior. I listened to this on CD and I rather thought he was silently adding ""those idiots"" whenever he said ""history deniers"" (the phrase he uses for Creationists). Those who disagree are more like to shut the book before reading a whole chapter. So I think the main audience for this book will be people who already believe in Evolution who want to start fights with Creationists on the Internet. "
253,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,3,"This book does a decent job of explaning evolution, though I have two criticisms: First, the format suffers organizationally. The book is written as a rebuttal to creationist arguments, but Dawkins addresses those arguments by interspersing them, in no coherent order, within affirmative evidence for evolution. A bettter way to format the book would have been to model it after a good legal brief. Present the affirmative case for evolution first, then address creationist counterarguments second. Second, Dawkin exhibits unnecesary hostility toward those who believe in creationism. There is no good reason to be so disrespectful of their beliefs. To him, it's as if teaching children creationism is one of the world's greatest evils. At worst, however, teaching children creationism is only teaching them a false belief. Moreover, while many Americans (and others) believe in creationism, most (even by his own account) do not. The trend, if anything, is toward believing in evolution, so there's no reason to get so worked up about it. Dawkin's defensiveness and hostility actually render his book less persuasive, because he comes across as a radical, or extremist. For example, Dawkins repeats the phrase ""evolution is a fact"" perhaps several dozen times, as if saying it will necessarily make it so. If evolution if a fact, say it once and move on. In sum, a more level-headed approach would not only have made the book more persausive, but also a more enjoyable read. "
254,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"44% of Americans believe that humans were created by god about ten thousand years ago. I admire that Richard Dawkins' stamina in fighting the good fight but he's not going about it very effectively. He sounds pretentious. He uses technical terms quite frequently, to the point that I can barely keep up (and I have reasonable background in the area already). He repeatedly insults and mocks people who do not accept what he sees to be completely self-evident. The argument is not strung together too neatly and his time/resource allocation is also slightly questionable. You can feel his pain and sympathize, but if he wanted to be more effective he would have to surrender some of his ego first, which I don't think he can do very well.I personally read this book because I was curious to see what evidence from the animal kingdom Dawkins would select as his best ammunition and how he would structure the argument. I emerged slightly disappointed: by the tone, the flow, the structure, and the selection. If there is someone out there who would like to learn more about evolution I would instead recommend looking at some very well-produced videos on YouTube."

Although, I did have to google search some concepts because I didn't remember enough biology 101 foundations from undergrad (the embryology chapter killed me! but thankfully I've revived since). So, if you are evolution theory ignorant (because what I remember from high school and basic bio in college has pretty much left my brain by now), this is a great read to pick up and brush up those corners of your brain. And Dawkins tends to stick more to the biology is this one, rather than condescending (as much) to the religious which is generally my criticism for any atheist works of his, so yup... read it. "

263,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31260727-josiah,4,"As a creationist, I disagree with a lot of the ways that Dawkins interprets scientific studies and don't agree with most of his conclusions, but I have to give credit where credit is due: this is, by and large, a good argument for macro-evolution. He lays out complex scientific topics in easy-enough ways for a layperson to understand, explains things in entertaining ways at times, and uses a variety of studies and arguments to make his case. I think his scientific arguments are flawed (see this book), but he also makes some good points at times and I can appreciate certain arguments while disagreeing with them.That being said, while I could respect Dawkins when he was talking about science, his arguments were laughably bad when it came to philosophy. Dawkins tries to seriously argue that the presence of pain in gazelles disproves a creator, the fact that trees try to ""compete"" with each other for who can be the tallest disproves a creator, and the fact that predators don't prey ""optimally"" disproves a creator, among other things. His lack of understanding for what the intelligent design movement argues and his college-freshman-level understanding of philosophy hurt his credibility in my book. For someone who makes a big deal about non-scientists misinterpreting science, he really should be more careful before delving into philosophy as a non-philosopher.Overall, I appreciated reading this book to better understand scientific arguments against the creationist/intelligent design positions. Didn't persuade me, but it was well-argued (sans the philosophy bits).Rating: 3.5-4 Stars (Good)."

265,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Back in the 60‘s, the Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species and Descent of Man was probably the single greatest inspiration for me to study biology and eventually get a degree in that major. I was not an atheist back in those days. I’m not sure I am totally one today? I have many, many problems with organized religion. I cannot nor will I ever believe that I could be a member of such a community. However, I have not given up on the idea that there might not be some intelligent design to things. It’s just not the intelligence of Richard Dawkins.Think about it, Richard. I’ll bet that you believe their is a high probability that there is life and possibly even intelligence somewhere else in the universe. Would it be intelligence as we know it do you suppose?Publishers Weekly commented, ""If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book [GSoE] he should pick up.” The review then goes on to say that “Dawkins remains a superb translator of complex scientific concepts....he has a way of making the drollest details feel like a revelation."" I support the first part of that review but not the second. I think that Charles Darwin was that person who could so superbly articulate and make clear complex, scientific concepts. Richard Dawkins has a problem.The author of The Greatest Show on Earth, Richard Dawkins, is a self-described militant atheist. For me, therein lies the “greatest” problem with this book and others he has written. I have no problem with Dawkins’ atheism. I understand his militancy. But all of that, particularly rapped up in vehement emotion seems incongruent with a book on science. Unless perhaps in the study of behaviorism, science loses its authenticity in the presence of emotion. It ceases to be legitimate science and begins to sound more like the “circus” he is trying to debunk. In most of his books, Dawkins makes a passionate argument against the influence of religion around the teaching of evolution. Or maybe one should say the influence of religion on Not teaching evolution. I understand that and I completely support his thesis. However, for the same reason, I just do not believe that his anti-religious rants belong in a book that purports to teach science any more than speculation on creationism belongs in the classroom. Both seem to cheapen the discipline of science itself. As hard as Dawkins tries to separate Church, State and secular education, it is in this trying that his books lose their scientific punch. There was a lot to like about GSoE. Reading about evolution again, I relived with much of the same excitement I had had back in those days when, as that teenager, I was introduced to evolution. But all of Dawkins’ bashing and defensiveness diminishes the sheer enjoyment of reading and reveling in the beauty that is Charles Darwin all by himself. What Dawkins has to say about separating Church and State and education needs desperately to be said and needs to be listened to. A book all about that and without all the biology would be fine. It would make more sense and probably be more widely read. One book, Richard, maybe one book of the ilk of GSoE would make sense, but an entire library devoted to this? Come on..... Sounds almost like a crusade that you would argue against so ardently. Discover magazine called Richard Dawkins ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" for his “fierce and effective defense of evolution.” I believe that speaks a disservice to the genus canids. In today’s world, anyone with half a brain knows that evolution requires no more of defense than that of the heliocentric solar system. But yes, our schools and curricula do need defense from religious zealots. Let’s just keep the fact of evolution separate from the theory that it’s not. The socio-political and religious arguments for teaching creationism to the exclusion or at least the demeaning of evolution are strong, large and looming enough targets to go after on their own. The breath and depth of science in this book only muddys up that water. Do I care that a recent Gallup poll concluded that 44 percent of Americans believed a god created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years and that beliefs in Europe are not much different? You bet I care. I just do not think folks like Dawkins are going to change that thinking with books like this. You want to know about evolution? Read Charles Darwin first. Go to the master himself. He is totally approachable and his science reads like beautiful prose. You want religious influences out of public schools, join the PTA or vote for the right candidate. In its totality, I subscribe to all that Dawkins posits. It's only the messenger that I'd like to kill."
266,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Although Dawkins doesn't seem to realize that you can't reason someone away from a position they don't hold by reason, so trying to arm people to counter the arguments of evolution 'skeptics' is a futile endeavor; however, getting a lot of the gaps filled in about evolution is a fascinating subject for us dilettantes who accept that science isn't intentionally lying to us and are interested in how the accepted science came to be accepted.Yes, those are ironic quotes around the word skeptics, because metaphorically waving ones hands and repeating nuh-uh isn't really skepticism, it's willful ignorance.So, sure, one may hear from science deniers that evolution isn't science because you can't test it in a lab. People that claim that are both wrong about the necessity of a lab to test a hypothesis, and the claim that evolution hasn't been tested in a lab. There are experiments where evolution has been demonstrated in a lab - bacteria that have multiple generations in a day, so that evolutionary timelines are years instead of millennia. And the bacteria adapt. Is this good to read about because it will help you convince somebody who's invested in not believing evolution? Of course not. You can't change anybody's mind. Only they can, and if they've predetermined they won't change their mind you're wasting your time. But it's cool as heck. The experiment, that is. And Dawkins explains it, perfectly striking the balance between making it accessible to the layperson, without leaving out substance.Is the anecdote wherein a denier, who couldn't accept that random mutations could advance from a single cell to a complete human, with a nervous system, miles of blood vessels, sight, hearing, etc., might arise in billions of years, was confronted with the observation that she accomplished it herself in nine months, going to even begin to sway someone who's dug in their heels? Duh no. But the chapter about how we're metaphorical origami rather than constructions from blueprints elucidates so much, and makes the observations that humans have gills early in embryonic development, as birds have teeth and bony tails, make sense. These aren't flukes, they're expected observations of undesigned results of millions of random prototypes.So, please don't tell Dawkins I said this, because I hate to crush a dream, but the book works for unintended reasons. It's a great survey course in evolution. It cannot work to sway your extended family at Thanksgiving because they aren't genuinely interested in allowing their minds to be changed. And one thing dumb ol' evolution hasn't accomplished yet is allowing objective evidence to force someone to change their minds. Apparently there's no competitive advantage in it."

Why is it so difficult to believe in the evidence shoved in your face but just way too easy to believe in naked beings eating forbidden fruit and unleashing horrors in the world? A conversation with my dear mother or a close friend can make anyone fly off the handle. Senseless logic is in abundance. I am a very patient person except when it comes religion. I see no reason why I should be.A brilliant article in September by a well-known science professor about religion and science led to him receiving death threats. Yes, that is the ugly world we live in, a sad truth. Freedom of expression, of speech these rights belong to every person as long as they don’t use it. That’s how it works now a days.  ”The history-deniers themselves are among those that I am trying to reach in this book.”So listen carefully.”As for the claim that evolution has never been ‘proved’, proof is a notion that scientists have been intimidated into mistrusting. Influential philosophers tell us we can’t prove anything in science. Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution. Evolution is a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere. Though logic-choppers rule the town,* some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.”Dawkins is persistent and rightly so. Why would you disprove something that is true? If you are a creationist, do give Dawkins a chance. You might rethink your views. Enough of all this.The book begins with ‘theory’. What we do mean when use this word in a sentence? What do creationists mean when they use this word? The difference is major and explained wonderfully with the true meaning. Dawkins goes on to follow evolution from earlier times, depending on the species. Why are there so many different breeds of dogs suddenly when there were only a few back in the 18-19th centuries? Questions like this and many more are answered. We have come a long way from Darwin’s Origin of Species. More things are known today than Darwin knew back then when he was writing his masterpiece. ”Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips . . . continue the list as long as desired. That didn’t have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn’t. It didn’t have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it”Highly recommended."
268,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340159-amanda,4,"Approaching this with an education (albeit only just over half an undergrad degree for now) in evolutionary biology was a rather different experience, I would imagine, than approaching it with minimal knowledge of the subject matter. As it stands, I liked the book; I thought it was well put together and used some really classic as well as some really new and exciting examples of experiments that have been done and discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of evolution. But I also have some complaints and differences of opinion with it. The book seems to be a bit bipolar in terms of its intended audience. Obviously Dawkins wants to write for his usual fan base/ the generally curious and somewhat scientifically literate public. But another major aim of the book is to try and educate creationists. So it ends up switching back and forth between explaining the simplest of things (common sense stuff for anyone who's ever taken grade 9 or 10 science) and assuming you know them already. The end result is that the text patronizes even the layman reader while alienating the scientifically illiterate creationist who will not be able to grasp the concepts completely.Now, there are a few things I take issue with in terms of how he explains certain evolutionary concepts, but these are mostly nitty gritty details that I think could be worded to better convey the information without creating common misconceptions and thus aren't really worth focusing on too much. He doesn't really do evolutionary forces other than natural selection much justice (specifically random genetic drift), but as a friend of mine said: ""Just getting the idea of natural selection across to creationists is a challenge; bring out genetic drift and the shit will start to fly. One step at a time, here!""I think my major issue with the book pops up in the introduction. After explaining the scientific use of the word ""theory"" and contrasting it with the colloquial use, Dawkins decides that in order to avoid misconceptions, it would be best to use a different term. So he decides to make up a word. He borrows the mathematical term ""theorem"" and purposes misspells it ""theorum"". The ""theorum"" of evolution. He could just have easily referred to it as the fact of evolution, which is what he actually does for the rest of the book, only mentioning ""theorum"" once or twice more near the end. The whole thing is an exercise in futility and doesn't really do anything towards his goal of promoting scientific literacy. It just makes him sound silly. Although I suppose that ""theorum"" does sound better than if he were to purposely misspell ""law"" as ""luw"" of evolution.In spite of all the criticisms I've put forward, it actually is a good summary of evolutionary theory and deserves to be widely read. If we could make textbooks as engaging as this, I suspect that many more people would understand evolution and be less susceptible to creationist misinformation."
269,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is most certainly one of the best, most entertaining, and most interesting non-fiction books I’ve ever read. There is of course no doubt in this world anymore about Richard Dawkins’ amazing capabilities to put together a comprehensive, concise, yet thorough text on evolution that makes one want to keep reading, in search of even more interesting facts than the last few he’s brought forth.Dawkins describes this book as the ‘missing link’ in the impressive chain of books he’s written up until now: The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is meant as a book on the evidence for evolution, instead of being very much about the theory itself. And of course, as a highly intelligent evolutionary biologist, Dawkins more than succeeds in presenting evidence for evolution, using photos on coloured pages, diagrams, illustrations, and many other visual aids next to his own written word.He writes with humour and wit about all the amazingly interesting examples of evolution he puts forth, many of which were yet unknown to me, and shows how much passion and enthusiasm he has for this field. Reading this book made me almost feel giddy at times, and definitely brought me joy. Dawkins gives the reader a lot in this book: he doesn’t only provide evidence on evolution, but he also tackles a few arguments of creationists on evolution (the point where he stresses that the fossil record actually isn’t even needed as evidence for evolution is particularly strong, especially because it seems so overlooked). Critique on Dawkins and his work has sometimes been about his aggressive tone or his tendency to continue beating down creationists; I didn’t consider this to be a problem in The Greatest Show on Earth, nor did I think Dawkins was aggressive in any way. The creationists’ views are valid and contemporary in the discussion on the evidence of evolution, and I didn’t feel as if he was purposefully dragging them into this book.I would most certainly highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, with no exceptions. It’s a lovely, engaging, and interesting book that’s most definitely well-worth a read."
270,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,2,"I feel like I've had a Dawkins overload; maybe that's why I wasn't all that thrilled with this book, although some parts are very interesting (the part about dating from rings on trees and that sort of thing.) But his tone in arguing with believers in literal Biblical creation is annoying and condesending. Although I am firmly convinced of Darwin's theory, I think it's possible that religious writings such as the Bible (I am not all that familiar with any other holy books, I'm afraid) can be excused and interpreted by understanding the obvious: that people at the time of the writing did not have the knowledge we now have, and they made sense of things in the only way they knew how. Creating the earth in 6 days was meaningless at the time because what defines a day in the birth of the solar system? I can't come up with any science to rationalize the rib story, but as far as the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that's a pretty obvious reference to the origins of human consciousness, as in, they became self-aware and realized they were (gasp) naked. I doubt there was any snake involved but possibly the snake is a metaphor for evil/cunning; at any rate, I would not be surprised if the trouble was started by a woman.Dawkins makes no attempt at any understanding of his opponents, which is fine I guess, but to me, a good book looks at both sides."
271,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,4,"This work has to be a thorn in the side to all creationists. Dawkins refutes the most frequently put forward theories and sometimes simple lies and fairy tales of the modern creationists with clear evidence from an evolutionary standpoint.He provides several explanations for each example given from the animal and plant world and clearly explains why ""Darwin was right"".I found it unbelievable that, according to official surveys, so many people seriously believe that the world we know with all its diversity was only created 10,000 years ago."
272,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6794439-marius-masalar,3,"This is a challenging book to assess. My first question, upon finishing it, is ""who is this for?""The science is too involved for a scientifically illiterate fundamentalist creationist audience, the sardonic tone likewise off-putting to them, and the atheists like me who share his broad perspective hardly need a hand-held walk through the garden of nature's wonders and weirdnesses.Then again, maybe we do: it should be emphasised that this book makes for a fantastic full spectrum look at the subject of evolutionary theory, one complete with some excellent analogies, stunning facts, and wise correlations. Anyone with a high school level understanding of biology will be more than equipped to follow along and learn.Unfortunately, Dawkins' extensive expertise in the subject matter often falls prey to his fairly direct sense of humour, expressed via a mocking tone that does more to further the stereotype of him as a shrill British ponce than to reveal his truer nature as a passionate humanist.Inevitably, I am drawn to wonder what the inimitable Christopher Hitchens would have done with a similar task, equipped with Dawkins' subject expertise. I suspect his subtler wit, fantastically evocative writing, and sophisticated understanding of debate would have produced a finer work.Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend The Greatest Show On Earth to anyone who seeks a peerless introduction to the current state of evolutionary theory, or to a thicker-skinned creationist seeking to inform themselves about the opposing side in the debate about the origins of life."
273,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,5,"Dawkins latest book finally tackles creationism in a not-so-head-on collision. Always vowing to never answer a challenge directly, Dawkins does it in the best way he possibly could, by demonstrating why evolution is true.He seemingly leaves no stone uncovered in the challenge, often tackling direct claims made by creationists and demonstrating why they are false. He also covers how speciation has been observed and the whole ""show me your transitional fossils"" non-argument is handled masterfully. By demonstrating selective breeding of plants and animals by humans, he shows how easily and quickly humans have created new species within a couple of generations.Illustrated with images, colour plates and excellent description, Dawkins knows how to hold the reader's attention and to explain even the most complex scientific terms in easy to understand language. I'm not sure why this book was written though. In 2009, Jerry Coyne released ""Why Evolution is True"" which though I have not yet read, I imagine covers many similar themes and evidences.The other issue is of course that this book is NOT going to be read by the very people it is directed at. Creationists, despite their protests of ""teaching the controversy"" and ""academic freedom"", are not interested in understanding what evolution is. Those who are going to buy it and read it are those already convinced by the evidence for an old earth, natural selection and evolution by common descent, so the question must be asked in the words of Daniel Dennett... cui bono?See more book reviews at my blog"
274,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: ""'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution."" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the ""intelligent design"" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point."
275,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"Ironically a book on evolution would be a chimera of textbook, polemic, and panegyric it does none of those things particularly well. Too informal to be authoritative and too casual to be something one could refer someone to this book fits into the wide middle of Dawkins book which are summed up as ""nice but someone else has done it better"".Dawkins' books seem to grow out a nagging urge to yell something at the world and ""the point"" is poorly spread across sprawling chapters that reference across each other suggesting the book could have been better organized. The color plate system makes it easy to ""spoil"" section as it's not obvious what picture is being referred to.One section does stand head-and-shoulders above others in the discussion of dating tools. I never realized that tree-ring dating was as powerful as shown here, providing us a 12 millenia time-line in some places. If you can get it from your library or otherwise without cost, reading these sections is a good usage of ones time in providing a condensed pile of methodologies to pass to the uninformed. "

It ranks right up there with Climbing Mount Improbable and River out of Eden. Dawkins writes beautifully, especially for a scientist, with a combination of erudition and wit. I have a fairly strong background in science, but I don't think that this book would be too much of a slog for the intelligent humanities-based reader. The book's subtitle is The Evidence for Evolution, and the case he makes is cogent and convincing (although he's definitely preaching to the choir with this reader.)"

278,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"Unfortunately Richard Dawkins preceded this book with the book, The God Delusion. He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the ""theory"" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design. The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design. Sic Transit Intelligent Design.It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.Enough about evolution. What about the book?In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.For myself I suggest the following.The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievement"
279,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"Most educated people know the basics of evolution, so some of the topics covered in the book will already be familiar. The benefit of reading it is that Richard Dawkins covers all of the major areas, and so can fill in a few of the blanks that all of us have to one extent or the other. It covers the fossil record in depth, showing the relationships between living things past and present, and has a good discussion on “missing links.” He makes the point that the only reason we can divide the fossil record into different species is because of the gaps in that record. The slow changes over evolutionary time would have been imperceptible to anyone seeing the plants or animals while they were alive, and at no point could an observer have looked at something and said that it was a different species than its parents. In fact, the normal variation within the species would have been greater than any individual incremental evolutionary change. Only because of the breaks in the fossil record can we recognize the slow changes over time.Carbon-14, is the standard dating technique for plants and animals having lived within the past 50,000 years, but I did not know where it came from, and found Dawkins’ explanation quite interesting.Carbon-14 is special because it is continually being made by cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere. Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the atmosphere and its mass number is 14, the same as carbon-14’s. The difference is that carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons…. Cosmic ray particles are capable of hitting a proton in a nitrogen nucleus and converting it to a neutron. When this happens, the atom becomes carbon-14, carbon being one lower than nitrogen in the periodic table.Although we normally think of evolutionary time as taking place over millennia, Dawkins describes several experiments that showed major changes can happen very quickly. There was a fascinating experiment that tracked the changes in bacteria over many generation as they differentiated from their parent stock. There was also an experiment on zebra fish which showed that, in the absence of predators, the males evolved bright colors to attract females, but with predators present they quickly evolved duller spotted patterns to mimic the color of the stream bottom.He also makes a good point about sexual reproduction, in that when a living creature is conceived, it is only a “blending” of mother and father when looked at from a high level. At the DNA level, however, what gets passed are genes, which are either/or: any particular gene either comes from one parent or it comes from the other. They are never a blend of the two, although sometimes, for several reasons, they can pick up a mutation. There is an old Creationist argument that natural selection could not work because any new beneficial traits would be swamped as they blended into the existing traits of the general population, but if genes pass down intact, the helpful ones could spread.In his discussion of how modern molecular genetics has helped understand evolution, Dawkins makes an interesting point when explaining how scientists determine how closely related two species are:The human/dog cell should theoretically have an identical resemblance score to the chimpanzee/dog cell because humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same degree of relation to dogs. It should be identical, too, to the monkey/dog cell and the lemur/dog cell. This is because humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and lemurs are all connected to the dog via their common ancestor, an early primate (which probably looked a bit like a lemur). One of evolution’s most powerful arguments is that life evolved only once. This is a well known statement, but Dawkins makes it after he has brought to bear a great deal of evidence from many different fields of study, and when he finally presents it the reader gets a sense of its majesty. We are all truly connected, from the simplest bacteria to the most complicated creatures.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Richard Dawkins book if he didn’t take some well deserved swipes at Creationists. Were it not for their baleful influence on science and education, there would be something pathetically funny about them: they believe because they believe because they believe, and no amount of evidence or logic will change their minds. It reminded me of the saying that faith is not an argument, but the absence of arguments.I enjoyed this book. Because I already had a layman’s understanding of evolution, I wasn’t sure how much I would learn from it, but it was definitely worth the time. It filled in a number of gaps in my understanding, and expanded on the areas I was familiar with. It makes a strong case for evolution being, as the title says, the greatest show on earth."
280,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,3,"Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, in the same league as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Neil deGrasse Tyson. What stands out in the works of these people is their unwavering loyalty to Truth and Reason. They are not the sort of persons that can take an affront to Knowledge lying down. All of them are outright atheists that don’t mince words when it comes to attacking the superstitious and stupid religious beliefs. This is the third work of Dawkins that I am reading, after having gone through ‘The God Delusion’ and ‘The Magic of Reality’. Dawkins continues in the same vein as in those two books, but this book is turning the heat up for the ‘Creationists’ – those that believe that a god created this universe, our planet and all the life forms that populate it, within the last 10000 years or so. Dawkins builds a citadel from which the Evolutionists – those of us that believe that the planet Earth is about 4.6 billion years and all the life forms that we see in front of our eyes today evolved through natural genetic modification – can fight the ignorance of the ‘Creationists’. And, what a citadel has he built! I don’t think that a staunch believer of the religious version of ‘Creation’ will be moved by this book well enough to reverse his/her views, but this book will nevertheless end up causing a dent in his/her belief. Be it plants, animals or the multitude of bacterial and vermin life forms, Dawkins pulls them all up to stand as witness to the survival of their ancestors in the long gone past and their evolution by ‘natural selection’. Dawkins also arms all the ‘Evolutionists’ and ‘Darwinists’ with enough arsenal to fight back the stupid questions raised by the ‘Creationists’. ‘If men evolved from monkeys why are there monkeys still around?’, for example.But one thing that I couldn’t stomach in this book is that, while trying to build a citadel of facts and arguments strong enough to be unassailable by the ‘Creationists’, Dawkins seems to have become too obsessed with the details to the extent of ignoring the normal, laymen like me that couldn’t grasp science beyond a certain level, at least for now. You need to have a fair knowledge of genes to understand the book. In the previous two books, I found the words of Dawkins having a smooth flow. The same is lacking here. His random jumping between the topics and cross-referencing details in other chapters and even in his other books doesn’t make matters easy either. A good book to read, if you prefer reading books that are slow and heavy. Though this lacks the usual flow and wit of Richard Dawkins, it is a worthy shot in the arm if you are someone that ends up arguing with the ‘Believers’ every now and then."
281,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The Greatest Show On Earth: The Evidence for Evolution""I like most, but not all, of Richard Dawkins' books, especially ones such as ""The Selfish Gene"" where he is adding real new insights into how evolution works (and doesn't work). I gave his book-before-last, ""The God Delusion"", a pass, because it appeared to have all the charm and insight of a typical Internet rant. Dawkins is at his best when he talks about the topics he loves (biology), and at his worst when he talks about the topics he hates (religion).Fortunately, in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", he mostly sticks to what he loves. He describes this book as a sort of, ""oh, I should have said"", in which he goes back to describe the basic facts about evolution. In ""The Selfish Gene"", ""The Blind Watchmaker"", ""Climbing Mount Improbable"", and his other evolution-related books, he was taking it as given and discussing the more subtle aspects which are not covered in basic discussions. For this reason, I was not certain if I wanted to read this books, since, you know, I already took high school biology.The reality is, though, that Dawkins knows (or has at his disposal) an astonishing and delightful range of biological facts and short stories, from primates (current and extinct), dinosaurs, worms, a Monty Python parody of ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" (ok that one's not exactly biology), crab bodies imagined as rubber-sheet transformations of one another, and on and on.In particular I can commend Dawkins for his use of graphics. The technology used for making books in the 19th and 20th century led to an entirely regrettable reliance on exclusively print texts, which computer-controlled printing is only slowly undoing. In addition to the wonderful color insets, Dawkins has graphs, line drawings, and other imagery sprinkled liberally through the book. The greatest part of the history of books included pictures with the words; let's hope Dawkins becomes less of an exception in the 21st century.In addition, let's hope he sticks to topics he loves in future books. He's much more fun to read that way."
282,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277727-emily,0,"Richard Dawkins has set out to challenge Creationists with his new book ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."" As someone who was taught evolution by one of the most hardcore nuns in my Catholic school, I've always found Creationism somewhat baffling. Isn't ""faith"" believing in spite of evidence? Not pretending the evidence doesn't exist? In my personal canon, I rather like the idea that the ""clay"" God made Adam out of in the Bible is actually RNA. All live evolved from this, not just human life. I suppose this is neither here nor there. But it doesn't seem hard to reoncile evolution with God to me. If you created a universe, wouldn't you come up with some process by which the world could govern itself instead of having to deal with every little problem? I think you would. Anyway, Dawkins says this book is intended to convince Creationists that they are wrong. I don't think it will do that. They will just ignore this book as they ignore the rest of his work. I'm not sure there is any book that can be written that would convince people who are already certain, but it's not this one. (Perhaps if someone who was on the fence wrote a memoir about examining the evidence?) Dawkins's tone is a bit too superior. I listened to this on CD and I rather thought he was silently adding ""those idiots"" whenever he said ""history deniers"" (the phrase he uses for Creationists). Those who disagree are more like to shut the book before reading a whole chapter. So I think the main audience for this book will be people who already believe in Evolution who want to start fights with Creationists on the Internet. "
283,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,3,"This book does a decent job of explaning evolution, though I have two criticisms: First, the format suffers organizationally. The book is written as a rebuttal to creationist arguments, but Dawkins addresses those arguments by interspersing them, in no coherent order, within affirmative evidence for evolution. A bettter way to format the book would have been to model it after a good legal brief. Present the affirmative case for evolution first, then address creationist counterarguments second. Second, Dawkin exhibits unnecesary hostility toward those who believe in creationism. There is no good reason to be so disrespectful of their beliefs. To him, it's as if teaching children creationism is one of the world's greatest evils. At worst, however, teaching children creationism is only teaching them a false belief. Moreover, while many Americans (and others) believe in creationism, most (even by his own account) do not. The trend, if anything, is toward believing in evolution, so there's no reason to get so worked up about it. Dawkin's defensiveness and hostility actually render his book less persuasive, because he comes across as a radical, or extremist. For example, Dawkins repeats the phrase ""evolution is a fact"" perhaps several dozen times, as if saying it will necessarily make it so. If evolution if a fact, say it once and move on. In sum, a more level-headed approach would not only have made the book more persausive, but also a more enjoyable read. "
284,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"44% of Americans believe that humans were created by god about ten thousand years ago. I admire that Richard Dawkins' stamina in fighting the good fight but he's not going about it very effectively. He sounds pretentious. He uses technical terms quite frequently, to the point that I can barely keep up (and I have reasonable background in the area already). He repeatedly insults and mocks people who do not accept what he sees to be completely self-evident. The argument is not strung together too neatly and his time/resource allocation is also slightly questionable. You can feel his pain and sympathize, but if he wanted to be more effective he would have to surrender some of his ego first, which I don't think he can do very well.I personally read this book because I was curious to see what evidence from the animal kingdom Dawkins would select as his best ammunition and how he would structure the argument. I emerged slightly disappointed: by the tone, the flow, the structure, and the selection. If there is someone out there who would like to learn more about evolution I would instead recommend looking at some very well-produced videos on YouTube."
285,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4745220-alicja,5,"rating: 5/5It was sometimes a tough read but it presents the evidence for evolution in a clear and concise manner that is accessible to non-biologists. Although, I did have to google search some concepts because I didn't remember enough biology 101 foundations from undergrad (the embryology chapter killed me! but thankfully I've revived since). So, if you are evolution theory ignorant (because what I remember from high school and basic bio in college has pretty much left my brain by now), this is a great read to pick up and brush up those corners of your brain. And Dawkins tends to stick more to the biology is this one, rather than condescending (as much) to the religious which is generally my criticism for any atheist works of his, so yup... read it. "

I agree with him that it's pretty disheartening that so many people just out right reject evolution, without observing ANY evidence, but you also can't tell unbelievers that they are basically stupid because of their religion and expect people to care to listen to your argument.

293,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31260727-josiah,4,"As a creationist, I disagree with a lot of the ways that Dawkins interprets scientific studies and don't agree with most of his conclusions, but I have to give credit where credit is due: this is, by and large, a good argument for macro-evolution. He lays out complex scientific topics in easy-enough ways for a layperson to understand, explains things in entertaining ways at times, and uses a variety of studies and arguments to make his case. I think his scientific arguments are flawed (see this book), but he also makes some good points at times and I can appreciate certain arguments while disagreeing with them.That being said, while I could respect Dawkins when he was talking about science, his arguments were laughably bad when it came to philosophy. Dawkins tries to seriously argue that the presence of pain in gazelles disproves a creator, the fact that trees try to ""compete"" with each other for who can be the tallest disproves a creator, and the fact that predators don't prey ""optimally"" disproves a creator, among other things. His lack of understanding for what the intelligent design movement argues and his college-freshman-level understanding of philosophy hurt his credibility in my book. For someone who makes a big deal about non-scientists misinterpreting science, he really should be more careful before delving into philosophy as a non-philosopher.Overall, I appreciated reading this book to better understand scientific arguments against the creationist/intelligent design positions. Didn't persuade me, but it was well-argued (sans the philosophy bits).Rating: 3.5-4 Stars (Good)."

295,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Back in the 60‘s, the Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species and Descent of Man was probably the single greatest inspiration for me to study biology and eventually get a degree in that major. I was not an atheist back in those days. I’m not sure I am totally one today? I have many, many problems with organized religion. I cannot nor will I ever believe that I could be a member of such a community. However, I have not given up on the idea that there might not be some intelligent design to things. It’s just not the intelligence of Richard Dawkins.Think about it, Richard. I’ll bet that you believe their is a high probability that there is life and possibly even intelligence somewhere else in the universe. Would it be intelligence as we know it do you suppose?Publishers Weekly commented, ""If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book [GSoE] he should pick up.” The review then goes on to say that “Dawkins remains a superb translator of complex scientific concepts....he has a way of making the drollest details feel like a revelation."" I support the first part of that review but not the second. I think that Charles Darwin was that person who could so superbly articulate and make clear complex, scientific concepts. Richard Dawkins has a problem.The author of The Greatest Show on Earth, Richard Dawkins, is a self-described militant atheist. For me, therein lies the “greatest” problem with this book and others he has written. I have no problem with Dawkins’ atheism. I understand his militancy. But all of that, particularly rapped up in vehement emotion seems incongruent with a book on science. Unless perhaps in the study of behaviorism, science loses its authenticity in the presence of emotion. It ceases to be legitimate science and begins to sound more like the “circus” he is trying to debunk. In most of his books, Dawkins makes a passionate argument against the influence of religion around the teaching of evolution. Or maybe one should say the influence of religion on Not teaching evolution. I understand that and I completely support his thesis. However, for the same reason, I just do not believe that his anti-religious rants belong in a book that purports to teach science any more than speculation on creationism belongs in the classroom. Both seem to cheapen the discipline of science itself. As hard as Dawkins tries to separate Church, State and secular education, it is in this trying that his books lose their scientific punch. There was a lot to like about GSoE. Reading about evolution again, I relived with much of the same excitement I had had back in those days when, as that teenager, I was introduced to evolution. But all of Dawkins’ bashing and defensiveness diminishes the sheer enjoyment of reading and reveling in the beauty that is Charles Darwin all by himself. What Dawkins has to say about separating Church and State and education needs desperately to be said and needs to be listened to. A book all about that and without all the biology would be fine. It would make more sense and probably be more widely read. One book, Richard, maybe one book of the ilk of GSoE would make sense, but an entire library devoted to this? Come on..... Sounds almost like a crusade that you would argue against so ardently. Discover magazine called Richard Dawkins ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" for his “fierce and effective defense of evolution.” I believe that speaks a disservice to the genus canids. In today’s world, anyone with half a brain knows that evolution requires no more of defense than that of the heliocentric solar system. But yes, our schools and curricula do need defense from religious zealots. Let’s just keep the fact of evolution separate from the theory that it’s not. The socio-political and religious arguments for teaching creationism to the exclusion or at least the demeaning of evolution are strong, large and looming enough targets to go after on their own. The breath and depth of science in this book only muddys up that water. Do I care that a recent Gallup poll concluded that 44 percent of Americans believed a god created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years and that beliefs in Europe are not much different? You bet I care. I just do not think folks like Dawkins are going to change that thinking with books like this. You want to know about evolution? Read Charles Darwin first. Go to the master himself. He is totally approachable and his science reads like beautiful prose. You want religious influences out of public schools, join the PTA or vote for the right candidate. In its totality, I subscribe to all that Dawkins posits. It's only the messenger that I'd like to kill."
296,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Although Dawkins doesn't seem to realize that you can't reason someone away from a position they don't hold by reason, so trying to arm people to counter the arguments of evolution 'skeptics' is a futile endeavor; however, getting a lot of the gaps filled in about evolution is a fascinating subject for us dilettantes who accept that science isn't intentionally lying to us and are interested in how the accepted science came to be accepted.Yes, those are ironic quotes around the word skeptics, because metaphorically waving ones hands and repeating nuh-uh isn't really skepticism, it's willful ignorance.So, sure, one may hear from science deniers that evolution isn't science because you can't test it in a lab. People that claim that are both wrong about the necessity of a lab to test a hypothesis, and the claim that evolution hasn't been tested in a lab. There are experiments where evolution has been demonstrated in a lab - bacteria that have multiple generations in a day, so that evolutionary timelines are years instead of millennia. And the bacteria adapt. Is this good to read about because it will help you convince somebody who's invested in not believing evolution? Of course not. You can't change anybody's mind. Only they can, and if they've predetermined they won't change their mind you're wasting your time. But it's cool as heck. The experiment, that is. And Dawkins explains it, perfectly striking the balance between making it accessible to the layperson, without leaving out substance.Is the anecdote wherein a denier, who couldn't accept that random mutations could advance from a single cell to a complete human, with a nervous system, miles of blood vessels, sight, hearing, etc., might arise in billions of years, was confronted with the observation that she accomplished it herself in nine months, going to even begin to sway someone who's dug in their heels? Duh no. But the chapter about how we're metaphorical origami rather than constructions from blueprints elucidates so much, and makes the observations that humans have gills early in embryonic development, as birds have teeth and bony tails, make sense. These aren't flukes, they're expected observations of undesigned results of millions of random prototypes.So, please don't tell Dawkins I said this, because I hate to crush a dream, but the book works for unintended reasons. It's a great survey course in evolution. It cannot work to sway your extended family at Thanksgiving because they aren't genuinely interested in allowing their minds to be changed. And one thing dumb ol' evolution hasn't accomplished yet is allowing objective evidence to force someone to change their minds. Apparently there's no competitive advantage in it."

Why is it so difficult to believe in the evidence shoved in your face but just way too easy to believe in naked beings eating forbidden fruit and unleashing horrors in the world? A conversation with my dear mother or a close friend can make anyone fly off the handle. Senseless logic is in abundance. I am a very patient person except when it comes religion. I see no reason why I should be.A brilliant article in September by a well-known science professor about religion and science led to him receiving death threats. Yes, that is the ugly world we live in, a sad truth. Freedom of expression, of speech these rights belong to every person as long as they don’t use it. That’s how it works now a days.  ”The history-deniers themselves are among those that I am trying to reach in this book.”So listen carefully.”As for the claim that evolution has never been ‘proved’, proof is a notion that scientists have been intimidated into mistrusting. Influential philosophers tell us we can’t prove anything in science. Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution. Evolution is a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere. Though logic-choppers rule the town,* some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.”Dawkins is persistent and rightly so. Why would you disprove something that is true? If you are a creationist, do give Dawkins a chance. You might rethink your views. Enough of all this.The book begins with ‘theory’. What we do mean when use this word in a sentence? What do creationists mean when they use this word? The difference is major and explained wonderfully with the true meaning. Dawkins goes on to follow evolution from earlier times, depending on the species. Why are there so many different breeds of dogs suddenly when there were only a few back in the 18-19th centuries? Questions like this and many more are answered. We have come a long way from Darwin’s Origin of Species. More things are known today than Darwin knew back then when he was writing his masterpiece. ”Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips . . . continue the list as long as desired. That didn’t have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn’t. It didn’t have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it”Highly recommended."
298,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340159-amanda,4,"Approaching this with an education (albeit only just over half an undergrad degree for now) in evolutionary biology was a rather different experience, I would imagine, than approaching it with minimal knowledge of the subject matter. As it stands, I liked the book; I thought it was well put together and used some really classic as well as some really new and exciting examples of experiments that have been done and discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of evolution. But I also have some complaints and differences of opinion with it. The book seems to be a bit bipolar in terms of its intended audience. Obviously Dawkins wants to write for his usual fan base/ the generally curious and somewhat scientifically literate public. But another major aim of the book is to try and educate creationists. So it ends up switching back and forth between explaining the simplest of things (common sense stuff for anyone who's ever taken grade 9 or 10 science) and assuming you know them already. The end result is that the text patronizes even the layman reader while alienating the scientifically illiterate creationist who will not be able to grasp the concepts completely.Now, there are a few things I take issue with in terms of how he explains certain evolutionary concepts, but these are mostly nitty gritty details that I think could be worded to better convey the information without creating common misconceptions and thus aren't really worth focusing on too much. He doesn't really do evolutionary forces other than natural selection much justice (specifically random genetic drift), but as a friend of mine said: ""Just getting the idea of natural selection across to creationists is a challenge; bring out genetic drift and the shit will start to fly. One step at a time, here!""I think my major issue with the book pops up in the introduction. After explaining the scientific use of the word ""theory"" and contrasting it with the colloquial use, Dawkins decides that in order to avoid misconceptions, it would be best to use a different term. So he decides to make up a word. He borrows the mathematical term ""theorem"" and purposes misspells it ""theorum"". The ""theorum"" of evolution. He could just have easily referred to it as the fact of evolution, which is what he actually does for the rest of the book, only mentioning ""theorum"" once or twice more near the end. The whole thing is an exercise in futility and doesn't really do anything towards his goal of promoting scientific literacy. It just makes him sound silly. Although I suppose that ""theorum"" does sound better than if he were to purposely misspell ""law"" as ""luw"" of evolution.In spite of all the criticisms I've put forward, it actually is a good summary of evolutionary theory and deserves to be widely read. If we could make textbooks as engaging as this, I suspect that many more people would understand evolution and be less susceptible to creationist misinformation."

There is of course no doubt in this world anymore about Richard Dawkins’ amazing capabilities to put together a comprehensive, concise, yet thorough text on evolution that makes one want to keep reading, in search of even more interesting facts than the last few he’s brought forth.Dawkins describes this book as the ‘missing link’ in the impressive chain of books he’s written up until now: The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is meant as a book on the evidence for evolution, instead of being very much about the theory itself. And of course, as a highly intelligent evolutionary biologist, Dawkins more than succeeds in presenting evidence for evolution, using photos on coloured pages, diagrams, illustrations, and many other visual aids next to his own written word.He writes with humour and wit about all the amazingly interesting examples of evolution he puts forth, many of which were yet unknown to me, and shows how much passion and enthusiasm he has for this field. Reading this book made me almost feel giddy at times, and definitely brought me joy. Dawkins gives the reader a lot in this book: he doesn’t only provide evidence on evolution, but he also tackles a few arguments of creationists on evolution (the point where he stresses that the fossil record actually isn’t even needed as evidence for evolution is particularly strong, especially because it seems so overlooked). Critique on Dawkins and his work has sometimes been about his aggressive tone or his tendency to continue beating down creationists; I didn’t consider this to be a problem in The Greatest Show on Earth, nor did I think Dawkins was aggressive in any way. The creationists’ views are valid and contemporary in the discussion on the evidence of evolution, and I didn’t feel as if he was purposefully dragging them into this book.I would most certainly highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, with no exceptions. It’s a lovely, engaging, and interesting book that’s most definitely well-worth a read."
