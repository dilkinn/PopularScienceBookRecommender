0,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia,4,"This is a journalistic account of 'race science' - where both terms 'race' and 'science' are scrutinised with a sharp eye. Saini is quite up-front with her own stance: that there's no genetic or biological support for racial difference beyond the merest superficialities such as skin pigmentation. Driven by the re-emergence of the most pernicious ideologies that many of us thought had been exposed for what they are by the Holocaust and other race-based genocides of the C20th, this takes an interesting look at the history of 'race science' and the role it still plays in academic research today, however contested and controversial.Saini is a relaxed writer, always accessible and with a sense of humour that is light but with just the right level of suppressed snarkiness: witness the anecdote of the geneticist who proclaims that he's discovered the 'chop-stick using gene' in Chinese people! Well, we laugh - but, of course, it's not much of a jump to go from 'Chinese people are biologically pre-determined to use chopsticks' to insidious and horrific claims about racialised intelligence, racial hierarchies, justifications for slavery, the creation of race-based underclasses and we're soon back at those looming gas ovens of Auschwitz. What is most dispiriting about this book is the extent to which highly-educated scientists at the heart of the academe in both Europe and the US can cling to old views of racialised genetic predermination and 'race fate' *in the face of an almost complete lack of biological evidence for racial difference in humans*. It's an important point, of course, but one which perhaps gets slightly repetitive in this book. But, perhaps, it needs to. There are some horribly disconcerting moments such as when we realise that Maria Stopes favoured eugenics to stop the 'wrong' kind of people from giving birth in favour of so-called 'racial progress'; or that the legendary James Watson (of Crick and Watson fame) was openly racist and sexist and believed that cultural qualities such as Jewish intelligence, in the example given, is genetically pre-determined. It's impossible not to snigger at some of the desperate manoeuvers of 'race scientists': in the 1920s, when Greeks, Italians and other southern Europeans were being stigmatised as having sub-par intelligence, one 'scientist' claimed that artists such as Dante, Raphael, Titian, Michelangelo and da Vinci were clearly 'Nordic' - as, apparently, was Jesus! A high point, too, is Saini's digging behind the story from 2018 when the mummy of so-called 'Cheddar Man' was discovered and offered the opportunity to profile an ancient Briton - to the horror of many, not least the UK right-wing press, Cheddar Man turns out to have been black, not white. Which, considering the fact that humans all migrated out of Africa, is hardly surprising. (Light or white skin is an evolutionary development as ancient humans who migrated to less sunny northern Europe needed to maximise absorption of Vitamin D from the sun). So much, then, for all the Brexit-associated nostalgia for a mythic (white) England. And, of course, that's both the point of the book and why it's so important: this isn't a light-hearted review of old, done-and-dusted attitudes, this is about *now*: it's about Brexit and Trump, it's about #blacklivesmatter, it's about the alt-right appropriating and mis-using science, it's about respected scientists and scientific institutions themselves (though a marginal number, it must be stressed) still trying to find the elusive biological basis for race and differentiation - and all that follows along with it.

Extraordinarily good in how deep it goes (covering the intersection of 'science' with history, culture, and politics) and showing how very deeply rooted the tendrils are. Written with remarkable calm and objectivity which makes the final shout of rage all the more powerful. It goes into excellent detail about the resurgence of 'scientific' racism in recent years, as well as laying out the foolishness of the thinking but also its pervasiveness even in people who would think they know better and call themselves anti-racist. Essential reading, and I don't say that lightly."
2,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,1,"Politically correct but scientifically unsound This book drew a lot of attention recently in which the author suggests that the use of race in biological/medical research is due to widespread racism. For example, in Chapter 1, she argues that Out of Africa theory is invented by Europeans, and Nazis wanted to prove superiority of Aryan race. This is false; Hitler made alliances with Muslims from the Middle east against Jews. The Third Reich was anti-Semitic. If Hitler was really a racist, he would have invaded Africa. In fact, many SS officers who went to live in Egypt after the war became Muslims and followed Islamic practices. The author is also in error when she reminds readers that races correspond to “arbitrary” divisions of population variation that are “politically and economically useful,” The fact is that there are heritable characteristics that allow us to divide into a set of races in such a way that all the members share traits and tendencies with each other that they do not share with members of any other race. These traits and tendencies are viewed as race. Natural barriers such as oceans (e.g. the Atlantic), deserts (e.g. the Sahara) and mountain ranges (e.g. the Himalayas) impeded gene flow between different populations for substantial periods of time. When there is limited gene flow between populations that have come under different selection pressures, we would expect them to gradually diverge from one another over via the processes of genetic drift and natural selection. Races therefore correspond to human populations that have been living in relative isolation from one another, under different regimes of selection. This means that racial categories identify real phenotypic differences and reflect real genetic variation. Natural philosophers began to classify humans into different races because they looked different from one another. These differences reflect their divergent geographical origins. But the most controversial area of “race science” is research into population differences in cognitive ability. Chimpanzees share the distinction of being our closest living relative which share about 99% of our genes. A unique collaboration between the humanities and the natural sciences; geneticists, historians, archaeologists and linguists found a common ground about the origins of modern human beings including the common origins of languages from an ancient language called Indo-European language. Europeans today are a mix of the blending of at least three ancient populations of hunter-gatherers and farmers who moved into Europe in separate migrations. Modern human beings arose some 200,000 years ago, and for 190,000 years, they we were all dark-skinned, reflecting the origins from Africa. Caucasians are the product of a work of evolution across Europe, while scientist have discovered three genes that produce light skin – they have played a part in the lightening of Europeans’ skin color and the color of the eye over the past 8,000 years. The process of skin lightening, known as “depigmentation,” occurred due to a series of mutations in one particular gene called SCL24A5.Equating hereditarian claims with racism is illogical and irresponsible. Many of the ideas that Saini classifies as “scientific racism” are empirical claims. Besides, race is not a social construct, but nationalism and regionalism are certainly social constructs. She uses false arguments to fit her theory. This is a blatant abuse of scientific data to write a politically correct fable. Her conclusions are inaccurate. I would recommend staying away from this apologue."

We will make this be the truth if we try hard enough'- Subir Sinha.Oh how this resonates in our social media dominated/'fake news' society. Sinha's quote refers particularly to religious extremists but effectively demonstrates the kind of sentiment that underlies the 'science' and ways of thinking that the book works to demolish. That backwards system which starts with ideology and then looks for evidence to support it. Race is not about genetics/ biological difference, it is a social, cultural, political construct. It was created to separate, subordinate, invalidate certain types of people, a way of perpetuating and bolstering the supposed superiority of the great white male. It's the kind of thing that feels like part of the past, and it definitely should be, but Angela Saini shows that not only it it still here, it never went away. Even the Holocaust was not enough to demonstrate the dangers inherent in such ideology, simply pushing those who held these types of views out of the mainstream. For a while at least.Because now they're back and at the forefront of populist politics- given airtime, given applause, given power. And that's why books like this are so essential, to hold people and ideas up to scrutiny, to start conversations, to attack the fundamental misunderstandings (deliberate or otherwise) about human variation. Because feelings of superiority are how we end up arguing that migrant children in border camps don't really need soap or blankets or safety, it's how the fear of difference and the 'other' leads to Trump and Brexit, how 'knowing' that certain ethnic groups just aren't as clever or industrious means that they're a lost cause, worthless, a burden. It's always useful to blame those being crushed by inequality for their own problems. If they deserve it, there's nothing we can do, right? If nothing else, this book is an essential reminder about evaluating the quality of the information you access, share, and trust. Where does it come from? Who paid for it? What are they trying to sell you? Who benefits? What Saini's book does is present the ways in which the ideologies behind race science have altered or even determined its conclusions. And if you want to apply the same fact checking to her work, her sources are right there at the back. ARC via Netgalley"
5,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"It was always going to be difficult to follow Angela Saini's hugely popular Inferior, but with Superior she has pulled it off, not just in the content but by upping the quality of the writing to a whole new level. Where Inferior looked at the misuse of science in supporting sexism (and the existence of sexism in science), Superior examines the way that racism has been given a totally unfounded pseudo-scientific basis in the past - and how, remarkably, despite absolute evidence to the contrary, this still turns up today.At the heart of the book is the scientific fact that 'race' simply does not exist biologically - it is nothing more than an outdated social label. As Saini points out, there are far larger genetic variations within a so-called race than there are between individuals supposedly of different races. She shows how, pre-genetics, racial prejudice was given a pseudo-scientific veneer by dreaming up fictitious physical differences over and above the tiny distinctions of appearance - and how this has been continued and transformed with genetics to draw conclusions that go against the fundamental proviso of science - correlation is not causality. Saini demonstrates vividly how, for example, socio-economic or cultural causes of differences in capability, and even medical response to drugs, have been repeatedly ascribed to non-existent biological racial differences.Along the way we come across the horrendous race-based acts of the past - from slavery to the Nazi atrocities - which have been justified by fictitious assumptions about the implications of race. But Saini makes clear that this is not just a historical problem. One of the excellent aspects of the book is the way that she brings in interviews and personal experience, so, for example, there is a fascinating section on discrimination on the basis of caste in India, and attempts to justify this on a genetic basis. Similarly, she repeatedly shows how white supremacists misuse information to draw incorrect and vile conclusions.There are fascinating interviews with scientists whose work strays into misuse of evidence to imply something that the data simply does not support. With one exception of Robert Plomin, whose work seems far more solid than the rest, and can only be used to support racism by deliberately misunderstanding it, a lot of this work seems to have been poorly executed or involves drawing inappropriate conclusions. A considerable amount of this nonsense involves IQ testing - yet it has been shown that all IQ tests do is demonstrate an ability to do well at IQ tests, an ability that can be learned - so provides no useable evidence.The coverage might have easily been extended to cover other discrimination on perceived differences, but I can see the benefit of keeping the focus on race. For me, the only disappointing thing is that Saini shies away from the logical conclusion of her observations. Having categorically shown that race does not exist, it's ridiculous that we still classify people this way. As the author acknowledges, we need some means of categorisation to fight prejudice - but surely it should be based on real markers such as socio-economic means and culture - to continue to do so by race having established that race doesn't exist seems oddly incongruous, and makes it more difficult to counter racists by giving weight to the labels they use.Overall, a brilliant book, highly readable, which, if there were any justice, would put a final nail in the coffin of racism."
6,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"Having grown up as part of an ethnic minority group in London during the 1980s and 90s, Angela Saini has first-hand experience of the racism which was rife during these decades. Unfortunately, after being heavily discredited, race science has slowly and insidiously crept back into public discourse over the past 50-70 years. During her formative years, the murder of Stephen Lawrence in close proximity to her childhood home had a big impact on her and what really stuck in her mind was the difference between someone white being murdered and a black individual; it was obvious that fewer resources and time were dedicated to an ethnic minority individual to those who were white. But was this due to scientific or societal issues?This childhood experience precipitated Saini's intense interest in the subject of race, racial bias and matters surrounding it, and this is an essential and exceptional work which rebuts the idea of racism as a biological issue rather than a social one. Not only does she debunk the lie that inequality is to do with genetics but she goes a long way to proving that it has everything to do with political power. It is a fascinating and beautifully written piece which has clearly been extensively researched. It is a masterfully written, topical piece by one of the most trusted science writers of our time and should be on the reading lists of anyone interested in the history and evolution of this subject from the beginning of time up to present day. Although it is frequently referred to as race science, I think the most appropriate and fitting terminology is racist science. Many thanks to Fourth Estate for an ARC."

The power of nationalism is that it calls to the part of us that doesn’t want to accept being ordinary. It tells people that they are descended from greatness, that they have been genetically endowed with something special, something passed down to them over the generations. It attaches them to origin stories that have existed for hundreds of years, soaking into their subconscious, obscuring truth...
Simply outstanding. Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong—and the New Research That's Rewriting the Story was also fantastic, but I think Saini has outdone herself here!This is, above all, a journalist's exploration on what is happening right now. ""Race science"" never left, it was never gone, but it is having a resurgence today. Maybe most (some?) scientists have good intentions, but the language they use, the beliefs and biases they bring to their research, all of it has real-life consequences. This is what happens when researchers have already made their conclusions (through an upbringing full of society's social conditioning to believe that some races are inferior to others) before they have the evidence.
‘If you see the genetic markers today that are found in western Europe, people will see those in the past and continue referring to them as western European, even if they’re then also found in Siberia.’ It’s another example of an ‘indexing problem’, when the first available body of evidence influences subsequent thinking. Western researchers tend to have more access to European data because it’s on their doorstep, so later discoveries elsewhere in the world are often interpreted relative to these.
 Saini beautifully and effectively explains why ""race"" is not a biological category, but a social, cultural and political one. Scientists insistence to study race as biological has done extreme harm throughout history. First, as Saini explains, racial ""difference"" was believed to be ""in the blood"", while today many believe that it is genetic. As Saini frequently stresses, there are far more genetic variations within a ""race"" than there are between individuals of supposedly different races. There is a constant determination, within some sectors of the scientific community, that eventually they will find their proof of racial difference, that it'll be when the next form of technology comes into use, and the next, and the next...And this results in a society like this:
...Americans cling to the idea of black exceptionalism when it comes to health may be that, in some way, the idea lets society off the hook. It places the blame for inequality at the foot of biology. If poor health today is intrinsic to black bodies and nothing to do with racism, it’s no one’s fault. ‘It says it’s not our organisation of society that’s somehow unfair or unjust or discriminatory. It’s not that we treat people badly. It’s not that we give people worse life chances,’ he says. ‘It’s just that these people have some genetic defect and it’s just the way they are.’
It's disturbing and dispiriting, but Saini's collected evidence shows we cannot ignore this phenomenon any long. Race science was never history. It's still alive and here today.Overall, a fascinating, readable and stellar read. Everyone and anyone should read this book! Above all, it's important reminder to check your beliefs and check your sources."

11,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2912586-giovanni-chierico,3,"Important subject but somewhat rambling execution. The book doesn't seem to have a coherent trajectory, and repeats over and over the same points. It is essentially a reaction to the resurgence of racisms in today's world. IMHO the missing point is the following: there are facts and value judgments about such facts. Even imagining there are identifiable average differences between different populations (whose grouping might be a social construct) this does NOT imply any different treatment of such people is justified. E.g. in a different domain, ethical vegetarians are ready to admit different capabilities of different species, but they do not derive that humans are justified in slaughtering non human animals. So it's a two step process and the author focuses on the ""facts"" side ignoring the ""value"" side, making her argument more confused than what IMHO could be.Edit: from ""who we are and how we got here"" by David Reich :""The right way to deal with the inevitable discovery of substantial differences across populations is to realize that their existence should not affect the way we conduct ourselves.""""I am worried that people who deny the possibility of substantial biological differences among populations across a range of traits are digging themselves into an indefensible position, one that will not survive the onslaught of science.""""Because of the multidimensionality of human traits, the great variation that exists among individuals, and the extent to which hard work and upbringing can compensate for genetic endowment, the only sensible approach is to celebrate every person and every population as an extraordinary realization of our human genius and to give each person every chance to succeed, regardless of the particular average combination of genetic propensities he or she happens to display."""
12,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12798350-andrew,4,"Superior: The Return of Race Science, by Angela Saini, is a book looking at the disturbing history and modern application of race science. Saini argues that race science is almost entirely political - differences in humans are almost entirely related to nurture, economic and social differences, and culture. These factors are transferred between parent and child, but are not biological in any sense. Sainin brings together numerous data points and interviews with leading geneticists and biologists to show the science backs up these points. And yet, racial sciences persist. It has even seen a resurgence in recent years, with nationalists globally using racial science as a tool to rewrite history, and change the narrative to promote their own ideals of superiority. Racial science was a vogue branch of biology with roots in Darwinism, and was often utilized by colonial societies to promote racial hierarchy in highly unequal societies. This branch of science was, historically, related to white supremacy and domination of groups that were enslaved, colonized, or oppressed. The field of racial science was steeped in Darwinism and the idea that if different species of animal diverged, so to must humans. It stands to reason that this would be an assumption; racial differences were often perceived based on visual differences, and socioeconomic differences. Basically, if someone is poor, or colonized, then it stands to reason their must be a natural, genetic reason for this. This thought process led to the development of eugenics; the study of actual biological differences between peoples from different places on Earth. Eugenics was a nasty field of science that informed colonists in Europe, segregationists in the US, and the Nazi movement in Germany, a science steeped in blood.Saini moves on to analyze why racial science is still has such strong adherents. After WWII, the study of Eugenics went underground, and was re-branded. The word race was no longer an accepted term, and instead, phrases like human diversity, genetics, and biodiversity were used to portray the same ideas. Infamous books such as the Bell Curve - a 1993 study on differences in educational achievement in white and black communities in the US, came to the conclusion that these differences were genetic - that white students may be more capable students due to genetic differences, and not differences in socio-economic advantages. This book is rightly considered pretty pseudo-scientific, but has been influential in right leaning think tanks and magazines like Mankind Quarterly, which have in turn fuelled racialized rhetoric in nations all over the world. Saini looks at this form multiple perspectives, both from advert racists globally, and the more subtle, and inherent insensitivity and conflict that dog genetic research. Saini argues that genetics do not inform most differences between humans, and that, although an important field of study, genetics is often utilized for poor reasons. White supremacists scroll through academic papers to cherry pick information that conforms to their world view. Hindi nationalists use it to try and reignite the debates on caste and anti-Islamic thought. The list goes on. These deep connections are sought after by humans to try and conform to how they want to see the world, and how they want to perceive themselves. In reality, genetic diversity in humans in massively complex, and we show a remarkable level of human integration. On the plus side here, most racial sciences are considered to be quack, and many openly racists scientist are marginalized. Even so, they still exist, and groups like the Pioneer Fund, and their Mankind Quarterly, exist to fund racial sciences so that the debate on racial differences - largely considered bunk, can continue to influence opinions. An excellent read through and through, this book is an excellent look at the peer-reviewed world behind racism, and how racial sciences exist to fuel political topics that have little to do with the actual human genome. A solid read, and definitely a recommendation for a great and informative work on racial sciences. "
13,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"Ideas about race came into roughly modern form in the early modern period when Europeans started to come into contact with other parts of the world. Ideas of race are based on the features that easily come to the eye, skin tone, hair, eye color. The categories which shift due to theses appearance differences and political conditions on the ground ie. slavery, colonization, exploitation at the time form the initial hunches that racists use to make an ideology usually crafted for the politically dominant group. Science developed at the time which made striking strides in understanding the world was employed either intentionally by racists or unintentionally by scientists who were like everyone else affected by the ideas around them to lend credibility to this racist sensibility. Human tendency for cognitive bias and seeing what our expectations tend to want to see can explain how a lot of shoddy work, especially in earlier eras, was accepted. In the wake of the Eugenics movement and its logical terminus at the gas chambers in Treblinka science examined those easy assumptions of race in the postwar era and found the idea of race didn't hold up to scrutiny. Of course, racists were not going to go quietly into the good night and assembled with money from rich donors (the right always has rich donors) and set up a network of intellectuals to keep racist ideas going. So while the rest of Europe was trying to come to terms with the legacy of racism the racist network of intellectuals was supporting each other and biding its time for a comeback. Now calling themselves ""race realists"" they are trying to put their ideas into the academic mainstream to revive and give license to racist impulses found in a wide swath of the population. The old monsters are now waking from their slumber and are beginning to stir and this book documents the bad actors bringing this about."

It takes some mental acrobatics to be an intellectual racist in light of the scientific information we have today, but those who want to do it, will. Racists will find validation wherever they can, even if it means working a little harder than usual.

15,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,4,"I expected this book to focus on debunking the idea of innate differences in abilities between races. Instead, Saini documents the history of racial prejudice influencing science. The book is stronger for this approach, and I came out wiser, if a little more scared.In a well-written, often absorbing narrative, Saini documents the thread of eugenics from Darwinism, through fascism, and right to fringe publications, wealthy foundations, and even members of the editorial boards of mainstream science journals. She illustrates how a consistent way of thinking - which emphasises the superiority of European norms and peoples - continues to influence more mainstream thought. In this, the idea that outright racists are still within the Academy - is a little frightening in an era where outright racist ideas are gaining currency. Saini also looks at modern fields, from genetics to social and neuroscience. She covers the woeful tale of BiDil, which was for many years touted as the forerunner of a wave of racialised medicine. BiDil treats hypertension, which African-Americans suffer from in much higher rates than whites. Many American scientists persist in viewing this as a probable genetic difference, despite Africans (and Afro-Cuban) having quite low levels of hypertension. BiDil was touted as more effective on African-Americans. The issue is that it wasn't - in fact, in seeking approval to have listed as a specific racially targeted drug, BiDil was *only* tested on African Americans. The motivation was what Saini coyly calls ""marketing"", but was really to keep the drug in patent, and hence not subject to competing with generics. Nearly a decade on, BiDil is mostly a failure, not that surprising given it is marketed at a poor segment of the population but costs a mint, meaning health insurers won't pay for it. Oh, and it appears equally effective on all racial groups. BiDil has turned out to be the birth and death of racialised medicine.Saini also interviews David Reich, who bedazzles her with his complex net of understanding if how genetically mixed most humans are, descended from waves of people who use their ingenuity to get closer to the rest of the world, before twisting to hold open the ""but theoretically we could have cognitive differences between population groups which correspond to race"". Saini tackles him on how these ideas have been used - given that while "" theoretically"" it is possible, we have no evidence that is actually is - despite many goes at proving so. Reich's insistence that science will proof us against prejudice rings uncomfortably naive against the background of the book. It harkens back to the history of the Max Planck Institute/Kaiser Wilhelm institute, whose scientists mostly acquiesced to the Nazis, producing endless science demonstrating the superiority of blond Germans. The resisters were heroic, but they were also small in number and isolated.This book comes at a crucial time, not only because racism is on the rise, but as our societies seem more than ever riven between those who dismiss scientific experts altogether, and this who regard them as infallible. The book reminds us that scientists are human, part of society, and just as capable of storing their truths to support evil as the rest of us."
16,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144034-steve-bowbrick,5,An utterly gripping book. An essential read for an era in which pernicious racism is finding new support in bogus science.

The impending urge that you as a Democrat need to peacefully fight against racism in anyway you can by supporting democrats is all too strong but deeply misleading.If Donald Trump’s rhetoric abhors you, if his policies he has carried out offends you on the deepest levels and more importantly if you feel you need to go out and put an end to this by supporting the Democratic Party.Listen very closely, the book hits on the various right wing ideologies that tries to use race as a way to denigrate minorities and establish a firm status quo.However, democratic leadership has failed both of us. The fake resistance going on in the senate and in the house is laughable. 100 Democrats just voted against cutting the military budget by 10%. Why this is significant is that 10% is billions of $ that could have gone to public programs. Let me elaborate further, the modern Democratic Party is responsible for the rise of Trump. The democrats and republicans have backed their donors, created vast amount of income inequality that leads to the polarization today. In the midst of a pandemic and a race relations tragedy the Democratic Party refuses to back Medicare for all, will not legalize Marijuana which disproportionately effects people of color. They will not support raising the corporate tax rate or getting money out of politics. These are all issues that have lead to economic despair in regions that voted for Trump. In areas where workers lost their jobs to automation they we were more likely to vote for Trump. There is a litany of economic policies that democrats have signed off on that created the vacuum for Trump to be created. If income inequality is not addressed during the Biden administration if he happens to win, the void of Trump will be taken over by another individual, perhaps a Tucker Carlson type if not himself as rumors have swirled about a possible presidential run in 2024. The democrats have repeatedly made morality claims during Trumps administration, how immoral they’re but also have agreed to give a record amount of money for military expenses, did nothing to withhold funds at the border when kids were being locked up and have continuously provided no policies to address the current economic underpinnings. Biden did present the Buy American act which is a start but democrats have failed of major policy positions while continuing to accept money from the very same entities that crushed working class people. That demographics frustration can be manipulated again by another right wing fake populist such as trump. Democratic voters should demand more from the left, republican and Democratic voters need stimulus checks in monthly installments, they need the loss of healthcare to be addressed now that millions are unemployed. My comments are not on the book per say but on how the book should be interpreted. Both sides are bought and yes democrats are more palatable than republicans but that is a very low bar. We need leaders that represent people and not donors. Sadly we do not have a party that does that and I fear the same 2016 victory trump had will again happen at a later date if Democratic voters do not stop watching main stream media and getting trapped in a culture war instead of unifying with working people and demanding for economic rights to be presented to all."
18,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224976-julie,4,"I won an advance copy of this book through the website Library Thing. The subject matter is so timely, what with the rise of right wing nationalists in both the USA and Europe. When most people think of racists, they think of creepy inbred guys like the one playing banjo in the movie Deliverance. They think of guys wearing white robes, burning crosses on lawns. They think of Nazis wearing SS uniforms. They don't think of scientists and writers and professors.It's these white collar, professional racists that are the most dangerous. Using flawed research and misinterpretations of data, they provide the intellectual ballast for right wing politician's political views. By citing ""science"", the politicians appeal to people's fears while at the same time sounding logical and reasonable. After all, it can't be racist if it's a ""fact"". No matter that these ""facts"" are not true, that they do not hold up to peer review or any sort of scrutiny at all. It's all about the presentation. There are a few journals, funded by right wing patrons, that provide a sort of echo chamber for these people. It's the same few names over & over again, taking turns validating each other. It fools people into thinking, ""Hey this research is being published so it must be correct."" Wrong, anyone with money can start a journal or think tank and then publish anything they want. Science is becomes a tool for the rationalization of political ideas.This book traces the history of race science, that is, the science of ""proving"" how white Europeans are better than everyone else. It started in the 1700's with the Age of Enlightenment. People wanted to study the human race. As Saini puts it - ""The problem was that, because of the narrow parameters they established of what constituted a human being, setting themselves as the benchmark, other cultures were almost guaranteed not to fit. By seeing themselves as the paradigm, they had laid the foundations for dividing it."" It reminded me of a book I read recently about medical research, about how men's bodies are considered the default normal. Disease symptoms, side effects from medicine etc - it's how a man's body reacts that is considered ""normal"". The fact that women's bodies often react differently from mens is seen as the abnormal reaction. It's the same here. Seeing their own culture and situation as ""normal"" and others as ""abnormal"". The initial definitions are wrong and so the science is flawed from the beginning.""When we study human origins, we don't start at the beginning, we start at the end, with our own assumptions as the basis for inquiry."" Data in and of itself doesn't say anything. It's how we interpret the data. Scientists don't live in a vacuum. They are social creatures, who live in a society and their ideas are social constructions. Science is always shaped by the time and the place it is carried out. Saini gives an interesting example using the medical study of hypertension. It used to be seen as a Jewish disease because Jews were an inferior race more prone to health issues. Currently some medical professionals see it as a black disease, that black people are more prone to hypertension because of innate flaws within them. History, culture, environment are dismissed as reasons for differences within groups. The default answer is that it is due to biology.Saini also delves into the definition of race. Who came up with these categories. Why they came up with the categories. What does genetics and archaeology say about these categories. Why people want/need to separate people into groups. There are no good biological classifiers for race. It hinges on external differences like skin pigmentation and hair texture. There are no internal differences between humans. There is no variant of any gene that has been found to exist in everyone of one ""race"" and not in another. There is only one race, the human race. Our made up categories come out of humans need to be different from others.Another great Saini quote - ""The power of nationalism calls to the part of us that doesn't want to be ordinary. People like to believe that they are descended from greatness, that they have been genetically endowed with greatness. It's not enough to be who we are now, to be good human beings in the present."" It reminds me of people who believe in reincarnation. No one ever says in a past life that they were a peasant farmer, a petty bureaucrat, etc. They were always Napoleon or Cleopatra or Genghis Khan. Someone special! Thinking of humans in terms of different races lets people delude themselves with specialness.The idea of race didn't turn people racist, make them think of other groups as subhuman. The mistreatment was already there & already happening. The concept of race gave a rationale for the mistreatment.Race is not a universal construct.Race is not a biological rule.Race is a story we tell ourselves."

21,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11180459-sahar,4,"“Nothing is more seductive that a nice string of data, a single bell curve, or a seemingly peer-reviewed scientific study. After all, it can’t be racist if it is a “fact.”Superior is a critical read in light of the rise of global xenophobia, white supremacy and scientific racism. Eugenic principles have often been exploited to justify mass genocides and barbaric atrocities committed against people all around the world, with the most well-known of these being the Nazi regime. Saini touches upon the historical basis and inception of eugenics and how it shaped the mindset of early European geneticists who were academically able to hide their abhorrent racist beliefs under the guise of “science”. Sadly, I was not surprised by the volume of scientists referenced in this book who wholeheartedly proffered that black and brown people are innately inferior and genetically less intelligent than their white counterparts. It is difficult sometimes to cut through the BS of high scientific jargon and rigorous statistics when one reads a paper advocating a ridiculously racist perspective which attempts to come across as academically sound, objective and based in fact. The research and “facts” of race science truly come across as a grossly desperate and futile attempt to justify the oppression and enslavement of a people - many historic white geneticists argued that black people lacked the intellect on a molecular level (that is, genetically) to resist enslavement and that submission to their superior, the white master, was their prescribed destiny and inherent state. To the lay person, this obviously sounds like utter tripe and poorly-concealed racism, but to those who defend this claim and deem themselves intellectuals in the field, state there is a “nuance” to the theory posed. Methods such as IQ tests and DNA tests in the modern age have radically become a post-traditional eugenics way to once again “prove” that some cultures are simply dim - at no fault of their own, bless them - its just their genes making them a bit thick. Saini debunks all myths pertaining to race science fraudulence in a simplistic, accessible way, shifting towards a writing style that is both enjoyable and understandable. I appreciated the way she not only uncovered the field for the sham it was, but also the way she incorporated the opposing arguments into the narrative before annihilating them one by one. A truly marvellous sight to behold, one that would probably leave those who still hold supremacist and repressive views shaking in their boots. “Enjoy your culture or religion, have pride in where you live or where your ancestors came from if you like, but don’t imagine that these things give you any biological claim. Don’t be sucked into believing that you are so different from others that your rights have more value, that your blood is a different color. There is no authenticity except the authenticity of personal experience.”"
22,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34857506-meredith,4,"Detailed look at the interconnection of science(s) and its social & political aspects. Saini gives a good historical perspective and brings the issues forward to the present day to show how persistent and pernicious the effects of racism are on how we study (or try to study) human variation as well as how we apply the results. I appreciated that she took a global perspective, not just focussing on the United States, but had examples from other countries (Great Britain, India), and not only majority white countries showing how deeply embedded these issues are all over. "
23,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50673646-jos,4,"Easily one of the best books on the sociological aspects of race science and its return. Albeit very few and small scientific inconsistencies, Saini does the extremely difficult job of condensing a very complicated topic into an easily navigable and thought provoking text. The author does a phenomenal investigative and expositive work on a topic that has regained a newfound spotlight in the mainstream media and that deserves to be dispelled for good - race, as a biological concept, has no foundation and was constructed to justify wide ranges of oppression, such as racism, casteism and xenophobia. What Saini shows here is commendable as a whole, but a very valid point which I had not given proper thought is brilliantly made with several examples: well intentioned scientific researchers will often underestimate the negative social impact of the research they are conducting or plan to conduct and one needs to put a lot more thought into how these research proposals are stated and how their results are articulated to the world. Research fields such as ""race science"" (elevating this to a proper research field is only done for the sake of this sentence), genetics and population genetics have been distorted to justify the divine right of questionably defined groups such as the ""European people"" or ""white America"". Angela Saini's book is thought-provoking and should be a crucial part of any academic programme. In a time when truth is a matter of perspective (I believe the buzzword for this would be the ""post-truth era""), it becomes radically important to teach anyone responsible for researching it that solid conclusions can be made liquid by sloppy and purposeful or carelessly poor interpretations - academic research does not exist without society and society has to be contemplated when conducting academic research."

25,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15980449-aija,5,"Angela Saini’s Superior is a well-written and well-constructed book about race in science. Starting from the history, Saini brings it to the present day. She gives plenty of examples of how race has an influence on so many things. How it has been the force behind colonialism and white supremacy. How our need of belonging has made us think we’re somehow better than the others. Unfortunately, racism is dead. And there’s still so much to do. "
26,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher,3,"Angela Saini's striking dedication in Superior: The Return of Race Science reads ""For my parents, the only ancestors I need to know,"" which immediately sets the tone for what is to follow.The book an effective expose, and sometimes a demolition, of the shadier elements of race science, both historic and recent, but also one that argues convincingly that such science can never be fully objective, since much of it relies attempting to prove a prior hypothesis, or telling a story: The answer is simple: science is always shaped by the time and the place in which it is carried out. It ultimately sits at the mercy of the personal political beliefs of those carrying it out.The point is made multiple times, and one of the interviews in the book perhaps expresses it best:‘Underlying assumptions and ideas definitely get embedded in ways that we don’t even think about consciously, which can play out in the science,’ Bolnick adds. ‘We interpret data. We bring our perspectives, our framings to the data. You can use the same data to say many different things. I think modern genomic data provides the perfect example of that, because you can have different people who are all very smart and understand the data, who look at the same datasets and describe them in polar opposite directions.’ It’s impossible to escape our beliefs, our upbringing, our environment, even the pressure of wanting to be correct, when it comes to interpreting the facts. Our stories get in the way.Saini also argues that race science largely stems from the cultural context in which genetics and evolutionary theories developed, namely colonialism:The key to understanding the meaning of race is understanding power. When you see how power has shaped the idea of race and continues to shape it, how it affects even the scientific facts, everything finally begins to make sense.Although another theme is how issues often result from naivety of scientists or even good intentions, e.g. right back to the Enlightenment:In universalising humanity, Enlightenment thinkers had inadvertently laid the foundations for dividing it. And here lay the fatal error at the birth of modern science, one that would persist for centuries, and arguably persists to this day. It is a science of human origins, as British anthropologist Tim Ingold observes, that ‘has written the essence of humanity in its own image, and that measures other people by how far they have come in living up to it’.This is a timely book, and Saini should also be credited for making her own perspective, the story she wants to tell, very clear, and also for allowing those on the other side of the argument, particularly those who believe in racial differences, to present their side and in their own words.The book itself is a good read generally, although a little repetitive. At times it also was a little too Sunday Magazine supplement for my taste (‘... I’m told by Mark Thomas, professor of evolutionary genetics at University College London, who worked on the finding. Leaning back in his chair, wearing stonewashed jeans and a grandad-collar shirt, Thomas is about as relatable as a professor comes.) albeit perhaps that comes with the genre. More specifically here though, the book also got a little bogged-down for me at times in another form of journalism, investigative journalism (following the money behind the journal Mankind Quarterly) which didn't feel so suited to the form.4.5 stars for the importance of the messages although 3 for the reading experience - and thanks to the author/publisher for making the book free to Kindle readers for a period."
27,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian,5,"I wasn't much a fan of Saini's previous book on gender Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong—and the New Research That's Rewriting the Story, but in this follow-up on race, Saini does wonderfully.Saini's central argument is that the politics of race science makes the neutral treatment of race impossible. The history of the holocaust and the presence of white nationalists eager to seize anything they can use should make everyone very nervous about treading in these parts. That there is a resurgence among scientists (who self-identify as liberal and denounce racism) of race science is then best understood as ""well-intentioned people have reintroduced race to medical science without fully understanding either their reasons or the consequences."" She shows this devastatingly well by interviewing scientists and revealing their naiveté — from those associated with the failed Human Genome Diversity Project to geneticist David Reich trying to explain James Watson's racism. Through numerous historic examples and paralells, she forcefully makes a case that ""the idea of race is not harmless. It brings with it centuries of political baggage, the blood of millions. And it has never been a neutral variable.""This gets at what makes this book so much better than her previous: by discarding the veneer of objectivity and deciding to overtly be a reporter, Saini produces the kind of work only reporters can. Building off earlier work she talks about the influence of the dark networks of money promoting race science, at the heart of which is the Pioneer Institute and the dodgy journal Mankind Quarterly. She contacts reputable journals like Intelligence where contributors to Mankind Quarterly work, revealing a lack of resistance, even complicity.Stylistically, instead of positioning herself as a neutral observer, prompted by the growth of racism internationally, Saini is open about herself as a player in the story. She talks about her own experience growing up Indian in London, living in one of the few bouroughs that voted to leave the EU in part out of fear of people who look like her. When talking about the human zoo she was visiting, she notes powerfully that ""I more likely would have been inside a cage than outside it."" She talks of crying for Gail Beck, an Australian Aboriginal woman whose family had for generations been part of the ""stolen generations"", where they were stolen from their families by the State in a naked attempt to destory indigenous ways of life:I don’t cry easily. But in the car afterwards, I cry for Gail Beck. There is no scale of justice large enough to account for what happened. Not just for the abuse and the trauma, the children torn from their parents, the killings, but also for the lives that women and men like her didn’t have the chance to live.Curiously, Saini's willingness to do away with the ""objective"" writing style makes her seem more credible.Related but perhaps less important, her writing style seems to have gotten much better. There are now bits like these:We are forever chasing our origins. When we can’t find what we want in the present, we go back, and back further still, until there, at the dawn of time, we imagine we’ve found it. In the gloomy mists of the past, having squeezed ourselves back into the womb of humanity, we take a good look. Here it is, we say with satisfaction. Here is the root of our difference....those committed to the biological reality of race won’t back down if the data prove them wrong. There’s no incentive for them to admit intellectual defeat. They will just keep reaching for fresher, more elaborate theories when the old ones fail. If skin color doesn’t explain racial inequality, then maybe the structure of our brains and bodies will. If not anatomy, then maybe our genes. When then this, too, produces nothing of value, they will reach for the next thing. All this intellectual jumping through hoops to maintain the status quo. All this to prove what they have always really wanted to know: that they are superior. Well, keep reaching, keep reaching. One day there will be nothing left to reach for.On the question of the science, the book is a little weaker. Although there are enough examples of badly done science to serve as a warning and as illustration of the range of ways science can overreach, it's not entirely clear what Saini thinks we should believe. She points out that the role of racism is often not taken into account, and that genetic explanations are reached for too quickly. But is there good race science that's possible? She quotes without criticism geneticist Mark Jobling:If everyone in the world had their genomes sequenced, says Jobling, you wouldn’t find hard borders between them, but gradients, with each small community blending into the next, the way hills blend into valleys....It would have been perfectly possible to study human variation without grouping people. As Jobling explains, the divisions between us are so blurry that humans can theoretically be grouped any way you like. “You could do a thought experiment where you just said we will take Kenyans, Swedes, and Japanese, and will just proportion everybody into those three things.” If this were done, because we are all genetically connected to the average Kenyan, Swede, or Japanese person, either directly or by historic migration, then everyone on earth could theoretically be fully assigned to a group based on just these three nationalities. You could say that you were so many percent Kenyan, so many percent Swedish, and so many percent Japanese.” This may seem meaningless, but actually it is no more meaningless than dividing the world into black, brown, yellow, red, and white. “The definitions of those populations are cultural, and the choice of population is driven by expediency.”Still, in other places, Saini compares ""closeness"" of genetic make-up, possibly indicating the presence of something like a single scale along which differences can be placed. I'm unclear whether she's claiming simply that genetically-salient populations won't map onto modern political borders (given historical contingency and how migration happened over and over again, both forwards and backwards), or whether thinking about objective populations themselves is dubious, given the actual results of modern science (since the effects of structural racism can't be eliminated and since scientists have failed to actually identify enough individual genes to account for supposed genetic differences, although they keep estimating this will happen very soon).I don't have the expertise to adjudicate scientific claims here, but I still think she makes a powerful case that scientists have and continue to refuse to see the obvious truth that race science is laden with political meanings, and so the approach has to be cautious at best:Yet we keep looking back to race because of its familiarity. We can’t help it. For so long, it has been the backdrop to our lives, the running narrative. We automatically translate the information our eyes and ears receive into the language of race, forgetting where this language came from. “I think that scientists, they are trapped by the categories they use. They will either have to jettison it or find different ways of talking about this,” says Hammonds. “They’ll have to come to terms with that it has a social meaning.” This doesn’t mean that racial categories shouldn’t be used in medicine or in science more generally. But it does mean that those who use them should fully understand what they mean, be able to define them, and to know their history. They should at least know what race is."
28,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10339336-ethan,4,"A very compelling, thorough investigation into the intersection of modern science and race theory.The book is so titled (and especially subtitled) so as to suggest that the reader is into a major exploration of a resurgence of race science, and indeed, the work begins with a discussion of race science...only for the reader to learn how it never really went away. Ever since the end of the first half of the twentieth century there has remained a small minority of researchers and investigators attempting to justify old racial theories using new science. The author does well at exposing how they work, how flawed their works are, and yet their ability to pop up at any time, whenever the cultural tide is correct. But then the author also looks at the work of some very prominent anti-racist scientists as part of genome projects that look for differences among human populations in a way that, whereas not aligning with older categories, still attempts to categorize people into subpopulations. She questions the whole impulse to thus categorize and seek out such distinctions; she had already cast some aspersions on the whole basis of the Enlightenment project as *the* way forward for the investigation of reality. Toward the end of the work the author ends up demonstrating well how a good number of scientists, even those who have no ostensible racist intentions, end up maintaining racist categories in their heads, and, however unconsciously, continue to use them and thus find reasons to corroborate their presuppositions. In the end, the work just exposes how much of science is based on the presuppositions of scientists, and that as long as race is a major social category, science is going to keep attempting to find ways to characterize those who have as superior and those who don't as inferior. Biological bases will be sought for questions that are really answered sociologically: certain groups may be disadvantaged, but it's not based on biological difference (which, no matter how much it is sought, still does not exist), but based on sociological differences. But then, of course, those who have would again be forced to grapple with how they system they've built caused these other groups disadvantage, and would have to see how those disadvantages show up in the charts. To believe it's all based on genes, or some other factor, tranquilizes from these concerns.To this end this is a very powerful and excellent book and worthy of consideration: why do we even categorize on the basis of race? Why keep those boxes in our heads? Such boxes cause confusion and lead down inaccurate roads far more often than saying anything of value. We do better to see race categories as just the most recent form of justification of a form of supremacy, and deny its power outright. The author did well to point out how it was not that long ago that southern Europeans were believed to be inferior in intellect and biological stature; now they've been subsumed into the ""white"" population, and the same assumptions are now made about the ""new"" inferior groups, and it will probably change again. Likewise, it is hard to think of a racial basis for much of anything in Western culture when there are so many who seem to be of one race but are in fact an amalgamation of people from different parts of the world. The book also does well at showing the cost of implicit bias: the author spoke of a person she knew who went without the proper diagnosis for 8 years until a radiologist saw an x-ray without knowing who she was and could tell it was cystic fibrosis. At the time, cystic fibrosis was believed to be a ""white disease,"" and the girl was black. We can assume no ill will on the part of the physicians; these false categories just meant there was a failure of imagination that could have ended very tragically. And yet...the author has her own set of biases. She is acutely aware of the dangers and difficulties of racism and tribalism, being of middle class England but of Indian descent. Her acknowledgement to her son expresses the excess: what makes us is our personal experiences and individual actions, with culture and family and other things that might shape a person given a brusque and glib passing comment. It's a bit ironic, but sadly unsurprising: the author has attempted to show how all of these scientists are blinded by their presuppositions and cannot see them for what they are, and thus do not see the disconnect between the science they think they're doing and the systemic racism they end up perpetuating, and yet she herself does not seem to see how she is atomizing everyone, as if one's reality is formed by one's experience and one's own actions. The chapter before she had described how Mendel's ideas about genetics were most likely flawed because interaction with other factors at play were not in view; and so it is with her own views on these subjects. Family, culture, etc. does, and should, wield a lot of influence on a person. Yes, there is no biological basis to race; yes, race science is all an attempt to demonstrate a supremacy that is biologically invalid and sociologically bankrupt. But that doesn't mean we throw all of culture and ethnicity into the dustbin of history. The problem is not differences among populations: the problem is looking at ""the other"" as less than on account of differences. Whatever solutions exist to the scourge of racism must still find a way to honor and value ethnic and national differences, even though they are based in sociology, not biology. Nevertheless, a book worthy of consideration.**--review copy received as part of early review program"
29,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12643651-safiya,5,"This book really blew me away and it has irreversibly expanded the way I view and think about not only race but also origins and culture as well. Race is a concept so deeply embedded into our way of thinking and is used visibly (unless you’re one of those colourblind folks) in cultures and societies across the world.Saini examines the origins and construction of race and how colonialism and slavery framed and motivated it’s conception. The implications of this beginning are long lasting and race is still seen through the lens of colonialism and slavery, whether we are aware of it or not. The history and the present are inseparable.Many different specialist areas were delved into in this book including archeology, eugenics, genomics and medical disparities. Saini did a brilliant job of finding the balance of making the content accessible for laypeople without oversimplifying it. She regularly quoted relevant people she had interviewed in her research but managed to weave these into the writing and maintain the flow. It was often necessary to have extensive direct quotes especially regarding specialist areas and Saini would break them down with her commentary on the significance and it’s relevance.Her analysis of the deep history of humans and the constant migration and change in communities really struck me. When we talk of origins where is the starting point and where is the cut off point?Another aspect that she uncovered which I can’t stop thinking about was that there are elements of culture that have been woven into ideas of race. When we say something is in the blood, or certain ‘races’ are more skilled in certain areas because that’s in the genetics of that race, these can in fact be easily explained by culture. Skills that are valued by a culture will certainly be encouraged from a young age and instilled in that community. There’s so much more I could say but I’ll leave it there. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone. "

33,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26706153-j-earl,5,"Superior: The Return of Race Science by Angela Saini is an example of what science writing and journalism should be. She presents her position so there can't be any legitimate complaints about a hidden agenda, yet she presents the views of those abusing science to serve their views on race with more balance than most writers would be able to.This is not, nor does it claim to be, a scientific treatise. In much the same way that research surveys/overviews do, and these are regularly published in peer reviewed journals so this isn't anything that should be so startling to these people who act like this is so ""unscientific,"" Saini surveys the research and presents the consensus as well as the outlier views. Especially those outlier positions that have been appropriated by the alt-right (read racist, white supremacist extreme) to support their false sense of superiority. Perhaps what most bothers these ""reviewers"" who then spew pseudo-scientific manure in response is that after presenting some of these views, whether historical or relatively current, Saini uses the words of other researchers and scientists to refute those views, or at least to show how the chance of those views ever finding solid evidence is slim to none. Then, when she restates what these scientists say, those are the quotes these ""reviewers"" use to make it sound like she is just giving her own opinion. Don't let these people fool you, whether you agree with Saini and the majority of researchers in the field or not, this isn't just someone giving their opinions as argument against racist science. I started reading one or two reviews out loud to a researcher I know and had to stop, just reading it aloud caused all the dogs in the neighborhood to start barking. I guess there were a bunch of things in those reviews that do that. Particularly on e review that misused a research article in hopes no one would actually go read it and realize the guy lacks any science credibility whatsoever.Even for someone who understands that race is a social construct and thus finds the vast body of supporting research useful will have a couple areas that will likely not sit well. There is a difference between ignoring bad research and trying to stop research from being done. I never got the impression Saini was advocating for shutting down such research but a few of the researchers seemed like they would have been behind such an idea. The problem isn't so much that these researchers doing racist research are doing it but that there are now a lot of outlets that let these things see the light of day even though the vast majority of peer reviewed journals reject them. Prior to social media and the proliferation of information bubbles such research would have remained on the fringe and passed around or published through a few agenda-based publications.The book includes citations to research and articles mentioned if you want to make sure she isn't misstating what is being done, there is no hidden agenda here, at least not on her part. Those supporting and spreading the questionable science, well, their agenda is partially hidden behind false claims of being opposed to ""identity politics"" or pretending that the difference between any measurable characteristic of a population must be biological, since they pretend that there haven't been social, legal, and political factors. These pseudoscience advocates ignore, or likely don't understand, the extent to which environmental factors do indeed figure into genetics, primarily through epigenetics. But nuance isn't their thing, bluster and misdirection are their tools, and boy are they tools. I would recommend this to everybody. If you believe the vast body of evidence (as well as history) that race is socially constructed this offers some insight into how science is being misappropriated again. If you aren't sure exactly what might be different between populations and how those things might be framed, this will offer some insight into what the science can and cannot answer and will also show that many researchers doing this research aren't necessarily racist, they have a view of science that is still, unconsciously, affected by the society in which they live. If you believe that the vast majority of researchers are part of a long and large conspiracy to deny you your superiority, well, read it anyway, maybe some sense will seep in. But I know this last group won't read to learn anything or to assess information but strictly to find ways to attack it. They don't realize, or maybe they do but I'd rather not think they could be quite so low, that before one can argue against something one must have an understanding of that position. Otherwise, it just becomes trying to out yell the other side.Reviewed from a copy made available by the publisher via LibraryThing Early Reviewers."

36,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58494981-julia,5,"""People are assholes"" is basically the conclusion I take from every Angela Saini book. Loved this, but it scared me."
37,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,4,"Philosophers have written about ""humanity"" in its all encompassing meaning, they have written about virtue and morals and temperance but its unfortunate how all these are narrowly defined and limited to certain geographies and in turn, race. We are all well aware how the fundamental definitions of morality and virtue has a cultural lilt and somehow these philosophies tend to ignore what isn't in their vicinity. Be it Hume or Kant, they lacked the insight to see beyond the boundaries of their definition of humanity and still ended up defining it. It is up to us, in future, to question and debate these philosophies. But in current context, these philosophies have permeated to ethics, politics and its influence in everyday decision making. Saini argues this in initial chapters with selected examples including Max Plank science society that conducted experimentation during holocaust. Permeation of race superiority has taken place for several centuries finding its origins in colonialism. With Britain trying to be next big thing in civilizations, colonists pursued this ideology to heart and with ""victories"" came studies with which further progressed the racial divide. It takes a lot of years to undo thought processes and culturally induced racial proclivity. While most times its unintended, the times when it is, the consequences are devastating. "

This book kept me interested throughout and would be one of my reading recommendations."
39,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5852496-zara-rahman,5,"I’m such a fan of this book! It feels so timely and important, and covers such a wide range of research and topics. I’m so glad it exists, and have already recommended it a lot (and am beginning to reference it in my own work too, as i feel like a lot of the conclusions about race science are also just as valid for technology that touches on race/ethnicity.) hugely recommended! "

43,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73155440-alexandros-potapidis,4,"Writing about race is a precarious and sensitive venture, especially in today's partisan and nationalistic climate that dominates the social discurse. Angela Saini bravely explores the issue matter in a way that casts light in our day to day understanding of what racism is and how to think about it. She focuses on how race became so prominent in the scientific community, whether intentionally or unintentionally. This semi-established domain was, and still is, a part and parcel of society's understanding of racial categories. In this respect the book prompts the reader to re-examine her understanding of how to think about racism and where to find traces of stereotypes that belong to racial categories.Saini's definition of a racist is someone who ""asserts difference for political gain"" p. 290. At a first glance this is a very wide definition that could include anything, because ideological claims can be seen as political and vice versa. However, the author's focus in understanding race is making sense of power. In a nutshell, differences between populations are not biological or genetic. Scientists can not yet prove that there are genes that make a group of people, for example, more or less intelligent. The differences are social, they are cultural, historical, and environmental. But becoming more powerful we frame our power not only in cultural, but also in  natural terms. We portray the ""other"" as inferior because by inventing hierarchies we give meaning to our own categories p. 6-7. After all, racism was invented because of the need from people in power to hold on to that power by separating others and treat people as different, p. 156. And science in particular is a very political venture and discourse, it has normative values and it is dependent on the scientist's view of the world. If she sees divisions, she will assert divisions in her work. Those on the political spectrum of society were looking to science as ""a rationalisation of political ideas"", even though race science was born in colonial ideologies of oppression and exploitation, p. 50.In this respect race science is embedded in its time and the politics of its time, it was and can be used as an excuse and justification of treating people differently. The real reason behind the pursuit of the scientific idea of race was ""not so much to understand the differences in our bodies, but to try to justify why we lead such different lives"", p. 60-61. Race became a ""tool of measuring human progress, of placing judgement on the capacities and rights of others"", p. 61. The cases of slavery and colonisation reveal how the domination of certain people had political and economic roots but was presented in terms of difference and inferior race.To summarise, race is a social construction, a justification of the pain people inflict upon each other for political and economic reasons. And until scientists find that magic gene that makes some people superior and some inferior, we should treat each other with humanity. This is because we are all human beings and the differences we have are cultural, what unites us is much more of what separates us."
44,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6699202-christopher,4,"At the turn of the 20th century, eugenics was broadly popular in America and Europe. However, with the Nazi regime's use of eugenics and racial theories prevalent at the time led to the intellectual justifications for the Holocaust. Many thought that race science died out at the end of World War II, but as Ms. Saini shows in this incredibly necessary book, race science has not totally gone away. Instead, it has evolved and can now be heard on the lips of both academics and alt-right figures alike.Starting with a brief history of race science in the 19th and 20th century, Ms. Saini traces its evolution from then to the present day. What was fascinating to read about this is how the return of race science to mainstream consciousness very much parallels the rise far right intellectualism as described in another wonderful book, Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America by Nancy MacLean, where an opaque group of outside donors funds new forms of race science that typical keeps the same intellectual underpinnings, but substitutes words like ""race"" with ""population groups"" or ""racial differences"" with ""human biodiversity. But what was most shocking was the chapter where even left-wing scientists who are adamantly antiracist can fall into the trap of promoting modern race science endeavors, like the Human Genome Diversity Project. So, while far right ideologues, intellectuals, and conservatives are mostly to blame for race sciences continued presence in academia and the world, their opponents sometimes fall for it too. What was also interesting was how Ms. Saini tracked the appeal of race science not just in the United States and Europe, but in other places in the world. Ms. Saini's tracking of the rise of Hindu nationalism in India and its current attempts to justify their ideology through race science is fascinating and troubling news for the world's largest democracy. While I greatly enjoyed this book, I will say that I was a little confused by the first chapter or two. I didn't feel that Ms. Saini did a good job of explaining the layout for her book at the beginning, so I found myself a little confused by the first chapter or two, making me wonder where she was going with things. However, by the third chapter at least things finally started to click.As far-right, alt-right, and white supremacy advocates continue to have a moment in our continued politics, books like this are incredibly important for understanding and identifying the flawed and dangerous intellectual and ""scientific"" underpinnings of modern racists today. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested learning more about how racism and racial categories continue to plague us today in scientific circles in particular, but in the world as a whole."

Science - or the lack of it - in the end legitimized racism, rather than quashing it. Whatever real and worthwhile questions might have been asked about human difference were unavoidably tainted by politics and economics.
Over the last couple months, I got a front-seat viewing of the prejudiced aspects of science. I’d always thought that science predominantly is about discoveries rooted in the data and clear results. HA. Nope. Intellectual racism has always existed, and Angela Saini discusses all aspects of scientific racism in Superior: The Return of Race Science. And although scientists, such as myself, want to believe that research and discovery transcends politics, I've been proven sorely wrong. Throughout history, and even in today's day and age, science has been used to back incorrect but strong political and personal beliefs. In the best cases, these beliefs are discouraged, ignored and fade away; in the worst cases, these beliefs spread and cause harm.
Our stories get in the way of science. The past is always at the mercy of the present.
This idea that race is inherently biological has been abused, overshadowing good genetic and evolutionary science research. And it's not just old-school, unfunded, irrelevant scientists who are propagating it. These are scientists who are funded millions annually, and whose journal articles are being spread far and wide to endorse racism. Racist science continues to affect everything from medicine to education.There are differences between humans, just like there are differences between individuals of other species. No two birds look the same. But this variation does not exist on the ""race"" level, nor can race even be a biological metric; race is a social construct that is not generated by your DNA. And, being a scientist, I'll be spreading this fact until our species gets it.Oh, another thing. Angela Saini really made clear the importance of language. I'm in the business of collecting data, sure, but the words I use, and the words that scientists use, can influence social frameworks. That's how racist scientists have been articulating their work for centuries: using words like ""racially pure"" and ""hybrids"" to group people into racial categories.
The data, the theories, the facts themselves, are rotated and warped until they fit into a racial framework we can relate to. This is the power of race. It is the power to twist science to its own ends.
Science is political. It’s imbued with social tension. If there's anything I'll remember from academia, it's to question everything."
46,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,4,"First, I put this book under ""politics-public policy"" as well as ""science"" on my shelves because race science, as Saini makes clear, continues to ooze into both politics and public policy based on it.There's not really anything earthshaking here, at least not in race science, narrowly. Most of the major names in the race science biz she lists are pretty well known to me. Missing? Frank Miele and Vince Sarich. Maybe they've not gotten much of a reputation on the British side of the pond. Reginald Ruggles Gates is the biggest name that I didn't know about before.That said, this is more than a ""middling"" book. Saini goes beyond Miele, Sarich, Rushton, the Pioneer Fund, Meisenberg, Lynn, et al, to note other problems.One is the likes of Luigi Cavalli-Sforza not recognizing they were still playing by a race-based agenda with some of their relatively recent population genetics studies. The other is modern race-based medicine. She cites a combo of two blood pressure medicines not approved for the general public by the FDA, but then, when the Big Pharma company did a SMALL (too small to be statistically significant) study on African-Americans only, the FDA gave approval to the combo as a ""black high pressure drug."" That's despite, globally, people like Finns and Russians abounding in high blood pressure.Malaria and sickle cell is another issue. Not all sub-Saharan Africa has malaria, and the sickle-cell trait and similar aren't limited to sub-Saharan Africans."
47,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861104-sonny-peart,5,"'Superior' picks apart the claims of race science, from its development during the days of European colonialism, through its open celebration in the middle of the 20th Century, to it’s worrying resurgence in the 21st Century. Whether it has been to justify the subjugation of conquered nations, to provide a scientific rationale for genocide, or to underpin discriminatory policies and violent nationalism, race science has always worked in tandem with politics and the moral requirements of wider society. Saini explains how early racial classifications were scientifically arbitrary, and how biologists and then geneticists have found no meaningful way to define races. Race is a social and political construct, rooted in power hierarchies entrenched centuries ago and still persisting to a remarkable degree, so that even well-meaning scientists struggle to escape its assumptions. The persistence of the belief in a biological basis for race is amply illustrated by the online attacks on Saini’s work and, more worryingly, by the presence on the faculties of many leading universities, including my own, of researchers continuing to search for genetic distinctions that map onto racial categories. A book that adds to the armoury of anti-racists, and which racists and their apologists and facilitators will dismiss, without evidence, as a woke, left-wing polemic. And of course, it is an attack; it’s an attack on racism."
48,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91146394-jadey-the-bookish,4,"Every person should read this, especially anyone studying science. I'm at the end of my own Masters of Science and it has never ever came up in any of my studying that modern science is built upon white supremacy, that it still affects scientific research today. I have never learnt, in every time Mendel (the pea hybrid guy) has came up in lectures, that he was the father of eugenics. The same with Karl Pearson who has came up in the subject of statistics. It alarms me how many people studying scientific subjects are not aware of the history of science, and how many think they're above ethics. And how many scientists think that what they do is not political. If we do not learn from the past, we are doomed to repeat it.The reason I've given this 4 stars and not 5 is the massive section that talks about IQ but barely nothing is said about how flawed this way to measure intelligence is.Also P.S, don't listen to the 1 star review on the front page of this that literally says Hitler wasn't a racist. It's a load of crap and they're exactly the kind of person who this book describes as a 'pseudo-intellectual' who will bend the science in any way they want to make the claim that race isn't a social construct."
49,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111005218-steven-thomas,3,"I'm not sure why, but when I think of science or scientists, i never think ""racists"", I guess I always thought of science as strictly factual .. however this book does a great job in diving into what race science exactly is, or was.. Saini goes into depth on eugenics and the ideology of racism in science back then as well as today, everywhere from slavery, to the nazi regime, sickle cell, ""black pills"", neanderthal history, and how it changed once they found their DNA was tied into Europeans, all the way up to modern day Trump, and how ""Race Science"" played it's part in brainwashing society into thinking whites are superior to everyone else. What I got from this book was mainly that race isn't biologically a ""thing"", that it's more of a social / cultural grouping and that it shouldn't be used to determine who's better then who in anyway, but there is always people who dare to differ and will go above and beyond to try and prove whites are at the top of the human hierarchy. Even if it means manipulating scientific data or tests to do so. There were a couple fun stories in this book but overall wasnt the most entertaining, almost a text book like read, but very informational and enlightening 👌🏽"
50,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114597298-jess,3,"Ah, I was looking forward to this so much! Unfortunately, the potential for this book is largely tanked by the fact that Angela Saini is a liberal. So many things I loved and found genuinely enlightening - the outstanding (but too short!) chapter on race and health, the lies behind the dream of biological race, the links between genetics, archeology and nationalism around the world - but there were some really curious ideas of 'good' and 'bad' scientists,, with far too much emphasis placed on the intention of the study or the individual rather than the outcomes. Following Saini's own evidence, the return of race science is a misleading subtitle as race science never left. I would have really liked to see more about how colonialism and racism formed modern science as we know it on every level, through every discipline. Still, I would recommend this to geneticists (who are a weird bunch and need to be reminded that genes are not destiny and we know far less than we think) as well as anyone who is interested in race and science, if only to have a discussion around the many interesting points she brings up!"
51,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57356652-arrianne,4,"An excellent run through the literature around race — does it even exist as anything more than a social construct? Has anything changed in science since we tried to categorise people for eugenics purposes? How have we ended up where we are with right wing governments and people saying openly racist things?The chapter “Black Pills” should be read by everyone working in healthcare. It essentially shows (as I learned recently) that the basis of UK guidance on hypertension and what drugs we give to whom is nonsense and we just give Black people different drugs based on flawed, racist research.One point deducted for being a little superficial at times — just getting into the topic and then switching."
52,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105431508-poppy-jayne-morgan,4,"My favourite chapter was ""Black pills"" about how incorrect/meaningless racial categories have influenced medical diagnoses and treatment, and highlighted the historical racism of medicine. This book also provides really clear explanations of how genetic markers for race are problematic, misleading, and non-existent. Basically, race is a cultural category based on visual characteristics, and any differences seen are due to cultural inequalities - by attempting to define any differences as having a biological basis, we are implying there is an innate disparity, allowing us to shirk social responsibilities, instead of implementing change. "
53,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31241543-emma-louise-gale,2,"This book was a bit underwhelming to say the least. I expected something a little stronger from Saini. First off I thought I'd mention, I don't hate this book, in fact I thought some points were extremely well thought out and made sense for all. However, I'd like to think, not one person believes that scientists are immune to racism and nationalism (whether that be receiving or implementing) in the past. Scientific racism was definitely happening, as was general racism. I personally do not see a need to categorise them differently. It is racism and it is wrong.As a scientist, the only way to combat hard biological science is with hard biological science, not the less factual sociology and psychology. I understand where most her points stem from and I am ashamed of the history of Europeans (particularly the Brits and Germans) and the scientific community for being a part of it. But I found this should have been a factual history lesson and not an opinionated (one sided throughout) theory. It was very repetitive and did not need to be the length it was. I'm a little saddened by this. I had high expectations after seeing it on Nature's Top 10 of 2019. I will continue to educate myself on this topic but from a historical standpoint as that beat suits what I am looking for."

Can science be racist if the people doing it are antiracists?” This was very well written, interesting, and thought provoking. I am some issues with parts of it, and the under representation of Black or African voices, when they are so often the subject of discussion. Overall, I think this is a good investigative look at the current state of race science. "

I have never read something before that so thoroughly debunks racist bullshit like this book does.

56,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113487-angelique,5,"Brilliant. She is such an incredible author, so easy to read and so clear and passionate and paints such an incredible picture. In short, scientists keep trying to pin science to society and it fails. Just as between ‘male’ and ‘female’, we have more in common than not.

57,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71625164-trevor-smith,5,"A very important book, especially in times like this. She points out that the differences in people, the successes, the failures, aren’t down to a gene or some inherent biological factor but the society they’ve been raised in. The opportunity’s they have or haven’t, the factors, racism, poverty etc they have or haven’t had to overcome. The culture they’ve been raised in. Highly recommended. "
58,0807076910,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91353060-kirsty-clarke,5,"An incredible book, truely one which I will be thinking about for a long time. Saini explores long standing scientific myths and how they are married to societal opinion and the consequences in which they give rise to. I have never read a book like this, it offered such an insightful perspective on race as a catagorical concept, it can be content heavy at times but never too the point where I think there is unnecessary information. Bloody good read"
