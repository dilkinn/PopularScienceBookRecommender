0,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,3,"Between this book and Packing for Mars I know way more about pooping in space than I ever wanted to…..Mike Mullane’s childhood fascination with space travel gave him the determination to become one of the first groups of astronauts chosen for the space shuttle program, and eventually he made three trips into orbit. Despite eyesight bad enough to prevent him from being a pilot, he was also an Air Force officer who flew combat missions in Vietnam as the weapons system operator. (Like Goose in Top Gun.) He’s traveled the world and has a lot of funny stories about meeting famous people like hobnobbing with Christie Brinkley at a Super Bowl and getting a tour of the White House while cracking jokes with Barbara Bush. While he’s justifiably proud of his achievements, he’s also got a self-deprecating sense of humor that shows he doesn’t take himself too seriously.All in all, Mullane has lived a life that’s going to make most of us seem about as interesting as a bowl of cottage cheese by comparison, and he’d probably be entertaining as hell if you had a couple of beers with him. He’s amusing at providing the details about what it’s like to be in space including oversharing a bit on the Viagra effect of zero-G as well as a step-by-step explanation of using the toilet. However, despite having the subtitle of “The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut”, I didn’t find any of the tales that outrageous or different from other books I’ve read from people involved in the space program. Since the shuttle missions were mainly about delivering freight to space, they just aren’t that exciting unless something went horribly wrong. It doesn’t help that two of Mullane’s three missions involved putting top secret military hardware into orbit so he can’t even talk about the details of those because they're classified. I feel silly saying that a guy writing about riding a giant tank of burning rocket fuel into space seems kind of routine, but when I contrast this with something like Jim Lovell’s Lost Moon, in which Lovell recounts not only his life story but the life-threatening Apollo 13 mission, then this seems kind of tame by comparison despite Mullane’s efforts to convey the wonderous nature of viewing the Earth from orbit. (In fairness, part of the reason I checked this out was because Andy Weir’s The Martian gave me a tremendous hankering to read something from a smart-ass astronaut’s point of view, but it’s really not fair to compare the fictional Mark Watney to the real life of Mullane.)What I did find intriguing was Mullane’s frankness when discussing the shuttle program, NASA management and his own obsession with getting into space. He doesn’t hedge when saying that after NASA completed the greatest engineering project in history by getting to the moon that it was turned into a freight hauling service with demands to become cost effective by politicians and bureaucrats who treated the shuttle like a commercial jetliner instead of the high risk experimental aircraft it was. He’s highly critical of the NASA management that let a secretive process to select flight crews turn the astronaut’s office into a seething stew of paranoia, fear and frustration. Mullane plainly lays the blame for the Challenger and Columbia disasters on the culture that resulted from these factors. He also confesses that like most of the other astronauts he was so desperate to get into space that he ignored safety concerns, and that he often put his own family second to his career.Mullane is also brutally honest when recounting the casual sexism that he and the other astronauts engaged in when they were training with America’s first female astronauts. As someone who had gone to the all-male West Point as well as being a military officer, Mullane’s background had been almost exclusively male, and he admits to behaving like a jerk at times. However, he would grow to respect most of the female astronauts and would develop a strong friendship with Judith Resnik who would later be killed on-board Challenger. He was far less friendly with Sally Ride, and one gets the impression that the two of them probably didn’t exchange Christmas cards.While I enjoyed his story as well as his frankness, in the end I wish that NASA had come up with a grander mission for a guy like Mike Mullane rather than risking his life to put satellites into orbit."

Her words of advice ran something along the lines of if you read just one astronaut autobiography, make it this one.Mike Mullane was one of a group of pilots, military and civilian specialists, the TFNGs or Thirty-Five New Guys, chosen in the late seventies for the brand-spanking new space shuttle program. Mullane uses a very joking, conversational tone that is a real pleasure to read. He admits that he and many of his colleagues were little more than sexist pigs when they started the program which included six women. To be fair, coming from military and aviation backgrounds, most of them had never had a female coworker. Their behavior was less than admirable. Though Sally Ride bristled at some of their antics, Judy Resnik became ""one of the guys"" and developed a great rapport with Mullane.With Mullane as your guide, you will take a step-by-step ride through the intensive training process, from a ride on the Vomit Comet to a trip to the toilet trainer. (I won't go into any details here, but Mullane certainly does not hold back.)Learn about the interminable wait for a flight assignment and then, sit in nervous anticipation through infuriating and nerve-wracking launch scrubs. (It's as great as being there, only you don't have to put on a diaper...unless you want to.)Mullane finally made it into orbit on the 12th shuttle flight, the first mission for Discovery.Bottom row: Mullane, Steve Hawley, Mike Coats, Hank Hartsfield / Back row: Charlie Walker, Judy ResnikThis was a wonderful, exhilarating trip from beginning to end, though it's not all fun and games. Mullane candidly discusses both the Challenger and Columbia tragedies and muses about steps that could have been taken to prevent them. He also speaks poignantly and with great affection for Resnik, who died with the other crew members of the Challenger.  Why are we fascinated by astronauts? Because they go places we will never go, see and experience things that we will never know, AND THEN, they come back down to earth and tell us about their adventures. And, though a child growing up today probably has a better chance of becoming President than an astronaut, I hope there are still young boys and girls, standing in their back yards, looking skyward and dreaming of flying beyond the stars. Because..."
2,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,2,"Mike Mullane is a shuttle astronaut with a penis fixation. Although Riding Rockets is ostensibly about the opening decades of the space shuttle era in NASA, it could be titled the Cosmic Adventures of Mike and his Member. If he doesn't mention his genitalia more times than he uses the acronym ""NASA"", he at least makes a valiant effort. His is an astronaut memoir of an altogether different kind than say, Jim Lovell's, or Deke Slayton's. This is not a heroic tale of people achieving the impossible:it is instead the story of a man-child and his bros in space. He is juvenile, inappropriate, and obsessed with himself --- but someone who has an interesting story to tell, one that sometimes verges on thoughtful, if you can endure his boorishness.Riding Rockets gave me fits, being an uncomfortable read: Mullane has all the tact of a dog in heat, and writes almost confrontationally. His emotions are ever on his sleeves, and he dares anyone to challenge him. (""Come at me, bro!"") His story is entertaining, and even touching -- there were times when I shook with laughter, and moments wherein I put the book away to put some distance myself and Mullane's emotions, like his despair at his friends' death following the Challenger explosion. Part of the appeal in reading the memoirs of astronauts is that they've seen Earth and humanity in a way the overwhelming majority of us haven't. A photo of Earthrise cannot have the same profound effect on people as actually being there, hanging in the black of space and seeing the Earth -- the stage for every human drama, the sum of our experienced lives -- shrinking below, the entirety of our existence reduced to a finite thing that can be left behind. Mullane can write beautifully, but instead he makes a lot of penis jokes, and those moments of author-reader connection were always broken by wanting to recoil from his personality.Despite the sometimes beauty of his words, and his insights, Mullane is, candidly, a jackass. The image that comes to mind is that of a drunk teenager invading a bar, perhaps one who has just finished the greatest high school football game of his life and can't wait to impress his audience with it -- but is oblivious to the fact that he is in the company of grown adults who find his posturing and immense self-satisfaction wholly obnoxious. He identifies himself early on, and somewhat proudly, as being in a state of a Arrested Development, along with most of the astronaut corps. Having cheerfully written off his ability to function as a mature, considerate, and thoughtful human beings, he spends most of the book acting instead like a jackass -- ogling women, devoting paragraphs to how rockin' the bods of some of his female colleagues were; endlessly complaining and opining about everyone who thought or acted differently from himself, and of course, chatting merrily away about his penis. Inexplicably, he forgot to mention said organ in the index. It was certainly mentioned enough times to merit inclusion there. Charming he isn't, although his attempts at civilized behavior are almost comic. After dismissing civilian astronauts for being a bunch of pantywaisted granola-eating libtards -- in contradistinction to the solid, right-thinking, manly-man military pilots -- Mullane reflects on their performance throughout the shuttle missions and concludes, ""Hey, those guys did have a pair. Not bad!""I couldn't be impressed by Mullane. Behind the cocky grin and the swagger are thoughtful eyes and a mind that can deliver stirringly poetic tributes and reflections to friends, love, and the beauty of life , but these occasions are few and far between, diamonds in a rough possibly too broad to justify digging in. There aren't many astronaut memoirs about the shuttle program, but I'm planning on reading the other I've found (Sky Walking, Tom Jones) to see if readers interested in that era of NASA's history have to be content with this story of adolescents in space."
3,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5497863-jon-mcbride,5,"Excellent read, though I am admittedly biased from growing up around NASA. Mike has a way of bringing back memories - joyful, painful and all points between - of America's Space Shuttle Program and the Astronaut corp of ""Thirty-Five New Guys"" of 1978, or TFNGs (which included my father, Jon McBride).The book is raw and honest, taking a look behind the public face of NASA into the lives of the men and women who comprised the program as well as the spouses and families who also sacrificed much to fuel the dream of human spaceflight.Having been a ""child of NASA"", growing up across the street from JSC and in 1984 watching my father pilot Challenger, it was great to read this book and relive the memories. The rosy childhood lenses have long been replaced by adult perspective of the realities of the dangers of military aviation and rocketry, but it made the book more fascinating to me in many ways.From the exhilaration of realizing lifelong dreams to the many observable yet dismissed warning signs that led to tragedies for the Challenger crew and, later, Columbia's, Colonel Mullane respectfully remembers those who gave their lives and those who were left behind to live with the scars. I appreciate him mentioning my own brother's death in military aviation and memorializing numerous other's in the close-knit extended family of NASA's astronauts.The Outpost - the now demolished tavern that was an old NASA hangout - came back to life for me. I could see George Abbey once again, though I really just knew his fantastic children as sometimes play buddies. I even remember my dad chuckling at some message cork-board in the astronaut office (now I get it!). I could almost smell the jet fuel at Ellington Field as I watched my dad and perhaps Colonel Mullane in the back seat of a T-38 say ""goodbye"" for a short trip by way of a giant and probably unnecessary afterburner that seemed 100ft long!!Thanks for this gem Colonel Mullane and thank you for your service; great to see you before the final flight of Discovery a couple months ago. This book helps me understand what that launch must have meant to you personally, and so many others. And also to keep reaching for dreams!!When the final launch of the Space Shuttle takes place (scheduled for July with Atlantis), it will be bittersweet to be sure. I hope that the United States continues human spaceflight in some significant way."
4,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4274490-kathryn,1,"Like probably half of American kids, I wanted to be an astronaut. So I was hoping this book would get down to the nuts and bolts of what it's like to be on a space shuttle, what astronauts do all day when they're up there, what the training is like, etc. Also, this book came recommended by Mary Roach. I was very disappointed. First of all, the writing style is that of a talented sixth-grader. The dialogue, such as it is, is stilted and unrealistic. (Proud of that Tarzan nickname, are you, Mike? So proud you need to use it in every sentence Judy says?) The author himself seems to be stuck permanently in sixth grade as well-- the jokes are either about poop or boobs, and self-aggrandizement alters with self-pity so fast it should have given the author whiplash. He's fixated on the idea of himself as a red-blooded, all-American, pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps don't-ask-nothin'-from-nobody kind of guy, and then whines throughout the book about how the female astronauts get the most press attention, and other missions get the most press attention, and Sally Ride was mean to him because he's a serial sexual harasser, and on and on and on. In one paragraph, he asserts that the civilian astronauts don't have any life experience, and in the next, he states that he's never worked with a woman before. Because the only kind of life experience that exists is fighting in Vietnam, apparently. And even though this is supposedly the beginning of his transformation in thinking, I have never read anything less self-aware. Later on, he wants some cookies for having realized that the women he works with are competent and do their jobs well. As a self-professed middle-of-the-road guy, you'd think he'd have recognized that a woman, like Sally Ride, with a PhD in physics from Stanford was beyond competent. In fact, this book left me with serious doubts about NASA's HR. Mike Mullane is one of those people who substitutes ""politically correct"" for ""polite."" A large percentage of the book is taken up by his gleeful stories of sexually harassing other astronauts and staff. He takes about a page to go through the women in his astronaut class and give their credentials, along with their marital status and number of kids. (Of course, he never does anything similar with the men.) The only women he likes are the ones who don't object to his sexist jokes, many of which he recounts in detail. Sorry, Mike, if you're looking at a woman's chest while talking to her, that's not un-politically correct. That's both unprofessional and an asshole move. When he finally gets on the shuttle, there is very little about day-to-day life, except the details of the space toilet (which I thought was pretty interesting). There's almost nothing about the mission itself or what astronaut work looks like (his second two missions were classified, but the first wasn't). There's a lot of wanna-be poetical stuff about watching the earth below the shuttle, which is also written at a sixth-grade level, tops. If you want to know what an astronaut's job is, read a different book. The only interesting parts in the book were about NASA internal politics and the Challenger explosion. According to the author, there were a lot of internal screw-ups and a nasty office culture that led to the Challenger explosion, and the Columbia disaster several years later. He spends quite some time on the toxic climate in NASA, where astronauts fear that any dissent will get them grounded permanently, and where there is no transparency or accountability for things like flight assignments and engineering failures. The effect this lifestyle has on astronaut families is tragic, and you really do feel bad for the author's wife. Mostly, though, I only finished this book because I was waiting for my next hold to come in from the library. Don't read it if you like professionalism, women, or the English language. "
5,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424908-map,5,"You'll read a lot of reviews on this site talking about the sexism in Mullane's book, and how if you can get through that, it's pretty funny. One thing they don't mention thought is:HE KNOWS IT. In fact, one of the themes of growth in this book is that Mullane goes from being a sexist pig in the 70s to a man who realizes women can do everything he can do as well and better. Now, granted, he still doesn't seem to be able to resist telling us the sexist jokes he used to make (to prove just how sexist he used to be, of course, only that, not because he still secretly thinks they're funny, no, not at all) but the point is, it's MUCH more lighthearted an inoffensive than I was afraid it would be when I read other reviews.Ok, onto the review proper.This book follows Mullane (not completely chronologically) from his early childhood, fascinated by Sputnik and building his own rockets, through military life, applying for the astronaut corps, and through his life as an astronaut, 10% of which is ""riding rockets"" and 90% of which is being jerked around by the bosses. Mullane talks about it all with an easy humor, lots of self-deprecation, and a real understanding for how NASA works (for good and for bad) and how hard it is on the families of astronauts.Seriously, Mullane's wife deserves a medal. 2 medals. One for being the wife of an astronaut, and one for being the wife of a man who would, at a public party, give her a painting of....well, just read the book!"
6,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1541562-diane,4,"This book was everything I had hoped for. It gave me insight into the real life of an astronaut, it humanized the incredible feats it took to get into space, and it made me even more enthusiastic, if that's even possible, about the human species exploring the vasty nothingness of space.I've read some other reviews that mention that Mullane is sexist, and talks about his penis a great deal. While those assessments of the man are actually correct, the reviewers missed the point. Mullane came from an era where men, especially fighter pilots, were sexist misogynistic pigs. No doubt about that. But the point of him recounting his idiot tendencies, which he admits to and apologizes for, is that he actually changes his mind - he grows and changes, as all people should.The talk about his penis does one really important thing: takes the luster off space flight. He's not talking about his bits to impress anyone. He's talking about them because the reality of space flight is that astronauts wear diapers, or urine-catching condoms, and it's NOT sexy. While the rewards for getting into space are amazing, as he recounts with loving detail, the hurdles to get there are also well detailed, spelling out the reality that space travel is hard work. That he chose to approach it with a 5th grader's sensibility and make jokes was actually fine with me.His recounting of the Challenger disaster really got to me. Probably because I had the same thoughts about the accident that he did - that the crew was killed instantly and didn't suffer. ... The reports from the investigation show otherwise. They were awake and alive for the two and half minute fall to earth, with no way out.With his insights, I understand better why the shuttle program was eventually shut down. I hope for our return to space as explorers, but with slightly more opportunity for survival.You would think with all my praise, I would give it 5 stars. But there are some down sides to this book - the use of acronyms being one of them. I get that in the astronaut service they use acronyms with no difficulty, but being a civilian, it was often bewildering when he threw 6 - 10 acronyms out and just kept using them assuming I remembered them all through the course of the book. Not so, really.And at times, the writing suffers. He is eloquent and moving in many parts of the book. And other times the writing is tedious and boring, with poor word choices and phrases that jolt you out of the narrative.That being said, really worth the read. I really quite enjoyed it."
7,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2266055-daniel-villines,2,"A fair characterization of this book is that it tells two stories. The first story is one of the astronaut program as it was transformed after Apollo and operated during the initial years of the space shuttle program. The second is the personal story of the book’s author, Mike Mullane, and his complete lack of consideration for the mere mortal humans that come into contact with His Grace, the One True Astronaut. The first story, as does the second, spans the entire book. Mullane gives a recount of his career from his selection as a shuttle astronaut, progresses through his training, and continues on through three flights on the space shuttle. The story is insightful and indeed contains the very information and insights I was hoping for in any book about the space program.Mullane knows his stuff. When he’s focused on his job he cannot be impeached. He had me completely captivated. There were minor details and major facts that had never been revealed to me previously about the shuttle program. His reports of the Challenger and Columbia disasters were complete and insightful. The first story about the shuttle program is well worth the read provided you can keep your lunch down during the various ascensions of Mike Mullane’s personal life-views, i.e. the second story. Within the periodic appearances of the second story, Mullane has a superiority complex of the worst kind. Women that come into his world are initially judged as incompetent and incapable. They are assigned a mental rating with imaginary numeric cards ranging from 1 to 10 based solely on their looks. If a woman is a 9 or 10 (and is tolerant of lecherous behavior), Mullane might actually become enlightened by her abilities as time goes by, but only because he wants to be around her. His physical attraction towards women provides the time required to form an opinion about their competency.Along these same lines, the astronauts who are academic scientists are also made to suffer his holier-than-thou perceptions of them. What right do scientists have to fly into space when military fighter jocks like Mullane are virtually ordained to do so? While in Mullane’s presence, the astronaut-scientists have no purpose other than to make Mullane feel good about himself by suffering the brunt of Mullane’s stupid juvenile jokes. However, with the passage of time and forced exposure, Mullane sees fit elevate some of the astronaut-scientists to a level of measured respect.And that’s why didn’t like Mullane. In his eyes, everybody who is not like Mullane is someone who is less than himself, not different, but less. Redemption to achieve some value of consideration by Mullane is just that: an elevation by Mullane to a level that resides somewhere below his own god-like self perception. Heaven forbid that a woman or a scientist should present themselves as equals to Mullane based upon the merits of being selected as an astronaut. What Mullane forgets is that his credibility for this book stems from those very same qualifications.I gave this book a punitive two stars where three could actually be due. Mullane is not the right voice for a topic of such universal and human importance as space exploration. There must be other books by other astronauts that can provide the same information provided in Riding Rockets but do not foster the caustic feelings of alienation that are fanned by Astronaut Richard Michael Mullane."
8,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008953-sharon,5,"This is a great book. Here's why:1. Some of his childhood stories are utterly hysterical. I was actually lying in bed reading, laughing so hard that tears were rolling down my face. 2. There's a lot of crazy, odd, humiliating stuff about being an astronaut and he shares ALL of it. The man has never heard of TMI. Some of the details, most of the humor, and a little of the language is pretty crude, so consider yourself forewarned. It's part of Mullane's ""charm"", such as it is. 3. His friendship with Judy Resnik, who died on Challenger (along with 3 of his other astronaut classmates/friends) is funny, moving, and sad. 4. His analysis of NASA culture, especially the astronaut office and the 'experimental' nature of the Space Shuttle is disturbing and occasionally shocking. 5. His countdowns to his first launch on the Shuttle had me literally holding my breath. For PAGES. 6. His talk of the ""normalization of deviance"" is soooo important and interesting. I'd never really thought about things that way and it is easy to see how disasters like Challenger and Columbia happen when you consider how easy it is to normalize deviance when it occurs repeatedly with no associated tragedies. 7. His descriptions of looking at the earth from space are among the best I've read and his practice of sticking his bed sack to a wall so his face was near a window and then staying up to watch the earth roll beneath him while he was supposed to be sleeping are great. A quote: ""To say the view was overwhelmingly beautiful would be an insult to God."" 8. He's was a sexist pig. He knows he was a pig. He's a little proud he was a pig. He was a real, real pig. But he's funny and easy to forgive for being a pig. He made a lot of progress over the years and came to respect most of the women he worked with (never really came to like Sally Ride, though!) and to understand something about the realities of discrimination. But if sexist banter and jokes bother you, don't read this book. LOL. 9. It's just a great, laugh-out-loud funny, heartbreaking book. :) And educational along the way. "
9,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32853493-mckenzie-literarydragon,0,My feelings toward this book are best summed up in Kathryn's review which is in the link below. Blegh. https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
10,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237178-carolyn,5,"Of all the astronaut biographies published over the past 30 years Mike Mullane’s Riding Rockets: The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut stands apart from the rest. An alternate title for Mullane’s book could easily be The Sacred and the Profane, because the author, a former shuttle astronaut, delivers a no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners peek inside examination of NASA’s astronaut office that is irreverent and occasionally blasphemous, yet engaging and spellbinding. Like most astronauts of his generation, Mullane was inspired by Sputnik to spend his high school years building rockets (for “high school projects”) with the blessing of his constantly supportive parents (he speaks fondly of his father who was crippled by polio when Mike was a boy). After flying 134 missions in Vietnam, he volunteered for the space program where he was subjected to every test known to man or beast including counting backwards by 7 (a test he failed) and a colonoscopy. “I was determined when the NASA proctologist looked up my ass he would see pipes so dazzling he would ask the nurse to get his sunglasses.” Having passed the clean ass exam, Mullane joined a new class of trainees, the TFNGs (either the thirty five new guys or the fucking new guys depending on who you ask), the first class that NASA tried to diversify, hiring African American men and white women (including Judy Resnik and Sally Ride). Mullane has no problem accepting other races, but initially holds the same chauvinistic sexist views about women that characterized an era. He spent 12 years in all boys Catholic schools, followed by the military academy, followed by Vietnam. His only concept of women came from his mother and his wife, both of whom seemed content and fulfilled without a career. Mullane is honest about these feelings in the book, and while we can’t really cheer for him for his Road to Damascus revelation that “Oh wow! Women can be as talented and as smart and as good as men,” I did appreciate his candor. And NASA clearly was a boys club. Where else can you “snort” at particularly attractive women (as in “I want to snort her flanks”) and get away with it? Or use the shuttle manipulator arm and camera to give head-to-toe inspections of female colleagues, as Mullane remembers doing? And where else but in microgravity do you get a “morning” Viagra effect thanks to the redistribution of blood?On orbit opportunities abounded for the Planet AD crowd. One shuttle commander, a particularly right-wing crewmember, ordered a countdown from a colleague—literally, “3, 2, 1, 0!”—in orbit so he could “squeeze … out a [fecal] muffin on that [expletive] Castro” as the shuttle passed over Havana. To say that Mullane and the other Planet AD inhabitants were uninhibited is an understatement. They were living on the edge—seemingly impervious. Of course, some of the more conservative post-doctorate members and female astronauts weren’t so amused. According to the author, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, carried a heavy feminist chip on her shoulder. But other female astronauts, like Judy Resnik and Rhea Seddon, shrugged it all off and gave as good as they got. However, discount the profane in this book, entertaining though it may be. Instead, admire Mullane’s moving description of the sacred ground of the Beach House, with its Ozzie and Harriet furniture, where the Challenger crew last saw their loved ones. And appreciate, along with Mullane, his close friendship with fellow TFNG Judy Resnik. A few strands of her hair were all that were recovered after the Challenger disaster. Considering it is doubtful we will ever read a dedicated biography of Judy Resnik, this book probably provides the best insight into her life as an astronaut. This book is an honest, sympathetic and authentic look into the fears and frustrations in these astronauts’ lives."
11,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345786-paul,5,"I've always been a NASA/space shuttle geek, and Mullane's book, recommended to me by several friends, was an excellent look behind the scenes at JSC and KSC, and how the program unfolded. If you can tolerate not-that-rare occasions of crude and sexist humor, it's pretty funny, and reading his stories of interactions with the ill-fated crew of Challenger, especially Judy Reznik, were particularly touching, too. Anyone who is a fan of NASA and manned space exploration in general, and the shuttle in particular, will definitely enjoy Riding Rockets."
12,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2650069-alicia,5,I learned everything about going to space and living in space very explicit not for the kids. I loved everything about it even met and got a autographed copy of this book. 
13,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42679947-everydayreader1,2,"RIDING ROCKETS was one of those books I expected to be among my favorite reads of 2020. Mike Mullane writes candidly about his life and being part of the crew of the first flight of the space shuttle Discovery. From that perspective, it is well written and informative, especially concerning the culture at NASA during his time there.The reason I gave this book less than a stellar rating is because of the constant emphasis, it seems to me, on the feminine/masculine divide or differences, and his own attitudes about women. Naturally, I expected some frank discussion of the subject, but it was a constant that grated on me and took so much away from both the process and risks of space flight and my overall enjoyment of the book. I was relieved to finish reading it. That continual sarcasm, mail chauvinism, whatever term you choose to apply, always has, and always will, leave a very bad taste in my mouth. And, it is the dominant impression I am left with from these pages, though I'm certain that was not the author's intent. As a reader, if you can set this aspect aside, you'll find the book interesting. "
14,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54331913-volodymyr-yatsevsky,5,"It’s dramatic, fun and exciting at the same time. It’s full of technical stuff to stay aware how daring were the shuttle flights. It’s about loss and gains, dreams and reality, life and death in all details. It’s an odyssey in the end and pure tranquility of the orbital gravity. This book stands out being the story of a true space Forrest Gump. "
15,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62569911-rebecca,5,"In addition to a lot of information about Mullane's crotch, this also gives a clear insight into the machinations of NASA practices and policies in the Shuttle era. Worth the read, or even better, the listen - Mullane reads it himself."
16,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23295044-bruce,5,"I'm going to go ahead and give this 5 stars, even though Mullane's favorite thing about himself--his sense of humor--is mostly awful. Still, the man can write, and he does a great job of chronicling how the astronaut's special blend of obsessive competitiveness, huge self-confidence, and gut-churning fear can land him in the back seat of a space craft, wearing a urine condom and praying the weather will clear so he can be blasted skyward even as he counts the various ways he can end up dead in the very near future. Unexpectedly, given the author's insistence that he hails from the Planet AD (Arrested Development), he's also a great champion of the beauties of Earth, which he was able to observe during three Shuttle missions and describes wonderfully in the book. There's much more to enjoy in Riding Rockets, including the barbs Mullane aims at NASA management in general and one bureaucrat in particular, but I won't spoil the fun. This is one of the very best of the astronaut books."
17,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,2,"I've written this review about thirty times in my head. After reading An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth, I wanted more space. I read the summary for this, but rejected it until Mary Roach mentioned it as ""if you only read one astronaut biography, read this one"". (Her book was published before Hadfield's.)It's...hysterical. I literally laughed until I cried at some points. Mullane writes irreverently about the first decade of the space shuttle program, revealing NASA as it was, warts and all.But oh, the misogyny. It dripped from every page, lurking in every chapter and leaping out at unexpected moments. I suspect Mullane is beloved friend, husband, and father, but the contempt he holds for people (read: women) unwilling to put up with his ""Planet Arrested Development"" outlook is stomach-churning. It makes me sad and upset that this guy was an astronaut, who got to go into space three times, representing his country. It makes me angry that someone published what he says about women in the 21st century. There are places in the narrative where he almost seems to apologize for his behavior - he lays out what he did or said, elevates the person who put up with it for, well, putting up with it, but he never condemns himself or his fellow astronauts or apologizes in any way. No mention about they shouldn't have had to put up with it in the first place.He almost, almost pulls it up at the end, outlining what he learned about the bravery and dedication of women (and civilian post-docs, the poor things) and how it changed him. There's a particularly moving story where he first notes angrily that all these women probably just up and decided to be astronauts when they saw a poster on a job bulletin board...only to come to the realization that a little girl seeing Sputnik go up in the 1950s and wanting to be an astronaut would be discouraged at every turn, unlike Mullane, who had the full, enthusiastic support of his parents, teachers, and the military. I'm just not sure if it makes up for the previous 350 rage-inducing pages of ""god, feminists, why so uptight?""In the end, his attitude made it hard to take his complaints about the organizational structure of NASA at the time and how it lead to the Challenger incident. Sorry dude, but while you were a small cog in the machine, the ""Right Stuff"" attitude held by you and most everyone else in the space program at the time only contributed."
18,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5939179-michael-mcclelland,5,"A surpringly honest, emotionally baring, funny and mostly modest tale from an American astronaut. As one of the first new intake of gifted and skilled people selected to man the space shuttle - what he would soon realise was a vehicle more dangerous than any that preceded it, despite its tradesmen-like intent - Mike Mullane is subjected to the politics, terror, exhilaration, depression, frustration and deathly mismanagement that was the lot of a NASA astronaut. From the homemade rocket-launching days of his childhood in his adventurous, supportive family; through to his ultimately successful but desperately fraudulent NASA selection interview; we discover not only that dreams come true, but that it's not so galling to hear so from such a light-hearted, grateful and witty author.Initially denied the title of 'astronaut', it's a wild and dangerous ride through training as Mike perhaps learns even more about life and his colleagues than he does about the technology he needs to master to ensure survival.In a time of firsts and in a climate where safety is gradually subjugated by the want of space programme publicity, he earns his astronaut pin (which he himself must pay for) and almost falls victim to the shuttle design flaws that will ultimately claim the lives of the crews/his friends aboard Challenger and Columbia. Finally, totally addicted to space travel, yet fully aware of the sacrifices made by his family for him to fulfill his dream - and his own selfishness, comes the difficult decision to leave NASA.This is a fantastic book. Devoid of the excessive technical data that would have made it a slog, it is instead a funny and welcoming read. The author is likeable, the acts described are out of this world (literally) and this era of space history is particularly fascinating. (It's too bad Mike Mullane isn't a Buddhist, otherwise we might get a sequel to his life story ;) Highly Recommended."
19,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3392444-terpkristin,3,"Over the course of my education, internships, and now career, I've met and worked with a few astronauts. I actually think I may have met author Mullane while at an internship at Kennedy Space Center. Because of this experience, this interaction, nothing in this book was a real surprise. Astronauts are driven folks. They know how to act (how to hide things that shouldn't be shown like fear or concern, except when the cameras are off and they're in the company of their peers and teams that help make space missions succeed). They have big egos (well, a lot of them do). Mullane's book was an often funny and sometimes somber (Challenger, other disasters) reflection of his life leading up to and then his career as an astronaut. From what I know from the astronauts I've met, it's pretty honest. Mullane doesn't sugar-coat things when they shouldn't be--in that sense, even though he isn't an engineer by training, he shares that with his ground-based brethren. Some of his honesty might be easier since he's now so far removed from his duties as an astronaut, but it's still refreshing to read.Mullane broke each chapter into a fairly well-contained story on its own (though at the end, bigger stories spanned multiple chapters). This was a good thing and a bad thing; it made it easy to pick up and put down for short reading bursts. As such, this book took me forever to finish. Especially in the beginning, as he discussed his early life, it was easy to read a chapter then put down for the next shiny object. But that also made it convenient to read, easily read while waiting at a doctor's office or while in line.If you've never met an astronaut and have ever wondered what the space program is like, this is a great book to read. If you have met astronauts, or you're an engineer in the field, you'll probably still enjoy it...but it might be more of what you already know. For me, it was a reminder of the people involved in the field I'm in, that there are human lives impacted by the work I do."
20,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/383682-rinabeana,5,"The shuttle program was something I didn't know much about, and don't really follow now. Most of my space nerdiness regards the Apollo program (and Mercury and Gemini as they led up to it). This book was a double whammy because I learned a lot about the shuttle program and was very entertained. I loved Mullane's writing style and no holds barred stories. (I perhaps didn't need to know quite so much about waste excretion in space, but what can you do?) I was (naively) shocked to discover just how dangerous the space program was and that many of the missions came very close to the fates of Challenger, Columbia, and their crews. Mullane's opinion was that he (and most of the other astronauts) considered it a very real possibility that they wouldn't come back from their missions (which didn't stop them from going, to the dismay of their families). He was also openly critical of the way NASA handled problems (or didn't handle them), and held them directly responsible for the Challenger and Columbia disasters. It's quite sad, really. Despite these criticisms, he managed to throw in countless anecdotes about his fellow astronauts. I was especially amused that Sally Ride shunned him after he told a dirty joke. I loved his descriptions of his relationship with Judy Resnik (who died on Challenger) and how the women in the shuttle program really showed him that his former misogynist views were groundless (though in his own defense, he cited many examples of how he'd been indoctrinated to such views). I applaud him for learning such a lesson, because it seems that not everyone was able to. To sum it up, this book is well worth reading!"
21,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,4,"Recommended by Mary Roach in Packing for Mars. This was a very good read, full of every entertaining anecdote Mullane could think of concerning his astronaut career.He doesn’t discuss training very much, but he gives detailed accounts of what it was like to exchange tearful farewells with his wife and be strapped into the shuttle, spending uncomfortable hours waiting for a launch that might very well be scrubbed. He describes mundane details of life in orbit, including everything you’d want to know about using the bathroom.More soberly, he is bitter about NASA’s mismanagement of the astronauts which fostered low morale and an atmosphere of paranoia. He touches on the institutional problems which were uncovered by the investigation of the Challenger disaster, and he does not exempt the astronauts themselves from blame.One jarring note is that Mullane was a sexist pig. Possibly he still is: he shakes his head while describing his bad behavior, but I can picture a smirk on his face while he’s doing it. He seems rather pleased that he and his astronaut buddies resisted the many admonitions to “grow up”. He was proud of the way Judy Resnik handled the unprofessional, macho atmosphere: by shrugging off the jokes and crudeness and by giving as good as she got. He’s disdainful of Sally Ride’s feminist activism."
22,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5585222-lisa-shininger,5,"It's a great memoir, by turns tender and irreverent, with sometimes refreshing candor and healthy doses of self-congratulation. Mullane doesn't shy away from the more horrifying aspects of an astronaut's life (both the flyboy culture and the work) and might actually beat Mary Roach at bringing in-flight vomiting and pooping to life. I think he's more convinced of his own conversion from sexist jerk to tolerant guy than the evidence warrants, but at least he makes it amusing along the way. He is right about one thing: the spouses and families of astronauts deserve way more recognition than they get.Honestly, though, what's always going to stick with me is the affection and respect that practically leaps off the page when Mullane writes about his crew- and classmate Judith Resnick, who died in the Challenger accident, and the anger as he lashes out at the toxic management culture that allowed crew and vehicle safety concerns to go unanswered in the headlong rush to preserve the all-important schedule."
23,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,4,"Follow astronaut Mike Mullane as he progresses from male chauvinist pig fighter jock to reluctant feminist. Along the way he flies into space on the shuttle three times, loses a close friend in the Challenger explosion, lives in terror of dying on every flight he takes, and is even more terrified by the thought that he might not be allowed to go. Mullane has much to say about the administrators of NASA, none of it good, and accuses some of them of being more interested in power and job security than in the safety of the astronauts. We see his joy in the beauty and thrill of spaceflight, and his sorrow at the passing of fellow astronauts. If your eyes stay dry after reading his letters to his wife and mother preceding his final flight, well... If you have followed the progress of America's quest to go into space, and are saddened by our abandonment of that quest, you will want to read this book."
24,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80347-dana,5,"We all know I love space travel, and this was a great little find in the Orlando NASA giftshop. Very interesting information contained within, and it's an enjoyable read if you have any interest in knowing that it was like to be one of the original astronauts. Feels like he didn't leave anything out he didn't have to.One note: If you were a child during the Challenger tragedy, it was kind of theraputic to read Mullane's virtual love letter to the astronauts lost on that flight. The news focused so much on Christa McAullife (with all do respect), but there were others on that flight that were equally as important, and it was nice to hear about them in more detail.So, I would recommend, if you're into this sort of thing. :)"
25,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126781-minh,5,"For a self professed sexist pig, Mike Mulligan has the soul of a poet. His autobiography is one of the most moving and well written novels I've read in a while, even for someone with only passing interest in the space race this book was enough to stir my soul. His descriptions of earth of space, grief at losing fellow astronauts and the sheer strength of his love for his parents and his wife, you can't help but be moved and sucked into this book. With some of the most sexist jokes I've ever heard, you can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness as even Mike acknowledges what an ass he is. Much like Stiff from last year, Riding Rockets is educational, hilarious and has forever changed my view of life in space. "
26,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,4,"Funny, candid, detailed, with an easy prose style, astronaut Mullane has opinions about the shuttle program, NASA bureaucracy and the exploration of space, and he knows how to use them. He was a friend of fellow astronaut Judith Resnik, who died on Challenger, and he writes honestly about the pain of that loss. He is also very frank about the unpaid service of astronauts’ wives, and you will end this book thinking his own should be canonized. Riding Rockets is the best book by an astronaut since Michael Collins’ Carrying the Fire. Reading both back to back is a full history of the US astronaut corps."
27,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1296241-lioness,4,"The author of this autobiography was one of the early Space Shuttle astronauts. He tells how he became an astronaut, what drives men like him and how he changed over the years. Most touching was the love and admiration he developed for Judy Resnick - a civilian astronaut who died in the Challenger shuttle explosion.The politics and intrigue in NASA was fascinating to read about and the nitty gritty details of space flight was very interesting.Less convincing was the secondary theme of the book -how he went from being a male chauvinist to a man who learned to appreciate woman as something more than sex objects. This was overdone with a lot of content repeated often."
28,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie,4,"This was in the bibliography of Mary Roach's Packing for Mars, and you can never get enough humor out of body functions in space. He chronicles the change over from the rocket to the shuttle program, and what that meant for astronauts. He also tells the story of losing his friends on Challenger, and the fears and disasters faced. I remembered that I watched Challenger take off as a live broadcast from a Science Fiction Convention in San Jose. A room filled with people who wanted more than anything to trade places with those astronauts watching, and crying."
29,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8678817-johanna,5,"When I bought this book at KSC I did not expect to get what this book delivers. First of all, I thought I knew something about the space program until I read Mullane's book and realized just how little us mortals actually know.The book was funny, easy read and most importantly heart wrenching honest. It gave me an even deeper respect for the men and woman of the space program and their quest to follow their dreams."
30,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/506479-christine,4,"Imagine if Michael Scott, instead of operating a regional branch of Dunder Mifflin, became an astronaut with a gift for writing. That’s Mike Mullane. Mullane makes the average reader cringe on a nearly-every-chapter basis. Seemingly self-aware in hindsight, honest, inappropriate and juvenile, yet always heartfelt. I enjoyed this book immensely.Note: I found this book after researching Judy Resnick, who deserves a worthy biography."
31,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23362951-sherryl,4,It was certainly a trip reading about the 'space cowboys' of yesteryear. Mike Mullane certainly has a way with relating his trips to orbit to us earth-bound souls. The imagery invoked in his descriptions of his time in space are beautifully written and makes one almost feel as though we were with him.
32,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8848209-scott-kardel,4,"I am a big fan of astronaut autobiographies and Mike Mullane's Riding Rockets is a good one, giving an honest (and often uncensored) look at his life and career as a Space Shuttle astronaut. Mullane vividly describes the stress of crew selection, very real fear of riding in a shuttle, the majesty of seeing Earth from space and the crazy antics that took place in the astronaut office in the 1980s."
33,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1064644-nathan,3,"George Carlin meets John Glenn. If you can get past the constant sexism and crude excuses for humor, Mike Mullane offers a wide-eyed glimpse into space travel that might turn out to be the closest any of us ever get. For that reason, a good read but not a great one."
34,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11750959-brendan-oldham,2," I didn't like. He comes off as arrogant and pig-headed. It was like reading ""Top Gun"". That said, if you're interested in space, you'll learn a lot about being an astronaut. It certainly convinced me that I'd never want to be one!"
35,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11776206-sheryl-sato,5,"Loved this book. Recommended by Mary Roach as the one book written by an astronaut which should be read, this book is a journey into space multiple times, along with many interesting facts and opinions about the space age during the 70s and 80s. An epic journey and thoroughly entertaining."
36,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549220-sarah,3,"Mike Mullane has a strong tendancy towards being a sexist pig. That said, this was the most entertaining astronaut memoirs I've read. (And I've read a lot.)"
37,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13174155-clay-davis,5,A great autobiography of an astronaut. I learned and was entertained by this book. I found out a lot about how N.A.S.A. works and how it doesn't.
38,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106571581-sean-mobley,4,"Riding Rockets tells the story of former NASA astronaut Mike Mullane’s selection for, training on, and missions during the space shuttle program. In it, Mike is remarkably frank about so much, from his opinions about NASA leadership during his tenure to the terror and sometimes physical pain surrounding space travel to, perhaps most revealing, his personal journey from arrogant, sexist dinosaur to someone who is still a relic of his time but also has a more full understanding of the hardships faced by women and minorities in the space program.Autobiographies can be tough, because this is a person’s chance to share their version of a story, and often they tell the stories that make them look the best. Mullane is not afraid to make himself look a fool or dive into the inner workings of the male-dominated, male-centric world he emerged from. This book strips a lot of the varnish from the space program, so if you’re going into this hoping to keep all your heroes intact then you’ll be disappointed. I certainly came away with food for thought on people and parts of the NASA shuttle program that I hadn’t really challenged before. Perhaps the best praise I can give any history book is that it made me curious to learn more, in this case to research some of the points he made and see if others felt the same way he did (which is very far from the rosy portrait of NASA unity that the public gets).Mullane several times laments that right-brained engineers are the ones telling a lot of the space stories, implying that they fail to capture in words the beauty of their experience in the way a poet might. Sure, he’s no poet, but he is a fine writer, and his vivid language brings you right along for the ride. Mullane tells you up-front what he’s all about, and you can tell from the very first chapter that this book is rated PG-13 at a minimum. As I said before, he is brutally honest about his archaic views towards the women he worked with. I’ve read a review of someone who got to the first hints of that and got disgusted with this “sexist pig” and stopped reading. It’s unfortunate that person chose to stop, because they clearly only read the first few pages and missed the entire evolution of this person as he came to understand the obstacles that a world that was designed to lift him up as a white male put in the place of just about everyone else, and came to respect the ambitions and skills and depth of the women and people of color who joined him in the first shuttle astronaut class. While his views and language never elevates itself to a place that I personally would consider fully worth celebrating (indeed in the last third of the book, I felt myself joining Mullane’s wife when she would ask him “when are you going to grow up?”) as a historian I see so much value in this story. If you’re going to read a history book, any history book, and expect it to live your values and beliefs, you’re going to end up with an extremely shallow view of history. Heck, Margaret Sanger believed in sterilizing poor women. You can take that out of it’s context too, or you can learn about Margaret and the world around her to understand why she believed that. That's the whole point of reading about history: you're not sitting here saying, ""Yes, they were so right back then!"" You're saying, ""Yes, I want to learn about someone else's view of the world."" You gotta take the good with the bad. I rate books based on how eager I am to re-read them. This one comes in at 4-stars, meaning I am excited to reread it at some point in the future. This is one of the best astronaut biographies I’ve read, and I highly recommend it for people interested in this take on the Shuttle era, with the caveat that if you are going to get turned off by some of the more gross aspects of being an astronaut, or Mullane’s retelling of the crass comments he and many of the men in his class made about women, then seek safer options."
39,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9209104-amita,3,"The actual stories and discussion about NASA during the peak Shuttle launch era were really interesting. I loved learning about the dynamic between the leadership and the astronauts - it's a side of the glamorous NASA life you don't hear much. I also loved hearing about the training, the space flights, the camaraderie, and the awkward/crazy press tours. It's when we get into the antics of the ""Arrested Development Crowd,"" that I get a little torn. I like hearing all the craziness they got up to, but I hate that it's presented as some sort of bygone, halcyon era of good times and no one knows how to have fun anymore. Therein lies my biggest issue with the book: I wanted so much to like this guy. But he comes off arrogant and selfish and juvenile, all while claiming that at least he's self-aware and that's better than ignorance. The disdain he had for some of his fellow crew was obvious, despite his repeated efforts to claim that he learned his lesson and he really does value them now. He recognizes and apologizes for the fact that he was probably a pretty shitty father and husband while he was chasing his dream, but he also tries to spin it as a virtue of his wife that she dealt with it. ""I was terrible, but isn't my wife great for never nagging me? That's the lesson here - have a really awesome wife!"" The number of times he prefaces whatever hilarious anecdote he wanted to tell with ""politically correct"" or ""Arrested Development Crowd"" or ""misogynistic"" proves he's aware enough to know something is probably inappropriate, but he just doesn't care. ""Listen to this hilarious thing I said once! Oh I know, I'm such an asshole - but I KNOW that, so it's fine, right?""I know this book isn't about a dude who grew up in the 50s learning how to be a more socially-aware person, so I tried not to focus on it in deciding how I felt about the book. I would dutifully ignore the juvenile comments and focus on the underlying story, and then he'd say something just so frustrating that it would pull me out of the book. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the NASA parts of this story. And he's a great story-teller. But it mostly just made me want to read an astronaut memoir from someone else entirely."
40,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"I'm of two minds about this book.On the one hand, Mullane provides a fast-paced and entertaining view of the early years of the Space Shuttle program, giving us outsiders a view into the selection process, training, the politics and mismanaged administration of the Astronaut Office, the astronauts' intense drive, work ethic, and also their utter fear of what the Shuttle could do to them, fuelled by the seeming complacency of NASA management toward astronaut safety. He is brutally honest about the discomforts and indignities of space travel, and about his frustrations with the way astronauts were treated by management.On the other hand, he paints himself as an old-school chauvinist jock who came to NASA with deep Air Force experience (including in Vietnam) and immense personal drive, but a kind of psychological immaturity that made it hard for him to work in the non-military world. This makes major parts of his memoir cringe-worthy. The pranks, sexual innuendo directed at the female astronaut candidates, dismissal of non-military and ""part-time"" astronauts, and endless discussion of bodily functions, were tough for me to read. I certainly didn't expect to read so much about his penis, nor can I imagine how his wife, who comes across as a very traditional woman, consented to have her sex life with her husband described over and over again. His tribute to his close friend Judy Reznik, who died in the Challenger explosion, is dulled by his constant references to her appearance and his physical attraction to her. By the end of the book he comes to recognize how his initial attitudes were wrong, but the reader can't help but sympathize with the people (especially the women) who were the target of his disdain or prejudice. All in all I think this is a book worth reading for anyone interested in the Space Shuttle program, giving a great inside look at the forces (good and bad) motivating the astronauts and their management. At the same time, it dispels any notions one might have about astronauts as superhuman figures with noble motivations and impeccable character. The scene in which veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (of Gemini and Apollo fame) shakes his head at Mullane's pranks and drunken tomfoolery is telling. A slice of life, as it were."
41,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903375-gwen,3,"I like space. Never had a desire to be an astronaut, but I've always loved stars and NASA and all the work that goes into sending people up. So of course I picked this up when I visited the Johnson Space Center.Parts of this were good, parts of it were bad. But ultimately, once I finished reading about his first space flight (which, honestly, I expected to be more than a chapter) I was done. And what turned me away was Mullane himself. No doubt about it, he's a misogynist. He applauded himself on the back several times for not sleeping with a co-worker. Turned himself into a hero because of it. Never mind he was married, had kids, or hell, managed to get into space. Restraint was his greatest achievement! But he never thought it wrong. Never stopped thinking it. And all his other comments about looking down on those not in the military. On seeing beautiful women as threats because they could sleep around and get a leg up. Hell, he actively says that the only reason he became an astronaut was because he didn't have to be involved in the household. Chores, kids, shopping - his wife did everything so he had nothing to get in the way of his career. For. Ever. He acknowledges this only once, and was a jerk to her most of the time. (Can you say privileged?)I got to the point of the book where he'd been in space and then stopped reading because I realized if I ever meet Mullane in real life I'd turn on my heel and walk the other way.Parts of this I did like. The understanding of the inner politics of NASA and astronaut assignments. The stress Mullane's wife went through watch failed launch after failed launch. His slight growth towards seeing the feminist/civilian light, understanding their struggles and worth. (though really, seeing worth in everyone should be expected, not worthy of ten gold stars). The small moments of how it felt to hit 50 miles and officially become an astronaut, watching day come over the earth.They just weren't enough to pull me to finish the book."
42,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"This was a great memoir from start to finish. The glory and folly of the post-Apollo space age. Seen through the eyes of one of the most politically incorrect astronauts ever. This actually got me excited about the Space Shuttle era - something I would not of thought possible.The right stuff: astronaut autobiographies from Glenn to HadfieldAn enduring image of an ‘astronaut’ was created for the public by NASA, Time magazine, and Tom Woolf’s The Right Stuff. These caricatures of the original seven American astronauts, the so-called Mercury-7, chosen to assert American supremacy over the communist threat of Sputnik have seemingly endured way past their use by date. A resurgence in interest in ‘astronauts’ was made almost single-handedly in the English speaking world by the Canadian Colonel Chris Hadfield. His much publicised exploits, through the media of YouTube, as commander of expedition 35 aboard the International Space Station made obvious a change from May 5, 1961 when Alan Shepherd rode Freedom 7 into the history books.In his autobiographical An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, the now retired Hadfield provides one of the most readable and honest stories of his journey from being a glider in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in 1975 to commanding the international space Station in 2013 - after ‘only’ 21 years of astronaut training. He candidly describes the effort and training to get to being a modern astronauts - studying, practicing, learning, waiting, preparing for the worst - then being flexible enough to deal with the unexpected. What I liked is his can do approach as explained in his response to the 1969 Apollo 11moon landing and wanting to become an astronaut: I also knew, as did every other kid in Canada, that it was impossible. Astronauts were American. NASA only accepted applications from U.S citizens, and Canada didn’t even have a space agency. I was old enough to understand that getting ready wasn’t simply a matter of playing “space mission” with my brothers in our bunk beds, underneath a big National geographic poster of the Moon. But there was no program I could enroll in, no manual i could read, no one to ask. There was only one option, I decided. I had to imagine what an astronaut might do if he were 9 years old, then do exactly the same thing.His laconic, sometimes counter-intuitive advise is always presented with a wealth of evidence to support his lesson. His Frank assessment of the impact of his dream on the rest of his family make a good reminder for all the corporate males who neglect family events for yet another sales meeting.Hadfield’s book is a great read and compares favorably with two of my other notable astronaut autobiographies.At the age of five I was devastated when my mum said to me that I could not become an astronaut. She dashed my probably overly enthusiastic boyish exuberance regarding space exploration explaining that I would need to be both American and a military pilot. Despite this early reality check, and taking a different path to Hadfield, I followed the Apollo program with enthusiasm - racing home from primary school to watch the historic moon-walk of Armstrong and Aldrin.Of those Apollo 11 voyagers only Michael Collins put pen to paper to capture his journeys as an astronaut in the vivid and captivating Carrying the Fire. Collins displays a fine writing style and wry sense of humor. He wrote from an earlier time than Hadfield. Collins was part of the “Apollo fourteen”, the third group of astronauts, after being unsuccessful for selection in the second group, the “New Nine”.Collins adroitly describes his emergence as an astronaut, training for and flying on Gemini 10 with John Young and participating in the US’s third “space walk”. Collins was originally picked as part of the Apollo 8 crew. He was replaced by Jim Lovell when a bone spur was discovered on his spine, requiring surgery. He relates his feelings at losing this opportunity, Apollo 8 became the bold second manned Apollo flight all the way to circle the Moon, and then gaining his place in history as the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 11. Other books from this era that deserve a mention are Deke Slayton’s Deke and John Glenn’s A Memoir. Both of these were of the Mercury 7. Glenn’s memoir is so straight that it strains the reader’s credulity. Extraordinarily enough it is all John Glenn - astronaut, married family man, US Senator - it is definitely one of an uncomplicated patriotic kind. Slayton was different, grounded with a heart irregularity and instead of flying became the first Chief of the Astronaut Corps and selected the crews who flew Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions. His book, written as he was dying from cancer, covers the full space race period up to his retirement post the start of the Space Shuttle era.Other books of note are books by Eugene Cernan The Last Man on the Moon, and John Young’s Forever Young.My third must read astronaut autobiography though is Mike Mullane’s Riding Rockets.This in my mind is a minor classic, again so different to both Collins and Hadfield. Mullane was part of the Space Shuttle generation of astronauts, the 1978 class of TFNGs (the Thirty Five New Guys), a group that included the first female NASA astronauts. This book contains an emotional level and cadence not pictured in other first hand astronaut memoirs.Mullane, a self-confessed inhabitant from planet ‘arrested development’ shares his growing pains in recognising that women could be colleagues and brilliant astronauts at that. His brutally honest depiction of losing his friend Judy Resnik in the Challenger disaster due to NASA hubris. Mullane describes in vivid detail the subsequent appalling bureaucratic treatment of the family members who were present at the disastrous launch. His own experience prior to this when STS-27 suffered near catastrophic heat shield damage from launch damage makes this description all the more poignant.The whole fateful uncertainty of the Space Shuttle era, the “glory and the folly” of this remarkable era in human exploration of near space is wittily and cuttingly told. If you aren’t both amazed and angered in reading this memoir than I suggest you go back and read it again.http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "
43,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37078159-olesya,5,"I absolutely love the book. Mike’s passion for rockets and space is very inspiring. I loved that he didn’t camouflage the open sexism, that was a part of the culture he grew up with. I laughed out loud at his jokes, not so intelligent, yet I find it funny. There is a criticism of him of being never-grownup-teenager with all that comes with it, and that’s exactly what I find the super attractive in this book. While I believe in passionate librarian or accountant (being one myself), it takes completely different personality to conquer the space. Lots of teenage behaviour, as absence of some internal “breaks”, or “normality”. I think some people just judge it as unacceptable. Mike is very smart. He gave a very interesting insight of NASA’s day to day life. It’s impossible to read this book, and not wanting to know more about the history and the future of the space program. "
44,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81189160-ashley,4,"After reading some of the lower star reviews on this book, I can understand why some readers may feel gypped - yes, it is about spaceflight and written by an astronaut.However, for those reviewers that love to point out how childish and inappropriate some of his stories are, might I point you to the lead-in phrase of the title: ""The OUTRAGEOUS TALES of a Space Shuttle Astronaut."" I would also like to point them towards all of the sections describing his VERY SERIOUS and PROFESSIONAL work mates also acting in the same immature manner throughout the ENTIRE book. I think what these reviewers are experiencing is a disconnect between the way in which astronauts are seen professionally and the way in which they actually function on a personal level - the same as everyone else. Yes! Astronauts are humans! They are not robots! Who knew?!"
45,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877351-jen,3,"I struggled with this rating. Based on his book, Mike Mullane is an asshole who I doubt I could or would want to hold down a conversation with. He seemed to glory in being a misogynistic pig and it was all okay because eventually he figured out that women and PHd candidates were just as qualified as his military background self to be an astronaut. And, because he thanked his poor wife and mother. This attitude came up over and over and I nearly growled out loud each time in disgust and frustration. But, he did a good job of relating a very technical thing in terms that were understandable. It was an engaging book about an interesting topic. Stuck between giving this 2 or 3 stars and ended up appreciating the value it did impart but could not particularly recommend it to anyone."
46,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37844348-jes,3,"This is a book written by a dude in Texas and it sure does sound like it, speaking as a native Texan myself. The first half of the book, I was still getting used to the fact that NASA used to be hella racist and sexist. I did NOT appreciate any of Mike's commentary on women, his wife, his coworkers, whatsoever. This man does not have a clue how to talk to a woman and I bet he was rewarded for it his whole life. My contempt aside, there were some pretty great stories in here. Mike also did learn a thing or two about women in space, but not nearly enough.This book is enjoyable if you can get beyond the sexism.I recommend to Texan readers, men with similar ideologies and love a tall tale, and for space enthusiasts willing to sit through sexism."
47,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93161860-nicole,5,"Astronaut Mike Mullane poured his heart out on every page of ""Riding Rockets."" From the first line to the last I was on the edge of my seat flipping pages to see what he'd say next. It was an honor to share his joy and excitement, pain and frustration, and admiration and love for those with whom he worked alongside. I laughed, I cried, I recommended this book to everyone I've bumped into lately. A must-read if there ever was one.When I finished the book I took the time to write Col. Mullane a short note and within a day he replied. He encouraged me to ""Keep looking up"" and that's more or less the point of his book. To look up and be inspired, to reach for a goal, to see the good, the bad, and the ugly of anything and work even hard for a goal. "

Hopefully NASA has learnt a lot from the experience... and from people like Mike who’s lifted the lid on many taboo subjects and areas. Well worth a read even if you don’t like reading about space, astronauts, rockets, etc.!!!!"

However, the repeated glorification of sexist behaviour just didn't sit right with me. 2 interesting facts:- an astronaut has to pass 50 miles away from Earth to be considered officially an 'Astronaut'.- during the space shuttle program there was a potential landing site in Senegal so NASA sent someone to Senegal during launches to help with air traffic control as well as have the astronaut passports and visas should the emergency landing be required. "
50,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3181013-ashley-rayford,1,"I couldn’t get past 15% of this book. That 15% is riddled with sexism and cockiness. Mike seems to think that because he admits he was basically a sexist pig in the early days of his career at NASA, that we’d all like to go along with him while he recounts some of those tasteless jokes and behaviours. The beginning of this book read more like a guy who’s just been initiated into the most stereotypical fraternity than someone who has been accepted into NASA’s space shuttle program. I dread to think how the rest of it played out. Wasn’t worth it for me."

There are many things you never think about when you see news about space, and Mike's humor, his never-ending optimism, and literary style takes you through the complexities of flying into space and living in close quarters with a fellow crew in zero gravity, re-leaving his experiences and imagine the pictures he saw while watching the Earth moving under him."

In addition to copious amounts of humor (those easily offended need not read), Mullane provides a infrequently voiced perspective on the life of an astronaut, NASA, and the burden of the astronaut lifestyle on family. While potentially not a life-altering read, highly recommended for fun/thought provocation, and easily worth 4.5 stars."

58,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91449382-mindi,3,"(UPDATED) I'm glad I read a few reviews first and prepared myself for his sexism, crude jokes, and preoccupation with bowel function. Then again, he was a product of his time and possessed enough self-awareness to make it fairly comical. I appreciated his dry wit and unapologetic bluntness. But it was his love/hate relationship with his job that will stick with me. Like most kids in the 80s, I also wanted to be an astronaut. That dream was lost somewhere in my adolescence, but I still follow the current science and. Mike's career story includes graphic details of a department fraught with dysfunction...which is to say, it was just like any other job. Yes, he got to see the Earth from space and will forever have those memories and bragging rights, but when he wasn't strapped to a rocket or floating in space, he was drowning in drama, favoritism, politics, and disappointment. All in all, his book was a good read/listen (I switched from PB to audio early-on), but I probably wouldn't reach for it again."

Although the stories are fun and amusing there isa counterpoint of stress with and undercurrent of anxiety and grief; Mike knew the members of the Challenge and Discovery disasters.Although fascinating, this is not a fast read: a burst here, a single story there; it took me two-ish weeks to get through it."

That’s Mike Mullane. Mullane makes the average reader cringe on a nearly-every-chapter basis. Seemingly self-aware in hindsight, honest, inappropriate and juvenile, yet always heartfelt. I enjoyed this book immensely.Note: I found this book after researching Judy Resnick, who deserves a worthy biography."
61,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23362951-sherryl,4,It was certainly a trip reading about the 'space cowboys' of yesteryear.

67,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13174155-clay-davis,5,A great autobiography of an astronaut. I learned and was entertained by this book. I found out a lot about how N.A.S.A. works and how it doesn't.
68,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106571581-sean-mobley,4,"Riding Rockets tells the story of former NASA astronaut Mike Mullane’s selection for, training on, and missions during the space shuttle program. In it, Mike is remarkably frank about so much, from his opinions about NASA leadership during his tenure to the terror and sometimes physical pain surrounding space travel to, perhaps most revealing, his personal journey from arrogant, sexist dinosaur to someone who is still a relic of his time but also has a more full understanding of the hardships faced by women and minorities in the space program.Autobiographies can be tough, because this is a person’s chance to share their version of a story, and often they tell the stories that make them look the best. Mullane is not afraid to make himself look a fool or dive into the inner workings of the male-dominated, male-centric world he emerged from. This book strips a lot of the varnish from the space program, so if you’re going into this hoping to keep all your heroes intact then you’ll be disappointed. I certainly came away with food for thought on people and parts of the NASA shuttle program that I hadn’t really challenged before. Perhaps the best praise I can give any history book is that it made me curious to learn more, in this case to research some of the points he made and see if others felt the same way he did (which is very far from the rosy portrait of NASA unity that the public gets).Mullane several times laments that right-brained engineers are the ones telling a lot of the space stories, implying that they fail to capture in words the beauty of their experience in the way a poet might. Sure, he’s no poet, but he is a fine writer, and his vivid language brings you right along for the ride. Mullane tells you up-front what he’s all about, and you can tell from the very first chapter that this book is rated PG-13 at a minimum. As I said before, he is brutally honest about his archaic views towards the women he worked with. I’ve read a review of someone who got to the first hints of that and got disgusted with this “sexist pig” and stopped reading. It’s unfortunate that person chose to stop, because they clearly only read the first few pages and missed the entire evolution of this person as he came to understand the obstacles that a world that was designed to lift him up as a white male put in the place of just about everyone else, and came to respect the ambitions and skills and depth of the women and people of color who joined him in the first shuttle astronaut class. While his views and language never elevates itself to a place that I personally would consider fully worth celebrating (indeed in the last third of the book, I felt myself joining Mullane’s wife when she would ask him “when are you going to grow up?”) as a historian I see so much value in this story. If you’re going to read a history book, any history book, and expect it to live your values and beliefs, you’re going to end up with an extremely shallow view of history. Heck, Margaret Sanger believed in sterilizing poor women. You can take that out of it’s context too, or you can learn about Margaret and the world around her to understand why she believed that. That's the whole point of reading about history: you're not sitting here saying, ""Yes, they were so right back then!"" You're saying, ""Yes, I want to learn about someone else's view of the world."" You gotta take the good with the bad. I rate books based on how eager I am to re-read them. This one comes in at 4-stars, meaning I am excited to reread it at some point in the future. This is one of the best astronaut biographies I’ve read, and I highly recommend it for people interested in this take on the Shuttle era, with the caveat that if you are going to get turned off by some of the more gross aspects of being an astronaut, or Mullane’s retelling of the crass comments he and many of the men in his class made about women, then seek safer options."
69,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9209104-amita,3,"The actual stories and discussion about NASA during the peak Shuttle launch era were really interesting. I loved learning about the dynamic between the leadership and the astronauts - it's a side of the glamorous NASA life you don't hear much. I also loved hearing about the training, the space flights, the camaraderie, and the awkward/crazy press tours. It's when we get into the antics of the ""Arrested Development Crowd,"" that I get a little torn. I like hearing all the craziness they got up to, but I hate that it's presented as some sort of bygone, halcyon era of good times and no one knows how to have fun anymore. Therein lies my biggest issue with the book: I wanted so much to like this guy. But he comes off arrogant and selfish and juvenile, all while claiming that at least he's self-aware and that's better than ignorance. The disdain he had for some of his fellow crew was obvious, despite his repeated efforts to claim that he learned his lesson and he really does value them now. He recognizes and apologizes for the fact that he was probably a pretty shitty father and husband while he was chasing his dream, but he also tries to spin it as a virtue of his wife that she dealt with it. ""I was terrible, but isn't my wife great for never nagging me? That's the lesson here - have a really awesome wife!"" The number of times he prefaces whatever hilarious anecdote he wanted to tell with ""politically correct"" or ""Arrested Development Crowd"" or ""misogynistic"" proves he's aware enough to know something is probably inappropriate, but he just doesn't care. ""Listen to this hilarious thing I said once! Oh I know, I'm such an asshole - but I KNOW that, so it's fine, right?""I know this book isn't about a dude who grew up in the 50s learning how to be a more socially-aware person, so I tried not to focus on it in deciding how I felt about the book. I would dutifully ignore the juvenile comments and focus on the underlying story, and then he'd say something just so frustrating that it would pull me out of the book. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the NASA parts of this story. And he's a great story-teller. But it mostly just made me want to read an astronaut memoir from someone else entirely."
70,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"I'm of two minds about this book.On the one hand, Mullane provides a fast-paced and entertaining view of the early years of the Space Shuttle program, giving us outsiders a view into the selection process, training, the politics and mismanaged administration of the Astronaut Office, the astronauts' intense drive, work ethic, and also their utter fear of what the Shuttle could do to them, fuelled by the seeming complacency of NASA management toward astronaut safety. He is brutally honest about the discomforts and indignities of space travel, and about his frustrations with the way astronauts were treated by management.On the other hand, he paints himself as an old-school chauvinist jock who came to NASA with deep Air Force experience (including in Vietnam) and immense personal drive, but a kind of psychological immaturity that made it hard for him to work in the non-military world. This makes major parts of his memoir cringe-worthy. The pranks, sexual innuendo directed at the female astronaut candidates, dismissal of non-military and ""part-time"" astronauts, and endless discussion of bodily functions, were tough for me to read. I certainly didn't expect to read so much about his penis, nor can I imagine how his wife, who comes across as a very traditional woman, consented to have her sex life with her husband described over and over again. His tribute to his close friend Judy Reznik, who died in the Challenger explosion, is dulled by his constant references to her appearance and his physical attraction to her. By the end of the book he comes to recognize how his initial attitudes were wrong, but the reader can't help but sympathize with the people (especially the women) who were the target of his disdain or prejudice. All in all I think this is a book worth reading for anyone interested in the Space Shuttle program, giving a great inside look at the forces (good and bad) motivating the astronauts and their management. At the same time, it dispels any notions one might have about astronauts as superhuman figures with noble motivations and impeccable character. The scene in which veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (of Gemini and Apollo fame) shakes his head at Mullane's pranks and drunken tomfoolery is telling. A slice of life, as it were."
71,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903375-gwen,3,"I like space. Never had a desire to be an astronaut, but I've always loved stars and NASA and all the work that goes into sending people up. So of course I picked this up when I visited the Johnson Space Center.Parts of this were good, parts of it were bad. But ultimately, once I finished reading about his first space flight (which, honestly, I expected to be more than a chapter) I was done. And what turned me away was Mullane himself. No doubt about it, he's a misogynist. He applauded himself on the back several times for not sleeping with a co-worker. Turned himself into a hero because of it. Never mind he was married, had kids, or hell, managed to get into space. Restraint was his greatest achievement! But he never thought it wrong. Never stopped thinking it. And all his other comments about looking down on those not in the military. On seeing beautiful women as threats because they could sleep around and get a leg up. Hell, he actively says that the only reason he became an astronaut was because he didn't have to be involved in the household. Chores, kids, shopping - his wife did everything so he had nothing to get in the way of his career. For. Ever. He acknowledges this only once, and was a jerk to her most of the time. (Can you say privileged?)I got to the point of the book where he'd been in space and then stopped reading because I realized if I ever meet Mullane in real life I'd turn on my heel and walk the other way.Parts of this I did like. The understanding of the inner politics of NASA and astronaut assignments. The stress Mullane's wife went through watch failed launch after failed launch. His slight growth towards seeing the feminist/civilian light, understanding their struggles and worth. (though really, seeing worth in everyone should be expected, not worthy of ten gold stars). The small moments of how it felt to hit 50 miles and officially become an astronaut, watching day come over the earth.They just weren't enough to pull me to finish the book."
72,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"This was a great memoir from start to finish. The glory and folly of the post-Apollo space age. Seen through the eyes of one of the most politically incorrect astronauts ever. This actually got me excited about the Space Shuttle era - something I would not of thought possible.The right stuff: astronaut autobiographies from Glenn to HadfieldAn enduring image of an ‘astronaut’ was created for the public by NASA, Time magazine, and Tom Woolf’s The Right Stuff. These caricatures of the original seven American astronauts, the so-called Mercury-7, chosen to assert American supremacy over the communist threat of Sputnik have seemingly endured way past their use by date. A resurgence in interest in ‘astronauts’ was made almost single-handedly in the English speaking world by the Canadian Colonel Chris Hadfield. His much publicised exploits, through the media of YouTube, as commander of expedition 35 aboard the International Space Station made obvious a change from May 5, 1961 when Alan Shepherd rode Freedom 7 into the history books.In his autobiographical An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, the now retired Hadfield provides one of the most readable and honest stories of his journey from being a glider in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in 1975 to commanding the international space Station in 2013 - after ‘only’ 21 years of astronaut training. He candidly describes the effort and training to get to being a modern astronauts - studying, practicing, learning, waiting, preparing for the worst - then being flexible enough to deal with the unexpected. What I liked is his can do approach as explained in his response to the 1969 Apollo 11moon landing and wanting to become an astronaut: I also knew, as did every other kid in Canada, that it was impossible. Astronauts were American. NASA only accepted applications from U.S citizens, and Canada didn’t even have a space agency. I was old enough to understand that getting ready wasn’t simply a matter of playing “space mission” with my brothers in our bunk beds, underneath a big National geographic poster of the Moon. But there was no program I could enroll in, no manual i could read, no one to ask. There was only one option, I decided. I had to imagine what an astronaut might do if he were 9 years old, then do exactly the same thing.His laconic, sometimes counter-intuitive advise is always presented with a wealth of evidence to support his lesson. His Frank assessment of the impact of his dream on the rest of his family make a good reminder for all the corporate males who neglect family events for yet another sales meeting.Hadfield’s book is a great read and compares favorably with two of my other notable astronaut autobiographies.At the age of five I was devastated when my mum said to me that I could not become an astronaut. She dashed my probably overly enthusiastic boyish exuberance regarding space exploration explaining that I would need to be both American and a military pilot. Despite this early reality check, and taking a different path to Hadfield, I followed the Apollo program with enthusiasm - racing home from primary school to watch the historic moon-walk of Armstrong and Aldrin.Of those Apollo 11 voyagers only Michael Collins put pen to paper to capture his journeys as an astronaut in the vivid and captivating Carrying the Fire. Collins displays a fine writing style and wry sense of humor. He wrote from an earlier time than Hadfield. Collins was part of the “Apollo fourteen”, the third group of astronauts, after being unsuccessful for selection in the second group, the “New Nine”.Collins adroitly describes his emergence as an astronaut, training for and flying on Gemini 10 with John Young and participating in the US’s third “space walk”. Collins was originally picked as part of the Apollo 8 crew. He was replaced by Jim Lovell when a bone spur was discovered on his spine, requiring surgery. He relates his feelings at losing this opportunity, Apollo 8 became the bold second manned Apollo flight all the way to circle the Moon, and then gaining his place in history as the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 11. Other books from this era that deserve a mention are Deke Slayton’s Deke and John Glenn’s A Memoir. Both of these were of the Mercury 7. Glenn’s memoir is so straight that it strains the reader’s credulity. Extraordinarily enough it is all John Glenn - astronaut, married family man, US Senator - it is definitely one of an uncomplicated patriotic kind. Slayton was different, grounded with a heart irregularity and instead of flying became the first Chief of the Astronaut Corps and selected the crews who flew Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions. His book, written as he was dying from cancer, covers the full space race period up to his retirement post the start of the Space Shuttle era.Other books of note are books by Eugene Cernan The Last Man on the Moon, and John Young’s Forever Young.My third must read astronaut autobiography though is Mike Mullane’s Riding Rockets.This in my mind is a minor classic, again so different to both Collins and Hadfield. Mullane was part of the Space Shuttle generation of astronauts, the 1978 class of TFNGs (the Thirty Five New Guys), a group that included the first female NASA astronauts. This book contains an emotional level and cadence not pictured in other first hand astronaut memoirs.Mullane, a self-confessed inhabitant from planet ‘arrested development’ shares his growing pains in recognising that women could be colleagues and brilliant astronauts at that. His brutally honest depiction of losing his friend Judy Resnik in the Challenger disaster due to NASA hubris. Mullane describes in vivid detail the subsequent appalling bureaucratic treatment of the family members who were present at the disastrous launch. His own experience prior to this when STS-27 suffered near catastrophic heat shield damage from launch damage makes this description all the more poignant.The whole fateful uncertainty of the Space Shuttle era, the “glory and the folly” of this remarkable era in human exploration of near space is wittily and cuttingly told. If you aren’t both amazed and angered in reading this memoir than I suggest you go back and read it again.http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "
73,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37078159-olesya,5,"I absolutely love the book. Mike’s passion for rockets and space is very inspiring. I loved that he didn’t camouflage the open sexism, that was a part of the culture he grew up with. I laughed out loud at his jokes, not so intelligent, yet I find it funny. There is a criticism of him of being never-grownup-teenager with all that comes with it, and that’s exactly what I find the super attractive in this book. While I believe in passionate librarian or accountant (being one myself), it takes completely different personality to conquer the space. Lots of teenage behaviour, as absence of some internal “breaks”, or “normality”. I think some people just judge it as unacceptable. Mike is very smart. He gave a very interesting insight of NASA’s day to day life. It’s impossible to read this book, and not wanting to know more about the history and the future of the space program. "
74,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81189160-ashley,4,"After reading some of the lower star reviews on this book, I can understand why some readers may feel gypped - yes, it is about spaceflight and written by an astronaut.However, for those reviewers that love to point out how childish and inappropriate some of his stories are, might I point you to the lead-in phrase of the title: ""The OUTRAGEOUS TALES of a Space Shuttle Astronaut."" I would also like to point them towards all of the sections describing his VERY SERIOUS and PROFESSIONAL work mates also acting in the same immature manner throughout the ENTIRE book. I think what these reviewers are experiencing is a disconnect between the way in which astronauts are seen professionally and the way in which they actually function on a personal level - the same as everyone else. Yes! Astronauts are humans! They are not robots! Who knew?!"
75,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877351-jen,3,"I struggled with this rating. Based on his book, Mike Mullane is an asshole who I doubt I could or would want to hold down a conversation with. He seemed to glory in being a misogynistic pig and it was all okay because eventually he figured out that women and PHd candidates were just as qualified as his military background self to be an astronaut. And, because he thanked his poor wife and mother. This attitude came up over and over and I nearly growled out loud each time in disgust and frustration. But, he did a good job of relating a very technical thing in terms that were understandable. It was an engaging book about an interesting topic. Stuck between giving this 2 or 3 stars and ended up appreciating the value it did impart but could not particularly recommend it to anyone."
76,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37844348-jes,3,"This is a book written by a dude in Texas and it sure does sound like it, speaking as a native Texan myself. The first half of the book, I was still getting used to the fact that NASA used to be hella racist and sexist. I did NOT appreciate any of Mike's commentary on women, his wife, his coworkers, whatsoever. This man does not have a clue how to talk to a woman and I bet he was rewarded for it his whole life. My contempt aside, there were some pretty great stories in here. Mike also did learn a thing or two about women in space, but not nearly enough.This book is enjoyable if you can get beyond the sexism.I recommend to Texan readers, men with similar ideologies and love a tall tale, and for space enthusiasts willing to sit through sexism."
77,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93161860-nicole,5,"Astronaut Mike Mullane poured his heart out on every page of ""Riding Rockets."" From the first line to the last I was on the edge of my seat flipping pages to see what he'd say next. It was an honor to share his joy and excitement, pain and frustration, and admiration and love for those with whom he worked alongside. I laughed, I cried, I recommended this book to everyone I've bumped into lately. A must-read if there ever was one.When I finished the book I took the time to write Col. Mullane a short note and within a day he replied. He encouraged me to ""Keep looking up"" and that's more or less the point of his book. To look up and be inspired, to reach for a goal, to see the good, the bad, and the ugly of anything and work even hard for a goal. "
78,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70994537-john-armstrong,4,"There were certain things I didn’t like about Mike Mullane (some of the things he did, his attitudes towards certain things, etc.), but that aside I really enjoyed reading this book and the insights into what was a crazy world and how the whole Space Shuttle idea was basically mental and fundamentally flawed. Hopefully NASA has learnt a lot from the experience... and from people like Mike who’s lifted the lid on many taboo subjects and areas. Well worth a read even if you don’t like reading about space, astronauts, rockets, etc.!!!!"
79,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29804629-sharen,3,"I love books about the space program and found the specifics regarding training and missions interesting. However, the repeated glorification of sexist behaviour just didn't sit right with me. 2 interesting facts:- an astronaut has to pass 50 miles away from Earth to be considered officially an 'Astronaut'.- during the space shuttle program there was a potential landing site in Senegal so NASA sent someone to Senegal during launches to help with air traffic control as well as have the astronaut passports and visas should the emergency landing be required. "
80,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3181013-ashley-rayford,1,"I couldn’t get past 15% of this book. That 15% is riddled with sexism and cockiness. Mike seems to think that because he admits he was basically a sexist pig in the early days of his career at NASA, that we’d all like to go along with him while he recounts some of those tasteless jokes and behaviours. The beginning of this book read more like a guy who’s just been initiated into the most stereotypical fraternity than someone who has been accepted into NASA’s space shuttle program. I dread to think how the rest of it played out. Wasn’t worth it for me."
81,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4222871-dmytro-shteflyuk,5,"An insightful and inspirational story about the space flight by an astronaut Mike Mullane. There are many things you never think about when you see news about space, and Mike's humor, his never-ending optimism, and literary style takes you through the complexities of flying into space and living in close quarters with a fellow crew in zero gravity, re-leaving his experiences and imagine the pictures he saw while watching the Earth moving under him."
82,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105621986-nicholas-lanoue,4,"A thoroughly entertaining read for anyone interested in the history of the Shuttle program, military aviation, or general 1960s-1980s debauchery. In addition to copious amounts of humor (those easily offended need not read), Mullane provides a infrequently voiced perspective on the life of an astronaut, NASA, and the burden of the astronaut lifestyle on family. While potentially not a life-altering read, highly recommended for fun/thought provocation, and easily worth 4.5 stars."

While he freely admits to being sexist, its still tough to read his impressions and feelings toward his female colleagues."
84,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7304211-mike,5,"Hilarious! HOWEVER, if you like political correctness, this one may not be for you.

85,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86070504-mac,5,"My absolute favourite astronaut book of all time. It is emotional, hilarious and thought provoking. I have recommended this book to nearly everyone I know and resorted to threats to make them read it. I have read it at least twice and will always come back to it when in need of a great read. Thank you, Mike, for all the lessons and laughs."

Mike gives a great insight and behind-the-scenes feel. He comes from a great family, and learning about his childhood was amazing too. You can see how you can come from coffee can rockets to the Apollo. "

This book is awesomely funny, but also gives a great insight on the questions, issues and pressures that were around being someone that is going to space aboard the Shuttle.A great read for anybody interested in human spaceflight."
88,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91449382-mindi,3,"(UPDATED) I'm glad I read a few reviews first and prepared myself for his sexism, crude jokes, and preoccupation with bowel function. Then again, he was a product of his time and possessed enough self-awareness to make it fairly comical. I appreciated his dry wit and unapologetic bluntness. But it was his love/hate relationship with his job that will stick with me. Like most kids in the 80s, I also wanted to be an astronaut. That dream was lost somewhere in my adolescence, but I still follow the current science and. Mike's career story includes graphic details of a department fraught with dysfunction...which is to say, it was just like any other job. Yes, he got to see the Earth from space and will forever have those memories and bragging rights, but when he wasn't strapped to a rocket or floating in space, he was drowning in drama, favoritism, politics, and disappointment. All in all, his book was a good read/listen (I switched from PB to audio early-on), but I probably wouldn't reach for it again."
89,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22472445-toby-martin,3,"Mike Mullane is a great raconteur. Although the stories are fun and amusing there isa counterpoint of stress with and undercurrent of anxiety and grief; Mike knew the members of the Challenge and Discovery disasters.Although fascinating, this is not a fast read: a burst here, a single story there; it took me two-ish weeks to get through it."

That’s Mike Mullane. Mullane makes the average reader cringe on a nearly-every-chapter basis. Seemingly self-aware in hindsight, honest, inappropriate and juvenile, yet always heartfelt. I enjoyed this book immensely.Note: I found this book after researching Judy Resnick, who deserves a worthy biography."
91,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23362951-sherryl,4,It was certainly a trip reading about the 'space cowboys' of yesteryear. Mike Mullane certainly has a way with relating his trips to orbit to us earth-bound souls. The imagery invoked in his descriptions of his time in space are beautifully written and makes one almost feel as though we were with him.
92,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8848209-scott-kardel,4,"I am a big fan of astronaut autobiographies and Mike Mullane's Riding Rockets is a good one, giving an honest (and often uncensored) look at his life and career as a Space Shuttle astronaut. Mullane vividly describes the stress of crew selection, very real fear of riding in a shuttle, the majesty of seeing Earth from space and the crazy antics that took place in the astronaut office in the 1980s."

95,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11776206-sheryl-sato,5,"Loved this book. Recommended by Mary Roach as the one book written by an astronaut which should be read, this book is a journey into space multiple times, along with many interesting facts and opinions about the space age during the 70s and 80s. An epic journey and thoroughly entertaining."

97,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13174155-clay-davis,5,A great autobiography of an astronaut. I learned and was entertained by this book. I found out a lot about how N.A.S.A. works and how it doesn't.
98,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106571581-sean-mobley,4,"Riding Rockets tells the story of former NASA astronaut Mike Mullane’s selection for, training on, and missions during the space shuttle program. In it, Mike is remarkably frank about so much, from his opinions about NASA leadership during his tenure to the terror and sometimes physical pain surrounding space travel to, perhaps most revealing, his personal journey from arrogant, sexist dinosaur to someone who is still a relic of his time but also has a more full understanding of the hardships faced by women and minorities in the space program.Autobiographies can be tough, because this is a person’s chance to share their version of a story, and often they tell the stories that make them look the best. Mullane is not afraid to make himself look a fool or dive into the inner workings of the male-dominated, male-centric world he emerged from. This book strips a lot of the varnish from the space program, so if you’re going into this hoping to keep all your heroes intact then you’ll be disappointed. I certainly came away with food for thought on people and parts of the NASA shuttle program that I hadn’t really challenged before. Perhaps the best praise I can give any history book is that it made me curious to learn more, in this case to research some of the points he made and see if others felt the same way he did (which is very far from the rosy portrait of NASA unity that the public gets).Mullane several times laments that right-brained engineers are the ones telling a lot of the space stories, implying that they fail to capture in words the beauty of their experience in the way a poet might. Sure, he’s no poet, but he is a fine writer, and his vivid language brings you right along for the ride. Mullane tells you up-front what he’s all about, and you can tell from the very first chapter that this book is rated PG-13 at a minimum. As I said before, he is brutally honest about his archaic views towards the women he worked with. I’ve read a review of someone who got to the first hints of that and got disgusted with this “sexist pig” and stopped reading. It’s unfortunate that person chose to stop, because they clearly only read the first few pages and missed the entire evolution of this person as he came to understand the obstacles that a world that was designed to lift him up as a white male put in the place of just about everyone else, and came to respect the ambitions and skills and depth of the women and people of color who joined him in the first shuttle astronaut class. While his views and language never elevates itself to a place that I personally would consider fully worth celebrating (indeed in the last third of the book, I felt myself joining Mullane’s wife when she would ask him “when are you going to grow up?”) as a historian I see so much value in this story. If you’re going to read a history book, any history book, and expect it to live your values and beliefs, you’re going to end up with an extremely shallow view of history. Heck, Margaret Sanger believed in sterilizing poor women. You can take that out of it’s context too, or you can learn about Margaret and the world around her to understand why she believed that. That's the whole point of reading about history: you're not sitting here saying, ""Yes, they were so right back then!"" You're saying, ""Yes, I want to learn about someone else's view of the world."" You gotta take the good with the bad. I rate books based on how eager I am to re-read them. This one comes in at 4-stars, meaning I am excited to reread it at some point in the future. This is one of the best astronaut biographies I’ve read, and I highly recommend it for people interested in this take on the Shuttle era, with the caveat that if you are going to get turned off by some of the more gross aspects of being an astronaut, or Mullane’s retelling of the crass comments he and many of the men in his class made about women, then seek safer options."
99,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9209104-amita,3,"The actual stories and discussion about NASA during the peak Shuttle launch era were really interesting. I loved learning about the dynamic between the leadership and the astronauts - it's a side of the glamorous NASA life you don't hear much. I also loved hearing about the training, the space flights, the camaraderie, and the awkward/crazy press tours. It's when we get into the antics of the ""Arrested Development Crowd,"" that I get a little torn. I like hearing all the craziness they got up to, but I hate that it's presented as some sort of bygone, halcyon era of good times and no one knows how to have fun anymore. Therein lies my biggest issue with the book: I wanted so much to like this guy. But he comes off arrogant and selfish and juvenile, all while claiming that at least he's self-aware and that's better than ignorance. The disdain he had for some of his fellow crew was obvious, despite his repeated efforts to claim that he learned his lesson and he really does value them now. He recognizes and apologizes for the fact that he was probably a pretty shitty father and husband while he was chasing his dream, but he also tries to spin it as a virtue of his wife that she dealt with it. ""I was terrible, but isn't my wife great for never nagging me? That's the lesson here - have a really awesome wife!"" The number of times he prefaces whatever hilarious anecdote he wanted to tell with ""politically correct"" or ""Arrested Development Crowd"" or ""misogynistic"" proves he's aware enough to know something is probably inappropriate, but he just doesn't care. ""Listen to this hilarious thing I said once! Oh I know, I'm such an asshole - but I KNOW that, so it's fine, right?""I know this book isn't about a dude who grew up in the 50s learning how to be a more socially-aware person, so I tried not to focus on it in deciding how I felt about the book. I would dutifully ignore the juvenile comments and focus on the underlying story, and then he'd say something just so frustrating that it would pull me out of the book. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the NASA parts of this story. And he's a great story-teller. But it mostly just made me want to read an astronaut memoir from someone else entirely."
100,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"I'm of two minds about this book.On the one hand, Mullane provides a fast-paced and entertaining view of the early years of the Space Shuttle program, giving us outsiders a view into the selection process, training, the politics and mismanaged administration of the Astronaut Office, the astronauts' intense drive, work ethic, and also their utter fear of what the Shuttle could do to them, fuelled by the seeming complacency of NASA management toward astronaut safety. He is brutally honest about the discomforts and indignities of space travel, and about his frustrations with the way astronauts were treated by management.On the other hand, he paints himself as an old-school chauvinist jock who came to NASA with deep Air Force experience (including in Vietnam) and immense personal drive, but a kind of psychological immaturity that made it hard for him to work in the non-military world. This makes major parts of his memoir cringe-worthy. The pranks, sexual innuendo directed at the female astronaut candidates, dismissal of non-military and ""part-time"" astronauts, and endless discussion of bodily functions, were tough for me to read. I certainly didn't expect to read so much about his penis, nor can I imagine how his wife, who comes across as a very traditional woman, consented to have her sex life with her husband described over and over again. His tribute to his close friend Judy Reznik, who died in the Challenger explosion, is dulled by his constant references to her appearance and his physical attraction to her. By the end of the book he comes to recognize how his initial attitudes were wrong, but the reader can't help but sympathize with the people (especially the women) who were the target of his disdain or prejudice. All in all I think this is a book worth reading for anyone interested in the Space Shuttle program, giving a great inside look at the forces (good and bad) motivating the astronauts and their management. At the same time, it dispels any notions one might have about astronauts as superhuman figures with noble motivations and impeccable character. The scene in which veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (of Gemini and Apollo fame) shakes his head at Mullane's pranks and drunken tomfoolery is telling. A slice of life, as it were."
101,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903375-gwen,3,"I like space. Never had a desire to be an astronaut, but I've always loved stars and NASA and all the work that goes into sending people up. So of course I picked this up when I visited the Johnson Space Center.Parts of this were good, parts of it were bad. But ultimately, once I finished reading about his first space flight (which, honestly, I expected to be more than a chapter) I was done. And what turned me away was Mullane himself. No doubt about it, he's a misogynist. He applauded himself on the back several times for not sleeping with a co-worker. Turned himself into a hero because of it. Never mind he was married, had kids, or hell, managed to get into space. Restraint was his greatest achievement! But he never thought it wrong. Never stopped thinking it. And all his other comments about looking down on those not in the military. On seeing beautiful women as threats because they could sleep around and get a leg up. Hell, he actively says that the only reason he became an astronaut was because he didn't have to be involved in the household. Chores, kids, shopping - his wife did everything so he had nothing to get in the way of his career. For. Ever. He acknowledges this only once, and was a jerk to her most of the time. (Can you say privileged?)I got to the point of the book where he'd been in space and then stopped reading because I realized if I ever meet Mullane in real life I'd turn on my heel and walk the other way.Parts of this I did like. The understanding of the inner politics of NASA and astronaut assignments. The stress Mullane's wife went through watch failed launch after failed launch. His slight growth towards seeing the feminist/civilian light, understanding their struggles and worth. (though really, seeing worth in everyone should be expected, not worthy of ten gold stars). The small moments of how it felt to hit 50 miles and officially become an astronaut, watching day come over the earth.They just weren't enough to pull me to finish the book."
102,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"This was a great memoir from start to finish. The glory and folly of the post-Apollo space age. Seen through the eyes of one of the most politically incorrect astronauts ever. This actually got me excited about the Space Shuttle era - something I would not of thought possible.The right stuff: astronaut autobiographies from Glenn to HadfieldAn enduring image of an ‘astronaut’ was created for the public by NASA, Time magazine, and Tom Woolf’s The Right Stuff. These caricatures of the original seven American astronauts, the so-called Mercury-7, chosen to assert American supremacy over the communist threat of Sputnik have seemingly endured way past their use by date. A resurgence in interest in ‘astronauts’ was made almost single-handedly in the English speaking world by the Canadian Colonel Chris Hadfield. His much publicised exploits, through the media of YouTube, as commander of expedition 35 aboard the International Space Station made obvious a change from May 5, 1961 when Alan Shepherd rode Freedom 7 into the history books.In his autobiographical An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, the now retired Hadfield provides one of the most readable and honest stories of his journey from being a glider in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in 1975 to commanding the international space Station in 2013 - after ‘only’ 21 years of astronaut training. He candidly describes the effort and training to get to being a modern astronauts - studying, practicing, learning, waiting, preparing for the worst - then being flexible enough to deal with the unexpected. What I liked is his can do approach as explained in his response to the 1969 Apollo 11moon landing and wanting to become an astronaut: I also knew, as did every other kid in Canada, that it was impossible. Astronauts were American. NASA only accepted applications from U.S citizens, and Canada didn’t even have a space agency. I was old enough to understand that getting ready wasn’t simply a matter of playing “space mission” with my brothers in our bunk beds, underneath a big National geographic poster of the Moon. But there was no program I could enroll in, no manual i could read, no one to ask. There was only one option, I decided. I had to imagine what an astronaut might do if he were 9 years old, then do exactly the same thing.His laconic, sometimes counter-intuitive advise is always presented with a wealth of evidence to support his lesson. His Frank assessment of the impact of his dream on the rest of his family make a good reminder for all the corporate males who neglect family events for yet another sales meeting.Hadfield’s book is a great read and compares favorably with two of my other notable astronaut autobiographies.At the age of five I was devastated when my mum said to me that I could not become an astronaut. She dashed my probably overly enthusiastic boyish exuberance regarding space exploration explaining that I would need to be both American and a military pilot. Despite this early reality check, and taking a different path to Hadfield, I followed the Apollo program with enthusiasm - racing home from primary school to watch the historic moon-walk of Armstrong and Aldrin.Of those Apollo 11 voyagers only Michael Collins put pen to paper to capture his journeys as an astronaut in the vivid and captivating Carrying the Fire. Collins displays a fine writing style and wry sense of humor. He wrote from an earlier time than Hadfield. Collins was part of the “Apollo fourteen”, the third group of astronauts, after being unsuccessful for selection in the second group, the “New Nine”.Collins adroitly describes his emergence as an astronaut, training for and flying on Gemini 10 with John Young and participating in the US’s third “space walk”. Collins was originally picked as part of the Apollo 8 crew. He was replaced by Jim Lovell when a bone spur was discovered on his spine, requiring surgery. He relates his feelings at losing this opportunity, Apollo 8 became the bold second manned Apollo flight all the way to circle the Moon, and then gaining his place in history as the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 11. Other books from this era that deserve a mention are Deke Slayton’s Deke and John Glenn’s A Memoir. Both of these were of the Mercury 7. Glenn’s memoir is so straight that it strains the reader’s credulity. Extraordinarily enough it is all John Glenn - astronaut, married family man, US Senator - it is definitely one of an uncomplicated patriotic kind. Slayton was different, grounded with a heart irregularity and instead of flying became the first Chief of the Astronaut Corps and selected the crews who flew Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions. His book, written as he was dying from cancer, covers the full space race period up to his retirement post the start of the Space Shuttle era.Other books of note are books by Eugene Cernan The Last Man on the Moon, and John Young’s Forever Young.My third must read astronaut autobiography though is Mike Mullane’s Riding Rockets.This in my mind is a minor classic, again so different to both Collins and Hadfield. Mullane was part of the Space Shuttle generation of astronauts, the 1978 class of TFNGs (the Thirty Five New Guys), a group that included the first female NASA astronauts. This book contains an emotional level and cadence not pictured in other first hand astronaut memoirs.Mullane, a self-confessed inhabitant from planet ‘arrested development’ shares his growing pains in recognising that women could be colleagues and brilliant astronauts at that. His brutally honest depiction of losing his friend Judy Resnik in the Challenger disaster due to NASA hubris. Mullane describes in vivid detail the subsequent appalling bureaucratic treatment of the family members who were present at the disastrous launch. His own experience prior to this when STS-27 suffered near catastrophic heat shield damage from launch damage makes this description all the more poignant.The whole fateful uncertainty of the Space Shuttle era, the “glory and the folly” of this remarkable era in human exploration of near space is wittily and cuttingly told. If you aren’t both amazed and angered in reading this memoir than I suggest you go back and read it again.http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "
103,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37078159-olesya,5,"I absolutely love the book. Mike’s passion for rockets and space is very inspiring. I loved that he didn’t camouflage the open sexism, that was a part of the culture he grew up with. I laughed out loud at his jokes, not so intelligent, yet I find it funny. There is a criticism of him of being never-grownup-teenager with all that comes with it, and that’s exactly what I find the super attractive in this book. While I believe in passionate librarian or accountant (being one myself), it takes completely different personality to conquer the space. Lots of teenage behaviour, as absence of some internal “breaks”, or “normality”. I think some people just judge it as unacceptable. Mike is very smart. He gave a very interesting insight of NASA’s day to day life. It’s impossible to read this book, and not wanting to know more about the history and the future of the space program. "

I would also like to point them towards all of the sections describing his VERY SERIOUS and PROFESSIONAL work mates also acting in the same immature manner throughout the ENTIRE book. I think what these reviewers are experiencing is a disconnect between the way in which astronauts are seen professionally and the way in which they actually function on a personal level - the same as everyone else. Yes! Astronauts are humans! They are not robots! Who knew?!"
105,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877351-jen,3,"I struggled with this rating. Based on his book, Mike Mullane is an asshole who I doubt I could or would want to hold down a conversation with. He seemed to glory in being a misogynistic pig and it was all okay because eventually he figured out that women and PHd candidates were just as qualified as his military background self to be an astronaut. And, because he thanked his poor wife and mother. This attitude came up over and over and I nearly growled out loud each time in disgust and frustration. But, he did a good job of relating a very technical thing in terms that were understandable. It was an engaging book about an interesting topic. Stuck between giving this 2 or 3 stars and ended up appreciating the value it did impart but could not particularly recommend it to anyone."

The first half of the book, I was still getting used to the fact that NASA used to be hella racist and sexist. I did NOT appreciate any of Mike's commentary on women, his wife, his coworkers, whatsoever. This man does not have a clue how to talk to a woman and I bet he was rewarded for it his whole life. My contempt aside, there were some pretty great stories in here. Mike also did learn a thing or two about women in space, but not nearly enough.This book is enjoyable if you can get beyond the sexism.I recommend to Texan readers, men with similar ideologies and love a tall tale, and for space enthusiasts willing to sit through sexism."

From the first line to the last I was on the edge of my seat flipping pages to see what he'd say next. It was an honor to share his joy and excitement, pain and frustration, and admiration and love for those with whom he worked alongside. I laughed, I cried, I recommended this book to everyone I've bumped into lately. A must-read if there ever was one.When I finished the book I took the time to write Col. Mullane a short note and within a day he replied. He encouraged me to ""Keep looking up"" and that's more or less the point of his book. To look up and be inspired, to reach for a goal, to see the good, the bad, and the ugly of anything and work even hard for a goal. "

Hopefully NASA has learnt a lot from the experience... and from people like Mike who’s lifted the lid on many taboo subjects and areas.

Mike seems to think that because he admits he was basically a sexist pig in the early days of his career at NASA, that we’d all like to go along with him while he recounts some of those tasteless jokes and behaviours. The beginning of this book read more like a guy who’s just been initiated into the most stereotypical fraternity than someone who has been accepted into NASA’s space shuttle program. I dread to think how the rest of it played out. Wasn’t worth it for me."

There are many things you never think about when you see news about space, and Mike's humor, his never-ending optimism, and literary style takes you through the complexities of flying into space and living in close quarters with a fellow crew in zero gravity, re-leaving his experiences and imagine the pictures he saw while watching the Earth moving under him."

In addition to copious amounts of humor (those easily offended need not read), Mullane provides a infrequently voiced perspective on the life of an astronaut, NASA, and the burden of the astronaut lifestyle on family.

Then again, he was a product of his time and possessed enough self-awareness to make it fairly comical. I appreciated his dry wit and unapologetic bluntness. But it was his love/hate relationship with his job that will stick with me. Like most kids in the 80s, I also wanted to be an astronaut. That dream was lost somewhere in my adolescence, but I still follow the current science and. Mike's career story includes graphic details of a department fraught with dysfunction...which is to say, it was just like any other job. Yes, he got to see the Earth from space and will forever have those memories and bragging rights, but when he wasn't strapped to a rocket or floating in space, he was drowning in drama, favoritism, politics, and disappointment. All in all, his book was a good read/listen (I switched from PB to audio early-on), but I probably wouldn't reach for it again."

127,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13174155-clay-davis,5,A great autobiography of an astronaut. I learned and was entertained by this book. I found out a lot about how N.A.S.A. works and how it doesn't.
128,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106571581-sean-mobley,4,"Riding Rockets tells the story of former NASA astronaut Mike Mullane’s selection for, training on, and missions during the space shuttle program. In it, Mike is remarkably frank about so much, from his opinions about NASA leadership during his tenure to the terror and sometimes physical pain surrounding space travel to, perhaps most revealing, his personal journey from arrogant, sexist dinosaur to someone who is still a relic of his time but also has a more full understanding of the hardships faced by women and minorities in the space program.Autobiographies can be tough, because this is a person’s chance to share their version of a story, and often they tell the stories that make them look the best. Mullane is not afraid to make himself look a fool or dive into the inner workings of the male-dominated, male-centric world he emerged from. This book strips a lot of the varnish from the space program, so if you’re going into this hoping to keep all your heroes intact then you’ll be disappointed. I certainly came away with food for thought on people and parts of the NASA shuttle program that I hadn’t really challenged before. Perhaps the best praise I can give any history book is that it made me curious to learn more, in this case to research some of the points he made and see if others felt the same way he did (which is very far from the rosy portrait of NASA unity that the public gets).Mullane several times laments that right-brained engineers are the ones telling a lot of the space stories, implying that they fail to capture in words the beauty of their experience in the way a poet might. Sure, he’s no poet, but he is a fine writer, and his vivid language brings you right along for the ride. Mullane tells you up-front what he’s all about, and you can tell from the very first chapter that this book is rated PG-13 at a minimum. As I said before, he is brutally honest about his archaic views towards the women he worked with. I’ve read a review of someone who got to the first hints of that and got disgusted with this “sexist pig” and stopped reading. It’s unfortunate that person chose to stop, because they clearly only read the first few pages and missed the entire evolution of this person as he came to understand the obstacles that a world that was designed to lift him up as a white male put in the place of just about everyone else, and came to respect the ambitions and skills and depth of the women and people of color who joined him in the first shuttle astronaut class. While his views and language never elevates itself to a place that I personally would consider fully worth celebrating (indeed in the last third of the book, I felt myself joining Mullane’s wife when she would ask him “when are you going to grow up?”) as a historian I see so much value in this story. If you’re going to read a history book, any history book, and expect it to live your values and beliefs, you’re going to end up with an extremely shallow view of history. Heck, Margaret Sanger believed in sterilizing poor women. You can take that out of it’s context too, or you can learn about Margaret and the world around her to understand why she believed that. That's the whole point of reading about history: you're not sitting here saying, ""Yes, they were so right back then!"" You're saying, ""Yes, I want to learn about someone else's view of the world."" You gotta take the good with the bad. I rate books based on how eager I am to re-read them. This one comes in at 4-stars, meaning I am excited to reread it at some point in the future. This is one of the best astronaut biographies I’ve read, and I highly recommend it for people interested in this take on the Shuttle era, with the caveat that if you are going to get turned off by some of the more gross aspects of being an astronaut, or Mullane’s retelling of the crass comments he and many of the men in his class made about women, then seek safer options."
129,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9209104-amita,3,"The actual stories and discussion about NASA during the peak Shuttle launch era were really interesting. I loved learning about the dynamic between the leadership and the astronauts - it's a side of the glamorous NASA life you don't hear much. I also loved hearing about the training, the space flights, the camaraderie, and the awkward/crazy press tours. It's when we get into the antics of the ""Arrested Development Crowd,"" that I get a little torn. I like hearing all the craziness they got up to, but I hate that it's presented as some sort of bygone, halcyon era of good times and no one knows how to have fun anymore. Therein lies my biggest issue with the book: I wanted so much to like this guy. But he comes off arrogant and selfish and juvenile, all while claiming that at least he's self-aware and that's better than ignorance. The disdain he had for some of his fellow crew was obvious, despite his repeated efforts to claim that he learned his lesson and he really does value them now. He recognizes and apologizes for the fact that he was probably a pretty shitty father and husband while he was chasing his dream, but he also tries to spin it as a virtue of his wife that she dealt with it. ""I was terrible, but isn't my wife great for never nagging me? That's the lesson here - have a really awesome wife!"" The number of times he prefaces whatever hilarious anecdote he wanted to tell with ""politically correct"" or ""Arrested Development Crowd"" or ""misogynistic"" proves he's aware enough to know something is probably inappropriate, but he just doesn't care. ""Listen to this hilarious thing I said once! Oh I know, I'm such an asshole - but I KNOW that, so it's fine, right?""I know this book isn't about a dude who grew up in the 50s learning how to be a more socially-aware person, so I tried not to focus on it in deciding how I felt about the book. I would dutifully ignore the juvenile comments and focus on the underlying story, and then he'd say something just so frustrating that it would pull me out of the book. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the NASA parts of this story. And he's a great story-teller. But it mostly just made me want to read an astronaut memoir from someone else entirely."
130,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"I'm of two minds about this book.On the one hand, Mullane provides a fast-paced and entertaining view of the early years of the Space Shuttle program, giving us outsiders a view into the selection process, training, the politics and mismanaged administration of the Astronaut Office, the astronauts' intense drive, work ethic, and also their utter fear of what the Shuttle could do to them, fuelled by the seeming complacency of NASA management toward astronaut safety. He is brutally honest about the discomforts and indignities of space travel, and about his frustrations with the way astronauts were treated by management.On the other hand, he paints himself as an old-school chauvinist jock who came to NASA with deep Air Force experience (including in Vietnam) and immense personal drive, but a kind of psychological immaturity that made it hard for him to work in the non-military world. This makes major parts of his memoir cringe-worthy. The pranks, sexual innuendo directed at the female astronaut candidates, dismissal of non-military and ""part-time"" astronauts, and endless discussion of bodily functions, were tough for me to read. I certainly didn't expect to read so much about his penis, nor can I imagine how his wife, who comes across as a very traditional woman, consented to have her sex life with her husband described over and over again. His tribute to his close friend Judy Reznik, who died in the Challenger explosion, is dulled by his constant references to her appearance and his physical attraction to her. By the end of the book he comes to recognize how his initial attitudes were wrong, but the reader can't help but sympathize with the people (especially the women) who were the target of his disdain or prejudice. All in all I think this is a book worth reading for anyone interested in the Space Shuttle program, giving a great inside look at the forces (good and bad) motivating the astronauts and their management. At the same time, it dispels any notions one might have about astronauts as superhuman figures with noble motivations and impeccable character. The scene in which veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (of Gemini and Apollo fame) shakes his head at Mullane's pranks and drunken tomfoolery is telling. A slice of life, as it were."
131,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903375-gwen,3,"I like space. Never had a desire to be an astronaut, but I've always loved stars and NASA and all the work that goes into sending people up. So of course I picked this up when I visited the Johnson Space Center.Parts of this were good, parts of it were bad. But ultimately, once I finished reading about his first space flight (which, honestly, I expected to be more than a chapter) I was done. And what turned me away was Mullane himself. No doubt about it, he's a misogynist. He applauded himself on the back several times for not sleeping with a co-worker. Turned himself into a hero because of it. Never mind he was married, had kids, or hell, managed to get into space. Restraint was his greatest achievement! But he never thought it wrong. Never stopped thinking it. And all his other comments about looking down on those not in the military. On seeing beautiful women as threats because they could sleep around and get a leg up. Hell, he actively says that the only reason he became an astronaut was because he didn't have to be involved in the household. Chores, kids, shopping - his wife did everything so he had nothing to get in the way of his career. For. Ever. He acknowledges this only once, and was a jerk to her most of the time. (Can you say privileged?)I got to the point of the book where he'd been in space and then stopped reading because I realized if I ever meet Mullane in real life I'd turn on my heel and walk the other way.Parts of this I did like. The understanding of the inner politics of NASA and astronaut assignments. The stress Mullane's wife went through watch failed launch after failed launch. His slight growth towards seeing the feminist/civilian light, understanding their struggles and worth. (though really, seeing worth in everyone should be expected, not worthy of ten gold stars). The small moments of how it felt to hit 50 miles and officially become an astronaut, watching day come over the earth.They just weren't enough to pull me to finish the book."
132,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"This was a great memoir from start to finish. The glory and folly of the post-Apollo space age. Seen through the eyes of one of the most politically incorrect astronauts ever. This actually got me excited about the Space Shuttle era - something I would not of thought possible.The right stuff: astronaut autobiographies from Glenn to HadfieldAn enduring image of an ‘astronaut’ was created for the public by NASA, Time magazine, and Tom Woolf’s The Right Stuff. These caricatures of the original seven American astronauts, the so-called Mercury-7, chosen to assert American supremacy over the communist threat of Sputnik have seemingly endured way past their use by date. A resurgence in interest in ‘astronauts’ was made almost single-handedly in the English speaking world by the Canadian Colonel Chris Hadfield. His much publicised exploits, through the media of YouTube, as commander of expedition 35 aboard the International Space Station made obvious a change from May 5, 1961 when Alan Shepherd rode Freedom 7 into the history books.In his autobiographical An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, the now retired Hadfield provides one of the most readable and honest stories of his journey from being a glider in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in 1975 to commanding the international space Station in 2013 - after ‘only’ 21 years of astronaut training. He candidly describes the effort and training to get to being a modern astronauts - studying, practicing, learning, waiting, preparing for the worst - then being flexible enough to deal with the unexpected. What I liked is his can do approach as explained in his response to the 1969 Apollo 11moon landing and wanting to become an astronaut: I also knew, as did every other kid in Canada, that it was impossible. Astronauts were American. NASA only accepted applications from U.S citizens, and Canada didn’t even have a space agency. I was old enough to understand that getting ready wasn’t simply a matter of playing “space mission” with my brothers in our bunk beds, underneath a big National geographic poster of the Moon. But there was no program I could enroll in, no manual i could read, no one to ask. There was only one option, I decided. I had to imagine what an astronaut might do if he were 9 years old, then do exactly the same thing.His laconic, sometimes counter-intuitive advise is always presented with a wealth of evidence to support his lesson. His Frank assessment of the impact of his dream on the rest of his family make a good reminder for all the corporate males who neglect family events for yet another sales meeting.Hadfield’s book is a great read and compares favorably with two of my other notable astronaut autobiographies.At the age of five I was devastated when my mum said to me that I could not become an astronaut. She dashed my probably overly enthusiastic boyish exuberance regarding space exploration explaining that I would need to be both American and a military pilot. Despite this early reality check, and taking a different path to Hadfield, I followed the Apollo program with enthusiasm - racing home from primary school to watch the historic moon-walk of Armstrong and Aldrin.Of those Apollo 11 voyagers only Michael Collins put pen to paper to capture his journeys as an astronaut in the vivid and captivating Carrying the Fire. Collins displays a fine writing style and wry sense of humor. He wrote from an earlier time than Hadfield. Collins was part of the “Apollo fourteen”, the third group of astronauts, after being unsuccessful for selection in the second group, the “New Nine”.Collins adroitly describes his emergence as an astronaut, training for and flying on Gemini 10 with John Young and participating in the US’s third “space walk”. Collins was originally picked as part of the Apollo 8 crew. He was replaced by Jim Lovell when a bone spur was discovered on his spine, requiring surgery. He relates his feelings at losing this opportunity, Apollo 8 became the bold second manned Apollo flight all the way to circle the Moon, and then gaining his place in history as the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 11. Other books from this era that deserve a mention are Deke Slayton’s Deke and John Glenn’s A Memoir. Both of these were of the Mercury 7. Glenn’s memoir is so straight that it strains the reader’s credulity. Extraordinarily enough it is all John Glenn - astronaut, married family man, US Senator - it is definitely one of an uncomplicated patriotic kind. Slayton was different, grounded with a heart irregularity and instead of flying became the first Chief of the Astronaut Corps and selected the crews who flew Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions. His book, written as he was dying from cancer, covers the full space race period up to his retirement post the start of the Space Shuttle era.Other books of note are books by Eugene Cernan The Last Man on the Moon, and John Young’s Forever Young.My third must read astronaut autobiography though is Mike Mullane’s Riding Rockets.This in my mind is a minor classic, again so different to both Collins and Hadfield. Mullane was part of the Space Shuttle generation of astronauts, the 1978 class of TFNGs (the Thirty Five New Guys), a group that included the first female NASA astronauts. This book contains an emotional level and cadence not pictured in other first hand astronaut memoirs.Mullane, a self-confessed inhabitant from planet ‘arrested development’ shares his growing pains in recognising that women could be colleagues and brilliant astronauts at that. His brutally honest depiction of losing his friend Judy Resnik in the Challenger disaster due to NASA hubris. Mullane describes in vivid detail the subsequent appalling bureaucratic treatment of the family members who were present at the disastrous launch. His own experience prior to this when STS-27 suffered near catastrophic heat shield damage from launch damage makes this description all the more poignant.The whole fateful uncertainty of the Space Shuttle era, the “glory and the folly” of this remarkable era in human exploration of near space is wittily and cuttingly told. If you aren’t both amazed and angered in reading this memoir than I suggest you go back and read it again.http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "

I would also like to point them towards all of the sections describing his VERY SERIOUS and PROFESSIONAL work mates also acting in the same immature manner throughout the ENTIRE book.

He seemed to glory in being a misogynistic pig and it was all okay because eventually he figured out that women and PHd candidates were just as qualified as his military background self to be an astronaut. And, because he thanked his poor wife and mother. This attitude came up over and over and I nearly growled out loud each time in disgust and frustration.

The first half of the book, I was still getting used to the fact that NASA used to be hella racist and sexist. I did NOT appreciate any of Mike's commentary on women, his wife, his coworkers, whatsoever. This man does not have a clue how to talk to a woman and I bet he was rewarded for it his whole life. My contempt aside, there were some pretty great stories in here. Mike also did learn a thing or two about women in space, but not nearly enough.This book is enjoyable if you can get beyond the sexism.I recommend to Texan readers, men with similar ideologies and love a tall tale, and for space enthusiasts willing to sit through sexism."

It was an honor to share his joy and excitement, pain and frustration, and admiration and love for those with whom he worked alongside. I laughed, I cried, I recommended this book to everyone I've bumped into lately. A must-read if there ever was one.When I finished the book I took the time to write Col. Mullane a short note and within a day he replied. He encouraged me to ""Keep looking up"" and that's more or less the point of his book. To look up and be inspired, to reach for a goal, to see the good, the bad, and the ugly of anything and work even hard for a goal. "

Mike seems to think that because he admits he was basically a sexist pig in the early days of his career at NASA, that we’d all like to go along with him while he recounts some of those tasteless jokes and behaviours. The beginning of this book read more like a guy who’s just been initiated into the most stereotypical fraternity than someone who has been accepted into NASA’s space shuttle program.

Then again, he was a product of his time and possessed enough self-awareness to make it fairly comical. I appreciated his dry wit and unapologetic bluntness. But it was his love/hate relationship with his job that will stick with me. Like most kids in the 80s, I also wanted to be an astronaut. That dream was lost somewhere in my adolescence, but I still follow the current science and. Mike's career story includes graphic details of a department fraught with dysfunction...which is to say, it was just like any other job. Yes, he got to see the Earth from space and will forever have those memories and bragging rights, but when he wasn't strapped to a rocket or floating in space, he was drowning in drama, favoritism, politics, and disappointment. All in all, his book was a good read/listen (I switched from PB to audio early-on), but I probably wouldn't reach for it again."

157,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13174155-clay-davis,5,A great autobiography of an astronaut. I learned and was entertained by this book. I found out a lot about how N.A.S.A. works and how it doesn't.
158,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106571581-sean-mobley,4,"Riding Rockets tells the story of former NASA astronaut Mike Mullane’s selection for, training on, and missions during the space shuttle program. In it, Mike is remarkably frank about so much, from his opinions about NASA leadership during his tenure to the terror and sometimes physical pain surrounding space travel to, perhaps most revealing, his personal journey from arrogant, sexist dinosaur to someone who is still a relic of his time but also has a more full understanding of the hardships faced by women and minorities in the space program.Autobiographies can be tough, because this is a person’s chance to share their version of a story, and often they tell the stories that make them look the best. Mullane is not afraid to make himself look a fool or dive into the inner workings of the male-dominated, male-centric world he emerged from. This book strips a lot of the varnish from the space program, so if you’re going into this hoping to keep all your heroes intact then you’ll be disappointed. I certainly came away with food for thought on people and parts of the NASA shuttle program that I hadn’t really challenged before. Perhaps the best praise I can give any history book is that it made me curious to learn more, in this case to research some of the points he made and see if others felt the same way he did (which is very far from the rosy portrait of NASA unity that the public gets).Mullane several times laments that right-brained engineers are the ones telling a lot of the space stories, implying that they fail to capture in words the beauty of their experience in the way a poet might. Sure, he’s no poet, but he is a fine writer, and his vivid language brings you right along for the ride. Mullane tells you up-front what he’s all about, and you can tell from the very first chapter that this book is rated PG-13 at a minimum. As I said before, he is brutally honest about his archaic views towards the women he worked with. I’ve read a review of someone who got to the first hints of that and got disgusted with this “sexist pig” and stopped reading. It’s unfortunate that person chose to stop, because they clearly only read the first few pages and missed the entire evolution of this person as he came to understand the obstacles that a world that was designed to lift him up as a white male put in the place of just about everyone else, and came to respect the ambitions and skills and depth of the women and people of color who joined him in the first shuttle astronaut class. While his views and language never elevates itself to a place that I personally would consider fully worth celebrating (indeed in the last third of the book, I felt myself joining Mullane’s wife when she would ask him “when are you going to grow up?”) as a historian I see so much value in this story. If you’re going to read a history book, any history book, and expect it to live your values and beliefs, you’re going to end up with an extremely shallow view of history. Heck, Margaret Sanger believed in sterilizing poor women. You can take that out of it’s context too, or you can learn about Margaret and the world around her to understand why she believed that. That's the whole point of reading about history: you're not sitting here saying, ""Yes, they were so right back then!"" You're saying, ""Yes, I want to learn about someone else's view of the world."" You gotta take the good with the bad. I rate books based on how eager I am to re-read them. This one comes in at 4-stars, meaning I am excited to reread it at some point in the future. This is one of the best astronaut biographies I’ve read, and I highly recommend it for people interested in this take on the Shuttle era, with the caveat that if you are going to get turned off by some of the more gross aspects of being an astronaut, or Mullane’s retelling of the crass comments he and many of the men in his class made about women, then seek safer options."
159,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9209104-amita,3,"The actual stories and discussion about NASA during the peak Shuttle launch era were really interesting. I loved learning about the dynamic between the leadership and the astronauts - it's a side of the glamorous NASA life you don't hear much. I also loved hearing about the training, the space flights, the camaraderie, and the awkward/crazy press tours. It's when we get into the antics of the ""Arrested Development Crowd,"" that I get a little torn. I like hearing all the craziness they got up to, but I hate that it's presented as some sort of bygone, halcyon era of good times and no one knows how to have fun anymore. Therein lies my biggest issue with the book: I wanted so much to like this guy. But he comes off arrogant and selfish and juvenile, all while claiming that at least he's self-aware and that's better than ignorance. The disdain he had for some of his fellow crew was obvious, despite his repeated efforts to claim that he learned his lesson and he really does value them now. He recognizes and apologizes for the fact that he was probably a pretty shitty father and husband while he was chasing his dream, but he also tries to spin it as a virtue of his wife that she dealt with it. ""I was terrible, but isn't my wife great for never nagging me? That's the lesson here - have a really awesome wife!"" The number of times he prefaces whatever hilarious anecdote he wanted to tell with ""politically correct"" or ""Arrested Development Crowd"" or ""misogynistic"" proves he's aware enough to know something is probably inappropriate, but he just doesn't care. ""Listen to this hilarious thing I said once! Oh I know, I'm such an asshole - but I KNOW that, so it's fine, right?""I know this book isn't about a dude who grew up in the 50s learning how to be a more socially-aware person, so I tried not to focus on it in deciding how I felt about the book. I would dutifully ignore the juvenile comments and focus on the underlying story, and then he'd say something just so frustrating that it would pull me out of the book. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the NASA parts of this story. And he's a great story-teller. But it mostly just made me want to read an astronaut memoir from someone else entirely."
160,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"I'm of two minds about this book.On the one hand, Mullane provides a fast-paced and entertaining view of the early years of the Space Shuttle program, giving us outsiders a view into the selection process, training, the politics and mismanaged administration of the Astronaut Office, the astronauts' intense drive, work ethic, and also their utter fear of what the Shuttle could do to them, fuelled by the seeming complacency of NASA management toward astronaut safety. He is brutally honest about the discomforts and indignities of space travel, and about his frustrations with the way astronauts were treated by management.On the other hand, he paints himself as an old-school chauvinist jock who came to NASA with deep Air Force experience (including in Vietnam) and immense personal drive, but a kind of psychological immaturity that made it hard for him to work in the non-military world. This makes major parts of his memoir cringe-worthy. The pranks, sexual innuendo directed at the female astronaut candidates, dismissal of non-military and ""part-time"" astronauts, and endless discussion of bodily functions, were tough for me to read. I certainly didn't expect to read so much about his penis, nor can I imagine how his wife, who comes across as a very traditional woman, consented to have her sex life with her husband described over and over again. His tribute to his close friend Judy Reznik, who died in the Challenger explosion, is dulled by his constant references to her appearance and his physical attraction to her. By the end of the book he comes to recognize how his initial attitudes were wrong, but the reader can't help but sympathize with the people (especially the women) who were the target of his disdain or prejudice. All in all I think this is a book worth reading for anyone interested in the Space Shuttle program, giving a great inside look at the forces (good and bad) motivating the astronauts and their management. At the same time, it dispels any notions one might have about astronauts as superhuman figures with noble motivations and impeccable character. The scene in which veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (of Gemini and Apollo fame) shakes his head at Mullane's pranks and drunken tomfoolery is telling. A slice of life, as it were."
161,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903375-gwen,3,"I like space. Never had a desire to be an astronaut, but I've always loved stars and NASA and all the work that goes into sending people up. So of course I picked this up when I visited the Johnson Space Center.Parts of this were good, parts of it were bad. But ultimately, once I finished reading about his first space flight (which, honestly, I expected to be more than a chapter) I was done. And what turned me away was Mullane himself. No doubt about it, he's a misogynist. He applauded himself on the back several times for not sleeping with a co-worker. Turned himself into a hero because of it. Never mind he was married, had kids, or hell, managed to get into space. Restraint was his greatest achievement! But he never thought it wrong. Never stopped thinking it. And all his other comments about looking down on those not in the military. On seeing beautiful women as threats because they could sleep around and get a leg up. Hell, he actively says that the only reason he became an astronaut was because he didn't have to be involved in the household. Chores, kids, shopping - his wife did everything so he had nothing to get in the way of his career. For. Ever. He acknowledges this only once, and was a jerk to her most of the time. (Can you say privileged?)I got to the point of the book where he'd been in space and then stopped reading because I realized if I ever meet Mullane in real life I'd turn on my heel and walk the other way.Parts of this I did like. The understanding of the inner politics of NASA and astronaut assignments. The stress Mullane's wife went through watch failed launch after failed launch. His slight growth towards seeing the feminist/civilian light, understanding their struggles and worth. (though really, seeing worth in everyone should be expected, not worthy of ten gold stars). The small moments of how it felt to hit 50 miles and officially become an astronaut, watching day come over the earth.They just weren't enough to pull me to finish the book."
162,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"This was a great memoir from start to finish. The glory and folly of the post-Apollo space age. Seen through the eyes of one of the most politically incorrect astronauts ever. This actually got me excited about the Space Shuttle era - something I would not of thought possible.The right stuff: astronaut autobiographies from Glenn to HadfieldAn enduring image of an ‘astronaut’ was created for the public by NASA, Time magazine, and Tom Woolf’s The Right Stuff. These caricatures of the original seven American astronauts, the so-called Mercury-7, chosen to assert American supremacy over the communist threat of Sputnik have seemingly endured way past their use by date. A resurgence in interest in ‘astronauts’ was made almost single-handedly in the English speaking world by the Canadian Colonel Chris Hadfield. His much publicised exploits, through the media of YouTube, as commander of expedition 35 aboard the International Space Station made obvious a change from May 5, 1961 when Alan Shepherd rode Freedom 7 into the history books.In his autobiographical An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, the now retired Hadfield provides one of the most readable and honest stories of his journey from being a glider in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in 1975 to commanding the international space Station in 2013 - after ‘only’ 21 years of astronaut training. He candidly describes the effort and training to get to being a modern astronauts - studying, practicing, learning, waiting, preparing for the worst - then being flexible enough to deal with the unexpected. What I liked is his can do approach as explained in his response to the 1969 Apollo 11moon landing and wanting to become an astronaut: I also knew, as did every other kid in Canada, that it was impossible. Astronauts were American. NASA only accepted applications from U.S citizens, and Canada didn’t even have a space agency. I was old enough to understand that getting ready wasn’t simply a matter of playing “space mission” with my brothers in our bunk beds, underneath a big National geographic poster of the Moon. But there was no program I could enroll in, no manual i could read, no one to ask. There was only one option, I decided. I had to imagine what an astronaut might do if he were 9 years old, then do exactly the same thing.His laconic, sometimes counter-intuitive advise is always presented with a wealth of evidence to support his lesson. His Frank assessment of the impact of his dream on the rest of his family make a good reminder for all the corporate males who neglect family events for yet another sales meeting.Hadfield’s book is a great read and compares favorably with two of my other notable astronaut autobiographies.At the age of five I was devastated when my mum said to me that I could not become an astronaut. She dashed my probably overly enthusiastic boyish exuberance regarding space exploration explaining that I would need to be both American and a military pilot. Despite this early reality check, and taking a different path to Hadfield, I followed the Apollo program with enthusiasm - racing home from primary school to watch the historic moon-walk of Armstrong and Aldrin.Of those Apollo 11 voyagers only Michael Collins put pen to paper to capture his journeys as an astronaut in the vivid and captivating Carrying the Fire. Collins displays a fine writing style and wry sense of humor. He wrote from an earlier time than Hadfield. Collins was part of the “Apollo fourteen”, the third group of astronauts, after being unsuccessful for selection in the second group, the “New Nine”.Collins adroitly describes his emergence as an astronaut, training for and flying on Gemini 10 with John Young and participating in the US’s third “space walk”. Collins was originally picked as part of the Apollo 8 crew. He was replaced by Jim Lovell when a bone spur was discovered on his spine, requiring surgery. He relates his feelings at losing this opportunity, Apollo 8 became the bold second manned Apollo flight all the way to circle the Moon, and then gaining his place in history as the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 11. Other books from this era that deserve a mention are Deke Slayton’s Deke and John Glenn’s A Memoir. Both of these were of the Mercury 7. Glenn’s memoir is so straight that it strains the reader’s credulity. Extraordinarily enough it is all John Glenn - astronaut, married family man, US Senator - it is definitely one of an uncomplicated patriotic kind. Slayton was different, grounded with a heart irregularity and instead of flying became the first Chief of the Astronaut Corps and selected the crews who flew Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions. His book, written as he was dying from cancer, covers the full space race period up to his retirement post the start of the Space Shuttle era.Other books of note are books by Eugene Cernan The Last Man on the Moon, and John Young’s Forever Young.My third must read astronaut autobiography though is Mike Mullane’s Riding Rockets.This in my mind is a minor classic, again so different to both Collins and Hadfield. Mullane was part of the Space Shuttle generation of astronauts, the 1978 class of TFNGs (the Thirty Five New Guys), a group that included the first female NASA astronauts. This book contains an emotional level and cadence not pictured in other first hand astronaut memoirs.Mullane, a self-confessed inhabitant from planet ‘arrested development’ shares his growing pains in recognising that women could be colleagues and brilliant astronauts at that. His brutally honest depiction of losing his friend Judy Resnik in the Challenger disaster due to NASA hubris. Mullane describes in vivid detail the subsequent appalling bureaucratic treatment of the family members who were present at the disastrous launch. His own experience prior to this when STS-27 suffered near catastrophic heat shield damage from launch damage makes this description all the more poignant.The whole fateful uncertainty of the Space Shuttle era, the “glory and the folly” of this remarkable era in human exploration of near space is wittily and cuttingly told. If you aren’t both amazed and angered in reading this memoir than I suggest you go back and read it again.http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "
163,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37078159-olesya,5,"I absolutely love the book. Mike’s passion for rockets and space is very inspiring. I loved that he didn’t camouflage the open sexism, that was a part of the culture he grew up with. I laughed out loud at his jokes, not so intelligent, yet I find it funny. There is a criticism of him of being never-grownup-teenager with all that comes with it, and that’s exactly what I find the super attractive in this book. While I believe in passionate librarian or accountant (being one myself), it takes completely different personality to conquer the space. Lots of teenage behaviour, as absence of some internal “breaks”, or “normality”. I think some people just judge it as unacceptable. Mike is very smart. He gave a very interesting insight of NASA’s day to day life. It’s impossible to read this book, and not wanting to know more about the history and the future of the space program. "

Mike seems to think that because he admits he was basically a sexist pig in the early days of his career at NASA, that we’d all like to go along with him while he recounts some of those tasteless jokes and behaviours. The beginning of this book read more like a guy who’s just been initiated into the most stereotypical fraternity than someone who has been accepted into NASA’s space shuttle program.

Then again, he was a product of his time and possessed enough self-awareness to make it fairly comical. I appreciated his dry wit and unapologetic bluntness. But it was his love/hate relationship with his job that will stick with me. Like most kids in the 80s, I also wanted to be an astronaut. That dream was lost somewhere in my adolescence, but I still follow the current science and. Mike's career story includes graphic details of a department fraught with dysfunction...which is to say, it was just like any other job. Yes, he got to see the Earth from space and will forever have those memories and bragging rights, but when he wasn't strapped to a rocket or floating in space, he was drowning in drama, favoritism, politics, and disappointment. All in all, his book was a good read/listen (I switched from PB to audio early-on), but I probably wouldn't reach for it again."

187,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13174155-clay-davis,5,A great autobiography of an astronaut. I learned and was entertained by this book. I found out a lot about how N.A.S.A. works and how it doesn't.
188,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106571581-sean-mobley,4,"Riding Rockets tells the story of former NASA astronaut Mike Mullane’s selection for, training on, and missions during the space shuttle program. In it, Mike is remarkably frank about so much, from his opinions about NASA leadership during his tenure to the terror and sometimes physical pain surrounding space travel to, perhaps most revealing, his personal journey from arrogant, sexist dinosaur to someone who is still a relic of his time but also has a more full understanding of the hardships faced by women and minorities in the space program.Autobiographies can be tough, because this is a person’s chance to share their version of a story, and often they tell the stories that make them look the best. Mullane is not afraid to make himself look a fool or dive into the inner workings of the male-dominated, male-centric world he emerged from. This book strips a lot of the varnish from the space program, so if you’re going into this hoping to keep all your heroes intact then you’ll be disappointed. I certainly came away with food for thought on people and parts of the NASA shuttle program that I hadn’t really challenged before. Perhaps the best praise I can give any history book is that it made me curious to learn more, in this case to research some of the points he made and see if others felt the same way he did (which is very far from the rosy portrait of NASA unity that the public gets).Mullane several times laments that right-brained engineers are the ones telling a lot of the space stories, implying that they fail to capture in words the beauty of their experience in the way a poet might. Sure, he’s no poet, but he is a fine writer, and his vivid language brings you right along for the ride. Mullane tells you up-front what he’s all about, and you can tell from the very first chapter that this book is rated PG-13 at a minimum. As I said before, he is brutally honest about his archaic views towards the women he worked with. I’ve read a review of someone who got to the first hints of that and got disgusted with this “sexist pig” and stopped reading. It’s unfortunate that person chose to stop, because they clearly only read the first few pages and missed the entire evolution of this person as he came to understand the obstacles that a world that was designed to lift him up as a white male put in the place of just about everyone else, and came to respect the ambitions and skills and depth of the women and people of color who joined him in the first shuttle astronaut class. While his views and language never elevates itself to a place that I personally would consider fully worth celebrating (indeed in the last third of the book, I felt myself joining Mullane’s wife when she would ask him “when are you going to grow up?”) as a historian I see so much value in this story. If you’re going to read a history book, any history book, and expect it to live your values and beliefs, you’re going to end up with an extremely shallow view of history. Heck, Margaret Sanger believed in sterilizing poor women. You can take that out of it’s context too, or you can learn about Margaret and the world around her to understand why she believed that. That's the whole point of reading about history: you're not sitting here saying, ""Yes, they were so right back then!"" You're saying, ""Yes, I want to learn about someone else's view of the world."" You gotta take the good with the bad. I rate books based on how eager I am to re-read them. This one comes in at 4-stars, meaning I am excited to reread it at some point in the future. This is one of the best astronaut biographies I’ve read, and I highly recommend it for people interested in this take on the Shuttle era, with the caveat that if you are going to get turned off by some of the more gross aspects of being an astronaut, or Mullane’s retelling of the crass comments he and many of the men in his class made about women, then seek safer options."
189,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9209104-amita,3,"The actual stories and discussion about NASA during the peak Shuttle launch era were really interesting. I loved learning about the dynamic between the leadership and the astronauts - it's a side of the glamorous NASA life you don't hear much. I also loved hearing about the training, the space flights, the camaraderie, and the awkward/crazy press tours. It's when we get into the antics of the ""Arrested Development Crowd,"" that I get a little torn. I like hearing all the craziness they got up to, but I hate that it's presented as some sort of bygone, halcyon era of good times and no one knows how to have fun anymore. Therein lies my biggest issue with the book: I wanted so much to like this guy. But he comes off arrogant and selfish and juvenile, all while claiming that at least he's self-aware and that's better than ignorance. The disdain he had for some of his fellow crew was obvious, despite his repeated efforts to claim that he learned his lesson and he really does value them now. He recognizes and apologizes for the fact that he was probably a pretty shitty father and husband while he was chasing his dream, but he also tries to spin it as a virtue of his wife that she dealt with it. ""I was terrible, but isn't my wife great for never nagging me? That's the lesson here - have a really awesome wife!"" The number of times he prefaces whatever hilarious anecdote he wanted to tell with ""politically correct"" or ""Arrested Development Crowd"" or ""misogynistic"" proves he's aware enough to know something is probably inappropriate, but he just doesn't care. ""Listen to this hilarious thing I said once! Oh I know, I'm such an asshole - but I KNOW that, so it's fine, right?""I know this book isn't about a dude who grew up in the 50s learning how to be a more socially-aware person, so I tried not to focus on it in deciding how I felt about the book. I would dutifully ignore the juvenile comments and focus on the underlying story, and then he'd say something just so frustrating that it would pull me out of the book. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the NASA parts of this story. And he's a great story-teller. But it mostly just made me want to read an astronaut memoir from someone else entirely."
190,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"I'm of two minds about this book.On the one hand, Mullane provides a fast-paced and entertaining view of the early years of the Space Shuttle program, giving us outsiders a view into the selection process, training, the politics and mismanaged administration of the Astronaut Office, the astronauts' intense drive, work ethic, and also their utter fear of what the Shuttle could do to them, fuelled by the seeming complacency of NASA management toward astronaut safety. He is brutally honest about the discomforts and indignities of space travel, and about his frustrations with the way astronauts were treated by management.On the other hand, he paints himself as an old-school chauvinist jock who came to NASA with deep Air Force experience (including in Vietnam) and immense personal drive, but a kind of psychological immaturity that made it hard for him to work in the non-military world. This makes major parts of his memoir cringe-worthy. The pranks, sexual innuendo directed at the female astronaut candidates, dismissal of non-military and ""part-time"" astronauts, and endless discussion of bodily functions, were tough for me to read. I certainly didn't expect to read so much about his penis, nor can I imagine how his wife, who comes across as a very traditional woman, consented to have her sex life with her husband described over and over again. His tribute to his close friend Judy Reznik, who died in the Challenger explosion, is dulled by his constant references to her appearance and his physical attraction to her. By the end of the book he comes to recognize how his initial attitudes were wrong, but the reader can't help but sympathize with the people (especially the women) who were the target of his disdain or prejudice. All in all I think this is a book worth reading for anyone interested in the Space Shuttle program, giving a great inside look at the forces (good and bad) motivating the astronauts and their management. At the same time, it dispels any notions one might have about astronauts as superhuman figures with noble motivations and impeccable character. The scene in which veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (of Gemini and Apollo fame) shakes his head at Mullane's pranks and drunken tomfoolery is telling. A slice of life, as it were."
191,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903375-gwen,3,"I like space. Never had a desire to be an astronaut, but I've always loved stars and NASA and all the work that goes into sending people up. So of course I picked this up when I visited the Johnson Space Center.Parts of this were good, parts of it were bad. But ultimately, once I finished reading about his first space flight (which, honestly, I expected to be more than a chapter) I was done. And what turned me away was Mullane himself. No doubt about it, he's a misogynist. He applauded himself on the back several times for not sleeping with a co-worker. Turned himself into a hero because of it. Never mind he was married, had kids, or hell, managed to get into space. Restraint was his greatest achievement! But he never thought it wrong. Never stopped thinking it. And all his other comments about looking down on those not in the military. On seeing beautiful women as threats because they could sleep around and get a leg up. Hell, he actively says that the only reason he became an astronaut was because he didn't have to be involved in the household. Chores, kids, shopping - his wife did everything so he had nothing to get in the way of his career. For. Ever. He acknowledges this only once, and was a jerk to her most of the time. (Can you say privileged?)I got to the point of the book where he'd been in space and then stopped reading because I realized if I ever meet Mullane in real life I'd turn on my heel and walk the other way.Parts of this I did like. The understanding of the inner politics of NASA and astronaut assignments. The stress Mullane's wife went through watch failed launch after failed launch. His slight growth towards seeing the feminist/civilian light, understanding their struggles and worth. (though really, seeing worth in everyone should be expected, not worthy of ten gold stars). The small moments of how it felt to hit 50 miles and officially become an astronaut, watching day come over the earth.They just weren't enough to pull me to finish the book."
192,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"This was a great memoir from start to finish. The glory and folly of the post-Apollo space age. Seen through the eyes of one of the most politically incorrect astronauts ever. This actually got me excited about the Space Shuttle era - something I would not of thought possible.The right stuff: astronaut autobiographies from Glenn to HadfieldAn enduring image of an ‘astronaut’ was created for the public by NASA, Time magazine, and Tom Woolf’s The Right Stuff. These caricatures of the original seven American astronauts, the so-called Mercury-7, chosen to assert American supremacy over the communist threat of Sputnik have seemingly endured way past their use by date. A resurgence in interest in ‘astronauts’ was made almost single-handedly in the English speaking world by the Canadian Colonel Chris Hadfield. His much publicised exploits, through the media of YouTube, as commander of expedition 35 aboard the International Space Station made obvious a change from May 5, 1961 when Alan Shepherd rode Freedom 7 into the history books.In his autobiographical An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, the now retired Hadfield provides one of the most readable and honest stories of his journey from being a glider in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in 1975 to commanding the international space Station in 2013 - after ‘only’ 21 years of astronaut training. He candidly describes the effort and training to get to being a modern astronauts - studying, practicing, learning, waiting, preparing for the worst - then being flexible enough to deal with the unexpected. What I liked is his can do approach as explained in his response to the 1969 Apollo 11moon landing and wanting to become an astronaut: I also knew, as did every other kid in Canada, that it was impossible. Astronauts were American. NASA only accepted applications from U.S citizens, and Canada didn’t even have a space agency. I was old enough to understand that getting ready wasn’t simply a matter of playing “space mission” with my brothers in our bunk beds, underneath a big National geographic poster of the Moon. But there was no program I could enroll in, no manual i could read, no one to ask. There was only one option, I decided. I had to imagine what an astronaut might do if he were 9 years old, then do exactly the same thing.His laconic, sometimes counter-intuitive advise is always presented with a wealth of evidence to support his lesson. His Frank assessment of the impact of his dream on the rest of his family make a good reminder for all the corporate males who neglect family events for yet another sales meeting.Hadfield’s book is a great read and compares favorably with two of my other notable astronaut autobiographies.At the age of five I was devastated when my mum said to me that I could not become an astronaut. She dashed my probably overly enthusiastic boyish exuberance regarding space exploration explaining that I would need to be both American and a military pilot. Despite this early reality check, and taking a different path to Hadfield, I followed the Apollo program with enthusiasm - racing home from primary school to watch the historic moon-walk of Armstrong and Aldrin.Of those Apollo 11 voyagers only Michael Collins put pen to paper to capture his journeys as an astronaut in the vivid and captivating Carrying the Fire. Collins displays a fine writing style and wry sense of humor. He wrote from an earlier time than Hadfield. Collins was part of the “Apollo fourteen”, the third group of astronauts, after being unsuccessful for selection in the second group, the “New Nine”.Collins adroitly describes his emergence as an astronaut, training for and flying on Gemini 10 with John Young and participating in the US’s third “space walk”. Collins was originally picked as part of the Apollo 8 crew. He was replaced by Jim Lovell when a bone spur was discovered on his spine, requiring surgery. He relates his feelings at losing this opportunity, Apollo 8 became the bold second manned Apollo flight all the way to circle the Moon, and then gaining his place in history as the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 11. Other books from this era that deserve a mention are Deke Slayton’s Deke and John Glenn’s A Memoir. Both of these were of the Mercury 7. Glenn’s memoir is so straight that it strains the reader’s credulity. Extraordinarily enough it is all John Glenn - astronaut, married family man, US Senator - it is definitely one of an uncomplicated patriotic kind. Slayton was different, grounded with a heart irregularity and instead of flying became the first Chief of the Astronaut Corps and selected the crews who flew Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions. His book, written as he was dying from cancer, covers the full space race period up to his retirement post the start of the Space Shuttle era.Other books of note are books by Eugene Cernan The Last Man on the Moon, and John Young’s Forever Young.My third must read astronaut autobiography though is Mike Mullane’s Riding Rockets.This in my mind is a minor classic, again so different to both Collins and Hadfield. Mullane was part of the Space Shuttle generation of astronauts, the 1978 class of TFNGs (the Thirty Five New Guys), a group that included the first female NASA astronauts. This book contains an emotional level and cadence not pictured in other first hand astronaut memoirs.Mullane, a self-confessed inhabitant from planet ‘arrested development’ shares his growing pains in recognising that women could be colleagues and brilliant astronauts at that. His brutally honest depiction of losing his friend Judy Resnik in the Challenger disaster due to NASA hubris. Mullane describes in vivid detail the subsequent appalling bureaucratic treatment of the family members who were present at the disastrous launch. His own experience prior to this when STS-27 suffered near catastrophic heat shield damage from launch damage makes this description all the more poignant.The whole fateful uncertainty of the Space Shuttle era, the “glory and the folly” of this remarkable era in human exploration of near space is wittily and cuttingly told. If you aren’t both amazed and angered in reading this memoir than I suggest you go back and read it again.http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "
193,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37078159-olesya,5,"I absolutely love the book. Mike’s passion for rockets and space is very inspiring. I loved that he didn’t camouflage the open sexism, that was a part of the culture he grew up with. I laughed out loud at his jokes, not so intelligent, yet I find it funny. There is a criticism of him of being never-grownup-teenager with all that comes with it, and that’s exactly what I find the super attractive in this book. While I believe in passionate librarian or accountant (being one myself), it takes completely different personality to conquer the space. Lots of teenage behaviour, as absence of some internal “breaks”, or “normality”. I think some people just judge it as unacceptable. Mike is very smart. He gave a very interesting insight of NASA’s day to day life. It’s impossible to read this book, and not wanting to know more about the history and the future of the space program. "
194,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81189160-ashley,4,"After reading some of the lower star reviews on this book, I can understand why some readers may feel gypped - yes, it is about spaceflight and written by an astronaut.However, for those reviewers that love to point out how childish and inappropriate some of his stories are, might I point you to the lead-in phrase of the title: ""The OUTRAGEOUS TALES of a Space Shuttle Astronaut."" I would also like to point them towards all of the sections describing his VERY SERIOUS and PROFESSIONAL work mates also acting in the same immature manner throughout the ENTIRE book. I think what these reviewers are experiencing is a disconnect between the way in which astronauts are seen professionally and the way in which they actually function on a personal level - the same as everyone else. Yes! Astronauts are humans! They are not robots! Who knew?!"

Based on his book, Mike Mullane is an asshole who I doubt I could or would want to hold down a conversation with. He seemed to glory in being a misogynistic pig and it was all okay because eventually he figured out that women and PHd candidates were just as qualified as his military background self to be an astronaut. And, because he thanked his poor wife and mother. This attitude came up over and over and I nearly growled out loud each time in disgust and frustration.

To look up and be inspired, to reach for a goal, to see the good, the bad, and the ugly of anything and work even hard for a goal. "

Mike seems to think that because he admits he was basically a sexist pig in the early days of his career at NASA, that we’d all like to go along with him while he recounts some of those tasteless jokes and behaviours. The beginning of this book read more like a guy who’s just been initiated into the most stereotypical fraternity than someone who has been accepted into NASA’s space shuttle program. I dread to think how the rest of it played out. Wasn’t worth it for me."

There are many things you never think about when you see news about space, and Mike's humor, his never-ending optimism, and literary style takes you through the complexities of flying into space and living in close quarters with a fellow crew in zero gravity, re-leaving his experiences and imagine the pictures he saw while watching the Earth moving under him."

In addition to copious amounts of humor (those easily offended need not read), Mullane provides a infrequently voiced perspective on the life of an astronaut, NASA, and the burden of the astronaut lifestyle on family.

Then again, he was a product of his time and possessed enough self-awareness to make it fairly comical. I appreciated his dry wit and unapologetic bluntness. But it was his love/hate relationship with his job that will stick with me. Like most kids in the 80s, I also wanted to be an astronaut. That dream was lost somewhere in my adolescence, but I still follow the current science and. Mike's career story includes graphic details of a department fraught with dysfunction...which is to say, it was just like any other job. Yes, he got to see the Earth from space and will forever have those memories and bragging rights, but when he wasn't strapped to a rocket or floating in space, he was drowning in drama, favoritism, politics, and disappointment. All in all, his book was a good read/listen (I switched from PB to audio early-on), but I probably wouldn't reach for it again."

I enjoyed this book immensely.Note: I found this book after researching Judy Resnick, who deserves a worthy biography."

217,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13174155-clay-davis,5,A great autobiography of an astronaut. I learned and was entertained by this book. I found out a lot about how N.A.S.A. works and how it doesn't.
218,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106571581-sean-mobley,4,"Riding Rockets tells the story of former NASA astronaut Mike Mullane’s selection for, training on, and missions during the space shuttle program. In it, Mike is remarkably frank about so much, from his opinions about NASA leadership during his tenure to the terror and sometimes physical pain surrounding space travel to, perhaps most revealing, his personal journey from arrogant, sexist dinosaur to someone who is still a relic of his time but also has a more full understanding of the hardships faced by women and minorities in the space program.Autobiographies can be tough, because this is a person’s chance to share their version of a story, and often they tell the stories that make them look the best. Mullane is not afraid to make himself look a fool or dive into the inner workings of the male-dominated, male-centric world he emerged from. This book strips a lot of the varnish from the space program, so if you’re going into this hoping to keep all your heroes intact then you’ll be disappointed. I certainly came away with food for thought on people and parts of the NASA shuttle program that I hadn’t really challenged before. Perhaps the best praise I can give any history book is that it made me curious to learn more, in this case to research some of the points he made and see if others felt the same way he did (which is very far from the rosy portrait of NASA unity that the public gets).Mullane several times laments that right-brained engineers are the ones telling a lot of the space stories, implying that they fail to capture in words the beauty of their experience in the way a poet might. Sure, he’s no poet, but he is a fine writer, and his vivid language brings you right along for the ride. Mullane tells you up-front what he’s all about, and you can tell from the very first chapter that this book is rated PG-13 at a minimum. As I said before, he is brutally honest about his archaic views towards the women he worked with. I’ve read a review of someone who got to the first hints of that and got disgusted with this “sexist pig” and stopped reading. It’s unfortunate that person chose to stop, because they clearly only read the first few pages and missed the entire evolution of this person as he came to understand the obstacles that a world that was designed to lift him up as a white male put in the place of just about everyone else, and came to respect the ambitions and skills and depth of the women and people of color who joined him in the first shuttle astronaut class. While his views and language never elevates itself to a place that I personally would consider fully worth celebrating (indeed in the last third of the book, I felt myself joining Mullane’s wife when she would ask him “when are you going to grow up?”) as a historian I see so much value in this story. If you’re going to read a history book, any history book, and expect it to live your values and beliefs, you’re going to end up with an extremely shallow view of history. Heck, Margaret Sanger believed in sterilizing poor women. You can take that out of it’s context too, or you can learn about Margaret and the world around her to understand why she believed that. That's the whole point of reading about history: you're not sitting here saying, ""Yes, they were so right back then!"" You're saying, ""Yes, I want to learn about someone else's view of the world."" You gotta take the good with the bad. I rate books based on how eager I am to re-read them. This one comes in at 4-stars, meaning I am excited to reread it at some point in the future. This is one of the best astronaut biographies I’ve read, and I highly recommend it for people interested in this take on the Shuttle era, with the caveat that if you are going to get turned off by some of the more gross aspects of being an astronaut, or Mullane’s retelling of the crass comments he and many of the men in his class made about women, then seek safer options."
219,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9209104-amita,3,"The actual stories and discussion about NASA during the peak Shuttle launch era were really interesting. I loved learning about the dynamic between the leadership and the astronauts - it's a side of the glamorous NASA life you don't hear much. I also loved hearing about the training, the space flights, the camaraderie, and the awkward/crazy press tours. It's when we get into the antics of the ""Arrested Development Crowd,"" that I get a little torn. I like hearing all the craziness they got up to, but I hate that it's presented as some sort of bygone, halcyon era of good times and no one knows how to have fun anymore. Therein lies my biggest issue with the book: I wanted so much to like this guy. But he comes off arrogant and selfish and juvenile, all while claiming that at least he's self-aware and that's better than ignorance. The disdain he had for some of his fellow crew was obvious, despite his repeated efforts to claim that he learned his lesson and he really does value them now. He recognizes and apologizes for the fact that he was probably a pretty shitty father and husband while he was chasing his dream, but he also tries to spin it as a virtue of his wife that she dealt with it. ""I was terrible, but isn't my wife great for never nagging me? That's the lesson here - have a really awesome wife!"" The number of times he prefaces whatever hilarious anecdote he wanted to tell with ""politically correct"" or ""Arrested Development Crowd"" or ""misogynistic"" proves he's aware enough to know something is probably inappropriate, but he just doesn't care. ""Listen to this hilarious thing I said once! Oh I know, I'm such an asshole - but I KNOW that, so it's fine, right?""I know this book isn't about a dude who grew up in the 50s learning how to be a more socially-aware person, so I tried not to focus on it in deciding how I felt about the book. I would dutifully ignore the juvenile comments and focus on the underlying story, and then he'd say something just so frustrating that it would pull me out of the book. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the NASA parts of this story. And he's a great story-teller. But it mostly just made me want to read an astronaut memoir from someone else entirely."
220,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"I'm of two minds about this book.On the one hand, Mullane provides a fast-paced and entertaining view of the early years of the Space Shuttle program, giving us outsiders a view into the selection process, training, the politics and mismanaged administration of the Astronaut Office, the astronauts' intense drive, work ethic, and also their utter fear of what the Shuttle could do to them, fuelled by the seeming complacency of NASA management toward astronaut safety. He is brutally honest about the discomforts and indignities of space travel, and about his frustrations with the way astronauts were treated by management.On the other hand, he paints himself as an old-school chauvinist jock who came to NASA with deep Air Force experience (including in Vietnam) and immense personal drive, but a kind of psychological immaturity that made it hard for him to work in the non-military world. This makes major parts of his memoir cringe-worthy. The pranks, sexual innuendo directed at the female astronaut candidates, dismissal of non-military and ""part-time"" astronauts, and endless discussion of bodily functions, were tough for me to read. I certainly didn't expect to read so much about his penis, nor can I imagine how his wife, who comes across as a very traditional woman, consented to have her sex life with her husband described over and over again. His tribute to his close friend Judy Reznik, who died in the Challenger explosion, is dulled by his constant references to her appearance and his physical attraction to her. By the end of the book he comes to recognize how his initial attitudes were wrong, but the reader can't help but sympathize with the people (especially the women) who were the target of his disdain or prejudice. All in all I think this is a book worth reading for anyone interested in the Space Shuttle program, giving a great inside look at the forces (good and bad) motivating the astronauts and their management. At the same time, it dispels any notions one might have about astronauts as superhuman figures with noble motivations and impeccable character. The scene in which veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (of Gemini and Apollo fame) shakes his head at Mullane's pranks and drunken tomfoolery is telling. A slice of life, as it were."
221,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903375-gwen,3,"I like space. Never had a desire to be an astronaut, but I've always loved stars and NASA and all the work that goes into sending people up. So of course I picked this up when I visited the Johnson Space Center.Parts of this were good, parts of it were bad. But ultimately, once I finished reading about his first space flight (which, honestly, I expected to be more than a chapter) I was done. And what turned me away was Mullane himself. No doubt about it, he's a misogynist. He applauded himself on the back several times for not sleeping with a co-worker. Turned himself into a hero because of it. Never mind he was married, had kids, or hell, managed to get into space. Restraint was his greatest achievement! But he never thought it wrong. Never stopped thinking it. And all his other comments about looking down on those not in the military. On seeing beautiful women as threats because they could sleep around and get a leg up. Hell, he actively says that the only reason he became an astronaut was because he didn't have to be involved in the household. Chores, kids, shopping - his wife did everything so he had nothing to get in the way of his career. For. Ever. He acknowledges this only once, and was a jerk to her most of the time. (Can you say privileged?)I got to the point of the book where he'd been in space and then stopped reading because I realized if I ever meet Mullane in real life I'd turn on my heel and walk the other way.Parts of this I did like. The understanding of the inner politics of NASA and astronaut assignments. The stress Mullane's wife went through watch failed launch after failed launch. His slight growth towards seeing the feminist/civilian light, understanding their struggles and worth. (though really, seeing worth in everyone should be expected, not worthy of ten gold stars). The small moments of how it felt to hit 50 miles and officially become an astronaut, watching day come over the earth.They just weren't enough to pull me to finish the book."
222,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"This was a great memoir from start to finish. The glory and folly of the post-Apollo space age. Seen through the eyes of one of the most politically incorrect astronauts ever. This actually got me excited about the Space Shuttle era - something I would not of thought possible.The right stuff: astronaut autobiographies from Glenn to HadfieldAn enduring image of an ‘astronaut’ was created for the public by NASA, Time magazine, and Tom Woolf’s The Right Stuff. These caricatures of the original seven American astronauts, the so-called Mercury-7, chosen to assert American supremacy over the communist threat of Sputnik have seemingly endured way past their use by date. A resurgence in interest in ‘astronauts’ was made almost single-handedly in the English speaking world by the Canadian Colonel Chris Hadfield. His much publicised exploits, through the media of YouTube, as commander of expedition 35 aboard the International Space Station made obvious a change from May 5, 1961 when Alan Shepherd rode Freedom 7 into the history books.In his autobiographical An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, the now retired Hadfield provides one of the most readable and honest stories of his journey from being a glider in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in 1975 to commanding the international space Station in 2013 - after ‘only’ 21 years of astronaut training. He candidly describes the effort and training to get to being a modern astronauts - studying, practicing, learning, waiting, preparing for the worst - then being flexible enough to deal with the unexpected. What I liked is his can do approach as explained in his response to the 1969 Apollo 11moon landing and wanting to become an astronaut: I also knew, as did every other kid in Canada, that it was impossible. Astronauts were American. NASA only accepted applications from U.S citizens, and Canada didn’t even have a space agency. I was old enough to understand that getting ready wasn’t simply a matter of playing “space mission” with my brothers in our bunk beds, underneath a big National geographic poster of the Moon. But there was no program I could enroll in, no manual i could read, no one to ask. There was only one option, I decided. I had to imagine what an astronaut might do if he were 9 years old, then do exactly the same thing.His laconic, sometimes counter-intuitive advise is always presented with a wealth of evidence to support his lesson. His Frank assessment of the impact of his dream on the rest of his family make a good reminder for all the corporate males who neglect family events for yet another sales meeting.Hadfield’s book is a great read and compares favorably with two of my other notable astronaut autobiographies.At the age of five I was devastated when my mum said to me that I could not become an astronaut. She dashed my probably overly enthusiastic boyish exuberance regarding space exploration explaining that I would need to be both American and a military pilot. Despite this early reality check, and taking a different path to Hadfield, I followed the Apollo program with enthusiasm - racing home from primary school to watch the historic moon-walk of Armstrong and Aldrin.Of those Apollo 11 voyagers only Michael Collins put pen to paper to capture his journeys as an astronaut in the vivid and captivating Carrying the Fire. Collins displays a fine writing style and wry sense of humor. He wrote from an earlier time than Hadfield. Collins was part of the “Apollo fourteen”, the third group of astronauts, after being unsuccessful for selection in the second group, the “New Nine”.Collins adroitly describes his emergence as an astronaut, training for and flying on Gemini 10 with John Young and participating in the US’s third “space walk”. Collins was originally picked as part of the Apollo 8 crew. He was replaced by Jim Lovell when a bone spur was discovered on his spine, requiring surgery. He relates his feelings at losing this opportunity, Apollo 8 became the bold second manned Apollo flight all the way to circle the Moon, and then gaining his place in history as the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 11. Other books from this era that deserve a mention are Deke Slayton’s Deke and John Glenn’s A Memoir. Both of these were of the Mercury 7. Glenn’s memoir is so straight that it strains the reader’s credulity. Extraordinarily enough it is all John Glenn - astronaut, married family man, US Senator - it is definitely one of an uncomplicated patriotic kind. Slayton was different, grounded with a heart irregularity and instead of flying became the first Chief of the Astronaut Corps and selected the crews who flew Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions. His book, written as he was dying from cancer, covers the full space race period up to his retirement post the start of the Space Shuttle era.Other books of note are books by Eugene Cernan The Last Man on the Moon, and John Young’s Forever Young.My third must read astronaut autobiography though is Mike Mullane’s Riding Rockets.This in my mind is a minor classic, again so different to both Collins and Hadfield. Mullane was part of the Space Shuttle generation of astronauts, the 1978 class of TFNGs (the Thirty Five New Guys), a group that included the first female NASA astronauts. This book contains an emotional level and cadence not pictured in other first hand astronaut memoirs.Mullane, a self-confessed inhabitant from planet ‘arrested development’ shares his growing pains in recognising that women could be colleagues and brilliant astronauts at that. His brutally honest depiction of losing his friend Judy Resnik in the Challenger disaster due to NASA hubris. Mullane describes in vivid detail the subsequent appalling bureaucratic treatment of the family members who were present at the disastrous launch. His own experience prior to this when STS-27 suffered near catastrophic heat shield damage from launch damage makes this description all the more poignant.The whole fateful uncertainty of the Space Shuttle era, the “glory and the folly” of this remarkable era in human exploration of near space is wittily and cuttingly told. If you aren’t both amazed and angered in reading this memoir than I suggest you go back and read it again.http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "
223,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37078159-olesya,5,"I absolutely love the book. Mike’s passion for rockets and space is very inspiring. I loved that he didn’t camouflage the open sexism, that was a part of the culture he grew up with. I laughed out loud at his jokes, not so intelligent, yet I find it funny. There is a criticism of him of being never-grownup-teenager with all that comes with it, and that’s exactly what I find the super attractive in this book. While I believe in passionate librarian or accountant (being one myself), it takes completely different personality to conquer the space. Lots of teenage behaviour, as absence of some internal “breaks”, or “normality”. I think some people just judge it as unacceptable. Mike is very smart. He gave a very interesting insight of NASA’s day to day life. It’s impossible to read this book, and not wanting to know more about the history and the future of the space program. "
224,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81189160-ashley,4,"After reading some of the lower star reviews on this book, I can understand why some readers may feel gypped - yes, it is about spaceflight and written by an astronaut.However, for those reviewers that love to point out how childish and inappropriate some of his stories are, might I point you to the lead-in phrase of the title: ""The OUTRAGEOUS TALES of a Space Shuttle Astronaut."" I would also like to point them towards all of the sections describing his VERY SERIOUS and PROFESSIONAL work mates also acting in the same immature manner throughout the ENTIRE book. I think what these reviewers are experiencing is a disconnect between the way in which astronauts are seen professionally and the way in which they actually function on a personal level - the same as everyone else. Yes! Astronauts are humans! They are not robots! Who knew?!"
225,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877351-jen,3,"I struggled with this rating. Based on his book, Mike Mullane is an asshole who I doubt I could or would want to hold down a conversation with. He seemed to glory in being a misogynistic pig and it was all okay because eventually he figured out that women and PHd candidates were just as qualified as his military background self to be an astronaut. And, because he thanked his poor wife and mother. This attitude came up over and over and I nearly growled out loud each time in disgust and frustration. But, he did a good job of relating a very technical thing in terms that were understandable. It was an engaging book about an interesting topic. Stuck between giving this 2 or 3 stars and ended up appreciating the value it did impart but could not particularly recommend it to anyone."

The first half of the book, I was still getting used to the fact that NASA used to be hella racist and sexist. I did NOT appreciate any of Mike's commentary on women, his wife, his coworkers, whatsoever. This man does not have a clue how to talk to a woman and I bet he was rewarded for it his whole life. My contempt aside, there were some pretty great stories in here. Mike also did learn a thing or two about women in space, but not nearly enough.This book is enjoyable if you can get beyond the sexism.I recommend to Texan readers, men with similar ideologies and love a tall tale, and for space enthusiasts willing to sit through sexism."

I laughed, I cried, I recommended this book to everyone I've bumped into lately. A must-read if there ever was one.When I finished the book I took the time to write Col.

The beginning of this book read more like a guy who’s just been initiated into the most stereotypical fraternity than someone who has been accepted into NASA’s space shuttle program.

Then again, he was a product of his time and possessed enough self-awareness to make it fairly comical. I appreciated his dry wit and unapologetic bluntness. But it was his love/hate relationship with his job that will stick with me. Like most kids in the 80s, I also wanted to be an astronaut. That dream was lost somewhere in my adolescence, but I still follow the current science and. Mike's career story includes graphic details of a department fraught with dysfunction...which is to say, it was just like any other job. Yes, he got to see the Earth from space and will forever have those memories and bragging rights, but when he wasn't strapped to a rocket or floating in space, he was drowning in drama, favoritism, politics, and disappointment. All in all, his book was a good read/listen (I switched from PB to audio early-on), but I probably wouldn't reach for it again."

247,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13174155-clay-davis,5,A great autobiography of an astronaut. I learned and was entertained by this book. I found out a lot about how N.A.S.A. works and how it doesn't.
248,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106571581-sean-mobley,4,"Riding Rockets tells the story of former NASA astronaut Mike Mullane’s selection for, training on, and missions during the space shuttle program. In it, Mike is remarkably frank about so much, from his opinions about NASA leadership during his tenure to the terror and sometimes physical pain surrounding space travel to, perhaps most revealing, his personal journey from arrogant, sexist dinosaur to someone who is still a relic of his time but also has a more full understanding of the hardships faced by women and minorities in the space program.Autobiographies can be tough, because this is a person’s chance to share their version of a story, and often they tell the stories that make them look the best. Mullane is not afraid to make himself look a fool or dive into the inner workings of the male-dominated, male-centric world he emerged from. This book strips a lot of the varnish from the space program, so if you’re going into this hoping to keep all your heroes intact then you’ll be disappointed. I certainly came away with food for thought on people and parts of the NASA shuttle program that I hadn’t really challenged before. Perhaps the best praise I can give any history book is that it made me curious to learn more, in this case to research some of the points he made and see if others felt the same way he did (which is very far from the rosy portrait of NASA unity that the public gets).Mullane several times laments that right-brained engineers are the ones telling a lot of the space stories, implying that they fail to capture in words the beauty of their experience in the way a poet might. Sure, he’s no poet, but he is a fine writer, and his vivid language brings you right along for the ride. Mullane tells you up-front what he’s all about, and you can tell from the very first chapter that this book is rated PG-13 at a minimum. As I said before, he is brutally honest about his archaic views towards the women he worked with. I’ve read a review of someone who got to the first hints of that and got disgusted with this “sexist pig” and stopped reading. It’s unfortunate that person chose to stop, because they clearly only read the first few pages and missed the entire evolution of this person as he came to understand the obstacles that a world that was designed to lift him up as a white male put in the place of just about everyone else, and came to respect the ambitions and skills and depth of the women and people of color who joined him in the first shuttle astronaut class. While his views and language never elevates itself to a place that I personally would consider fully worth celebrating (indeed in the last third of the book, I felt myself joining Mullane’s wife when she would ask him “when are you going to grow up?”) as a historian I see so much value in this story. If you’re going to read a history book, any history book, and expect it to live your values and beliefs, you’re going to end up with an extremely shallow view of history. Heck, Margaret Sanger believed in sterilizing poor women. You can take that out of it’s context too, or you can learn about Margaret and the world around her to understand why she believed that. That's the whole point of reading about history: you're not sitting here saying, ""Yes, they were so right back then!"" You're saying, ""Yes, I want to learn about someone else's view of the world."" You gotta take the good with the bad. I rate books based on how eager I am to re-read them. This one comes in at 4-stars, meaning I am excited to reread it at some point in the future. This is one of the best astronaut biographies I’ve read, and I highly recommend it for people interested in this take on the Shuttle era, with the caveat that if you are going to get turned off by some of the more gross aspects of being an astronaut, or Mullane’s retelling of the crass comments he and many of the men in his class made about women, then seek safer options."
249,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9209104-amita,3,"The actual stories and discussion about NASA during the peak Shuttle launch era were really interesting. I loved learning about the dynamic between the leadership and the astronauts - it's a side of the glamorous NASA life you don't hear much. I also loved hearing about the training, the space flights, the camaraderie, and the awkward/crazy press tours. It's when we get into the antics of the ""Arrested Development Crowd,"" that I get a little torn. I like hearing all the craziness they got up to, but I hate that it's presented as some sort of bygone, halcyon era of good times and no one knows how to have fun anymore. Therein lies my biggest issue with the book: I wanted so much to like this guy. But he comes off arrogant and selfish and juvenile, all while claiming that at least he's self-aware and that's better than ignorance. The disdain he had for some of his fellow crew was obvious, despite his repeated efforts to claim that he learned his lesson and he really does value them now. He recognizes and apologizes for the fact that he was probably a pretty shitty father and husband while he was chasing his dream, but he also tries to spin it as a virtue of his wife that she dealt with it. ""I was terrible, but isn't my wife great for never nagging me? That's the lesson here - have a really awesome wife!"" The number of times he prefaces whatever hilarious anecdote he wanted to tell with ""politically correct"" or ""Arrested Development Crowd"" or ""misogynistic"" proves he's aware enough to know something is probably inappropriate, but he just doesn't care. ""Listen to this hilarious thing I said once! Oh I know, I'm such an asshole - but I KNOW that, so it's fine, right?""I know this book isn't about a dude who grew up in the 50s learning how to be a more socially-aware person, so I tried not to focus on it in deciding how I felt about the book. I would dutifully ignore the juvenile comments and focus on the underlying story, and then he'd say something just so frustrating that it would pull me out of the book. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the NASA parts of this story. And he's a great story-teller. But it mostly just made me want to read an astronaut memoir from someone else entirely."
250,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"I'm of two minds about this book.On the one hand, Mullane provides a fast-paced and entertaining view of the early years of the Space Shuttle program, giving us outsiders a view into the selection process, training, the politics and mismanaged administration of the Astronaut Office, the astronauts' intense drive, work ethic, and also their utter fear of what the Shuttle could do to them, fuelled by the seeming complacency of NASA management toward astronaut safety. He is brutally honest about the discomforts and indignities of space travel, and about his frustrations with the way astronauts were treated by management.On the other hand, he paints himself as an old-school chauvinist jock who came to NASA with deep Air Force experience (including in Vietnam) and immense personal drive, but a kind of psychological immaturity that made it hard for him to work in the non-military world. This makes major parts of his memoir cringe-worthy. The pranks, sexual innuendo directed at the female astronaut candidates, dismissal of non-military and ""part-time"" astronauts, and endless discussion of bodily functions, were tough for me to read. I certainly didn't expect to read so much about his penis, nor can I imagine how his wife, who comes across as a very traditional woman, consented to have her sex life with her husband described over and over again. His tribute to his close friend Judy Reznik, who died in the Challenger explosion, is dulled by his constant references to her appearance and his physical attraction to her. By the end of the book he comes to recognize how his initial attitudes were wrong, but the reader can't help but sympathize with the people (especially the women) who were the target of his disdain or prejudice. All in all I think this is a book worth reading for anyone interested in the Space Shuttle program, giving a great inside look at the forces (good and bad) motivating the astronauts and their management. At the same time, it dispels any notions one might have about astronauts as superhuman figures with noble motivations and impeccable character. The scene in which veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (of Gemini and Apollo fame) shakes his head at Mullane's pranks and drunken tomfoolery is telling. A slice of life, as it were."
251,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903375-gwen,3,"I like space. Never had a desire to be an astronaut, but I've always loved stars and NASA and all the work that goes into sending people up. So of course I picked this up when I visited the Johnson Space Center.Parts of this were good, parts of it were bad. But ultimately, once I finished reading about his first space flight (which, honestly, I expected to be more than a chapter) I was done. And what turned me away was Mullane himself. No doubt about it, he's a misogynist. He applauded himself on the back several times for not sleeping with a co-worker. Turned himself into a hero because of it. Never mind he was married, had kids, or hell, managed to get into space. Restraint was his greatest achievement! But he never thought it wrong. Never stopped thinking it. And all his other comments about looking down on those not in the military. On seeing beautiful women as threats because they could sleep around and get a leg up. Hell, he actively says that the only reason he became an astronaut was because he didn't have to be involved in the household. Chores, kids, shopping - his wife did everything so he had nothing to get in the way of his career. For. Ever. He acknowledges this only once, and was a jerk to her most of the time. (Can you say privileged?)I got to the point of the book where he'd been in space and then stopped reading because I realized if I ever meet Mullane in real life I'd turn on my heel and walk the other way.Parts of this I did like. The understanding of the inner politics of NASA and astronaut assignments. The stress Mullane's wife went through watch failed launch after failed launch. His slight growth towards seeing the feminist/civilian light, understanding their struggles and worth. (though really, seeing worth in everyone should be expected, not worthy of ten gold stars). The small moments of how it felt to hit 50 miles and officially become an astronaut, watching day come over the earth.They just weren't enough to pull me to finish the book."
252,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"This was a great memoir from start to finish. The glory and folly of the post-Apollo space age. Seen through the eyes of one of the most politically incorrect astronauts ever. This actually got me excited about the Space Shuttle era - something I would not of thought possible.The right stuff: astronaut autobiographies from Glenn to HadfieldAn enduring image of an ‘astronaut’ was created for the public by NASA, Time magazine, and Tom Woolf’s The Right Stuff. These caricatures of the original seven American astronauts, the so-called Mercury-7, chosen to assert American supremacy over the communist threat of Sputnik have seemingly endured way past their use by date. A resurgence in interest in ‘astronauts’ was made almost single-handedly in the English speaking world by the Canadian Colonel Chris Hadfield. His much publicised exploits, through the media of YouTube, as commander of expedition 35 aboard the International Space Station made obvious a change from May 5, 1961 when Alan Shepherd rode Freedom 7 into the history books.In his autobiographical An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, the now retired Hadfield provides one of the most readable and honest stories of his journey from being a glider in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in 1975 to commanding the international space Station in 2013 - after ‘only’ 21 years of astronaut training. He candidly describes the effort and training to get to being a modern astronauts - studying, practicing, learning, waiting, preparing for the worst - then being flexible enough to deal with the unexpected. What I liked is his can do approach as explained in his response to the 1969 Apollo 11moon landing and wanting to become an astronaut: I also knew, as did every other kid in Canada, that it was impossible. Astronauts were American. NASA only accepted applications from U.S citizens, and Canada didn’t even have a space agency. I was old enough to understand that getting ready wasn’t simply a matter of playing “space mission” with my brothers in our bunk beds, underneath a big National geographic poster of the Moon. But there was no program I could enroll in, no manual i could read, no one to ask. There was only one option, I decided. I had to imagine what an astronaut might do if he were 9 years old, then do exactly the same thing.His laconic, sometimes counter-intuitive advise is always presented with a wealth of evidence to support his lesson. His Frank assessment of the impact of his dream on the rest of his family make a good reminder for all the corporate males who neglect family events for yet another sales meeting.Hadfield’s book is a great read and compares favorably with two of my other notable astronaut autobiographies.At the age of five I was devastated when my mum said to me that I could not become an astronaut. She dashed my probably overly enthusiastic boyish exuberance regarding space exploration explaining that I would need to be both American and a military pilot. Despite this early reality check, and taking a different path to Hadfield, I followed the Apollo program with enthusiasm - racing home from primary school to watch the historic moon-walk of Armstrong and Aldrin.Of those Apollo 11 voyagers only Michael Collins put pen to paper to capture his journeys as an astronaut in the vivid and captivating Carrying the Fire. Collins displays a fine writing style and wry sense of humor. He wrote from an earlier time than Hadfield. Collins was part of the “Apollo fourteen”, the third group of astronauts, after being unsuccessful for selection in the second group, the “New Nine”.Collins adroitly describes his emergence as an astronaut, training for and flying on Gemini 10 with John Young and participating in the US’s third “space walk”. Collins was originally picked as part of the Apollo 8 crew. He was replaced by Jim Lovell when a bone spur was discovered on his spine, requiring surgery. He relates his feelings at losing this opportunity, Apollo 8 became the bold second manned Apollo flight all the way to circle the Moon, and then gaining his place in history as the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 11. Other books from this era that deserve a mention are Deke Slayton’s Deke and John Glenn’s A Memoir. Both of these were of the Mercury 7. Glenn’s memoir is so straight that it strains the reader’s credulity. Extraordinarily enough it is all John Glenn - astronaut, married family man, US Senator - it is definitely one of an uncomplicated patriotic kind. Slayton was different, grounded with a heart irregularity and instead of flying became the first Chief of the Astronaut Corps and selected the crews who flew Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions. His book, written as he was dying from cancer, covers the full space race period up to his retirement post the start of the Space Shuttle era.Other books of note are books by Eugene Cernan The Last Man on the Moon, and John Young’s Forever Young.My third must read astronaut autobiography though is Mike Mullane’s Riding Rockets.This in my mind is a minor classic, again so different to both Collins and Hadfield. Mullane was part of the Space Shuttle generation of astronauts, the 1978 class of TFNGs (the Thirty Five New Guys), a group that included the first female NASA astronauts. This book contains an emotional level and cadence not pictured in other first hand astronaut memoirs.Mullane, a self-confessed inhabitant from planet ‘arrested development’ shares his growing pains in recognising that women could be colleagues and brilliant astronauts at that. His brutally honest depiction of losing his friend Judy Resnik in the Challenger disaster due to NASA hubris. Mullane describes in vivid detail the subsequent appalling bureaucratic treatment of the family members who were present at the disastrous launch. His own experience prior to this when STS-27 suffered near catastrophic heat shield damage from launch damage makes this description all the more poignant.The whole fateful uncertainty of the Space Shuttle era, the “glory and the folly” of this remarkable era in human exploration of near space is wittily and cuttingly told. If you aren’t both amazed and angered in reading this memoir than I suggest you go back and read it again.http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "
253,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37078159-olesya,5,"I absolutely love the book. Mike’s passion for rockets and space is very inspiring. I loved that he didn’t camouflage the open sexism, that was a part of the culture he grew up with. I laughed out loud at his jokes, not so intelligent, yet I find it funny. There is a criticism of him of being never-grownup-teenager with all that comes with it, and that’s exactly what I find the super attractive in this book. While I believe in passionate librarian or accountant (being one myself), it takes completely different personality to conquer the space. Lots of teenage behaviour, as absence of some internal “breaks”, or “normality”. I think some people just judge it as unacceptable. Mike is very smart. He gave a very interesting insight of NASA’s day to day life. It’s impossible to read this book, and not wanting to know more about the history and the future of the space program. "
254,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81189160-ashley,4,"After reading some of the lower star reviews on this book, I can understand why some readers may feel gypped - yes, it is about spaceflight and written by an astronaut.However, for those reviewers that love to point out how childish and inappropriate some of his stories are, might I point you to the lead-in phrase of the title: ""The OUTRAGEOUS TALES of a Space Shuttle Astronaut."" I would also like to point them towards all of the sections describing his VERY SERIOUS and PROFESSIONAL work mates also acting in the same immature manner throughout the ENTIRE book. I think what these reviewers are experiencing is a disconnect between the way in which astronauts are seen professionally and the way in which they actually function on a personal level - the same as everyone else. Yes! Astronauts are humans! They are not robots! Who knew?!"
255,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877351-jen,3,"I struggled with this rating. Based on his book, Mike Mullane is an asshole who I doubt I could or would want to hold down a conversation with. He seemed to glory in being a misogynistic pig and it was all okay because eventually he figured out that women and PHd candidates were just as qualified as his military background self to be an astronaut. And, because he thanked his poor wife and mother. This attitude came up over and over and I nearly growled out loud each time in disgust and frustration. But, he did a good job of relating a very technical thing in terms that were understandable. It was an engaging book about an interesting topic. Stuck between giving this 2 or 3 stars and ended up appreciating the value it did impart but could not particularly recommend it to anyone."

The first half of the book, I was still getting used to the fact that NASA used to be hella racist and sexist. I did NOT appreciate any of Mike's commentary on women, his wife, his coworkers, whatsoever. This man does not have a clue how to talk to a woman and I bet he was rewarded for it his whole life. My contempt aside, there were some pretty great stories in here. Mike also did learn a thing or two about women in space, but not nearly enough.This book is enjoyable if you can get beyond the sexism.I recommend to Texan readers, men with similar ideologies and love a tall tale, and for space enthusiasts willing to sit through sexism."

It was an honor to share his joy and excitement, pain and frustration, and admiration and love for those with whom he worked alongside. I laughed, I cried, I recommended this book to everyone I've bumped into lately. A must-read if there ever was one.When I finished the book I took the time to write Col. Mullane a short note and within a day he replied. He encouraged me to ""Keep looking up"" and that's more or less the point of his book. To look up and be inspired, to reach for a goal, to see the good, the bad, and the ugly of anything and work even hard for a goal. "

Then again, he was a product of his time and possessed enough self-awareness to make it fairly comical. I appreciated his dry wit and unapologetic bluntness. But it was his love/hate relationship with his job that will stick with me. Like most kids in the 80s, I also wanted to be an astronaut. That dream was lost somewhere in my adolescence, but I still follow the current science and. Mike's career story includes graphic details of a department fraught with dysfunction...which is to say, it was just like any other job. Yes, he got to see the Earth from space and will forever have those memories and bragging rights, but when he wasn't strapped to a rocket or floating in space, he was drowning in drama, favoritism, politics, and disappointment. All in all, his book was a good read/listen (I switched from PB to audio early-on), but I probably wouldn't reach for it again."

277,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13174155-clay-davis,5,A great autobiography of an astronaut. I learned and was entertained by this book. I found out a lot about how N.A.S.A. works and how it doesn't.
278,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106571581-sean-mobley,4,"Riding Rockets tells the story of former NASA astronaut Mike Mullane’s selection for, training on, and missions during the space shuttle program. In it, Mike is remarkably frank about so much, from his opinions about NASA leadership during his tenure to the terror and sometimes physical pain surrounding space travel to, perhaps most revealing, his personal journey from arrogant, sexist dinosaur to someone who is still a relic of his time but also has a more full understanding of the hardships faced by women and minorities in the space program.Autobiographies can be tough, because this is a person’s chance to share their version of a story, and often they tell the stories that make them look the best. Mullane is not afraid to make himself look a fool or dive into the inner workings of the male-dominated, male-centric world he emerged from. This book strips a lot of the varnish from the space program, so if you’re going into this hoping to keep all your heroes intact then you’ll be disappointed. I certainly came away with food for thought on people and parts of the NASA shuttle program that I hadn’t really challenged before. Perhaps the best praise I can give any history book is that it made me curious to learn more, in this case to research some of the points he made and see if others felt the same way he did (which is very far from the rosy portrait of NASA unity that the public gets).Mullane several times laments that right-brained engineers are the ones telling a lot of the space stories, implying that they fail to capture in words the beauty of their experience in the way a poet might. Sure, he’s no poet, but he is a fine writer, and his vivid language brings you right along for the ride. Mullane tells you up-front what he’s all about, and you can tell from the very first chapter that this book is rated PG-13 at a minimum. As I said before, he is brutally honest about his archaic views towards the women he worked with. I’ve read a review of someone who got to the first hints of that and got disgusted with this “sexist pig” and stopped reading. It’s unfortunate that person chose to stop, because they clearly only read the first few pages and missed the entire evolution of this person as he came to understand the obstacles that a world that was designed to lift him up as a white male put in the place of just about everyone else, and came to respect the ambitions and skills and depth of the women and people of color who joined him in the first shuttle astronaut class. While his views and language never elevates itself to a place that I personally would consider fully worth celebrating (indeed in the last third of the book, I felt myself joining Mullane’s wife when she would ask him “when are you going to grow up?”) as a historian I see so much value in this story. If you’re going to read a history book, any history book, and expect it to live your values and beliefs, you’re going to end up with an extremely shallow view of history. Heck, Margaret Sanger believed in sterilizing poor women. You can take that out of it’s context too, or you can learn about Margaret and the world around her to understand why she believed that. That's the whole point of reading about history: you're not sitting here saying, ""Yes, they were so right back then!"" You're saying, ""Yes, I want to learn about someone else's view of the world."" You gotta take the good with the bad. I rate books based on how eager I am to re-read them. This one comes in at 4-stars, meaning I am excited to reread it at some point in the future. This is one of the best astronaut biographies I’ve read, and I highly recommend it for people interested in this take on the Shuttle era, with the caveat that if you are going to get turned off by some of the more gross aspects of being an astronaut, or Mullane’s retelling of the crass comments he and many of the men in his class made about women, then seek safer options."
279,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9209104-amita,3,"The actual stories and discussion about NASA during the peak Shuttle launch era were really interesting. I loved learning about the dynamic between the leadership and the astronauts - it's a side of the glamorous NASA life you don't hear much. I also loved hearing about the training, the space flights, the camaraderie, and the awkward/crazy press tours. It's when we get into the antics of the ""Arrested Development Crowd,"" that I get a little torn. I like hearing all the craziness they got up to, but I hate that it's presented as some sort of bygone, halcyon era of good times and no one knows how to have fun anymore. Therein lies my biggest issue with the book: I wanted so much to like this guy. But he comes off arrogant and selfish and juvenile, all while claiming that at least he's self-aware and that's better than ignorance. The disdain he had for some of his fellow crew was obvious, despite his repeated efforts to claim that he learned his lesson and he really does value them now. He recognizes and apologizes for the fact that he was probably a pretty shitty father and husband while he was chasing his dream, but he also tries to spin it as a virtue of his wife that she dealt with it. ""I was terrible, but isn't my wife great for never nagging me? That's the lesson here - have a really awesome wife!"" The number of times he prefaces whatever hilarious anecdote he wanted to tell with ""politically correct"" or ""Arrested Development Crowd"" or ""misogynistic"" proves he's aware enough to know something is probably inappropriate, but he just doesn't care. ""Listen to this hilarious thing I said once! Oh I know, I'm such an asshole - but I KNOW that, so it's fine, right?""I know this book isn't about a dude who grew up in the 50s learning how to be a more socially-aware person, so I tried not to focus on it in deciding how I felt about the book. I would dutifully ignore the juvenile comments and focus on the underlying story, and then he'd say something just so frustrating that it would pull me out of the book. Ultimately, I really enjoyed the NASA parts of this story. And he's a great story-teller. But it mostly just made me want to read an astronaut memoir from someone else entirely."
280,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40298632-joe-q,4,"I'm of two minds about this book.On the one hand, Mullane provides a fast-paced and entertaining view of the early years of the Space Shuttle program, giving us outsiders a view into the selection process, training, the politics and mismanaged administration of the Astronaut Office, the astronauts' intense drive, work ethic, and also their utter fear of what the Shuttle could do to them, fuelled by the seeming complacency of NASA management toward astronaut safety. He is brutally honest about the discomforts and indignities of space travel, and about his frustrations with the way astronauts were treated by management.On the other hand, he paints himself as an old-school chauvinist jock who came to NASA with deep Air Force experience (including in Vietnam) and immense personal drive, but a kind of psychological immaturity that made it hard for him to work in the non-military world. This makes major parts of his memoir cringe-worthy. The pranks, sexual innuendo directed at the female astronaut candidates, dismissal of non-military and ""part-time"" astronauts, and endless discussion of bodily functions, were tough for me to read. I certainly didn't expect to read so much about his penis, nor can I imagine how his wife, who comes across as a very traditional woman, consented to have her sex life with her husband described over and over again. His tribute to his close friend Judy Reznik, who died in the Challenger explosion, is dulled by his constant references to her appearance and his physical attraction to her. By the end of the book he comes to recognize how his initial attitudes were wrong, but the reader can't help but sympathize with the people (especially the women) who were the target of his disdain or prejudice. All in all I think this is a book worth reading for anyone interested in the Space Shuttle program, giving a great inside look at the forces (good and bad) motivating the astronauts and their management. At the same time, it dispels any notions one might have about astronauts as superhuman figures with noble motivations and impeccable character. The scene in which veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (of Gemini and Apollo fame) shakes his head at Mullane's pranks and drunken tomfoolery is telling. A slice of life, as it were."
281,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903375-gwen,3,"I like space. Never had a desire to be an astronaut, but I've always loved stars and NASA and all the work that goes into sending people up. So of course I picked this up when I visited the Johnson Space Center.Parts of this were good, parts of it were bad. But ultimately, once I finished reading about his first space flight (which, honestly, I expected to be more than a chapter) I was done. And what turned me away was Mullane himself. No doubt about it, he's a misogynist. He applauded himself on the back several times for not sleeping with a co-worker. Turned himself into a hero because of it. Never mind he was married, had kids, or hell, managed to get into space. Restraint was his greatest achievement! But he never thought it wrong. Never stopped thinking it. And all his other comments about looking down on those not in the military. On seeing beautiful women as threats because they could sleep around and get a leg up. Hell, he actively says that the only reason he became an astronaut was because he didn't have to be involved in the household. Chores, kids, shopping - his wife did everything so he had nothing to get in the way of his career. For. Ever. He acknowledges this only once, and was a jerk to her most of the time. (Can you say privileged?)I got to the point of the book where he'd been in space and then stopped reading because I realized if I ever meet Mullane in real life I'd turn on my heel and walk the other way.Parts of this I did like. The understanding of the inner politics of NASA and astronaut assignments. The stress Mullane's wife went through watch failed launch after failed launch. His slight growth towards seeing the feminist/civilian light, understanding their struggles and worth. (though really, seeing worth in everyone should be expected, not worthy of ten gold stars). The small moments of how it felt to hit 50 miles and officially become an astronaut, watching day come over the earth.They just weren't enough to pull me to finish the book."
282,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"This was a great memoir from start to finish. The glory and folly of the post-Apollo space age. Seen through the eyes of one of the most politically incorrect astronauts ever. This actually got me excited about the Space Shuttle era - something I would not of thought possible.The right stuff: astronaut autobiographies from Glenn to HadfieldAn enduring image of an ‘astronaut’ was created for the public by NASA, Time magazine, and Tom Woolf’s The Right Stuff. These caricatures of the original seven American astronauts, the so-called Mercury-7, chosen to assert American supremacy over the communist threat of Sputnik have seemingly endured way past their use by date. A resurgence in interest in ‘astronauts’ was made almost single-handedly in the English speaking world by the Canadian Colonel Chris Hadfield. His much publicised exploits, through the media of YouTube, as commander of expedition 35 aboard the International Space Station made obvious a change from May 5, 1961 when Alan Shepherd rode Freedom 7 into the history books.In his autobiographical An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth, the now retired Hadfield provides one of the most readable and honest stories of his journey from being a glider in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in 1975 to commanding the international space Station in 2013 - after ‘only’ 21 years of astronaut training. He candidly describes the effort and training to get to being a modern astronauts - studying, practicing, learning, waiting, preparing for the worst - then being flexible enough to deal with the unexpected. What I liked is his can do approach as explained in his response to the 1969 Apollo 11moon landing and wanting to become an astronaut: I also knew, as did every other kid in Canada, that it was impossible. Astronauts were American. NASA only accepted applications from U.S citizens, and Canada didn’t even have a space agency. I was old enough to understand that getting ready wasn’t simply a matter of playing “space mission” with my brothers in our bunk beds, underneath a big National geographic poster of the Moon. But there was no program I could enroll in, no manual i could read, no one to ask. There was only one option, I decided. I had to imagine what an astronaut might do if he were 9 years old, then do exactly the same thing.His laconic, sometimes counter-intuitive advise is always presented with a wealth of evidence to support his lesson. His Frank assessment of the impact of his dream on the rest of his family make a good reminder for all the corporate males who neglect family events for yet another sales meeting.Hadfield’s book is a great read and compares favorably with two of my other notable astronaut autobiographies.At the age of five I was devastated when my mum said to me that I could not become an astronaut. She dashed my probably overly enthusiastic boyish exuberance regarding space exploration explaining that I would need to be both American and a military pilot. Despite this early reality check, and taking a different path to Hadfield, I followed the Apollo program with enthusiasm - racing home from primary school to watch the historic moon-walk of Armstrong and Aldrin.Of those Apollo 11 voyagers only Michael Collins put pen to paper to capture his journeys as an astronaut in the vivid and captivating Carrying the Fire. Collins displays a fine writing style and wry sense of humor. He wrote from an earlier time than Hadfield. Collins was part of the “Apollo fourteen”, the third group of astronauts, after being unsuccessful for selection in the second group, the “New Nine”.Collins adroitly describes his emergence as an astronaut, training for and flying on Gemini 10 with John Young and participating in the US’s third “space walk”. Collins was originally picked as part of the Apollo 8 crew. He was replaced by Jim Lovell when a bone spur was discovered on his spine, requiring surgery. He relates his feelings at losing this opportunity, Apollo 8 became the bold second manned Apollo flight all the way to circle the Moon, and then gaining his place in history as the Command Module Pilot of Apollo 11. Other books from this era that deserve a mention are Deke Slayton’s Deke and John Glenn’s A Memoir. Both of these were of the Mercury 7. Glenn’s memoir is so straight that it strains the reader’s credulity. Extraordinarily enough it is all John Glenn - astronaut, married family man, US Senator - it is definitely one of an uncomplicated patriotic kind. Slayton was different, grounded with a heart irregularity and instead of flying became the first Chief of the Astronaut Corps and selected the crews who flew Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions. His book, written as he was dying from cancer, covers the full space race period up to his retirement post the start of the Space Shuttle era.Other books of note are books by Eugene Cernan The Last Man on the Moon, and John Young’s Forever Young.My third must read astronaut autobiography though is Mike Mullane’s Riding Rockets.This in my mind is a minor classic, again so different to both Collins and Hadfield. Mullane was part of the Space Shuttle generation of astronauts, the 1978 class of TFNGs (the Thirty Five New Guys), a group that included the first female NASA astronauts. This book contains an emotional level and cadence not pictured in other first hand astronaut memoirs.Mullane, a self-confessed inhabitant from planet ‘arrested development’ shares his growing pains in recognising that women could be colleagues and brilliant astronauts at that. His brutally honest depiction of losing his friend Judy Resnik in the Challenger disaster due to NASA hubris. Mullane describes in vivid detail the subsequent appalling bureaucratic treatment of the family members who were present at the disastrous launch. His own experience prior to this when STS-27 suffered near catastrophic heat shield damage from launch damage makes this description all the more poignant.The whole fateful uncertainty of the Space Shuttle era, the “glory and the folly” of this remarkable era in human exploration of near space is wittily and cuttingly told. If you aren’t both amazed and angered in reading this memoir than I suggest you go back and read it again.http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "
283,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37078159-olesya,5,"I absolutely love the book. Mike’s passion for rockets and space is very inspiring. I loved that he didn’t camouflage the open sexism, that was a part of the culture he grew up with. I laughed out loud at his jokes, not so intelligent, yet I find it funny. There is a criticism of him of being never-grownup-teenager with all that comes with it, and that’s exactly what I find the super attractive in this book. While I believe in passionate librarian or accountant (being one myself), it takes completely different personality to conquer the space. Lots of teenage behaviour, as absence of some internal “breaks”, or “normality”. I think some people just judge it as unacceptable. Mike is very smart. He gave a very interesting insight of NASA’s day to day life. It’s impossible to read this book, and not wanting to know more about the history and the future of the space program. "
284,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81189160-ashley,4,"After reading some of the lower star reviews on this book, I can understand why some readers may feel gypped - yes, it is about spaceflight and written by an astronaut.However, for those reviewers that love to point out how childish and inappropriate some of his stories are, might I point you to the lead-in phrase of the title: ""The OUTRAGEOUS TALES of a Space Shuttle Astronaut."" I would also like to point them towards all of the sections describing his VERY SERIOUS and PROFESSIONAL work mates also acting in the same immature manner throughout the ENTIRE book. I think what these reviewers are experiencing is a disconnect between the way in which astronauts are seen professionally and the way in which they actually function on a personal level - the same as everyone else. Yes! Astronauts are humans! They are not robots! Who knew?!"
285,0743276833,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877351-jen,3,"I struggled with this rating. Based on his book, Mike Mullane is an asshole who I doubt I could or would want to hold down a conversation with. He seemed to glory in being a misogynistic pig and it was all okay because eventually he figured out that women and PHd candidates were just as qualified as his military background self to be an astronaut. And, because he thanked his poor wife and mother. This attitude came up over and over and I nearly growled out loud each time in disgust and frustration. But, he did a good job of relating a very technical thing in terms that were understandable. It was an engaging book about an interesting topic. Stuck between giving this 2 or 3 stars and ended up appreciating the value it did impart but could not particularly recommend it to anyone."

The first half of the book, I was still getting used to the fact that NASA used to be hella racist and sexist. I did NOT appreciate any of Mike's commentary on women, his wife, his coworkers, whatsoever. This man does not have a clue how to talk to a woman and I bet he was rewarded for it his whole life. My contempt aside, there were some pretty great stories in here. Mike also did learn a thing or two about women in space, but not nearly enough.This book is enjoyable if you can get beyond the sexism.I recommend to Texan readers, men with similar ideologies and love a tall tale, and for space enthusiasts willing to sit through sexism."

It was an honor to share his joy and excitement, pain and frustration, and admiration and love for those with whom he worked alongside. I laughed, I cried, I recommended this book to everyone I've bumped into lately. A must-read if there ever was one.When I finished the book I took the time to write Col. Mullane a short note and within a day he replied. He encouraged me to ""Keep looking up"" and that's more or less the point of his book. To look up and be inspired, to reach for a goal, to see the good, the bad, and the ugly of anything and work even hard for a goal. "

However, the repeated glorification of sexist behaviour just didn't sit right with me. 2 interesting facts:- an astronaut has to pass 50 miles away from Earth to be considered officially an 'Astronaut'.- during the space shuttle program there was a potential landing site in Senegal so NASA sent someone to Senegal during launches to help with air traffic control as well as have the astronaut passports and visas should the emergency landing be required.

Mike seems to think that because he admits he was basically a sexist pig in the early days of his career at NASA, that we’d all like to go along with him while he recounts some of those tasteless jokes and behaviours. The beginning of this book read more like a guy who’s just been initiated into the most stereotypical fraternity than someone who has been accepted into NASA’s space shuttle program.

This is a refreshing first hand story about the space shuttle program and the experience of going into space. I appreciated Mike Mullane's directness and honesty ... he did not hold back on the way it was back then."

I have recommended this book to nearly everyone I know and resorted to threats to make them read it. I have read it at least twice and will always come back to it when in need of a great read. Thank you, Mike, for all the lessons and laughs."

Mike gives a great insight and behind-the-scenes feel. He comes from a great family, and learning about his childhood was amazing too. You can see how you can come from coffee can rockets to the Apollo. "

This book is awesomely funny, but also gives a great insight on the questions, issues and pressures that were around being someone that is going to space aboard the Shuttle.A great read for anybody interested in human spaceflight."

Then again, he was a product of his time and possessed enough self-awareness to make it fairly comical. I appreciated his dry wit and unapologetic bluntness. But it was his love/hate relationship with his job that will stick with me. Like most kids in the 80s, I also wanted to be an astronaut. That dream was lost somewhere in my adolescence, but I still follow the current science and. Mike's career story includes graphic details of a department fraught with dysfunction...which is to say, it was just like any other job. Yes, he got to see the Earth from space and will forever have those memories and bragging rights, but when he wasn't strapped to a rocket or floating in space, he was drowning in drama, favoritism, politics, and disappointment. All in all, his book was a good read/listen (I switched from PB to audio early-on), but I probably wouldn't reach for it again."

Although the stories are fun and amusing there isa counterpoint of stress with and undercurrent of anxiety and grief; Mike knew the members of the Challenge and Discovery disasters.Although fascinating, this is not a fast read: a burst here, a single story there; it took me two-ish weeks to get through it."
