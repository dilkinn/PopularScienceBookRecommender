0,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,4," Technological Kickback Language is a form of technology, perhaps the source-technology from which all others are generated (even if academic linguists have difficulty in seeing it as such).* Language may not look like look a technology because it’s largely invisible. It takes time and effort to master but then it’s taken for granted so that it is no longer noticed. But like any technology, it does things for people which couldn’t be done without it. And like all technologies, language does things to the people who use it which they never anticipated. In both senses - as tool and as environment - language is the most powerful technology ever created.Or more accurately, the most powerful family of technologies because while all languages allow the same things to be achieved, they don’t do that in the same way. Some languages, like Ancient Greek, are extremely precise and complicated in their components (words, or as Deutscher calls them: labels) and how these work together (grammar) to form very precise expressions. Others, like Hebrew, are noticeably lacking in many of these features (like extensive vocabularies and tenses). Yet both can be used, more or less efficiently, to express the same ideas. Concepts seem constant while the labels change. Or do they?The mechanism of the language machine works on us as well as through us. Eons before the term Artificial Intelligence was coined, language itself took on a life of its own and started influencing the lives of human beings in ways of which we are entirely unaware. Its categories and its logics come to be perceived as natural, as an expression of the way the world really is. Things and labels became conjoined. Linguistic truth becomes confused with reality. Reasonableness, another linguistic trait, becomes a universal standard of human behaviour. Language runs the show. Deutscher calls it culture, which is shorthand for language at work.Of course it isn’t possible to even discuss the hegemony of language outside of language. So the deck is stacked from the start. But it turns out that there’s a crack in the Great Linguistic Wall. Each language has some distinctively unique effects on the human beings who use it. Differences can be compared in order to ‘out’ the concealed structures that each language imposes. These differences typically hide in plain sight. As Deutscher says,  “it turns out that the most significant connections between language, culture, and thought are to be found where they are least expected, in those places where healthy common sense would suggest that all cultures and all languages should be exactly the same.” Culture likes to masquerade as human nature. Most religions (and more generally, ideologies), for example, claim that their precepts simply reflect the authentic ‘being’ of Homo sapiens and the society that species has created. The discovery that other cultures had different ideas about what constitutes true humanity, typically provokes a sort of fundamentalist response of cultural superiority. And naturally this response is expressed in words, which often contain within themselves the very superiority being argued. What the fundamentalists themselves don’t understand is that they are being used by the language they think they control.This is an important book, and not just because it is an interesting and entertaining exposition of recent language-research. More importantly, it lifts the veil of language just enough to see its creative mechanism at work. No language provides a neutral, objective description of the world. All languages come with historical (and ideological) baggage which directs attention and prejudices conversation as much as it allows communication and cooperation. It probably takes as much effort to recognise this as it does to learn a language in the first place. The fact is that  “language is a cultural convention that doesn’t masquerade as anything but a cultural convention.”  Yes, just like the internet claims to be nothing more than a socially liberating form of communication!* Deutscher calls it a ‘lens.’ I’m generalising a bit from that; but I think making the metaphor more useful. The title as well as the contents is an oblique homage to the philosopher, Richard Rorty's, 1981 Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. It often does take social sciences, actually science in general, one or two generations to catch up with good philosophy."
1,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a fascinating book about how culture shapes language, and how language shapes our view of reality. Guy Deutscher is a linguist, and he separates out in some detail, the facts of this subject from fiction.Because, there is a lot of ""fiction"". Much of what we have heard about how language shapes our world-view is false. Nietzsche's line that ""the limits of my language mean the limits of my world"" is absolutely false. A true statement would be ""Languages differ in what they must convey, not in what they may convey."" In other words, languages force their speakers to use certain words in describing concepts, but languages do not constrain their speakers from discussing concepts.The fact that a language lacks a word that describes some concept, does not mean that its speakers are unaware of that concept. It just means, probably, that the concept is either not too important in that culture, or that it is so all-encompassing that it does not require a special word. The first half of the book discusses the language mirror--that is, how language mirrors its culture. The second part discusses the language lens--how language shapes the world-view of its speakers.The book starts out with a description of a big study by the prime minister of England, William Gladstone, of the works of Homer. in one chapter, he shows that the ancient Greeks did not use words that describe most colors. They used words for ""black"" and ""white"", and rarely ""red"" or other colors. He concluded that the ancient Greeks were color-blind, and that over the course of millennia, evolution changed human vision.Gladstone was originally criticized for his outrageous theory--but in a sense, he was right on the mark. The ancient Greeks did not have words for all the colors, and it was evolution--cultural evolution--that gradually brought more color words into the Greek vocabulary. And it wasn't just the ancient Greeks. Many contemporary languages in remote corners of the globe also have few words for colors.It used to be thought that the complexity of a language mirrors the complexity of its society. It is virtually impossible to objectively measure the overall complexity of a language. But the complexity of certain aspects of a language are measurable. For example, the morphological complexity of a language (the complexity of individual words) is inversely correlated with the size of population that speaks it. This is rather surprising, and the author can only speculate on the reasons. One amazing example is given, in the language of the Matses, a small tribe on the Amazon. Their verbs are incredibly complex. They have four past-tense forms of verbs that describe how far back in time an action took place. But in addition, verbs must also describe ""evidentiality"". The verb must describe how the speaker learned of the action. Does the verb express a direct experience (something the speaker saw with his own eyes), or something inferred, something conjectured, or hearsay? Each and every verb must describe all this detail, in a single word!I found the language lens to be absolutely fascinating. It is very difficult for linguists or psychologists to isolate some aspect of a person's world-view, and to say that it is not only correlated with, but caused by some aspect of his language. But, this has been done definitively in three areas; spatial concepts, gender, and color. For example, in English (and most European languages, I think), there are both ego-centric (up, down, in front, behind, left, right) and geo-centric (North, South, East, West) descriptors. But, some languages only have ego-centric desriptors, while others have only geo-centric words. Ego-centric descriptors are mostly useful in urban areas, such as when you need to give someone directions (go up the elevator to the 5th floor, turn right, pass two doors and take the corridor on the left). In the countryside, geo-centric descriptions might sometimes be more useful (the river running to the south of the lake). The tribes that speak languages that only have geo-centric descriptions learn from a very early age to set up an internal compass. This compass works regardless of visibility conditions; it works in a dense forest, in swamps, sand dunes, and in caves. Only if your transport the speaker of such a language by airplane does he lose his sense of direction. It's hard to imagine, that such a person will never say ""the cow to my left"" but instead would say ""the cow to the north of me"".Occasionally this book seems a bit repetitive. But it is a fine example of scientific digging for subtle answers to important questions."
2,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,4,"BLURBA masterpiece of linguistics scholarship, at once erudite and entertaining, confronts the thorny question of how-and whether-culture shapes language and language, culture.Linguistics has long shied away from claiming any link between a language and the culture of its speakers: too much simplistic (even bigoted) chatter about the romance of Italian and the goose-stepping orderliness of German has made serious thinkers wary of the entire subject. But now, acclaimed linguist Guy Deutscher has dared to reopen the issue. Can culture influence language-and vice versa? Can different languages lead their speakers to different thoughts? Could our experience of the world depend on whether our language has a word for ""blue""?Challenging the consensus that the fundaments of language are hard-wired in our genes and thus universal, Deutscher argues that the answer to all these questions is-yes. In thrilling fashion, he takes us from Homer to Darwin, from Yale to the Amazon, from how to name the rainbow to why Russian water-a ""she""-becomes a ""he"" once you dip a tea bag into her, demonstrating that language does in fact reflect culture in ways that are anything but trivial. Audacious, delightful, and field-changing, Through the Language Glass is a classic of intellectual discovery.COMMENTSThis book must be read in context of the global languages. There are more than seven thousand languages spoken in the world, of which one hundred and six languages have been committed to writing, and only seventy-eight have a literature of their own. Standard written English has at least one and a half million words, with past and present meanings of the words known because they have been recorded in writing, the average oral dialect, especially in African countries, has only a few thousand words with no means of knowing possible previous meanings of those words. The different cultural needs of these three thousand plus languages can explain why some have many words for one object, and others simply do not have a need for a thesaurus of possibilities which can explain the intention or meaning. However, in the 1800s it was this phenomenon that baffled the intellectuals. What people see, and what they report, is two very different things. Add evolution to it, and the scientists had their research cut out for them. All research, whether it was through philology or anthropology, was based on western civilization as the control/reference group - or yardstick, if you will. In today's world, this notion has largely been modified to allow scientists a more open-minded and respectful approach to the world and its people. Thank goodness for that!This book starts out with a highly interesting chapter on color in the context of language. I got so excited, I wanted to quote the entire chapter in the review! Of course I saved you this ordeal ! :-)“There are four tongues worthy of the world’s use,” says the Talmud: “Greek for song, Latin for war, Syriac for lamentation, and Hebrew for ordinary speech.” Other authorities have been no less decided in their judgment on what different languages are good for. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, king of Spain, archduke of Austria, and master of several European tongues, professed to speaking “Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse.”""European languages pinched their verbal philosophical tool kit from Latin, which in turn lifted it wholesale from Greek.The debate around color was set off by Right Honorable William Ewart Gladstone who published his Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age in London, March, 1858. Seventeen hundred pages covering three volumes, with a range of topics, from the geography of the Odyssey to Homer's sense of beauty; from the position of women in Homeric society, to the moral character of Helen. Tucked away in the last volume was the curious and seemingly marginal theme of ""Homer's perception and use of color."" Gladstone's theories and studies, as discussed in this book, had me curious enough to get my copy of Homer out and add it to the re-read list. This time around it will get a lot more attention than thirty years ago in school, that's for sure. "" Gladstone's conundrum will launch a thousand ships of learning, have a profound effect on the development of at least three academic disciplines, and trigger a war over the control of language between nature and culture that after 150 years shows not sign of abating.""Gladstone got the intellectuals shocked, stupefied and then rallying when he finally declared that ancient populations were colorblind! That was his conclusion after meticulously discussing the absence of color, or limited knowledge there of, in Homer's poems. You can either read the book yourself, or indulge in this spoiler to convince you to read it, in case you hesitate! The debate set off numerous scientific research project all over the world to determine why color did not have a presence in ancient literature, including the Bible.(view spoiler)[""Homer’s silence on the color of the sky shouts even louder. Here, says Gladstone, “Homer had before him the most perfect example of blue. Yet he never once so describes the sky. His sky is starry, or broad, or great, or iron, or copper; but it is never blue.”""Since Homer’s similes are so rich in the use of all sensible imagery, says Gladstone, we might have expected to find color a frequent and prominent ingredient in them. And yet his poppies may have “their head aslant, laden with seed and with the rain of spring,” but there is never so much as a hint of scarlet. His spring flowers may be a multitude in the field, but their color is not revealed. His fields may be “well-grown of wheat” or “new moistened with rain in summer-time,” but their hue is not divulged. His hills may be “woody” and his woods may be “thick” or “dark” or “shady,” but they are not green.""""Gladstone’s fourth point is the vast predominance of the “most crude and elemental forms of color”—black and white—over every other. He counts that Homer uses the adjective melas (black) about 170 times in the poems, and this does not even include instances of the corresponding verb “to grow black,” as when the sea is described as “blackening beneath the ripple of the West Wind that is newly risen.” Words meaning “white” appear around 100 times. In contrast to this abundance, the word eruthros (red) appears thirteen times, xanthos (yellow) is hardly found ten times, ioeis (violet) six times, and other colors even less often.""""Finally, Gladstone rummages through the Homeric poems in search of what is not there and discovers that even some of the elementary primary colors, which, as he puts it, “have been determined for us by Nature,” make no appearance at all. Most striking is the lack of any word that could be taken to mean “blue.” The word kuaneos, which in later stages of Greek meant blue, does make an appearance in the poems, but it must have just meant “dark” for Homer, because he uses it for neither the sky nor the sea, only to describe the eyebrows of Zeus, the hair of Hector, or a dark cloud. Green is hardly mentioned either, for the word chlôros is used mostly for non-green things, and yet there is no other word in the poems that can be supposed to represent this commonest of colors. And there doesn’t seem to be anything equivalent to our orange or pink in Homer’s entire color palette.""""There is no escaping the conclusion that Homer’s relation to color is seriously askew: he may often talk about light and brightness, but seldom does he venture beyond gray scale into the splendor of the prism. In those instances when colors are mentioned, they are often vague and highly inconsistent: his sea is wine-colored, and when not wine-colored, it is violet, just like his sheep. His honey is green and his southern sky is anything but blue"".  (hide spoiler)]I found this book entertaining and highly informative, with an academic flair to it. The research is impressive. So many languages are disappearing from the world's radar, due to lack of development. Languages can only develop when a need for new words arises. Academic/ intellectual, development is mostly the starting point for new words and terminology to service a language in a local community, especially when westernization of local cultures is concerned. An ignorance of ancient old traditions within non-western societies lead to an attitude of superiority over these misunderstood, and highly developed cultures. The printed word also inspires the development of a language. The author, Guy Deutscher, touches lightly on these issues, but provide a wealth of information in understanding these differences and how far we have come in understanding each other's worlds of words. He discusses how our mother tongue can affect how we think and how we perceive our world. He does not indulge in 'groundless twaddle' of any kind. So by the way, Latin is not only the basis of many European languages. It is also, surprisingly, the secret ingredient in many African languages. A less-known wonder of my continent. You only discover it when you read books about the history of languages, although this one did not mention it. I loved this book. It has enriched my world considerably. Confession: in my own language I have no problem expressing myself exactly how I want, of course, but in another language, I become a 'clueless primitive', battling a thesaurus of possibilities.So be it. This book is obviously recommended to the philologist-buffs among us! But for language lovers, without the academic itch, like me, it is a pleasure to read as well. The author was true to his promise indeed!"
3,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice,4,"--from the BrainyQuote Facebook pageNature or nurture?In the mid-19th century, William Gladstone, eminent British statesman and, in view of how we think of politicians nowadays, improbable source of scientific erudition, noted through his Homeric studies that the ancients didn't see color as we do. Wine-dark sea! And not only that, but violet sea, violet wool on sheep, and violet iron. And green--chlôros--for yes, sprouts--but twigs? Cyclops' club? Honey?Poetic license, scoffed his naysayers, but the patterns turned out to be too consistent for that. He was on to something. But what? Were the ancients color-blind? Working just before the Darwinian revolution, Gladstone thought--everyone did--that acquired traits were handed down. As in, the giraffe stretches its neck reaching for the choicest foliage, ergo its children have longer necks. Gladstone thought that only over the last millennium had our literal eye for color developed to its lofty modern level. It seems ancient texts from other cultures likewise vary from the colors we see. The next improbable thinker was philologist Lazarus Geiger, an Orthodox Jew whose 1867 presentation to the Assembly of German Naturalists and Physicians focused on blue and yellow as universally late-developing color concepts and on red as the first (after black and white). He was also the first to discriminate between what we say and what we see. But influenced by the new Darwinian science, he thought anatomical evolution of the eye accounted for the facts. Although clues to the contrary were cropping up, this savant died mid-career so wasn't around to pursue them.With emerging anthropological studies, it was only natural for Western European man (that yardstick by which all humanity is to be judged, right?) to be deemed the pinnacle of evolution, while newly discovered and studied ""primitive races"" had yet to reach our level. Ah, evolution, and, oh, the race science of the late 19th and early 20th century!With the crashing and burning of the biological approach and the triumph of culture, such interpretations fell from grace. Anything that smacked of the notion that ""savages"" were inferior to ""civilized people"" was viewed with distaste and, in fact, forgotten. For example, ""(i)n America, it was now being explicitly proclaimed as a tenet of anthropological science that culture was the only admissible factor in explaining mental differences between ethnic groups"" (p. 81). So, regarding color, the powers-that-were said that how a culture ""chose"" to speak of color was entirely arbitrary.But what about the discoveries of a universal order in the emergence of color names? Along came a 1969 rediscovery of what had been forgotten. Once again the pendulum swings and upsets the applecart.When the dust has settled it seems that cultures do have freedom in naming divisions of the color spectrum--within constraints. The anatomy of the eye isn't the issue, but rather the importance of color to us, which accompanies our ability to separate colors from their objects, and that accelerates when we start to use dyes and paints. We find names for what we find it important to talk about. First comes red, the color of blood, and always the first color named. Next, green and yellow--what's fresh? And what's ripe? Blue comes last.Biology vs. culture.It always seems that the way we do things is only right and ""natural."" Only by widening our horizons can we glimpse that our habits are just that--habits, not nature; one way but not universal. Color is the first ground the author tills to make us see that. At the end of the book he has included an appendix on color vision. Did you know that only primates developed trichromatic vision? ""(W)ith only a little exaggeration, one could say our trichromatic color vision is a device invented by certain fruiting trees in order to propagate themselves."" In particular, it seems that our trichromatic color vision evolved together with a certain class of tropical trees that bear fruit too large to be taken by birds and that are yellow or orange when ripe. The tree offers a color signal that is visible to the monkey against the masking foliage of the forests, and in return the monkey either spits out the undamaged seed at a distance or defecates it together with fertilizer. In short, monkeys are to colored fruit what bees are to flowers. (p. 247)That'll put us in our place!The author's overall thesis is that language does affect how we see the world. In the bad old days of perceived Western European biological superiority, it was commonly believed that various languages--usually the observer's own--permitted the most sublime expression, where as more limited (read, primitive) languages--those of others--constrained what could be said and, worse, what could be thought. Subsequently it became clear that whatever the idiosyncrasies of particular languages, people could understand and could express various concepts. So, again, it fell out of favor to think that languages affect how their speakers experience the world. The prevalent view these days is that there is no such cultural effect, i.e., no such differences between cultures. The author mines two other areas in addition to color to show that our native tongue does ""color"" our view of the world: directionality and gender.Although we know the cardinal directions and can give directions in those terms, we think it only natural that we usually speak with ourselves as the reference point, as when we say ""left"" and ""right,"" or ""in front of"" or ""behind"" me. Well, languages have been discovered in which people don't do that; they think entirely in terms of ""east,"" ""west,"" ""north,"" and ""south."" Although that seems ""unnatural,"" even impossible to us, they do it with ease. In fact, by practicing it as they learn to speak, they ""install"" that way of thinking just as readily as we do our way of thinking of directionality. In Daniel Kahneman's terms, it becomes part of their ""fast"" (intuitive) thinking that they do ""naturally"" without even having to think about it. In the above Family Circus comic from May 21, 2014, the little girl has caught on to using herself as a reference point but apparently not to our culture's excluding of the cardinal directions.The other linguistic area into which the author delves is gender. Some languages make us express whether things are ""feminine"" or ""masculine."" But gender originally meant ""type"" and not ""sex."" There are languages in which ""gender"" depends on animacy (animate vs. inanimate) instead of sex, and there are languages that have more than two genders, for example humans, size, collectives, liquids, etc.!The upshot of how languages affect our experience is contained in the following:SINCE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE that any language forbids its speakers to think anything, we must look in an entirely different direction to discover how our mother tongue really does shape our experience of the world. Some 50 years ago, the renowned linguist Roman Jakobson pointed out a crucial fact about differences between languages in a pithy maxim: “Languages differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may convey.” This maxim offers us the key to unlocking the real force of the mother tongue: if different languages influence our minds in different ways, this is not because of what our language allows us to think but rather because of what it habitually obliges us to think about.The above quotation comes from the author's 2010 article in the New York Times Sunday Magazine. Ever since I read that article, I've wanted to read this book. Then, some time ago, I spotted the hardback remaindered in Daedalus, and now I'm happy that I have read it!This author, like the psychologist Daniel Kahneman with whose work I'm enamoured, offers us a chance to get outside our own heads. That's just about the most fantastic thing we can do. I have now (applause, please) had a half-hour (don't laugh) introduction to Kant's thinking. I have a glimmer that Kant was speaking of the a priori structures of our thought, which we cannot get out of and which govern all that we experience. Today's cognitive scientists, analogously, point to what our thinking is evolutionarily programmed with and what gets programmed in so deeply through overlearning and habit that it may as well be innate. And yet, and yet--sometimes we can get a glimpse over the walls, into what another person sees and thinks!This author, Guy Deutscher, is somewhat self-deprecating. He is overly modest about what we can learn from psychological experimentation, believing that only when we can watch as our brains work will we really ""know."" He sometimes does not express the full import of what it means to see. Consequently his conclusions can seem underwhelming, as per this Guardian article:Of these three examples, only the first felt significant. The ability to know which way is north at all times, even in the dark, is an extraordinary skill that has useful applications. The other two examples showed, if anything, that language barely has an effect on perception since the experiments seemed overly contrived and the results slight.What has happened that the book's significance doesn't come through as it should? Perhaps the meandering of the narrative throws the reader off the track--if the reader doesn't realize the author is like a detective pursuing his leads historically. But I think the main culprit is that the author downplays his findings. Look at all the past figures he enumerates who drew erroneous conclusions! Deutscher especially doesn't want to be like the mid-20th century linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf whose name is mud today. He made a lot of radical and since-disproved claims about what limitations various languages impose on their speakers. So Deutscher says that each alleged impact of language must be individually demonstrated. He discounts the role of inference, and yet I think that in science deduction and induction work together. Deutscher, being overly hesitant about the implications of his findings, would never have used the picture I have added at the first of this review. He would never say, as Daniel Kahneman does in Thinking, Fast and Slow (about the impact of various subliminal experiences on behavior):The idea you should focus on, however, is that disbelief is not an option. The results are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have no choice but to accept that the major conclusion of these studies are true. More important, you must accept that they are true about you.... You do not believe that these results apply to you because they correspond to nothing in your subjective experience. But your subjective experience consists largely of the story that your System 2 tells itself about what is going on. Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and you have no conscious access to them.Ah, well. Deutscher is being modest and observing scientific caution, for which the casual reader may not be prepared, and I think maybe he is underestimating what can be learned from psychological as opposed to neuroanatomical findings. I tend to see his results, though, in the light of many other cognitive findings about the impact of our ""programming,"" so I'm prepared to be more impressed.One other point: Deutscher's big point is that culture, via language, is impacting us--culture, as opposed to nature. I'm not quite sure the distinction between nature and nurture is as clear as he makes it. Some evolutionary scientists think nowadays that biological evolution and culture interact. It used to be believed we humans haven't biologically evolved in 50,000 years. But many scientists today think evolution is still going on. Some change is mediated through culture, and then some individuals are better able to adapt to that cultural change and get their genes into the next generation. For example, the ability to benefit from dairy products. Culturally, some northern Europeans found dairy products to be a major food source in areas where the climate limited other food sources. So those who had a mutation that allowed them to digest it survived and out-bred the lactose intolerant. That's my rather simplistic rendition of how nature could interact with nurture, an example Jonathan Haidt uses in The Righteous Mind."
4,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,3,"The first foreign language I learned to complete fluency was German - after five years of high school German I spent a year at a German boys' boarding school. At the end of that year I was completely fluent, but noticed an odd phenomenon, that I felt like a slightly different person when I spoke German than when speaking English. Since then I've also learned Spanish to a high degree of fluency, and the same observation holds. In both cases, the main difference that I perceive has to do with humor, and the way the language I'm speaking affects my sense of humor. So I've always been interested in the extent to which language affects thought. The notion that it does is what linguists refer to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Belief in Sapir-Whorf reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century, but since then the notion that language affects cognition has been discredited by almost all mainstream linguists.In ""Through the Language Glass"" Guy Deutscher mounts a careful, very limited defence of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. He considers three major areas - the link between language and color perception, how different languages deal with spatial orientation, and the phenomenon of differences in noun genders across different languages. His examination of the link between language and color perception is extensive and thought-provoking - he traces the development of linguistic theory on color perception from British prime minister Gladstone's commentary on the relative paucity of color terms in Homer's work, through the Berlin-Kay model (stating essentially that languages all tend to split up the color spectrum in similar ways) through very recent experiments suggesting that the existence of a particular color distinction in a language (e.g. the existence of separate terms in Russian for light and dark blue) affects the brain's ability to perceive that distinction. Deutscher's account of the evolution of linguistic theory about color perception is a tour de force of scientific writing for a general audience - it is both crystal clear and a pleasure to read.Two factors contributed to my eventual disappointment with this book. The first is that, even after Deutscher's careful, eloquent, persuasive analysis, one's final reaction has to be a regretful ""So what?"" In the end, it all seems to amount to little of practical importance. The second disappointment pertained only to the experience of reading this book on an Amazon Kindle. Reference is made throughout to a ""color insert"" which evidently contained several color wheels as well as up to a dozen color illustrations. This feature was completely absent from the Kindle edition, which had a severe adverse effect on the overall experience of reading this book. Obviously, this point is relevant only if you are contemplating reading the Kindle version - DON'T!"
5,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen,4,"This is what I call Having a Really Good Time. Yes, I know, but then some people go ice-fishing. For fun. So, if (like me) you are a language geek and have a fairly quiet life, then this might be your idea of a high old time too. Because Guy Deutscher manages that most demanding combination. On one hand, he is an academic linguist, which you might assume would mean he uses phrases like pro-drop parameter or boundary conditions or declarative sentences or funny words like morpheme or evidentiality (haha). But on the other hand his writing style is playful, lucid, engaging and irresistibly amusing. Yes, it's true, there is such a thing as an entertaining linguist.Deutscher takes up the slightly disreputable idea that language may have some influence on our thought patterns. This is the baby that was thrown out with the bathwater when Benjamin Lee Whorf's notion that language determines our picture of reality was rejected as fanciful. Whorf made some rather presumptuous assumptions, claiming that language constrained our minds and prevented us from being able to understand certain concepts. If a language has no future tense, for example, then its speakers would not have any grasp of the notion of future time. Laughable really, but it was a theory that had currency for years. Once that theory had crashed, it became unfashionable to even think about the possibility that thought patterns might be influenced by language, but Deutscher examines how different languages force their speakers to pay attention to certain aspects of reality. One of the most impressive examples is the Australian Aboriginal language Guugu Yimithirr, from north Queensland. Guugu Yimithirr does not use words like “left” or “right,” “in front of” or “behind,” to describe the position of objects. Whenever we would use the egocentric system, the Guugu Yimithirr rely on cardinal directions. If they want you to move over on the car seat to make room, they’ll say “move a bit to the east.” To tell you where exactly they left something in your house, they’ll say, “I left it on the southern edge of the western table.” Or they would warn you to “look out for that big ant just north of your foot.” Even when shown a film on television, they gave descriptions of it based on the orientation of the screen. If the television was facing north, and a man on the screen was approaching, they said that he was “coming northward.” As one might expect, this necessity of specifying geographic directions all of the time means that the speakers of this language (and there are others in the world that are similar) have to develop an unfailing sense of orientation. Which of course they do, being able to 'feel' where north and south, east and west are in the same way as we feel where behind is. Actually, it saves the trouble you get with rotation when you use the egocentric right and left - no more would you need to ask ""your left or mine?"" East is east.Deutscher is cautious about leaping to any other conclusion than saying that language can develop a certain habit of mind, and speculating that there may be correlated influences on such things as memory or learning. But further than that he will not go, as the evidence is just not available yet, despite some fantastically ingenious testing methods to explore cognitive faculties. I do find that ingenuity amazing, but Deutscher points out in his epilogue that the ingenuity required is a sign of weakness: it is needed because we know so little about how the brain works. ""Were we not profoundly ignorant, we would not need to rely on roundabout methods of gleaning information from measures such as reaction speed to various contrived tasks."" True enough, I suppose. But I'm impressed none the less."
6,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9320590-jade,2,"I suppose I hold linguists to a higher standard than civilians regarding their word choice and articulation of ideas. After all, if there's one category of people who should know about the power of words, it's this one. Which is why I'm so disappointed by this book.The book is called Through the Language Glass: Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages. When you're done with it, you would expect to know why, according to the author, the world... looks different... in other languages. And while one or two chapters towards the end of the book attempt to tackle this question, they only offer evidence relating to a few areas, namely colour, gender and geographical orientation. Things that aren't exactly secrets, that most people who have heard about languages will already know vary from one to another.The bulk of the book is mainly concerned in history and anecdotes. The history of the study of colour perception takes up most of the first half of the book. While interesting in itself, it has little to do with language and with the purported thesis of the book. Reading digression after digression gets infuriating. I'm tempted to say this book needs an editor, but if it was properly edited, it would be reduced by eighty percent, so...Of course most people must have enjoyed Deutscher's rambles. The reason I didn't, apart from the fact that, well, he doesn't stick to his thesis, is that I hated his narrative voice. To me, the idea that you can write a book about languages, including endangered aboriginal languages, without once using the words ""racism,"" ""colonialism"" or ""imperialism"" -- or mentioning these ideas -- is simply outlandish. See for instance page 193: ""Together with Guugu Yimithirr, hundreds of other 'tropical languages' are going to the wall, dispersed by the onward march of civilisation."" I'd call what's happening to aboriginal languages in Australia a lot of things, but ""dispersed by the onward march of civilisation"" isn't one of them.Deutscher's unwillingness to address the reason why most linguists nowadays are adamant that all languages are equally complex does him a disservice too. No one is pretending that all languages have clause subordination. No one is pretending that language complexity is measurable at all. What people are saying is that all languages allow people to express the same complex ideas -- a kind of refutation of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, if you will. Which is Deutscher's thesis, too, so why not come out and say that Sapir-Whorf relies on racism and imperialism, and that the idea that all languages are equally complex is an attempt to push back against that?But then again, the fact that Deutscher chooses to use such words as ""savage"" and ""primitive"" to describe certain societies or languages kind of provides the answer to that. He is a linguist. He knows that words are not contained by their etymologies, and he knows how those words have been used, and in whose mouths. Yet not only does he use them, he never justifies his use of them.All in all, the best bits in this book are the ones about the study of colour perception. I wish Deutscher had written a book about that instead. The bits that are actually about what the book says it's about aren't that juicy, and if you're interested in languages you've probably heard about them already. (Many languages have genders! It doesn't mean that French speakers think knives are men and forks are women!) This book could also have benefited from a rudimentary knowledge of translation studies. It's one thing to speak several languages, but another completely to be able to translate to and from them -- otherwise all bilinguals would be translators. Authors such as Meschonnic or Berman have already thought, a lot, about most of the implicit questions in this book. It's a shame that while most translators and translation theorists know quite a lot about linguistics, most linguists know virtually nothing about translation theory."
7,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I can understand people who feel that Through the Language Glass didn't quite fulfill its promise. The subtitle might be more accurately, ""does the world look different in other languages?"" And the answer is yes, but in a limited way that won't be satisfying to those who want the answer to be an unequivocal yes. People feel that the world is different (for them) in different languages, and even that they are different in other languages, but there just isn't the scientific data to back those feelings up.(For me, and this is a brief digression, I do suspect that those who ""feel different"" when they speak other languages aren't taking into account context. For example, say you speak Hebrew with your family and English in school. You are a different person in those two contexts, but not because of the language you speak. You're adapting yourself to the situation, including the language. I suspect that even years after that division is so clear, where you might speak Hebrew to someone in the workplace, the associations remain.)Anyway, I found the book itself a bit dense and prone to repetition, but overall, very interesting. I loved the discussion of the issue of colour in Homer's work, as it's something that inevitably came up when discussing his epithets in class. Why ""wine-dark sea""? How could the sea look like wine? And this book has the answer.It's fairly conservative in its conclusions, not going beyond the available data -- and mocking rather people who did go beyond their data -- and explaining everything at some length rather than packing in various new ideas. It does include a lot of examples and interesting facts about various languages, like languages which don't use egocentric directions but always geographical ones. I would've been interested in a bit more on gendered language, but it doesn't seem as if the work has been done there, yet. It also gives some credit for ideas that were ahead of their time, even if they were founded on shaky principles, which was interesting.Ultimately, Deutscher explains why early assumptions that language affects the way we perceive the world were wrong -- but then goes on to explain that that instinctive feeling isn't wrong in itself."
8,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5978539-lena-tumasyan,3,"As a native Russian speaker, I always felt different from Americans. I've always wondered if the language i was brought up with altered my thinking in ways Americans weren't. I was hoping to get the answer in this book and I was really disappointed.The book started out strong, showing how 3 different languages defined ""culture"" in different ways (French being most romantic and German being most brutal). But then once I started reading the book, it never really delved deeply into the subject of how language affects thought or behavior. The intro and reviews (it was recommended on New York Times) made it sound like a book about language affecting thought. IT wasn't.I liked Deutchers' writing style. He was easy to read and funny. I liked his use of many examples, and then defining the examples to make it REALLY easy to understand. However, he NEVER really defined how A Language makes ONE society's thought be different from another's. He talked a little bit how a language FORCES one to pay attention and speak in a specific way. I really loved his example of how some cultures only have N S E W directions instead of front, back, left right. I understand what he said. I liked his analysis on ""how can all language be equally complex? they cant."" But i wish there were more examples like that. More than half of the book (waaay too much ) was devoted to how different societies define colors. For example, how many cultures only have one word for green and blue. Maybe it's just that many studies haven't been done on language and culture. I don't know. Then he devoted a TINY section of the book to sex of objects, but not enough.This book should have been titled ""Culture and Color."" I would have been less let down if he JUST focused on color (he did so for more than half the book) and talk about other stuff (sex of objects, directions) in another book. ""Through the Language Glass"" was interesting, and well researched, but not what the book intro claimed to be about."
9,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1198255-madeleine,4,"I finished this book, like, two weeks ago, right when my job's special breed of life-consuming crazy was bearing down on me with an animalistic rabidity. Let's see what I remembered about it, aside from the fact that it was generously packed with treats that made my inner word-nerd dance oh-so-whitely with joy.First of all, the author's first language is Yiddish. Seeing as I know far more native-tongue butchers of English than I do folks who can finesse the language like they're trying to get into its pants on the first date, it always disproportionately impresses me when a non-native speaker can so thoroughly rock this notoriously tricky tongue. Every well-executed pun (my ultimate linguistic guilty pleasure, for sure), every beautifully rendered lengthy sentence, every GRE-worthy word did something extra-special to my brain because I just couldn't get over how flawless and stunning Deutscher's English is. There are people who can write literately and there are people who should be getting paid to write because they're so bloody good at it: Betcha can't guess where I think the author fits on that spectrum.The book begins with a lengthy examination of how color names and thresholds vary across languages. The strangeness of Homer's color vocabulary in ""The Odyssey"" (""wine-dark sea"" being the jumping-off point here), possible biological mutations of the eye over a couple millennia, different cultures' attitudes toward the importance of naming hues, and how red always seems to be the first proper color to be saddled with a name are just a few of the topics explored in the book's first half. Since the influence that language and culture have on each other is apparently a concept in its respectable infancy (being the victim of red herrings, faulty conclusions and plain ol' stereotyping had reduced the line of thinking to rather embarrassing lows), it seems like using color-naming conventions as a primary example was the best way to go; however, had I not come to this book with a background in art and color theory (waning as they may be), I probably would have gone cross-eyed many times before yelling at the book to get to the bloody point already. In exploring a topic as broad as cultural variations, even confining them to their linguistic mirrors leaves room for numerous forays into surprise discoveries. The failure of translations -- when, for example, one language employs gender nomenclature in ways the other doesn't -- was especially interesting to me. Realizing how a passage can be so packed with implications and inherent musicality in its original tongue but so flat and uninspired in another left me with a whole new respect for the difficulties of translating an entire work, especially once this book offered up snippets indicating that knowing a language is only half of truly understanding its place as a living, malleable part of society. There were other things that tickled me enough to hastily scribble a few now-nonsensically truncated notes to myself, like how this book didn't focus on just the more popular Germanic and Romance languages, as quite a few tribal tongues received considerable attention. A number of languages seemed to reflect a less-than-modern view of women (I'll be damned if I can think of any examples right now). And it seems as though Latin has been key in uncovering cultural differences, though I could have told you that as a high-school freshman, thanks to my then-textbook's inclusion of ""plagosa"" (which means ""fond of whipping"") in its back-of-the-book dictionary. "
10,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"I really enjoyed this book, even though, or maybe because, it was not at all what I expected. I was expecting a kind of language survey detailing the ways in which various languages differ from each other that might possibly be related to culture. For example, the rather overplayed number of different words Inuit has for snow. I did not expect a very well written argument against some of the widely accepted tenets of linguistic theory, such as the Chomsky/Pinker belief that language is an inborn instinct not affected by environment or culture or that all languages are equally complex. Instead, Deutscher demonstrates both ways in which culture influences language -- the ""language mirror"" -- and how language influences culture -- the ""language lens"". I'm not sure he entirely makes the case for his positions. Although his examples are detailed and well demonstrated, there are relatively few of them. However, I got the impression he was not expecting to totally overturn linguistic thought, but instead to reanimate a discussion that had been unfairly discontinued. I felt like what he was really objecting to were the absolutes of previous theory. Deutscher says that language is more complex than we thought, or than linguistic scholars thought. He doesn't specifically deny the existence of a language instinct, but says that there's a lot more to it than that. Deutscher's writing style is very relaxed, almost colloquial. A thought provoking and very enjoyable read."
11,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3024716-geoffrey-fox,3,"This digressive examination of whether and, if so, how a speaker's language structures his/her thoughts contains two interesting arguments bundled with amusing anecdotes about odd languages and linguists. Some of the descriptions of non-Western languages, and even of Western languages (English among them) at earlier stages of development, show truly surprising ways of putting together information, such as numbers of tenses, whether person and time of action are included in verb or noun or in separate words (as in modern English), and even the number of sounds available to speakers. Current consensus: No language is a prison of thought; the speaker of any language can find a way to express any idea, even if s/he has to invent or borrow new vocabulary for some of it. But some languages oblige the speaker to give information that is optional in other languages. The handiest example is the English pronouns; if I'm speaking of a person, I can't say ""it"" visited me, I have to let you know whether the person was ""he"" or ""she"". If we're speaking Turkish (or any of many other languages with unsexed pronouns), I can leave the sex of the person ambiguous if I choose — or add something if I want to let you know.The first of the two interesting arguments is about the language of color. As William Gladstone discovered in his monumental study of Homer, there are no color references beyond ""black"" (meaning dark), ""white"" or light, and red in the Odyssey or Iliad. (I had had no idea that the politician Gladstone, before becoming PM, had been such an important scholar). The sea or sky are never described as blue, the word sometimes translated as ""green"" is really much vaguer (could be yellow, or could just mean ""ripe""). Later research revealed that no ancient language, or modern language of preliterate simple societies, has a developed vocabulary for all the colors that you or I would see and name and that surround them in their environment. Gladstone and generations of later linguists assumed there was something wrong with primitive and ancient people's color vision. But no: Deutscher reports all the tests that have shown that even people who have no names for many color tones can see them perfectly well if they need to. They don't think of the sky as ""blue"" because it does not seem to them to be an object, just a vast emptiness, and as people become more aware of different colors blue is always (so far in all the studies) the last to be named, because it just doesn't appear much in their environment (except that empty sky). We today are far more sensitive to colors than our ancestors because of all the colored objects on the market and in our household and on our computer screens etc. For people a few centuries back, distinguishing between bright and dark and red (because of blood, symbolizing life) was quite enough.The second argument is more amusing though less important: How assigning gender to inanimate objects affects, but only slightly, the way people perceive them. The German ""die Brucke"" is described as female, graceful, delicate, etc., the Spanish ""el puente"" as male, big, sturdy, the English ""bridge"" is simply a thing with no preconception about its delicacy or strength. But all three words refer to the same object. The sexual connotations of dish, spoon, sea, etc. are faint and of little consequence to most speakers in ordinary life, but can add flavor to the poetry in those languages that have not (as in English) lost their genders."

Turns out the author argues only for potential differences in perceptions of:1. space (if your MT is Guugu Yimithrr you're extremely unlikely to get lost or lose your car in a parking garage), 2. gender (if you speak a gendered language like German or Spanish you can have more fun with poetry and tv advertising that plays on the associations of, for example, a male pine tree and a female palm), and 3. color (if you're Homer, you'll speak almost entirely of black, white, and red, meaning a ""wine-dark sea"" almost literally).Of course he does call for more research, outlining some specific issues that need to be checked and suggesting ideas for experiments.Color insert of key charts, a few line drawings, notes, bibliography, index, and an appendix of the science of seeing color w/ retina + brain (which I skipped, having read last year as much as I could manage of that topic).

(If I say ""I had dinner with a neighbor"" I'm telling you that it happened in the past. Chinese would not have to specify the time. German, or French, or others would enforce an admission of the neighbor's gender.) ""Such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills."" The Matses' language enforces that the speaker describing something that happened use one of three past tenses that reveal the time distant, *and* reveal *how* she knows it happened *and* how long ago she learned/ discovered/ guessed that it happened. I think that politics (national, local, or 'office') and other discourse would be enhanced if dominant languages had at least some of this complexity.Kangaroo does not mean I don't understand.

16,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4931559-chris-miller,5,"In college I majored in linguistics with a specialization in cognition, and minored in psychology. My favorite part of this language/brain area of study was linguistic relativity (A.K.A. the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis)--although I didn't have time then to do anything but scratch the surface. The premise is that the language(s) you speak affect the way you think/perceive reality, and that the way you think/perceive reality molds the language(s) you speak; creating a self-reinforcing cycle. It's been over 7 years now since I finished school, and the trauma of college anxiety has worn-off enough that I'm interested in digging a little deeper into certain areas that I just got an introduction to in school. I decided to start with linguistic relativity, and picked-up this book which seemed to fall along those lines. To my naïve surprise linguistic relativity is an embarrassment to the linguistic community because Sapir and Whorf took the basic idea of linguistic relativity (that resonated so much with me as a student) all the way to crazy town (e.g. The Hopi Native Americans are incapable of understanding time the way everyone else does because of how their language represents time, etc). But, never fear! Linguistic relativity is not completely dead! This book takes the stance that there is a fascinating kernel of truth to linguistic relativity in spite of its trip to crazy town. What a relief!I think this idea is so interesting and feels so true to me because I grew up bilingual. If you only speak one language natively it's easy to think that concepts just come out of you and that language is just the vessel. But bilingualism offers contrast, and in that contrast you realize that language isn't merely a bystander. It seems completely natural to me that the emotions or thoughts that I have to express are filtered through their delivery system. I would notice that I could tell an English-speaking friend a story in English, and a Spanish-speaking friend the same story in Spanish--and it wouldn't be the same story. The basic points were the same, but the connotations and emphasis were very different--driven by linguistic and cultural influences. In the English story my concepts were getting Englishified, and in the Spanish story my concepts were getting Spanishified.Not only do I appreciate Guy Deutscher taking the controversial stance of partially reviving select aspects of linguistic relativity in a community of intellectuals who want to distance themselves from it as much as possible, but his writing style was thoroughly enjoyable. Many popular science books are so dry, you can tell they are not written by writers. You get a list of facts, not a story. Not so here, Deutscher is a wonderful storyteller. His humor is a little odd, in an eccentric-yet-charismatic sort of way. Maybe this is entirely because I know he is an Israeli-born British linguist, but I felt like there were elements of foreign language humor/British humor, and linguist humor in his style. Foreign language humor/British humor in the amount of deadpan sarcasm and sass, and linguist humor in how he would make self-referential jokes, playing around with language. Being a linguist myself who was raised speaking a foreign language, I found him hilarious.I wish there were more diverse examples of linguistic relativity in this book. Maybe there isn't much else that has been proven empirically yet? Maybe this was just meant to be an introduction? The main example of this book was color terms, with small sections on geographic orientation and gender. I definitely want more!I also noticed a feminist and self-referential aspect to this book that I thought was really awesome. In English (like most other languages) there's a default to male gender when speaking about people in general, yet look at the following snippet from this book:""Languages vary greatly across the globe, and everyone knows that the particular language a child happens to learn is just an accident of the particular culture she stumbled into.""The child is a she in the sentence above. This is just one of many examples of gender default reversal throughout the book. This she stands out to English speakers because it violates an aspect of English grammar that we all know about (most of us subconsciously)--that people are male until stated otherwise. I would expect that if you are an English-speaking male (and not a linguist or an English teacher) you've probably never noticed that English, by default, creates people in your image. I would also expect that if you are a female English speaker you've probably noticed this discrepancy. In a book about how language influences thought wherein 1 of 3 sections is about gender, this is hardly a coincidence. I think that in explaining how language influences thought, Deutscher is choosing to use language in a way that will make the reader notice things she hasn't before (see, I just did it too). Deutscher you clever dog!Now that I've given an example while explaining how Deutscher gives examples in how he gives examples, I'm going to stop; there is no way this review is going to get any better. Self-referential loops are like catnip to linguists.One small complaint about the eBook edition: At one point the phrase the bridge was said to be el puento in Spanish (instead of el puente). Come on! How did the editor miss a typo in such a common language like Spanish? This typo wasn't in the hard-copy of the book I have."
17,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"Warning for users of black-and-white-only ebook readers. Long stretches of this book are about how we perceive and express colors, which you might not immediately guess from its title and on-line description. It is difficult to understand these portions of the book without consulting the book-end photographic insert of color photographs and color samples. If my old-school black-and-white ebook reader were my only e-method of reading this book, I would have felt greatly cheated by this book. As it was, I downloaded copies of this book onto my tablet and handheld e-reader app, and consulted them when needed – a little awkward but not terribly so. Some book review sites contain bitter reviews from disappointed readers who apparently did not have this option.I enjoyed reading this book. It is an engagingly-narrated explanation of the decades-long twists and turns in the debate about the similarities and differences in how we (i.e., people alive today), the ancients, and less-developed cultures in the modern world experience, both directly and through language, our environment (including but not limited to its colors). This is not everybody's idea of an entertaining evening at home, I know, but the intellectual thrill of the chase clearly excites the writer, and he communicates this nicely to the reader. The author knows that he is on the intellectually-unfashionable side of this argument, specifically, that he believes that our native language's grammar and vocabulary can alter, at least slightly, the way that we perceive the world. Since this territory is otherwise largely inhabited by an array of unprestigious individuals ranging from self-taught mystics to undisguised racists, the author feels that he has to do a lot of apologizing and stipulating with the aim that the reader will not disregard him as a crank. He convinced me that he is not a crank.While I'm on the topic of being a crank: Have you ever had the feeling that certain long-dead historical figures are following you around the world, demanding your attention? No? You're lucky, or maybe just less odd than I am. In any event, if you're ever attending any séances in which the shade of former British Prime Minister William Gladstone is summoned, can you tell him for me to get off my back already? I understand that he was an awesome polymath, OK? I mean, first he appears as a major character in a trilogy of alternate-history Young Adult novels (really) that I listened to, and then I lived in Bulgaria, where he is worshipped and revered as an important instrument in the creation of the Bulgarian nation. When I was just about recovering from that experience, he pops up like some great bald Victorian-era whack-a-mole in this book, because apparently, in addition to being a successful public personality, he was also an influential scholar and author of a three-volume work on Homer, in which there is a lengthy digression on how the ancient Greeks experienced color. Who knew? Now I do, so Gladstone, wherever you are, I beg you: call off the dogs."
18,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492258-jan,4,"Another brilliant work of popular science from linguist Guy Deutscher. ""Through the Language Glass"" aims to bring the reader up to date on an easy-to-formulate but nearly impossible-to-answer question in linguistics: to what degree does one's language impact one's thought processes?This exploration centers around a very specific phenomenon, which is that languages differ in their stock of words for colors, and why some languages (like English) have names for all the colors we would commonly place in the rainbow, while Ancient Greek and many languages of isolated tribes don't have much more beyond white, black, and red. Scholars have been aware of this observation for nearly two centuries, and the history of our making sense of it provides a neat stand-in for the history of science in general. Over the years, brilliant minds have conjured a host of unfortunately wrong solutions (Homer's people were less evolved! the savages lack the mental machinery to perceive color! Lamarckian genetics!), confirmed either by prejudice or disproved by increasingly novel experiments.The upshot of these investigations for twentieth-century linguistics was first the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that one's language of origin so wholly determines one's mental capacities that a speaker of Hopi, in which certain English-speaking linguists lacked the creativity to recognize a structure functioning as ""tense"", wouldn't be able to comprehend the concept of time... and, as political correctness later took hold, the dogma that ""all languages are equally complex."" The pleasure of this book is that Deutscher takes none of it at face value, and is able to describe recent achievements in linguistics for what they are -- the first steps in a very nascent body of science.Overall, the quality of the writing is sparkling, and reading ""Through the Language Glass"" rarely flags below the level of an extremely engrossing conversation with someone who is enthusiastic about the subject matter and consistently humorous. Of course, what gives the book its value as popular science is that nothing is taken for granted, and assumptions are rejected lest we go down the path of pseudo-science and the quackery that dominates a lot of non-professional speculation about language in the human mind. The sheer honesty, though, renders the final product unsatisfying, as there are practically no answers and we are just beginning to figure out how to ask the questions."
19,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,5,"In high school I learned that neither matter nor energy could be created nor destroyed. Any girl scout sitting around a campfire would know this not to be true, but it took 30 years later for text books to get on board. Guy Deutscher challenges the parallel linguistics axiom: “The fundamentals of language are coded in our genes and are the same across the human race… All languages share the same universal grammar, the same underlying concepts, same degree of systemic complexity” (p. 6).Deutscher questions who explored all the languages, their methods and how they arrived at these conclusions, and refutes one major ramification of the assumption: that language does not influence thinking. Those who get to know speakers of other languages are sure to have heard the phrase, “it doesn’t translate very well.”The first part of the book is devoted to how language reflects the culture, and the later part on how the language can influence the thought process.Deutscher is a great story teller. An interesting sketch of William Gladstone who (prior to being PM of Great Britain) noted Homer’s very limited color vocabulary, introduces the debate on the consciousness of color. He describes several landmark studies that suggest evolving vision and color vocabulary. Color is revisited in the discussion of language shaping our thoughts. Speakers of languages with a rich vocabulary for color demonstrate an acuity not present in those whose languages are not as precise in color.The perception of space varies in language, with (often) rural cultures speaking of the object on their “east”. Directional phrases for languages in developed countries are left, right, and specific prepositions for behind, in front of, etc. Lest this leads you to think that a more developed culture will have a more specific language, Deutscher introduces Matses (Peru/Brazil), where verbs have a specific time and certainty, besides properties of tense and number.The concept of “gender” in language is used to demonstrate how thinking is influenced by words. A number of word experiments are described showing that gender, while in all practicality is divorced from sex identification, influences concepts and memory.This is a good read. Complex ideas are clearly presented, while Deutscher can be wordy at times, he can be very entertaining."
20,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"No one (in his or her right mind) would argue nowadays that the structure of a language limits its speakers’ understanding to those concepts and distinctions that happen to be already part of the linguistic system. (p. 156)The subtitle makes the focus of this book clear: Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages. The key word is “Looks,” because Guy Deutscher’s argument is that, under certain circumstances, the language we speak can affect how we interpret the world around us. He is not saying that language dictates thought, or that it sets any limits on what we are able to understand and express. He stresses that while our language is influenced by the culture we grow up in and can affect the way we see the world, it can do so only in ways that are interesting but hardly decisive.The demonstrated impact of language on thinking is very different from what was touted in the past. In particular, no evidence has come to light that our mother tongue imposes limits on our intellectual horizons or constrains our ability to understand concepts or distinctions used in other languages. The real effects on the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts that we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us – all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself.(p. 234)The whole subject of language, culture, and thought is fraught with controversy and historical baggage, and has been a playground for cranks and racists. Many linguists today would rather avoid the topic altogether than venture into this minefield. The reason it has become such a difficult subject to discuss is because linguistics, like all other academic disciplines, has its guiding principles, which sometimes change, and the accepted truths of one generation can become the embarrassing falsehoods of the next. The Sapir-Whorf theory of linguistic determination dominated the field in the first half of the twentieth century. In its strongest form it asserted that culture was derived from language, and certain thoughts were unthinkable because they could not be expressed in a particular language. Italians were cultured because of Italian vocabulary and grammar, and Germans were precise and orderly because they could not think any other way. (In fact, people who believe all Germans are orderly and methodical have watched too many World War II movies; their language is no more regular than any other. It has plenty of irregular verbs, and at least seven different ways to form plural nouns*.)Then came the backlash. The new linguistic doctrine was that languages were not unique in their effect on thought. In fact, all were exactly the same in complexity and all of them saw the world the same way. The new system was more inclusive and culturally sensitive, but students were discouraged from inquiring too much about the supporting evidence because it mostly circumstantial and not backed up by experimental results. Nevertheless, questioning it would get you labeled as a dunce, a troublemaker, or a racist.Over time, however, research has continued, helped by advances in technology. This book looks at several areas where there are intriguing findings in areas of color, spacial awareness, and gender.It begins with a discussion of the redoubtable William E. Gladstone, British prime minister and one of the most influential politicians of the 19th century. In his magisterial three volume, 1700 page Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age he included an interesting discussion of color in the classical world. We have all heard of Homer’s “wine-dark sea,” which has stirred debate for centuries. The sea may be blue, or green, or gray, but when is it ever dark red? In other places Homer mentions green honey and violet cattle. What was going on? Noticing Gladstone’s comments, other scholars found similar odd color associations in ancient literatures from widely varying cultures, including the Bible.The initial assumption was that it was a physiological phenomenon, that the eyes of the ancients had not yet evolved the ability to see the range of colors we take for granted. It took a long time for people to make the intellectual leap that the ancients’ eyes were every bit as good as our own, and their differences in color were cultural rather than physical. Many ancient cultures start out with only three colors: everything dark is called black, everything light is white, and red, the color of blood, is red. Only later, as societies evolve does there come a time when it is important to distinguish green, yellow, and finally, blue. This finding has been repeated with a number of modern day indigenous cultures, and even in advanced societies we find cultural influences on how people describe color. Russians, for instance, distinguish dark blue and light blue as separate colors rather than seeing them as shades of the same color. The ways a culture describes its colors can indeed influence how it literally sees the world and its ability to describe it.The second section of the book looks at spacial orientation. We generally give local directions using a relative system relating to our bodies, as in “in front of,” or “to the left of,” though in certain situations we will use geographic reference points, such as “to the north of.” Some languages only use the geographic system, as in, “Look out for that spider on the north side of your hand.” The people who use these kinds of systems have a remarkable ability to orient themselves spatially and know where the cardinal points are even in places where Westerners would be completely lost. This is, of course, a cultural rather than a biological ability, and it takes children until about the age of eight before they have mastered it.The final section looks at grammatical gender and what effects it has in languages that see nouns as masculine, feminine, or neuter. Some also parse nouns even further, such as specifying large things, or vegetables, or non-human animals. Experimental results give insights into the kinds of associations speakers make when nouns are masculine or feminine. For instance, the word “bridge” is feminine in German (die Brüke) but masculine in Spanish (el puente). When asked to describe the attributes of bridges Germans tended to use words such as slender or graceful, while Spaniards used words like strong. It’s not an earth-shaking revelation, but an interesting insight into the intersections of language, culture, and thought.I picked this book up because the subject sounded interesting, and was surprised at how readable it was. The author’s writing style is clear and non-technical, and he makes good use of social and historical background to add context to the discussion, and clearly explains the findings and implications of the studies and experiments he describes. I saw that he has another book that sounds interesting, The Unfolding of Language: An Evolutionary Tour of Mankind's Greatest Invention, and I added it to my to-read list.* “In German...there are at least seven different ways of forming the plurals: some nouns, like Auto, add an -s just like in English; others, such as “horse,” add an -e (Pferd, Pferde); nouns like “hero” add an -en (Held, Helden); nouns like “egg” add -er (Ei, Eier); nouns like “bird” do not add a suffix at all but rather change a vowel inside the word (Vogel, Vögel); some nouns, like “grass” change the vowel and add a suffix (Gras, Gräser); and finally some nouns, like “window” don’t change anything at all (Fenster, Fenster).” (p. 106)"
21,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5807483-rajaie-al-matrood,5,"This was written just before I finished reading the book: I'm close to finishing a book named Through The Language Glass, written by Guy Deutscher. Since the book actually deals with linguistics, I Thought it would be academic and not suitable for those not familiar with the field. It turned out, however, that the book is well-explained, simple and actually funny in some parts. Basically, what the book is talking about is the relationship between the language and the person's pattern of thinking; whether your mother language actually affects how you think. He provides well-structured arguments, as well as experiments, and explains them in a simple way. For example, one of the arguments is about gender and its association with language. In some languages (Arabic, for example), we assign pronouns even for inanimate objects as for males and females, so we say about the sun الشمس غابت or القمر غاب. There might be no system of which objects are referred to be males and females, but does this actually affect the way we think about these objects? Yes, actually it does. In an experiment, inanimate objects were assigned each with a name, and the people in the experiment were asked to remember a list of these objects by the names assigned. For example, 'apples' was a given a name, 'Claudia', and the name 'Claudio' was given to 'a bridge,' and so on. In Spanish, an apple is a 'she' while a bridge is a 'he'. What happened is that these (Spanish) subjects were able to remember the names of objects that were assigned to names of the same 'gender', while they failed to remember the names of those that do not correspond. This is just an example from the book, the book actually contains many more. I enjoyed the book and would definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in linguistics. "
22,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,4,"This is an interesting enjoyable book. It argues that language can shape our perceptions and views of the world without going so far as to say that languages are indicative of intelligence and the like. It certainly seems a better argument than saying that language has no impact on world view or perception. Perhaps the best summation is that languages can require people to phrase things to be clearly understood in a particular language in ways that might not matter in other languages which have a different emphasis. This book is also enjoyable in that it pokes fun at linguistics, particularly the textbooks…every discipline ought to make fun of its textbooks and journal articles for being either inane or incomprehensibility masquerading as learned intelligence. The jokes about German are also humorous. That said, the riting is readable and clear and the overall components of the argument are nicely delimited. All in all, I give this book a 4. I enjoyed the humor and writing, plus the argument makes sense. No major flaws here though I doubt I’ll reread the book.  "
23,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19603487-pep-bonet,4,"Probably you must be mad at languages to read this book. I couldn't help telling my wife about this and that I had just read and she rolled her eyes wondering how on earth this could be interesting for anybody. But I swear, it is. Lots of words just to discuss two simple things: why do people see colour differently? Was Homer colour-blind? Why does he almost never mention the blue colour in the Odyssey, which happens mostly on the sea? and does the language you speak influence your thought?The book is well documented and is extremely well written. Deutscher can be funny and keeps you reading even when the subject is whether, when moving, we have a bodycentric thinking or we rather use external fixed references (North, south, etc.)."
24,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4026072-kim,4,"A fascinating book on the links between language and culture that sets out to prove that language can impact on the way we think. There is quite a heavy emphasis on colour (some of which is difficult to comprehend as a colourblind person) but there's also sections on spacial orientation and gender.The book is well written and manages to make what could be very dry become easily accessible without being patronising. There's a few humourous inserts throughout and I never felt overwhelmed with technical linguist jargon.A well written, well researched book I encourage those who want to understand more about language and the human mind to give it a try."

I must re-read this gem and give it a proper review. The coolest chapter is on Russians, naturally, right? He explains how different language speakers indicate colour categories differently on an artist's spectrum. I started his other book, ""The Unfolding of Language."" Also a great read. His writing style is witty, fun and informative a bit similar to David Sacks, David Crystal or Oliver Sacks."
26,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139691-william-herschel,4,"Through the Language Glass starts on a hefty quest, to convince us that one's native tongue does in fact influence how one sees the world. You can tell the author is cautious. In fact, he spends the whole first half of the book detailing the history of people in the past trying to answer questions about how language develops (a result of nature or culture) and if people see the world differently because of their language so he can demonstrate the past errors in what people thought and avoid them in his own questioning. The history was the most interesting part of the book.The author seems to make his premise sound more grand than it sounds. No wonder he was so cautious. While very interesting, I am having trouble seeing why this is of any significance. I kind of walk away thinking, well so what? The author set me up for more but I should have tread in his caution. Any thought can be expressed in any language and is capable of being understood. The difference is that languages very much differ in grammar and what is required of one to say. Really, his ideas are more moderate than one-sided (culture and nature both play a role) in the development of, say, which colours develop names in a language.So, thoroughly interesting, but I think if the book had some other aim it would have done a better job."

28,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77509854-jules,2,"I finished reading this yesterday evening and it left me with a big ‚So what?‘ in my head. The title claimed that the book would explain why the world looks different in other languages (sounds interesting doesn’t it?) but besides 3 very specific and narrow hypotheses, that may point in this direction (two of which were already known to me), I am none the wiser.Communications is what I do for a living so language naturally interests me. Maybe this is why I feel that - given the title - this book could have been much more, alas it felt like a very long ramble that never got to the point. Deutscher starts with a part about how we name and perceive colors that was rather interesting (even if I felt that it could have done with 20 instead of 100 pages), and goes on to give information about geographical orientation and gender (in nouns). That those two concepts differ wildly among languages was not new to me, as I do speak more than one and am a German native speaker (hence actively use different grammatical concepts like gender in nouns). And that was really all there was, mixed in with some anecdotes and history fluff.One thing that particularly left me bewildered is the use of words like savages and primitive peoples. Shouldn’t a linguist of all people be aware of the power of language and maybe use less offending vocabulary? I generally got uncomfortable when the book talked about the languages of indigenous people as I felt the writing to be rather derogatory between the lines. All in all I still don’t know if people see the world differently if they have another mother tongue. I lean on the ‚only slightly‘ end of the spectrum, but this is definitely my own experience and not something I took away from this book."
29,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10424758-zoe,2,"I may be a bit late to the game - this book was published in 2010 when I was mid-degree in Modern Languages and there was a fair deal of hype around this book and Deutscher's hypotheses. His musings about the ungi, unga, susungu of the Bellonese language, leading into a supposition that we as English-speakers in economically developed contexts fail to see the intricacies of these peoples and tongues beyond a limited complexity we came to in our own minds, if we are not academic linguists.“Ask Joe the Plumber, Piers the Ploughman, or Tom the Piper’s Son what sort of languages the half-naked tribes in the Amazonian rainforest speak, and they will undoubtedly tell you that ‘primitive people speak primitive languages.’ Ask professional linguist the same question, and they’ll say something quite different.”Now I may have the title “Multilingual Professional” in my LinkedIn profile, but I am a far cry from a “professional” of sorts, certainly not considered so in the realm of academia. Much of my understanding of language — beyond the study of foreign languages—comes from vocational qualifications and self-taught study of phonology and grammar. I detest the assumption that Deutscher makes about working-class or non-academic people make (that ""lesser economically developed peoples"" are considered ""more primitive"" in nature.) You might call this wishful thinking, but I like to believe that the working man (or woman) inherits more in rhetoric from the dominant classes than what comes from their own ignorance. Myself a first-generation undergraduate from a working-class family in a relatively deprived area of the north, I believe that many working-class people of lower economic status see less value and importance in conventional economic development when it often sees them on the poverty line.And while I recognise that Deutscher does go on to defend these lesser known peoples and languages from such ridicule, he fails to understand that this is not merely an attitude of ‘uneducated workers,’ as he could have argued about those interviewed in 1960s Australia, but society as a whole, whose racist attitudes trickle down from — the only thing that does trickle down. Those Australians, and their views on Aboriginal peoples will stem from an entire culture and society that dehumanised Indigenous people, one that all White colonisers were guilty of, most importantly those at the top, who incredibly often left “uneducated” working classes behind.Deutscher’s reluctance to drop the ‘Joe, Piers or Tom’ analogy for the rest of the chapter — Tom, Dick or Harry would’ve been better, let’s be honest — irks me to no end. Similarly, it’s incredibly annoying that he judges academics who make sweeping statements that aren’t backed up by evidence when he falls into the same trap himself merely pages later. To keep referring to societies as ‘simple’ and ‘complex’ (p113) when he himself rebukes these ideas makes me skeptical of anything else he comes up with. I struggled to enjoy the rest of the book after this."
30,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,3," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com I bought this book on February 1st at a bookstore in Aachen, Germany, during what they called 'Bye Bye-Brexit rabat' (Bye Bye Brexit Sale) which was 20% discount on all English books. Obviously, I couldn't resist. I went on to convince the book club I recently joined to read it as our next read, but unfortunately because of the entire Covid19 situation, we haven't had the possibility to discuss the book. I now feel a little bit sorry for them, as the book was not really what I hoped it would be. The subject fascinates me. When I was a small child, growing up speaking Dutch, for a time I believed (I am embarrassed to admit) that everyone always thought in Dutch, but that two French people for example, would then decide to speak French to each other. I quickly learned this was not the case, but it kept me interested in how someones language might influence how people think. Which is why I wanted to read Through the Language Glass.The author himself is very much interested in colors. And a large part of the book is in fact about the evolution of the naming of colors in languages. While interesting, I thought it was rather a bit too extensive. The remainder of the book was filled with some interesting facts, which might come to use at a pub quiz but the argument for the influence between language and thought was never very strong. Most interestingly I found the argument that some languages are forcing people to convey information in a certain sentence that other do not. For example, if your languages has changing verbs announcing how certain you are something happened, you have to think about it before making that sentence. If you have different verbs for something that happened one day or a week ago, again you have to think about. Same for languages who unlike English have gendered words. Ultimately, the effect that was measured was rather small, I'd argue. While difficult to measure objectively, is thinking colors are further apart from each other when they cross an arbitrary color-name boundary something that is important enough to consider this a significant effect of language on thought? I am not convinced. "
31,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"My interest in  Through the Language Glass came from a conversation with a friend about how the color blue was relatively recent 'invention.' This was not that the color blue didn't exist in antiquity, but rather that it didn't go by that name. How then, did the ancients view blue? How did they view colors? Like most things, there's a book for that. Through the Language Glass not only delves into the complicated world of how language and culture affects how we organize colors, and perhaps even how we see them, but also how the science of how we perceive color and name it developed over time. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is also delved into, as are the multitude of problems with it and where they just may have gotten things right. This book is dense with information, riveting in what new discoveries and alternative hypotheses it discusses, and rife with good humor. While this book was a dry read at times, it was one I could not put down for the sheer interesting nature of all it discusses. It's a shame that so much of these topics have yet to be thoroughly discussed, but this book seems to be bringing glad tidings of a shift in focus that is more welcoming towards how culture affects language and perception."

Well, disappointed in what I read ... the book focused almost exclusively on color, and how the way we describe or see color is related to language. The author is color-blind, I believe, which I suppose explains this. However, I was expecting a book about how we *feel* different when we switch from one language to another, and that's not what this was. On the other hand, I am also somewhat relieved that the book isn't what I thought, since that's the book that I've been wanting to write. Guess I can still do that, since Guy Deutscher didn't ....."

39,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages"".There is a cluster of myths about language, referred to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that looms large over this book. If you have ever heard that the Eskimo had 50 (or 500) words for snow, and that what language you speak determines how you think, you have heard echoes of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The author of this book is one of the first to tiptoe back into the blast crater that was left when the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was exploded a century ago.In its more extreme form, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (named for a couple early scholars in the study of languages) asserts that because different languages have different words for things, and some concepts which have a name in one language do not have a name in others (e.g. schadenfreude), the language(s) you speak can determine what concepts you are able to think. For example, Eskimos can (allegedly) notice all the many shades of difference between one type of snow and another (hard packed, fused to ice, tiny and 'dry' like powder, big wet flakes, etc.), because they have words for them, and we cannot.Leaving aside whether or not the Inuit languages have many more words for snow than others (the answer appears to be complicated, but essentially 'not really'), there is another flaw with this, and 'schadenfreude' is a good illustration of it. First off, even though English had no word for 'taking joy in the misfortunes of others', we had no problem stealing it from German, and this is not only something that English does. Second, do we really believe that an english speaker in the years prior to this did not understand that sometimes a person would take joy in the downfall of another? You don't need a word or phrase for 'esprit de corps' to understand that morale is important, and if you have common enough occasion to refer to it, you can invent a word in any language.Moreover, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was one of several justifications given for policies like taking Australian Aborigines or Native Americans children from their homes and making them speak English, so it acquired a bit of a moral taint. Believing that the language you speak influences what you think became not just a scientific question, but a bit of a moral one as well, and any answer other than 'of course not' was morally suspect.Deutscher (a native speaker of Hebrew, by the way) is ready to risk such an accusation, but he first has to spend a chapter or two explaining what Sapir-Whorf was, why it wasn't true, and otherwise reassuring us that he doesn't think all children should be forced to speak one language on the grounds that it is culturally more refined. Having done that, he begins the exploration of this minefield by talking about the relatively objectively measurable topic of color.My favorite factoid from this book: there are languages in the world (several, it turns out) which have only two words for color (which correspond more or less to 'black' and 'white'). In these languages, the sky is black (except when it's covered with clouds, in which case it's white), and the leaves of plants are white. Stunned anthropologists spent a couple generations in remote villages or travelling with hunter/gatherers, and asking them to compare and label colored tiles or swatches of cloth, and determined that the people who spoke these languages were not colorblind, they just honestly didn't see the need for more words for color than this.The reason seems to be that there just isn't much need for words for color, until you have dyes, paints, markers, and other ways of routinely making a given thing one color or another. If all plants are green, why do you need to say the 'green plant'? You can just say 'plant'. If a fruit can only either be green (when it's not ripe) or red (when it's ripe), you can just say 'ripe' (or 'not ripe'), and there's no great need for a word for the color. It's rather like how we don't have words for smell, really, we mostly just say 'smells like coffee' or 'smells like flowers', or some other simile. We don't add fragrances to things (routinely), they mostly just smell how they smell, so we don't need to say 'hand me the coffee-smelling hammer, not the flowery-smelling one'. We just say 'hand me the hammer', and what smell it has is irrelevant.There are also languages which have three words for color: black, white, and red. There are several of these, not all related. What's interesting is that there aren't any with words for black, white, and blue, or black, white, and green. If there is a third and final color name, and you ask speakers to point to the tile which best epitomizes that color, they will point to the red one.Languages with four colors will have black, white, red, and either yellow or green, and languages with a fifth word for color will have both yellow and green. Blue is apparently not all that important to humans, and only languages with at least six words for color will be able to say that the sky is blue. Before that, apparently, you just note that the sky is clear, and get on with life without bothering about what color that is. One wonders what small children can pester their parents about if they can't ask why the sky is blue (I bet they manage).Having demonstrated that languages can really be different, Deutscher moves on to his main thesis: languages do really change how we think, at least a little, but not based on what they have words for. Rather, languages affect our thinking not in what they allow, but in what they require. There are languages where you do not refer to something being on your left or right; it must always be referred to as being on your north, south, or whatever. This REQUIRES the speaker to always be aware of which way is north, and to reflect this in their speech many times a day. When telling a story of something that happened to them, they must think about what direction they were facing when they told it. One might suspect that such people have a sense of direction much more developed than ours, and experiments prove that you are right. Wake such a person up from a deep sleeop in the middle of the night, and ask them what direction they were facing when they met their spouse for the first time decades before, and they will be able to tell you (although they may slap you upside the head first).There are many languages where nearly every noun is either masculine or feminine, and many others where a goodly percentage of inanimate objects are, and you have to reflect this in your word endings or choice of articles (e.g. which form of 'the' you use when speaking about 'the pine tree'). Ask speakers of German (where the word for 'bridge' is feminine) and Spanish (where it is masculine) to describe bridges, and the former will say that they are beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender, while the latter will say that they are big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and towering.Deutscher has several other such examples, with ample citations of published studies to back him up, and enough studies of Victorian scholars cavorting with savages to entertain a reader like me who is amused by the image of a bemused hunter regarding a box of colored tiles that the crazy white man wants to ask him questions about. The field he is involved in is still very immature, by his own admission. He compares it to trying to study the behavior of a corporation by camping outside the headquarters and monitoring which rooms are lit up for how many hours a day. But, if he and others succeed in at least legitimizing the question of how language influences the way we think, then it is possible that in a generation or two we may be in a position to say a lot more about it (in any language we care to use)."
40,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52711508-max-lauber,4,"This book offers a history of the often (and rightly) maligned Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and details how the notion that language shapes people's perception of the world became an *idea non grata*. Deutscher takes the reader from William Gladstone's 19th century analysis of Homer to state-of-the-art neurolinguistics research in order to not only show how language affects perception, but also to show that the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is mostly just a high-flying fantasy. To summarize it in a sentence, Deutscher argues that culture, i.e. language, has a stronger effect on our thinking than we are comfortable to admit, but that the impact of language on thought is very different from what it was believed to be in the past.Specifically, he argues that there is no evidence that our mother tongue constrains our cognitive capacity or that it imposes limits on what we can understand. In other words, he says the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is bunk. Instead, he argues that ""the real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us - all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself"". He summarizes this idea in what he calls the Boas-Jakobson principle: Languages differ essentially in what they must convey, not in what they may convey.By surveying not only current research, but also methodologies and findings from the past 200 years, Deutscher makes a very plausible claim for the Boas-Jakobson principle and for his rejection of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and the linguistic dogma that language does not fundamentally affect the way we think. Although there is no dearth of substance in this book, Deutscher shines more brightly when it comes to style. He has a knack for explaining the history of ideas (particularly when it comes to the history of color and perception) and dropping quirky anecdotes at the right moment (i.e. almost all the time). In short, this is an engaging read that offers a rather nuanced take on one of the thorniest linguistic questions. As such, definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."
41,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about language, mostly because the information provided is done so with great verve and charm by the author. His chatty style is most disarming — this is a man who knows how to educate his readers almost effortlessly: he will occasionally lead you astray deliberately, so that he can later point out what further research has revealed. And it is quite rewarding!This book limits itself to three specific aspects of language: the words used in languages for colour; the method used in various cultures and languages for orientation of oneself within the world; and an examination of the use of 'gender' in many languages (with English being one of the few that seems to particularly eschew this quality). The overall objective seems to be that from his studies Deutscher tends to believe that, as the title tells us, the world does look different in other languages. He tends to leave it at that: to argue as to how different that world is, and whether this indicates anything further with regard to science, philosophy, religion, culture, etc. are obviously left for others to ponder.I used quotes around the word 'gender' above because it was in this section (entitled ""Sex and Syntax"") that I was not completely convinced by his argument. He uses the example of a poem by Heine in which a pine tree in the North dreams of a palm tree 'far in the East', and points out that in the original German language a pine tree is a masculine word, while a palm tree is a feminine word — thus there is a 'sexual overtone' found in the original which a simple English translation would fail to communicate. He seems to argue that this lack of gender makes English less rich in its connotations. (It also explains why often enough learners of English from a country where words have a sexual distinction applied to them will often make 'mistakes' with personal pronouns, and will apply them 'incorrectly' to English words: in other words, they are still thinking of a word in the sex of their original language.) What bothers me about this is that my background is Italian, a language which has male and female words, but I can never remember thinking that they had an actual sexual connotation. For example, the word for a fork in Italian is feminine, but it does not mean that there are sexual connotations connected to a fork. Maybe I am being too precious about this, but it did make me wonder about whether Deutscher's 'smooth talking' might not mask other aspects which might not be 'quite right'…Be that as it may, the book is still quite a wonderful read for anyone interested in languages in general."
42,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10298127-anne,0,"I can't really review this book, because if I'd known anything about linguistics, I wouldn't have to read this in the first place. But I'll give it a try.Through the Language Glass is a popular science book for people interested in how language and perception of reality work. It is easy to read (but not too easy) and Guy Deutscher uses interesting examples to show how differences between languages can cause (ever so tiny) differences in perception. He is quite critical of people jumping to conclusions, so this book doesn't convince you of some radical idea that your reality is completely different from that of someone with a different mother tongue. Instead, it shows how things like colour perception, grammatical gender, and direction through left-right or east-west can have a tiny influence on your sense of the world, if only because when tested, people who are confronted with something that clashes with their language's 'settings' take a tiny bit more time than others.So the good part is that he doesn't try to shove crazy theories down your throat, but tries to remain critical. The bad part is that he seems either to take pleasure in discrediting scientists who were wrong about things or that he just exaggerates for dramatic effect. Either way, not so great. In general, his tone is definitely less neutral than I would like, also when he talks about ""primitive tribes"" etc. He seems not to have fixed on one term that is satisfactory, and although he defends the complexity of their language, I think he is quite careless and unspecific (and a bit tactless) in his terms to describe these societies, and maybe he could have looked up anthropologists' terms and used those. I know it's a fluffy popular science book but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a more objective, scientific tone.If you're looking for a book that will convince you that language changes your reality or that it absolutely does not, this is not it. Deutscher uses three topics (colour, grammatical gender, direction) of which colour takes up the most space in the book. It was a nice read but if at all possible, it would have been nice to have some extra categories, and not just these three."
43,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"As other reviewers remarked, the title of this book is slightly misleading. A large part of the book deals with colours. How they are perceived, how their naming follows a similar pattern in most languages and why this is important. There are mentions of Homer and his ""wine coloured sea"", a pretty dense historical background and references to modern studies. This part I found most interesting, but it has not much to do with the fact that the world looks different in other languages. Because, in fact it does not.Other chapters explain that languages have very little influence on thoughts and that grammar is the only constraint to the way we express ourselves. People understand basic concepts more or less in the same way, but they have different grammar rules to express them. More than language, what shapes their thoughts is their culture.There is also some debate about the fact that we change slightly, when we speak a foreign language. Much is said about languages that have masculine and feminine nouns and those that have not. Personally, I speak four languages quite fluently and I must confess I never noticed any major change of personality when I switch from Italian to English, to French or Portuguese. But maybe it is just me. The absence of ""gender"" in English nouns is actually much welcomed, since I must deal with random feminine and masculine in the other three languages I know.For those not familiar, I can assure you it is pretty annoying having to learn that ""la fleur"" is feminine in French and ""a viagem"" is feminine in Portuguese, while both are masculine in Italian (""il fiore"",""il viaggio""). The total lack of logic of assigning genders to nouns can be mind-blowing, but still does not interfere with the fact that when I see a flower I know it is a flower and not a cat – whether I think in Italian, French, English or Portuguese."
44,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"This book uses three 'case studies' (colour, gender and spacial awareness) to look at how language affects our view of the world, our thinking and our memory.The first third of the book looks in depth at the history of the study of how colour is described by various international and classical cultures and how the differences have been (miss)interpreted by an assortment of learned gentlemen over the years. This gives a very nice springboard to the reader to see the types of pitfalls that such studies can fall into and prepare the ground for the second part of the book.The second section of the book goes into more depth on the subject of 'how can we study whether linguistic differences really affect our minds and the way they work?'. The Australian (and other) tribes that do all their directions in North, South, East and West rather than ever using left, right, in front or behind, were new to me and absolutely fascinating. Deutscher writes in an easily accessible style adding plenty of actual data from studies without letting it overwhelm the greater story. I felt that the arguments for and against certain viewpoints were well rehearsed in a relatively light hearted non-judgemental way that left one feeling enlightened and amused. This book has re-enforced my view that the human minds and human cultures are totally fascinating in their infintie variety, and left me looking for more non fiction in a similar vein. I have a few other books lined up. I hope they are as good. "
45,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"I enjoyed this book. The title for me was a bit misleading, at least for the first part of the book, which was mostly about out color sense and how we perceive colors and the role that language plays in that perception. I was not expecting this and so it threw me off a bit but the author’s excellent writing style quickly had me feeling at ease.About the writing style, it is relaxed and playful. The author is a punster and the book is littered with witty puns throughout (even the appendix has a pun thrown in) but this doesn’t take away from the excellent scientific research that is conveyed. I especially liked the second part of the book and the fascinating story of the Guugu Yimithirr, a group of native peoples whose language reflects the geography of the world. Where I (and most other people I know) use our bodies as the starting point for explaining directions to other people, the Guugu Yimithirr use the cardinal points of a compass, so that if I see a bug on your left foot I would state that, whereas a Guugu Yimithirr person would say that you have a bug on your ""West"" foot (if he was facing South and you were facing him.) This was amazing to me, and the author describes other equally fascinating cultures that use geography to describe the world. I have a lousy sense of direction but not so these other peoples, and this kind of thinking is not as rare as you would imagine.All in all, I feel this is an excellent book and would like to read it again to catch the things I missed. Highly recommended. "
46,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745423-simon,4,"One small criticism first: this was in some ways less far-ranging and comprehensive than I'd imagined, focussing on just three aspects of language and the perception of reality - colour, gender and spatial relations. And the sections on colour account for almost half the book. This can be forgiven as these are the only areas in which any serious and conclusive research has been done.But once you get past that narrowing of the scope, this is a still an eye-opening and enormously readble book, full of fascinating details and vividly described characters. What makes it work best is Deutscher's skill as a storyteller, with early sections tracing the historical development of theories about ancient Greeks' colour perception at times read like a particularly engrossing thriller (no, really). Deutscher is also a skilled prose writer, and not above slipping in the occasional linguistic witticism, but only where appropriate and never coming across as clever for its own sake.Highly recommended."

While the famous Sapir-Whorf thesis has been debunked (and is a bit of an embarrassment for linguists), in the end it seems that language and our thinking *do* have have some influence upon each other.I enjoyed the discussion of Homer and the weird usage of colors, and the way some Australian tribes use an absolute (well, with earth as the frame of reference) coordinate system rather than 'left of me', 'in front of me' etc.Also interesting was the discussion of the Matsés people of the Amazon. Their language has a built-in concept of evidentiality -- every time they say anything about anything, their language requires them to express the amount of evidence for the statement -- 'seen with my own eyes' until 'mere hearsay' paper. A great idea -- maybe we should import that concept in our languages as well?"

He gives a careful dissecting of Whorfianism and showing why he's not defending that (a good debate strategy, to be sure); however, other works argue that the evidence presented therein really does have cause and effect backwards (as far as language and thought). I would strongly recommend reading this in conjunction with Christine Kennealy's ""The First Word"" and Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought,"" and drawing your own conclusions, assuming of course you're a linguistics nerd and have a lot of time on your hands. This, you'll get through fairly quickly: Pinker especially, though, will take you some chewing."

55,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23180960-stephen-case,3,"It started with a conversation with a student, who said he had read an article explaining that the color blue never appeared in ancient Greek writings. That led to some internet searching, and I quickly found this book, which claims to be a treatment of this puzzle and turns out to be an explanation of the way language shapes the way we see the world. Do people who speak different languages actually see the world differently? Or in other words, how much does the structure of our language mirror or constrain the structure of our thought?Deutscher-- a linguist with an axe to grind against some of the contemporary views in the field-- starts the exploration of this question with its most interesting manifestation: color. The realization that there was something strange going on in ancient accounts of color goes back to the philhellene and sometimes Prime Minister William Gladstone who noticed that blue never appears in Homer's writings. The sea and sky are not referred to as blue, and other colors are also used in questionable ways. Other researchers into ancient texts discovered similar things: many ancient languages didn't have a word for blue. Indeed, there seemed to be a order of appearance in which ""primitive"" languages (and the author offers examples of some contemporary languages as well) distinguish between dark and light and lump all colors together as reddish. Eventually words for yellows and browns appear and finally terms that distinguish between greens and blues. The differentiation of blue usually comes last, and there are still signs of this, for instance, in the fact that in old Japanese the word for blue and green is the same.What does this mean? Early theories speculated that there was an actual physiological evolution taking place, that as humans became less primitive their eyes developed to perceive a wider spectrum of colors. Modern genetics and tests on speakers who languages currently lack certain color words has disproven this. Ancient Greek eyes were the same as ours. But did their lack of names for certain colors shape the way they perceived the world? This is the crux of the author's question: do we really see things if we don't have words to express them? I explored this once in a story published in Daily Science Fiction. Does naming something make it more real or at least more readily apparent?Part of the argument for color goes something like this. In primitive civilizations color doesn't matter a whole lot, and certain colors are rarely perceived on their own. Red is the color of blood, so a word to distinguish this comes fairly early in most cultures. But there are no large blue animals, few blue flowers, and blue dye was very difficult to make and unknown in many cultures. (Egypt was an exception, and apparently ancient Egyptian had a word for blue.) Because of this, there was no social or linguistic need to distinguish or name this hue. But what about the sea and the sky? The sea rarely looks straightforwardly blue, and the sky-- when completely clear-- was simply the sky. Since there was no cultural need to distinguish its color, it was simply the sky.The first half of the book is an investigation of the history of the color question, and if you're not quite satisfied with the answer I've given (and I'm not sure I am), you might not be satisfied with this portion of the book. For Deutscher though, color simply sets up the bigger question: how do we determine-- and then empirically test-- whether language actually shapes our perception and our thought processes? Are certain concepts (like ""The sky is blue"") simply inexpressible in some languages? Does this mean speakers of those languages are unable to conceive of certain statements and concepts? Deutscher's answer is no to these last two questions but a cautious yes to the first.An older, stronger claim would answer the final question of the above paragraph in the affirmative: language constrains thought. Because the Hopi Indians, for instance, have no verb tense in their language or expressions of time, they cannot perceive time as linear. Because other Native American languages do not distinguish between verb and subject, speakers of these languages have a more monistic, unified of nature. Deutscher disagrees and takes obvious pleasure in demolishing these claims, maintaining instead that any concept can be expressed in any language. His alternate claim is more subtle: it's not that some languages make it impossible to perceive or conceive certain things; rather, his claim is that certain languages obligate speakers to always be thinking of certain things.What does this mean? The author provides three examples. The first is that of a particular well-studied Australian aboriginal language that does not possess an egocentric coordinate system (i.e. behind, in front, left, right) but only an absolute system (north, east, south, west). Every positional expression voiced in this language, from things as simple as ""There's a bug beside your foot"" have to be given in terms of cardinal directions. (""There's a bug north of your foot."") This means that speakers of the language always have a sense of these directions from a very young age, and their experiences and memories are seen through that directional lens. The author discusses a variety of experiments in which it's shown that speakers of this language can recall details in this coordinate system, recounting orientations of experiences from years ago. (To put this in perspective, try calling up a particularly vivid memory and expressing it in terms of cardinal directions. Were you standing to the north or south of your spouse when you got married?) The language obligates its speakers to always have cardinal directions in mind and thus shapes their perceptions of the world accordingly.Languages with no egocentric coordinate system though are comparatively rare, so the author's second example is closer to home: languages like German or Spanish or many more with a developed gender system. In English-- at least since the century or so after the Norman Conquest, as the author points out in a fascinating historical treatment-- does not oblige its speakers to assign genders to inanimate objects. Yet many other modern languages do. Not much study has yet been done, according to Deutscher, on how this influences the thoughts of speakers of these languages, but he illustrates some of the implications with an example of the role this plays in translation and the subtle nuances and relations that can be lost moving from a gendered to a largely non-gendered language.Finally, he returns to color. Does our language's names for colors-- and the fact that these names don't exist in certain other languages-- influence the way we perceive the world? Recent studies, the author argues, indicate that yes, it does. He takes the case of light blue and dark blue, which in Russian have separate names. An English speaker would perceive these as shades of the same color. For a Russian speaker they would be separate colors. If this was indeed the case, one could expect that this linguistic obligation (that of the Russian speaker to give these separate hues different names) would allow Russians to more quickly distinguish between similar shades of blue if they lay on opposite sides of this distinction, in a similar manner to how an English speaker could more readily distinguish between greenish-blue and bluish-green than a speaker of a language that does not differentiate between green and blue. The author relates in detail the set-up of experiments to determine just that, which show the language-processing region of the brain active even when actively naming the hues was not part of the experiment. Russian speakers consistently differentiated between close shades of blue more quickly than English speakers.What does all this mean? It comes back to the central claim of the book, that languages, by obligating their speakers to pay attention to certain things in their structure, can function as a lens by which their speakers perceive the world.Consider this analogy (not given in the book): if your language has several different expressions for snow, so that each time you talk about snow you're obligated to take into consideration things like whether it's falling or on the ground, how long it's been on the ground, what its thickness and consistency is, then when you look at snow (or call up a memory containing snow) you're going to have a richer perception of the object than an English speaker who encapsulates all the varieties of snow under a single word. That doesn't mean that an English speaker can't conceptualize or express these nuances of snow. It just means her language doesn't habituate her to these perceptions.In these (possibly over-simplified) terms, Deutscher's argument seems almost self-evident, but the richness of his treatment comes in the historical and linguistic background he provides while exploring this idea and especially in his explanations of the rigor and structure of the experiments devised to verify such apparently straightforward claims about language and how it shapes our perceptions of the world."
56,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3514657-aya-zain,4,"The blurb of this book excited me so much. I've always wondered whether language has an influence on our intentions, our implications, and our culture. But Guy Deutscher made me think of the reverse scenario: that culture has had an impact on language, and that language is enforced every day thus leaving us no choice but to express ourselves in a somewhat outdated mode. Let me illustrate that further.I'm not sure what my mother tongue is. I'm of Arab descent, so it should be Arabic, however I was born and raised overseas where I focused on learning English instead. I became advanced in English and chose English as both a major and a minor for university, whereas my Arabic is intermediate to say the least. I can speak Arabic, but I always mess up the verb tenses -- feminine or masculine? So 'That table has a book on it' would turn into That (masculine) table (feminine) has a book on (feminine) it -- which is all incorrect, by the way! My Arabic just wasn't very good, and so I always confused the propositions and other articles.Arabic - like a few other languages - doesn't have gender neutrality, so that our every day language must determine what is masculine and what is feminine. And you can probably imagine that the more delicate inanimate objects usually took on the feminine form.Anyway - it goes further than that. And I once mentioned it to a high school classmate of mine in the 11th grade. I asked him: how come the verb conjugation of the plural masculine form gets a special (new and improved) conjugation, however the plural feminine verb conjugation is subjected to the same conjugation as the 'they' conjugation?He retaliated almost defensively, telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and that Arabic is the language of religion (Islam) and that I shouldn't challenge it because it is a flawless language. Which is exactly what is wrong with language -- he chose to take my argument personally as if it's offensive to his very nature. And that is exactly the problem.You can imagine how an every day reminder of what is feminine and what is masculine, or what is female and what is male has an impact on the way we perceive things. Take this for example: mowazafa (female office worker) and mowazaf (male office worker).Those involved in that sort of dialogue will have constant reminders to make gender distinctions, whether they like it or not. Their impressions are already preconceived when determining the nature of that thing they are referring to - be it female or male.I picked up on that because that's how I studied my subjects. I would put the information into images in my head and create a story, so it was easy to fall into the presumption that the feminine conjugation fell into the same category as the it conjugation due to sexist precursors.Arabic is not a flawless language. Arabic has stopped developing at one point in time, and refuses to change its methods to fit the modern-day society, and so people on some scale will be stuck expressing themselves in a language that doesn't fit a progressive society or lifestyle.If we try to think of ways to develop language so as to expand our neurological functions, we'll find that our cognitive abilities will also improve, thus making us smarter and more knowledgeable.I really like the examples that Deutscher drew out in his book, such as Guugu Yimithirr -- an Aboriginal Australian language that existed in Far North Queensland. They had the tendency to use the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) rather than egocentric coordinations (right, left, back and front). How does that make them see the world differently? They will never get lost. Even looking at Google Maps confuses me sometimes - am I supposed to turn a right or a left? However if my mind was brought up in the Gugu Ymithir community, I wouldn't have been so troubled as to figure out which direction to go. But then again, that could be just my terrible sense of direction.Another example was about the color blue. A mysterious color, in my opinion. It's barely seen in nature, yet it's everywhere. It's in the sky, it's in the sea that reflects the sky. However Deutscher mentions that when you take a look at Ancient literature, you'll find that the color blue is never mentioned. The sea is described as the color of wine, and the sky is not seen as blue. In daylight, it's white, and at night it's black. The word blue just wasn't necessary back then. However, now blue is everywhere, and the sky is just about as blue as the sea. We have so much blue that the Russians have not one, but two names for the color blue. They have two color distinctions that the average English speaker would call blue, but they call Siniy and Goluboy.  When taken in for experiments, it was found that the Russian speakers were able to distinguish between all colors faster than the English speakers did. This ability to perceive colors in a different way, while seeing the same colors, shows that language could really transform our potentials and increase our capabilities.Language is a dangerous weapon if not handled correctly. There has been no example of this though, so don't take my word on it. But I think that we can utilize language if we work on it meticulously to shape the society and the future that we want.Thanks Deutscher for such an informative book! There are so many great references in this book, and I was left with a lot more information on language than I had before."

That being said, at times this books felt a bit condescending. The tone that Mr. Deutscher uses comes across poorly, although I think it is unintentional. The condescending tone does not take away from the merit of the book, but it often left me feeling distracted by it."
58,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116092820-meg-briers,4,"A good read exploring how our mother tongue may be affecting our perceptions of colour, gender and space/coordinate system. A nice crossover between the fields of linguistics and psychology that really made you think about language and how it's having an influence on your day to day life. Very informative and gave a lot of new information without making the language too inaccessible as many other similar books seem to do, quite a nice gentle read!"
59,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"Guy Deutscher's Through the Language Glass, which looks at the relationship between language, culture and perception, wasn't quite what I'd expected. Honestly, I'd expected a variation of that old chestnut on the Eskimos having a gazillion words for the concept of ""snow"", to explain how our environment and culture shapes the language we speak. Deutscher's book surpassed those expectations. There are a few painful moments in the book, when Deutscher attempts to make some witty puns (this is a book on language after all). Wannabe gems like ""In their pronouncements on language, culture and thought, it seems that big thinkers in their grandes oeuvres have not always risen much above little thinkers over their hors d'oeuvres."" Or how about ""All the facts mentioned so far about the cones in the retina are correct to the best of my knowledge. But if you are under the impression that they actually explain our sensation of colour, then you have been coned!"" Do I detect some eye rolling here? But things look up once Deutscher gets serious. Dismissing many of the common fallacies or accepted wisdoms in linguistics - like how all languages are equally complex (how does one measure complexity? how do you trade off complexity in morphology against complexity in syntax, grammar rules, etc?) - Deutscher makes a tight and convincing case for what we can conclude about language. We can summarise the main thrusts of this case with the following 3 points:1. While nature may set the boundaries of how we perceive and relate to the world (it doesn't make sense to use the same word to describe red dogs and red roses for instance), culture significantly influences how we navigate within those boundaries. A more refined colour vocabulary, or one that emphasises hue over brightness, will lead to differences in how colours are named and classified. 2. Languages vary considerable in the amount of information they convey within words - e.g. tense, person performing the action, singularity/plurality, distance, etc. There is an inverse correlation between the complexity of society and word structure as communication among intimates often allows more compact, terse ways of expressing oneself. Conversely, the greater the number of speakers, more explicit markers for providing context (e.g. prepositions, subordinate clauses) are required and simplification through bastardisation of the language also occurs. 3. Language influences us not so much in what we are allowed to think but in the ""kinds of information each language habitually obliges [us] to think about"", from the way we see spatial relationships, to the attributes that we associate objects with (depending on whether one's language assigns a gender to that object). ""When a language forces its speakers to pay attention to certain aspects of the world each time they open their mouths or prick up their ears, such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills"". There are many things in Deutscher's book that are thought provoking. But perhaps the point that struck me the most was just how much gets lost in translation, when the associations we make with certain words just disappear when transplanted into another linguistic framework. As Deutscher notes: ""But if you native speakers of English are tempted to feel sorry for those of us who are shackled by the heavy load of an irrational gender system, then think again. I would never want to change places with you...my world has so much to it that you entirely miss out on, because the landscape of my language is so much more fertile than your arid desert of 'it's'. It goes without saying that genders are language's gift to poets. Heine's masculine pine tree longs for the feminine palm; Boris Pasternak's My Sister Life can only work because 'life' is feminine in Russian; English translations of Charles Beaudelaire's 'L'homme et la mer', however inspired, can never hope to capture the tempestuous relationship of attraction and antagonism that he evokes between 'him' (the man) and 'her' (the sea); nor can English do justice to Pablo Neruda's 'Ode to the Sea', in which the (masculine) el mar strikes a stone (una piedra) and then 'he caresses her, kisses her, drenches her, pounds his chest, repeating his own name' - the English 'it caresses it, kisses it, drenches it, pounds its chest' is not quite the same."""
60,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,3," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com I bought this book on February 1st at a bookstore in Aachen, Germany, during what they called 'Bye Bye-Brexit rabat' (Bye Bye Brexit Sale) which was 20% discount on all English books. Obviously, I couldn't resist. I went on to convince the book club I recently joined to read it as our next read, but unfortunately because of the entire Covid19 situation, we haven't had the possibility to discuss the book. I now feel a little bit sorry for them, as the book was not really what I hoped it would be. The subject fascinates me. When I was a small child, growing up speaking Dutch, for a time I believed (I am embarrassed to admit) that everyone always thought in Dutch, but that two French people for example, would then decide to speak French to each other. I quickly learned this was not the case, but it kept me interested in how someones language might influence how people think. Which is why I wanted to read Through the Language Glass.The author himself is very much interested in colors. And a large part of the book is in fact about the evolution of the naming of colors in languages. While interesting, I thought it was rather a bit too extensive. The remainder of the book was filled with some interesting facts, which might come to use at a pub quiz but the argument for the influence between language and thought was never very strong. Most interestingly I found the argument that some languages are forcing people to convey information in a certain sentence that other do not. For example, if your languages has changing verbs announcing how certain you are something happened, you have to think about it before making that sentence. If you have different verbs for something that happened one day or a week ago, again you have to think about. Same for languages who unlike English have gendered words. Ultimately, the effect that was measured was rather small, I'd argue. While difficult to measure objectively, is thinking colors are further apart from each other when they cross an arbitrary color-name boundary something that is important enough to consider this a significant effect of language on thought? I am not convinced. "
61,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"My interest in  Through the Language Glass came from a conversation with a friend about how the color blue was relatively recent 'invention.' This was not that the color blue didn't exist in antiquity, but rather that it didn't go by that name. How then, did the ancients view blue? How did they view colors? Like most things, there's a book for that. Through the Language Glass not only delves into the complicated world of how language and culture affects how we organize colors, and perhaps even how we see them, but also how the science of how we perceive color and name it developed over time. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is also delved into, as are the multitude of problems with it and where they just may have gotten things right. This book is dense with information, riveting in what new discoveries and alternative hypotheses it discusses, and rife with good humor. While this book was a dry read at times, it was one I could not put down for the sheer interesting nature of all it discusses. It's a shame that so much of these topics have yet to be thoroughly discussed, but this book seems to be bringing glad tidings of a shift in focus that is more welcoming towards how culture affects language and perception."

Well, disappointed in what I read ... the book focused almost exclusively on color, and how the way we describe or see color is related to language. The author is color-blind, I believe, which I suppose explains this. However, I was expecting a book about how we *feel* different when we switch from one language to another, and that's not what this was. On the other hand, I am also somewhat relieved that the book isn't what I thought, since that's the book that I've been wanting to write. Guess I can still do that, since Guy Deutscher didn't ....."

69,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages"".There is a cluster of myths about language, referred to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that looms large over this book. If you have ever heard that the Eskimo had 50 (or 500) words for snow, and that what language you speak determines how you think, you have heard echoes of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The author of this book is one of the first to tiptoe back into the blast crater that was left when the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was exploded a century ago.In its more extreme form, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (named for a couple early scholars in the study of languages) asserts that because different languages have different words for things, and some concepts which have a name in one language do not have a name in others (e.g. schadenfreude), the language(s) you speak can determine what concepts you are able to think. For example, Eskimos can (allegedly) notice all the many shades of difference between one type of snow and another (hard packed, fused to ice, tiny and 'dry' like powder, big wet flakes, etc.), because they have words for them, and we cannot.Leaving aside whether or not the Inuit languages have many more words for snow than others (the answer appears to be complicated, but essentially 'not really'), there is another flaw with this, and 'schadenfreude' is a good illustration of it. First off, even though English had no word for 'taking joy in the misfortunes of others', we had no problem stealing it from German, and this is not only something that English does. Second, do we really believe that an english speaker in the years prior to this did not understand that sometimes a person would take joy in the downfall of another? You don't need a word or phrase for 'esprit de corps' to understand that morale is important, and if you have common enough occasion to refer to it, you can invent a word in any language.Moreover, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was one of several justifications given for policies like taking Australian Aborigines or Native Americans children from their homes and making them speak English, so it acquired a bit of a moral taint. Believing that the language you speak influences what you think became not just a scientific question, but a bit of a moral one as well, and any answer other than 'of course not' was morally suspect.Deutscher (a native speaker of Hebrew, by the way) is ready to risk such an accusation, but he first has to spend a chapter or two explaining what Sapir-Whorf was, why it wasn't true, and otherwise reassuring us that he doesn't think all children should be forced to speak one language on the grounds that it is culturally more refined. Having done that, he begins the exploration of this minefield by talking about the relatively objectively measurable topic of color.My favorite factoid from this book: there are languages in the world (several, it turns out) which have only two words for color (which correspond more or less to 'black' and 'white'). In these languages, the sky is black (except when it's covered with clouds, in which case it's white), and the leaves of plants are white. Stunned anthropologists spent a couple generations in remote villages or travelling with hunter/gatherers, and asking them to compare and label colored tiles or swatches of cloth, and determined that the people who spoke these languages were not colorblind, they just honestly didn't see the need for more words for color than this.The reason seems to be that there just isn't much need for words for color, until you have dyes, paints, markers, and other ways of routinely making a given thing one color or another. If all plants are green, why do you need to say the 'green plant'? You can just say 'plant'. If a fruit can only either be green (when it's not ripe) or red (when it's ripe), you can just say 'ripe' (or 'not ripe'), and there's no great need for a word for the color. It's rather like how we don't have words for smell, really, we mostly just say 'smells like coffee' or 'smells like flowers', or some other simile. We don't add fragrances to things (routinely), they mostly just smell how they smell, so we don't need to say 'hand me the coffee-smelling hammer, not the flowery-smelling one'. We just say 'hand me the hammer', and what smell it has is irrelevant.There are also languages which have three words for color: black, white, and red. There are several of these, not all related. What's interesting is that there aren't any with words for black, white, and blue, or black, white, and green. If there is a third and final color name, and you ask speakers to point to the tile which best epitomizes that color, they will point to the red one.Languages with four colors will have black, white, red, and either yellow or green, and languages with a fifth word for color will have both yellow and green. Blue is apparently not all that important to humans, and only languages with at least six words for color will be able to say that the sky is blue. Before that, apparently, you just note that the sky is clear, and get on with life without bothering about what color that is. One wonders what small children can pester their parents about if they can't ask why the sky is blue (I bet they manage).Having demonstrated that languages can really be different, Deutscher moves on to his main thesis: languages do really change how we think, at least a little, but not based on what they have words for. Rather, languages affect our thinking not in what they allow, but in what they require. There are languages where you do not refer to something being on your left or right; it must always be referred to as being on your north, south, or whatever. This REQUIRES the speaker to always be aware of which way is north, and to reflect this in their speech many times a day. When telling a story of something that happened to them, they must think about what direction they were facing when they told it. One might suspect that such people have a sense of direction much more developed than ours, and experiments prove that you are right. Wake such a person up from a deep sleeop in the middle of the night, and ask them what direction they were facing when they met their spouse for the first time decades before, and they will be able to tell you (although they may slap you upside the head first).There are many languages where nearly every noun is either masculine or feminine, and many others where a goodly percentage of inanimate objects are, and you have to reflect this in your word endings or choice of articles (e.g. which form of 'the' you use when speaking about 'the pine tree'). Ask speakers of German (where the word for 'bridge' is feminine) and Spanish (where it is masculine) to describe bridges, and the former will say that they are beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender, while the latter will say that they are big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and towering.Deutscher has several other such examples, with ample citations of published studies to back him up, and enough studies of Victorian scholars cavorting with savages to entertain a reader like me who is amused by the image of a bemused hunter regarding a box of colored tiles that the crazy white man wants to ask him questions about. The field he is involved in is still very immature, by his own admission. He compares it to trying to study the behavior of a corporation by camping outside the headquarters and monitoring which rooms are lit up for how many hours a day. But, if he and others succeed in at least legitimizing the question of how language influences the way we think, then it is possible that in a generation or two we may be in a position to say a lot more about it (in any language we care to use)."
70,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52711508-max-lauber,4,"This book offers a history of the often (and rightly) maligned Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and details how the notion that language shapes people's perception of the world became an *idea non grata*. Deutscher takes the reader from William Gladstone's 19th century analysis of Homer to state-of-the-art neurolinguistics research in order to not only show how language affects perception, but also to show that the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is mostly just a high-flying fantasy. To summarize it in a sentence, Deutscher argues that culture, i.e. language, has a stronger effect on our thinking than we are comfortable to admit, but that the impact of language on thought is very different from what it was believed to be in the past.Specifically, he argues that there is no evidence that our mother tongue constrains our cognitive capacity or that it imposes limits on what we can understand. In other words, he says the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is bunk. Instead, he argues that ""the real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us - all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself"". He summarizes this idea in what he calls the Boas-Jakobson principle: Languages differ essentially in what they must convey, not in what they may convey.By surveying not only current research, but also methodologies and findings from the past 200 years, Deutscher makes a very plausible claim for the Boas-Jakobson principle and for his rejection of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and the linguistic dogma that language does not fundamentally affect the way we think. Although there is no dearth of substance in this book, Deutscher shines more brightly when it comes to style. He has a knack for explaining the history of ideas (particularly when it comes to the history of color and perception) and dropping quirky anecdotes at the right moment (i.e. almost all the time). In short, this is an engaging read that offers a rather nuanced take on one of the thorniest linguistic questions. As such, definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."
71,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about language, mostly because the information provided is done so with great verve and charm by the author. His chatty style is most disarming — this is a man who knows how to educate his readers almost effortlessly: he will occasionally lead you astray deliberately, so that he can later point out what further research has revealed. And it is quite rewarding!This book limits itself to three specific aspects of language: the words used in languages for colour; the method used in various cultures and languages for orientation of oneself within the world; and an examination of the use of 'gender' in many languages (with English being one of the few that seems to particularly eschew this quality). The overall objective seems to be that from his studies Deutscher tends to believe that, as the title tells us, the world does look different in other languages. He tends to leave it at that: to argue as to how different that world is, and whether this indicates anything further with regard to science, philosophy, religion, culture, etc. are obviously left for others to ponder.I used quotes around the word 'gender' above because it was in this section (entitled ""Sex and Syntax"") that I was not completely convinced by his argument. He uses the example of a poem by Heine in which a pine tree in the North dreams of a palm tree 'far in the East', and points out that in the original German language a pine tree is a masculine word, while a palm tree is a feminine word — thus there is a 'sexual overtone' found in the original which a simple English translation would fail to communicate. He seems to argue that this lack of gender makes English less rich in its connotations. (It also explains why often enough learners of English from a country where words have a sexual distinction applied to them will often make 'mistakes' with personal pronouns, and will apply them 'incorrectly' to English words: in other words, they are still thinking of a word in the sex of their original language.) What bothers me about this is that my background is Italian, a language which has male and female words, but I can never remember thinking that they had an actual sexual connotation. For example, the word for a fork in Italian is feminine, but it does not mean that there are sexual connotations connected to a fork. Maybe I am being too precious about this, but it did make me wonder about whether Deutscher's 'smooth talking' might not mask other aspects which might not be 'quite right'…Be that as it may, the book is still quite a wonderful read for anyone interested in languages in general."
72,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10298127-anne,0,"I can't really review this book, because if I'd known anything about linguistics, I wouldn't have to read this in the first place. But I'll give it a try.Through the Language Glass is a popular science book for people interested in how language and perception of reality work. It is easy to read (but not too easy) and Guy Deutscher uses interesting examples to show how differences between languages can cause (ever so tiny) differences in perception. He is quite critical of people jumping to conclusions, so this book doesn't convince you of some radical idea that your reality is completely different from that of someone with a different mother tongue. Instead, it shows how things like colour perception, grammatical gender, and direction through left-right or east-west can have a tiny influence on your sense of the world, if only because when tested, people who are confronted with something that clashes with their language's 'settings' take a tiny bit more time than others.So the good part is that he doesn't try to shove crazy theories down your throat, but tries to remain critical. The bad part is that he seems either to take pleasure in discrediting scientists who were wrong about things or that he just exaggerates for dramatic effect. Either way, not so great. In general, his tone is definitely less neutral than I would like, also when he talks about ""primitive tribes"" etc. He seems not to have fixed on one term that is satisfactory, and although he defends the complexity of their language, I think he is quite careless and unspecific (and a bit tactless) in his terms to describe these societies, and maybe he could have looked up anthropologists' terms and used those. I know it's a fluffy popular science book but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a more objective, scientific tone.If you're looking for a book that will convince you that language changes your reality or that it absolutely does not, this is not it. Deutscher uses three topics (colour, grammatical gender, direction) of which colour takes up the most space in the book. It was a nice read but if at all possible, it would have been nice to have some extra categories, and not just these three."
73,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"As other reviewers remarked, the title of this book is slightly misleading. A large part of the book deals with colours. How they are perceived, how their naming follows a similar pattern in most languages and why this is important. There are mentions of Homer and his ""wine coloured sea"", a pretty dense historical background and references to modern studies. This part I found most interesting, but it has not much to do with the fact that the world looks different in other languages. Because, in fact it does not.Other chapters explain that languages have very little influence on thoughts and that grammar is the only constraint to the way we express ourselves. People understand basic concepts more or less in the same way, but they have different grammar rules to express them. More than language, what shapes their thoughts is their culture.There is also some debate about the fact that we change slightly, when we speak a foreign language. Much is said about languages that have masculine and feminine nouns and those that have not. Personally, I speak four languages quite fluently and I must confess I never noticed any major change of personality when I switch from Italian to English, to French or Portuguese. But maybe it is just me. The absence of ""gender"" in English nouns is actually much welcomed, since I must deal with random feminine and masculine in the other three languages I know.For those not familiar, I can assure you it is pretty annoying having to learn that ""la fleur"" is feminine in French and ""a viagem"" is feminine in Portuguese, while both are masculine in Italian (""il fiore"",""il viaggio""). The total lack of logic of assigning genders to nouns can be mind-blowing, but still does not interfere with the fact that when I see a flower I know it is a flower and not a cat – whether I think in Italian, French, English or Portuguese."
74,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"This book uses three 'case studies' (colour, gender and spacial awareness) to look at how language affects our view of the world, our thinking and our memory.The first third of the book looks in depth at the history of the study of how colour is described by various international and classical cultures and how the differences have been (miss)interpreted by an assortment of learned gentlemen over the years. This gives a very nice springboard to the reader to see the types of pitfalls that such studies can fall into and prepare the ground for the second part of the book.The second section of the book goes into more depth on the subject of 'how can we study whether linguistic differences really affect our minds and the way they work?'. The Australian (and other) tribes that do all their directions in North, South, East and West rather than ever using left, right, in front or behind, were new to me and absolutely fascinating. Deutscher writes in an easily accessible style adding plenty of actual data from studies without letting it overwhelm the greater story. I felt that the arguments for and against certain viewpoints were well rehearsed in a relatively light hearted non-judgemental way that left one feeling enlightened and amused. This book has re-enforced my view that the human minds and human cultures are totally fascinating in their infintie variety, and left me looking for more non fiction in a similar vein. I have a few other books lined up. I hope they are as good. "
75,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"I enjoyed this book. The title for me was a bit misleading, at least for the first part of the book, which was mostly about out color sense and how we perceive colors and the role that language plays in that perception. I was not expecting this and so it threw me off a bit but the author’s excellent writing style quickly had me feeling at ease.About the writing style, it is relaxed and playful. The author is a punster and the book is littered with witty puns throughout (even the appendix has a pun thrown in) but this doesn’t take away from the excellent scientific research that is conveyed. I especially liked the second part of the book and the fascinating story of the Guugu Yimithirr, a group of native peoples whose language reflects the geography of the world. Where I (and most other people I know) use our bodies as the starting point for explaining directions to other people, the Guugu Yimithirr use the cardinal points of a compass, so that if I see a bug on your left foot I would state that, whereas a Guugu Yimithirr person would say that you have a bug on your ""West"" foot (if he was facing South and you were facing him.) This was amazing to me, and the author describes other equally fascinating cultures that use geography to describe the world. I have a lousy sense of direction but not so these other peoples, and this kind of thinking is not as rare as you would imagine.All in all, I feel this is an excellent book and would like to read it again to catch the things I missed. Highly recommended. "
76,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745423-simon,4,"One small criticism first: this was in some ways less far-ranging and comprehensive than I'd imagined, focussing on just three aspects of language and the perception of reality - colour, gender and spatial relations. And the sections on colour account for almost half the book. This can be forgiven as these are the only areas in which any serious and conclusive research has been done.But once you get past that narrowing of the scope, this is a still an eye-opening and enormously readble book, full of fascinating details and vividly described characters. What makes it work best is Deutscher's skill as a storyteller, with early sections tracing the historical development of theories about ancient Greeks' colour perception at times read like a particularly engrossing thriller (no, really). Deutscher is also a skilled prose writer, and not above slipping in the occasional linguistic witticism, but only where appropriate and never coming across as clever for its own sake.Highly recommended."
77,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Book about the way language influences the way we think -- and vice-versa. While the famous Sapir-Whorf thesis has been debunked (and is a bit of an embarrassment for linguists), in the end it seems that language and our thinking *do* have have some influence upon each other.I enjoyed the discussion of Homer and the weird usage of colors, and the way some Australian tribes use an absolute (well, with earth as the frame of reference) coordinate system rather than 'left of me', 'in front of me' etc.Also interesting was the discussion of the Matsés people of the Amazon. Their language has a built-in concept of evidentiality -- every time they say anything about anything, their language requires them to express the amount of evidence for the statement -- 'seen with my own eyes' until 'mere hearsay' paper. A great idea -- maybe we should import that concept in our languages as well?"

The color chapters are by far the strongest (first and last). He gives a careful dissecting of Whorfianism and showing why he's not defending that (a good debate strategy, to be sure); however, other works argue that the evidence presented therein really does have cause and effect backwards (as far as language and thought). I would strongly recommend reading this in conjunction with Christine Kennealy's ""The First Word"" and Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought,"" and drawing your own conclusions, assuming of course you're a linguistics nerd and have a lot of time on your hands. This, you'll get through fairly quickly: Pinker especially, though, will take you some chewing."

85,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23180960-stephen-case,3,"It started with a conversation with a student, who said he had read an article explaining that the color blue never appeared in ancient Greek writings. That led to some internet searching, and I quickly found this book, which claims to be a treatment of this puzzle and turns out to be an explanation of the way language shapes the way we see the world. Do people who speak different languages actually see the world differently? Or in other words, how much does the structure of our language mirror or constrain the structure of our thought?Deutscher-- a linguist with an axe to grind against some of the contemporary views in the field-- starts the exploration of this question with its most interesting manifestation: color. The realization that there was something strange going on in ancient accounts of color goes back to the philhellene and sometimes Prime Minister William Gladstone who noticed that blue never appears in Homer's writings. The sea and sky are not referred to as blue, and other colors are also used in questionable ways. Other researchers into ancient texts discovered similar things: many ancient languages didn't have a word for blue. Indeed, there seemed to be a order of appearance in which ""primitive"" languages (and the author offers examples of some contemporary languages as well) distinguish between dark and light and lump all colors together as reddish. Eventually words for yellows and browns appear and finally terms that distinguish between greens and blues. The differentiation of blue usually comes last, and there are still signs of this, for instance, in the fact that in old Japanese the word for blue and green is the same.What does this mean? Early theories speculated that there was an actual physiological evolution taking place, that as humans became less primitive their eyes developed to perceive a wider spectrum of colors. Modern genetics and tests on speakers who languages currently lack certain color words has disproven this. Ancient Greek eyes were the same as ours. But did their lack of names for certain colors shape the way they perceived the world? This is the crux of the author's question: do we really see things if we don't have words to express them? I explored this once in a story published in Daily Science Fiction. Does naming something make it more real or at least more readily apparent?Part of the argument for color goes something like this. In primitive civilizations color doesn't matter a whole lot, and certain colors are rarely perceived on their own. Red is the color of blood, so a word to distinguish this comes fairly early in most cultures. But there are no large blue animals, few blue flowers, and blue dye was very difficult to make and unknown in many cultures. (Egypt was an exception, and apparently ancient Egyptian had a word for blue.) Because of this, there was no social or linguistic need to distinguish or name this hue. But what about the sea and the sky? The sea rarely looks straightforwardly blue, and the sky-- when completely clear-- was simply the sky. Since there was no cultural need to distinguish its color, it was simply the sky.The first half of the book is an investigation of the history of the color question, and if you're not quite satisfied with the answer I've given (and I'm not sure I am), you might not be satisfied with this portion of the book. For Deutscher though, color simply sets up the bigger question: how do we determine-- and then empirically test-- whether language actually shapes our perception and our thought processes? Are certain concepts (like ""The sky is blue"") simply inexpressible in some languages? Does this mean speakers of those languages are unable to conceive of certain statements and concepts? Deutscher's answer is no to these last two questions but a cautious yes to the first.An older, stronger claim would answer the final question of the above paragraph in the affirmative: language constrains thought. Because the Hopi Indians, for instance, have no verb tense in their language or expressions of time, they cannot perceive time as linear. Because other Native American languages do not distinguish between verb and subject, speakers of these languages have a more monistic, unified of nature. Deutscher disagrees and takes obvious pleasure in demolishing these claims, maintaining instead that any concept can be expressed in any language. His alternate claim is more subtle: it's not that some languages make it impossible to perceive or conceive certain things; rather, his claim is that certain languages obligate speakers to always be thinking of certain things.What does this mean? The author provides three examples. The first is that of a particular well-studied Australian aboriginal language that does not possess an egocentric coordinate system (i.e. behind, in front, left, right) but only an absolute system (north, east, south, west). Every positional expression voiced in this language, from things as simple as ""There's a bug beside your foot"" have to be given in terms of cardinal directions. (""There's a bug north of your foot."") This means that speakers of the language always have a sense of these directions from a very young age, and their experiences and memories are seen through that directional lens. The author discusses a variety of experiments in which it's shown that speakers of this language can recall details in this coordinate system, recounting orientations of experiences from years ago. (To put this in perspective, try calling up a particularly vivid memory and expressing it in terms of cardinal directions. Were you standing to the north or south of your spouse when you got married?) The language obligates its speakers to always have cardinal directions in mind and thus shapes their perceptions of the world accordingly.Languages with no egocentric coordinate system though are comparatively rare, so the author's second example is closer to home: languages like German or Spanish or many more with a developed gender system. In English-- at least since the century or so after the Norman Conquest, as the author points out in a fascinating historical treatment-- does not oblige its speakers to assign genders to inanimate objects. Yet many other modern languages do. Not much study has yet been done, according to Deutscher, on how this influences the thoughts of speakers of these languages, but he illustrates some of the implications with an example of the role this plays in translation and the subtle nuances and relations that can be lost moving from a gendered to a largely non-gendered language.Finally, he returns to color. Does our language's names for colors-- and the fact that these names don't exist in certain other languages-- influence the way we perceive the world? Recent studies, the author argues, indicate that yes, it does. He takes the case of light blue and dark blue, which in Russian have separate names. An English speaker would perceive these as shades of the same color. For a Russian speaker they would be separate colors. If this was indeed the case, one could expect that this linguistic obligation (that of the Russian speaker to give these separate hues different names) would allow Russians to more quickly distinguish between similar shades of blue if they lay on opposite sides of this distinction, in a similar manner to how an English speaker could more readily distinguish between greenish-blue and bluish-green than a speaker of a language that does not differentiate between green and blue. The author relates in detail the set-up of experiments to determine just that, which show the language-processing region of the brain active even when actively naming the hues was not part of the experiment. Russian speakers consistently differentiated between close shades of blue more quickly than English speakers.What does all this mean? It comes back to the central claim of the book, that languages, by obligating their speakers to pay attention to certain things in their structure, can function as a lens by which their speakers perceive the world.Consider this analogy (not given in the book): if your language has several different expressions for snow, so that each time you talk about snow you're obligated to take into consideration things like whether it's falling or on the ground, how long it's been on the ground, what its thickness and consistency is, then when you look at snow (or call up a memory containing snow) you're going to have a richer perception of the object than an English speaker who encapsulates all the varieties of snow under a single word. That doesn't mean that an English speaker can't conceptualize or express these nuances of snow. It just means her language doesn't habituate her to these perceptions.In these (possibly over-simplified) terms, Deutscher's argument seems almost self-evident, but the richness of his treatment comes in the historical and linguistic background he provides while exploring this idea and especially in his explanations of the rigor and structure of the experiments devised to verify such apparently straightforward claims about language and how it shapes our perceptions of the world."
86,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3514657-aya-zain,4,"The blurb of this book excited me so much. I've always wondered whether language has an influence on our intentions, our implications, and our culture. But Guy Deutscher made me think of the reverse scenario: that culture has had an impact on language, and that language is enforced every day thus leaving us no choice but to express ourselves in a somewhat outdated mode. Let me illustrate that further.I'm not sure what my mother tongue is. I'm of Arab descent, so it should be Arabic, however I was born and raised overseas where I focused on learning English instead. I became advanced in English and chose English as both a major and a minor for university, whereas my Arabic is intermediate to say the least. I can speak Arabic, but I always mess up the verb tenses -- feminine or masculine? So 'That table has a book on it' would turn into That (masculine) table (feminine) has a book on (feminine) it -- which is all incorrect, by the way! My Arabic just wasn't very good, and so I always confused the propositions and other articles.Arabic - like a few other languages - doesn't have gender neutrality, so that our every day language must determine what is masculine and what is feminine. And you can probably imagine that the more delicate inanimate objects usually took on the feminine form.Anyway - it goes further than that. And I once mentioned it to a high school classmate of mine in the 11th grade. I asked him: how come the verb conjugation of the plural masculine form gets a special (new and improved) conjugation, however the plural feminine verb conjugation is subjected to the same conjugation as the 'they' conjugation?He retaliated almost defensively, telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and that Arabic is the language of religion (Islam) and that I shouldn't challenge it because it is a flawless language. Which is exactly what is wrong with language -- he chose to take my argument personally as if it's offensive to his very nature. And that is exactly the problem.You can imagine how an every day reminder of what is feminine and what is masculine, or what is female and what is male has an impact on the way we perceive things. Take this for example: mowazafa (female office worker) and mowazaf (male office worker).Those involved in that sort of dialogue will have constant reminders to make gender distinctions, whether they like it or not. Their impressions are already preconceived when determining the nature of that thing they are referring to - be it female or male.I picked up on that because that's how I studied my subjects. I would put the information into images in my head and create a story, so it was easy to fall into the presumption that the feminine conjugation fell into the same category as the it conjugation due to sexist precursors.Arabic is not a flawless language. Arabic has stopped developing at one point in time, and refuses to change its methods to fit the modern-day society, and so people on some scale will be stuck expressing themselves in a language that doesn't fit a progressive society or lifestyle.If we try to think of ways to develop language so as to expand our neurological functions, we'll find that our cognitive abilities will also improve, thus making us smarter and more knowledgeable.I really like the examples that Deutscher drew out in his book, such as Guugu Yimithirr -- an Aboriginal Australian language that existed in Far North Queensland. They had the tendency to use the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) rather than egocentric coordinations (right, left, back and front). How does that make them see the world differently? They will never get lost. Even looking at Google Maps confuses me sometimes - am I supposed to turn a right or a left? However if my mind was brought up in the Gugu Ymithir community, I wouldn't have been so troubled as to figure out which direction to go. But then again, that could be just my terrible sense of direction.Another example was about the color blue. A mysterious color, in my opinion. It's barely seen in nature, yet it's everywhere. It's in the sky, it's in the sea that reflects the sky. However Deutscher mentions that when you take a look at Ancient literature, you'll find that the color blue is never mentioned. The sea is described as the color of wine, and the sky is not seen as blue. In daylight, it's white, and at night it's black. The word blue just wasn't necessary back then. However, now blue is everywhere, and the sky is just about as blue as the sea. We have so much blue that the Russians have not one, but two names for the color blue. They have two color distinctions that the average English speaker would call blue, but they call Siniy and Goluboy.  When taken in for experiments, it was found that the Russian speakers were able to distinguish between all colors faster than the English speakers did. This ability to perceive colors in a different way, while seeing the same colors, shows that language could really transform our potentials and increase our capabilities.Language is a dangerous weapon if not handled correctly. There has been no example of this though, so don't take my word on it. But I think that we can utilize language if we work on it meticulously to shape the society and the future that we want.Thanks Deutscher for such an informative book! There are so many great references in this book, and I was left with a lot more information on language than I had before."

That being said, at times this books felt a bit condescending. The tone that Mr. Deutscher uses comes across poorly, although I think it is unintentional. The condescending tone does not take away from the merit of the book, but it often left me feeling distracted by it."
88,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116092820-meg-briers,4,"A good read exploring how our mother tongue may be affecting our perceptions of colour, gender and space/coordinate system. A nice crossover between the fields of linguistics and psychology that really made you think about language and how it's having an influence on your day to day life. Very informative and gave a lot of new information without making the language too inaccessible as many other similar books seem to do, quite a nice gentle read!"
89,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"Guy Deutscher's Through the Language Glass, which looks at the relationship between language, culture and perception, wasn't quite what I'd expected. Honestly, I'd expected a variation of that old chestnut on the Eskimos having a gazillion words for the concept of ""snow"", to explain how our environment and culture shapes the language we speak. Deutscher's book surpassed those expectations. There are a few painful moments in the book, when Deutscher attempts to make some witty puns (this is a book on language after all). Wannabe gems like ""In their pronouncements on language, culture and thought, it seems that big thinkers in their grandes oeuvres have not always risen much above little thinkers over their hors d'oeuvres."" Or how about ""All the facts mentioned so far about the cones in the retina are correct to the best of my knowledge. But if you are under the impression that they actually explain our sensation of colour, then you have been coned!"" Do I detect some eye rolling here? But things look up once Deutscher gets serious. Dismissing many of the common fallacies or accepted wisdoms in linguistics - like how all languages are equally complex (how does one measure complexity? how do you trade off complexity in morphology against complexity in syntax, grammar rules, etc?) - Deutscher makes a tight and convincing case for what we can conclude about language. We can summarise the main thrusts of this case with the following 3 points:1. While nature may set the boundaries of how we perceive and relate to the world (it doesn't make sense to use the same word to describe red dogs and red roses for instance), culture significantly influences how we navigate within those boundaries. A more refined colour vocabulary, or one that emphasises hue over brightness, will lead to differences in how colours are named and classified. 2. Languages vary considerable in the amount of information they convey within words - e.g. tense, person performing the action, singularity/plurality, distance, etc. There is an inverse correlation between the complexity of society and word structure as communication among intimates often allows more compact, terse ways of expressing oneself. Conversely, the greater the number of speakers, more explicit markers for providing context (e.g. prepositions, subordinate clauses) are required and simplification through bastardisation of the language also occurs. 3. Language influences us not so much in what we are allowed to think but in the ""kinds of information each language habitually obliges [us] to think about"", from the way we see spatial relationships, to the attributes that we associate objects with (depending on whether one's language assigns a gender to that object). ""When a language forces its speakers to pay attention to certain aspects of the world each time they open their mouths or prick up their ears, such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills"". There are many things in Deutscher's book that are thought provoking. But perhaps the point that struck me the most was just how much gets lost in translation, when the associations we make with certain words just disappear when transplanted into another linguistic framework. As Deutscher notes: ""But if you native speakers of English are tempted to feel sorry for those of us who are shackled by the heavy load of an irrational gender system, then think again. I would never want to change places with you...my world has so much to it that you entirely miss out on, because the landscape of my language is so much more fertile than your arid desert of 'it's'. It goes without saying that genders are language's gift to poets. Heine's masculine pine tree longs for the feminine palm; Boris Pasternak's My Sister Life can only work because 'life' is feminine in Russian; English translations of Charles Beaudelaire's 'L'homme et la mer', however inspired, can never hope to capture the tempestuous relationship of attraction and antagonism that he evokes between 'him' (the man) and 'her' (the sea); nor can English do justice to Pablo Neruda's 'Ode to the Sea', in which the (masculine) el mar strikes a stone (una piedra) and then 'he caresses her, kisses her, drenches her, pounds his chest, repeating his own name' - the English 'it caresses it, kisses it, drenches it, pounds its chest' is not quite the same."""
90,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,3," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com I bought this book on February 1st at a bookstore in Aachen, Germany, during what they called 'Bye Bye-Brexit rabat' (Bye Bye Brexit Sale) which was 20% discount on all English books. Obviously, I couldn't resist. I went on to convince the book club I recently joined to read it as our next read, but unfortunately because of the entire Covid19 situation, we haven't had the possibility to discuss the book. I now feel a little bit sorry for them, as the book was not really what I hoped it would be. The subject fascinates me. When I was a small child, growing up speaking Dutch, for a time I believed (I am embarrassed to admit) that everyone always thought in Dutch, but that two French people for example, would then decide to speak French to each other. I quickly learned this was not the case, but it kept me interested in how someones language might influence how people think. Which is why I wanted to read Through the Language Glass.The author himself is very much interested in colors. And a large part of the book is in fact about the evolution of the naming of colors in languages. While interesting, I thought it was rather a bit too extensive. The remainder of the book was filled with some interesting facts, which might come to use at a pub quiz but the argument for the influence between language and thought was never very strong. Most interestingly I found the argument that some languages are forcing people to convey information in a certain sentence that other do not. For example, if your languages has changing verbs announcing how certain you are something happened, you have to think about it before making that sentence. If you have different verbs for something that happened one day or a week ago, again you have to think about. Same for languages who unlike English have gendered words. Ultimately, the effect that was measured was rather small, I'd argue. While difficult to measure objectively, is thinking colors are further apart from each other when they cross an arbitrary color-name boundary something that is important enough to consider this a significant effect of language on thought? I am not convinced. "
91,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"My interest in  Through the Language Glass came from a conversation with a friend about how the color blue was relatively recent 'invention.' This was not that the color blue didn't exist in antiquity, but rather that it didn't go by that name. How then, did the ancients view blue? How did they view colors? Like most things, there's a book for that. Through the Language Glass not only delves into the complicated world of how language and culture affects how we organize colors, and perhaps even how we see them, but also how the science of how we perceive color and name it developed over time. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is also delved into, as are the multitude of problems with it and where they just may have gotten things right. This book is dense with information, riveting in what new discoveries and alternative hypotheses it discusses, and rife with good humor. While this book was a dry read at times, it was one I could not put down for the sheer interesting nature of all it discusses. It's a shame that so much of these topics have yet to be thoroughly discussed, but this book seems to be bringing glad tidings of a shift in focus that is more welcoming towards how culture affects language and perception."
92,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2974294-jessica,1,"DNF a little more than 100 pages into it because the author's casual use of the words ""primitive"" and ""savage"" to describe indigenous peoples and peoples from pre-literate societies was extremely distasteful. And by that, I mean racist. And his discussion of creole/pidgin languages was similarly limited. Jade goes into more detail in her review than I care to.I'm going to save myself the energy and frustration, and just move on to  The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language instead."
93,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4514677-ruth-kunstadter,2,"Really disappointed in this. Well, disappointed in what I read ... the book focused almost exclusively on color, and how the way we describe or see color is related to language. The author is color-blind, I believe, which I suppose explains this. However, I was expecting a book about how we *feel* different when we switch from one language to another, and that's not what this was. On the other hand, I am also somewhat relieved that the book isn't what I thought, since that's the book that I've been wanting to write. Guess I can still do that, since Guy Deutscher didn't ....."
94,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18883154-liz,2,"Easy read, but oversells it's point on the cover. Claims to explore how language influences perception and culture, but really only focuses on linguistic oddities and differences (division of color, geographic orientation). I kept reading, hoping it would get to the meat of the claimed argument, and it never did. Would have rated higher had I not felt mislead by the book's claims of what it was discussing."
95,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290848-john,2,"Such promise this premise held! Unfortunately, as has been noted in reviews, much of the book (first half) consists of color-description issues among (obscure) languages - a little of that went a long way! Later discussion of gender classification was better, but still rather dry. Not particularly recommended ... alas."
96,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5922824-cynthia-frazer,4,"The writer's voice was truly irritating, but I was so interested in the differences in color perception in non-European languages, and conventions of orientation in conversation, among other topics, that I mentally told him to shut up several times, while I kept reading. His ego ALMOST obscured the fascinating content. "
97,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7205316-ellen,1,"This book on cultural linguistics/linguistic anthropology disappointed me. While I acknowledge that it was written for a lay audience, still, even a nonlinguist can handle a great deal more depth than the author supplied.

99,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages"".There is a cluster of myths about language, referred to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that looms large over this book. If you have ever heard that the Eskimo had 50 (or 500) words for snow, and that what language you speak determines how you think, you have heard echoes of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The author of this book is one of the first to tiptoe back into the blast crater that was left when the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was exploded a century ago.In its more extreme form, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (named for a couple early scholars in the study of languages) asserts that because different languages have different words for things, and some concepts which have a name in one language do not have a name in others (e.g. schadenfreude), the language(s) you speak can determine what concepts you are able to think. For example, Eskimos can (allegedly) notice all the many shades of difference between one type of snow and another (hard packed, fused to ice, tiny and 'dry' like powder, big wet flakes, etc.), because they have words for them, and we cannot.Leaving aside whether or not the Inuit languages have many more words for snow than others (the answer appears to be complicated, but essentially 'not really'), there is another flaw with this, and 'schadenfreude' is a good illustration of it. First off, even though English had no word for 'taking joy in the misfortunes of others', we had no problem stealing it from German, and this is not only something that English does. Second, do we really believe that an english speaker in the years prior to this did not understand that sometimes a person would take joy in the downfall of another? You don't need a word or phrase for 'esprit de corps' to understand that morale is important, and if you have common enough occasion to refer to it, you can invent a word in any language.Moreover, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was one of several justifications given for policies like taking Australian Aborigines or Native Americans children from their homes and making them speak English, so it acquired a bit of a moral taint. Believing that the language you speak influences what you think became not just a scientific question, but a bit of a moral one as well, and any answer other than 'of course not' was morally suspect.Deutscher (a native speaker of Hebrew, by the way) is ready to risk such an accusation, but he first has to spend a chapter or two explaining what Sapir-Whorf was, why it wasn't true, and otherwise reassuring us that he doesn't think all children should be forced to speak one language on the grounds that it is culturally more refined. Having done that, he begins the exploration of this minefield by talking about the relatively objectively measurable topic of color.My favorite factoid from this book: there are languages in the world (several, it turns out) which have only two words for color (which correspond more or less to 'black' and 'white'). In these languages, the sky is black (except when it's covered with clouds, in which case it's white), and the leaves of plants are white. Stunned anthropologists spent a couple generations in remote villages or travelling with hunter/gatherers, and asking them to compare and label colored tiles or swatches of cloth, and determined that the people who spoke these languages were not colorblind, they just honestly didn't see the need for more words for color than this.The reason seems to be that there just isn't much need for words for color, until you have dyes, paints, markers, and other ways of routinely making a given thing one color or another. If all plants are green, why do you need to say the 'green plant'? You can just say 'plant'. If a fruit can only either be green (when it's not ripe) or red (when it's ripe), you can just say 'ripe' (or 'not ripe'), and there's no great need for a word for the color. It's rather like how we don't have words for smell, really, we mostly just say 'smells like coffee' or 'smells like flowers', or some other simile. We don't add fragrances to things (routinely), they mostly just smell how they smell, so we don't need to say 'hand me the coffee-smelling hammer, not the flowery-smelling one'. We just say 'hand me the hammer', and what smell it has is irrelevant.There are also languages which have three words for color: black, white, and red. There are several of these, not all related. What's interesting is that there aren't any with words for black, white, and blue, or black, white, and green. If there is a third and final color name, and you ask speakers to point to the tile which best epitomizes that color, they will point to the red one.Languages with four colors will have black, white, red, and either yellow or green, and languages with a fifth word for color will have both yellow and green. Blue is apparently not all that important to humans, and only languages with at least six words for color will be able to say that the sky is blue. Before that, apparently, you just note that the sky is clear, and get on with life without bothering about what color that is. One wonders what small children can pester their parents about if they can't ask why the sky is blue (I bet they manage).Having demonstrated that languages can really be different, Deutscher moves on to his main thesis: languages do really change how we think, at least a little, but not based on what they have words for. Rather, languages affect our thinking not in what they allow, but in what they require. There are languages where you do not refer to something being on your left or right; it must always be referred to as being on your north, south, or whatever. This REQUIRES the speaker to always be aware of which way is north, and to reflect this in their speech many times a day. When telling a story of something that happened to them, they must think about what direction they were facing when they told it. One might suspect that such people have a sense of direction much more developed than ours, and experiments prove that you are right. Wake such a person up from a deep sleeop in the middle of the night, and ask them what direction they were facing when they met their spouse for the first time decades before, and they will be able to tell you (although they may slap you upside the head first).There are many languages where nearly every noun is either masculine or feminine, and many others where a goodly percentage of inanimate objects are, and you have to reflect this in your word endings or choice of articles (e.g. which form of 'the' you use when speaking about 'the pine tree'). Ask speakers of German (where the word for 'bridge' is feminine) and Spanish (where it is masculine) to describe bridges, and the former will say that they are beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender, while the latter will say that they are big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and towering.Deutscher has several other such examples, with ample citations of published studies to back him up, and enough studies of Victorian scholars cavorting with savages to entertain a reader like me who is amused by the image of a bemused hunter regarding a box of colored tiles that the crazy white man wants to ask him questions about. The field he is involved in is still very immature, by his own admission. He compares it to trying to study the behavior of a corporation by camping outside the headquarters and monitoring which rooms are lit up for how many hours a day. But, if he and others succeed in at least legitimizing the question of how language influences the way we think, then it is possible that in a generation or two we may be in a position to say a lot more about it (in any language we care to use)."
100,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52711508-max-lauber,4,"This book offers a history of the often (and rightly) maligned Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and details how the notion that language shapes people's perception of the world became an *idea non grata*. Deutscher takes the reader from William Gladstone's 19th century analysis of Homer to state-of-the-art neurolinguistics research in order to not only show how language affects perception, but also to show that the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is mostly just a high-flying fantasy. To summarize it in a sentence, Deutscher argues that culture, i.e. language, has a stronger effect on our thinking than we are comfortable to admit, but that the impact of language on thought is very different from what it was believed to be in the past.Specifically, he argues that there is no evidence that our mother tongue constrains our cognitive capacity or that it imposes limits on what we can understand. In other words, he says the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is bunk. Instead, he argues that ""the real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us - all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself"". He summarizes this idea in what he calls the Boas-Jakobson principle: Languages differ essentially in what they must convey, not in what they may convey.By surveying not only current research, but also methodologies and findings from the past 200 years, Deutscher makes a very plausible claim for the Boas-Jakobson principle and for his rejection of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and the linguistic dogma that language does not fundamentally affect the way we think. Although there is no dearth of substance in this book, Deutscher shines more brightly when it comes to style. He has a knack for explaining the history of ideas (particularly when it comes to the history of color and perception) and dropping quirky anecdotes at the right moment (i.e. almost all the time). In short, this is an engaging read that offers a rather nuanced take on one of the thorniest linguistic questions. As such, definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."
101,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about language, mostly because the information provided is done so with great verve and charm by the author. His chatty style is most disarming — this is a man who knows how to educate his readers almost effortlessly: he will occasionally lead you astray deliberately, so that he can later point out what further research has revealed. And it is quite rewarding!This book limits itself to three specific aspects of language: the words used in languages for colour; the method used in various cultures and languages for orientation of oneself within the world; and an examination of the use of 'gender' in many languages (with English being one of the few that seems to particularly eschew this quality). The overall objective seems to be that from his studies Deutscher tends to believe that, as the title tells us, the world does look different in other languages. He tends to leave it at that: to argue as to how different that world is, and whether this indicates anything further with regard to science, philosophy, religion, culture, etc. are obviously left for others to ponder.I used quotes around the word 'gender' above because it was in this section (entitled ""Sex and Syntax"") that I was not completely convinced by his argument. He uses the example of a poem by Heine in which a pine tree in the North dreams of a palm tree 'far in the East', and points out that in the original German language a pine tree is a masculine word, while a palm tree is a feminine word — thus there is a 'sexual overtone' found in the original which a simple English translation would fail to communicate. He seems to argue that this lack of gender makes English less rich in its connotations. (It also explains why often enough learners of English from a country where words have a sexual distinction applied to them will often make 'mistakes' with personal pronouns, and will apply them 'incorrectly' to English words: in other words, they are still thinking of a word in the sex of their original language.) What bothers me about this is that my background is Italian, a language which has male and female words, but I can never remember thinking that they had an actual sexual connotation. For example, the word for a fork in Italian is feminine, but it does not mean that there are sexual connotations connected to a fork. Maybe I am being too precious about this, but it did make me wonder about whether Deutscher's 'smooth talking' might not mask other aspects which might not be 'quite right'…Be that as it may, the book is still quite a wonderful read for anyone interested in languages in general."
102,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10298127-anne,0,"I can't really review this book, because if I'd known anything about linguistics, I wouldn't have to read this in the first place. But I'll give it a try.Through the Language Glass is a popular science book for people interested in how language and perception of reality work. It is easy to read (but not too easy) and Guy Deutscher uses interesting examples to show how differences between languages can cause (ever so tiny) differences in perception. He is quite critical of people jumping to conclusions, so this book doesn't convince you of some radical idea that your reality is completely different from that of someone with a different mother tongue. Instead, it shows how things like colour perception, grammatical gender, and direction through left-right or east-west can have a tiny influence on your sense of the world, if only because when tested, people who are confronted with something that clashes with their language's 'settings' take a tiny bit more time than others.So the good part is that he doesn't try to shove crazy theories down your throat, but tries to remain critical. The bad part is that he seems either to take pleasure in discrediting scientists who were wrong about things or that he just exaggerates for dramatic effect. Either way, not so great. In general, his tone is definitely less neutral than I would like, also when he talks about ""primitive tribes"" etc. He seems not to have fixed on one term that is satisfactory, and although he defends the complexity of their language, I think he is quite careless and unspecific (and a bit tactless) in his terms to describe these societies, and maybe he could have looked up anthropologists' terms and used those. I know it's a fluffy popular science book but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a more objective, scientific tone.If you're looking for a book that will convince you that language changes your reality or that it absolutely does not, this is not it. Deutscher uses three topics (colour, grammatical gender, direction) of which colour takes up the most space in the book. It was a nice read but if at all possible, it would have been nice to have some extra categories, and not just these three."
103,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"As other reviewers remarked, the title of this book is slightly misleading. A large part of the book deals with colours. How they are perceived, how their naming follows a similar pattern in most languages and why this is important. There are mentions of Homer and his ""wine coloured sea"", a pretty dense historical background and references to modern studies. This part I found most interesting, but it has not much to do with the fact that the world looks different in other languages. Because, in fact it does not.Other chapters explain that languages have very little influence on thoughts and that grammar is the only constraint to the way we express ourselves. People understand basic concepts more or less in the same way, but they have different grammar rules to express them. More than language, what shapes their thoughts is their culture.There is also some debate about the fact that we change slightly, when we speak a foreign language. Much is said about languages that have masculine and feminine nouns and those that have not. Personally, I speak four languages quite fluently and I must confess I never noticed any major change of personality when I switch from Italian to English, to French or Portuguese. But maybe it is just me. The absence of ""gender"" in English nouns is actually much welcomed, since I must deal with random feminine and masculine in the other three languages I know.For those not familiar, I can assure you it is pretty annoying having to learn that ""la fleur"" is feminine in French and ""a viagem"" is feminine in Portuguese, while both are masculine in Italian (""il fiore"",""il viaggio""). The total lack of logic of assigning genders to nouns can be mind-blowing, but still does not interfere with the fact that when I see a flower I know it is a flower and not a cat – whether I think in Italian, French, English or Portuguese."
104,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"This book uses three 'case studies' (colour, gender and spacial awareness) to look at how language affects our view of the world, our thinking and our memory.The first third of the book looks in depth at the history of the study of how colour is described by various international and classical cultures and how the differences have been (miss)interpreted by an assortment of learned gentlemen over the years. This gives a very nice springboard to the reader to see the types of pitfalls that such studies can fall into and prepare the ground for the second part of the book.The second section of the book goes into more depth on the subject of 'how can we study whether linguistic differences really affect our minds and the way they work?'. The Australian (and other) tribes that do all their directions in North, South, East and West rather than ever using left, right, in front or behind, were new to me and absolutely fascinating. Deutscher writes in an easily accessible style adding plenty of actual data from studies without letting it overwhelm the greater story. I felt that the arguments for and against certain viewpoints were well rehearsed in a relatively light hearted non-judgemental way that left one feeling enlightened and amused. This book has re-enforced my view that the human minds and human cultures are totally fascinating in their infintie variety, and left me looking for more non fiction in a similar vein. I have a few other books lined up. I hope they are as good. "
105,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"I enjoyed this book. The title for me was a bit misleading, at least for the first part of the book, which was mostly about out color sense and how we perceive colors and the role that language plays in that perception. I was not expecting this and so it threw me off a bit but the author’s excellent writing style quickly had me feeling at ease.About the writing style, it is relaxed and playful. The author is a punster and the book is littered with witty puns throughout (even the appendix has a pun thrown in) but this doesn’t take away from the excellent scientific research that is conveyed. I especially liked the second part of the book and the fascinating story of the Guugu Yimithirr, a group of native peoples whose language reflects the geography of the world. Where I (and most other people I know) use our bodies as the starting point for explaining directions to other people, the Guugu Yimithirr use the cardinal points of a compass, so that if I see a bug on your left foot I would state that, whereas a Guugu Yimithirr person would say that you have a bug on your ""West"" foot (if he was facing South and you were facing him.) This was amazing to me, and the author describes other equally fascinating cultures that use geography to describe the world. I have a lousy sense of direction but not so these other peoples, and this kind of thinking is not as rare as you would imagine.All in all, I feel this is an excellent book and would like to read it again to catch the things I missed. Highly recommended. "
106,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745423-simon,4,"One small criticism first: this was in some ways less far-ranging and comprehensive than I'd imagined, focussing on just three aspects of language and the perception of reality - colour, gender and spatial relations. And the sections on colour account for almost half the book. This can be forgiven as these are the only areas in which any serious and conclusive research has been done.But once you get past that narrowing of the scope, this is a still an eye-opening and enormously readble book, full of fascinating details and vividly described characters. What makes it work best is Deutscher's skill as a storyteller, with early sections tracing the historical development of theories about ancient Greeks' colour perception at times read like a particularly engrossing thriller (no, really). Deutscher is also a skilled prose writer, and not above slipping in the occasional linguistic witticism, but only where appropriate and never coming across as clever for its own sake.Highly recommended."
107,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Book about the way language influences the way we think -- and vice-versa. While the famous Sapir-Whorf thesis has been debunked (and is a bit of an embarrassment for linguists), in the end it seems that language and our thinking *do* have have some influence upon each other.I enjoyed the discussion of Homer and the weird usage of colors, and the way some Australian tribes use an absolute (well, with earth as the frame of reference) coordinate system rather than 'left of me', 'in front of me' etc.Also interesting was the discussion of the Matsés people of the Amazon. Their language has a built-in concept of evidentiality -- every time they say anything about anything, their language requires them to express the amount of evidence for the statement -- 'seen with my own eyes' until 'mere hearsay' paper. A great idea -- maybe we should import that concept in our languages as well?"

He gives a careful dissecting of Whorfianism and showing why he's not defending that (a good debate strategy, to be sure); however, other works argue that the evidence presented therein really does have cause and effect backwards (as far as language and thought). I would strongly recommend reading this in conjunction with Christine Kennealy's ""The First Word"" and Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought,"" and drawing your own conclusions, assuming of course you're a linguistics nerd and have a lot of time on your hands. This, you'll get through fairly quickly: Pinker especially, though, will take you some chewing."

115,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23180960-stephen-case,3,"It started with a conversation with a student, who said he had read an article explaining that the color blue never appeared in ancient Greek writings. That led to some internet searching, and I quickly found this book, which claims to be a treatment of this puzzle and turns out to be an explanation of the way language shapes the way we see the world. Do people who speak different languages actually see the world differently? Or in other words, how much does the structure of our language mirror or constrain the structure of our thought?Deutscher-- a linguist with an axe to grind against some of the contemporary views in the field-- starts the exploration of this question with its most interesting manifestation: color. The realization that there was something strange going on in ancient accounts of color goes back to the philhellene and sometimes Prime Minister William Gladstone who noticed that blue never appears in Homer's writings. The sea and sky are not referred to as blue, and other colors are also used in questionable ways. Other researchers into ancient texts discovered similar things: many ancient languages didn't have a word for blue. Indeed, there seemed to be a order of appearance in which ""primitive"" languages (and the author offers examples of some contemporary languages as well) distinguish between dark and light and lump all colors together as reddish. Eventually words for yellows and browns appear and finally terms that distinguish between greens and blues. The differentiation of blue usually comes last, and there are still signs of this, for instance, in the fact that in old Japanese the word for blue and green is the same.What does this mean? Early theories speculated that there was an actual physiological evolution taking place, that as humans became less primitive their eyes developed to perceive a wider spectrum of colors. Modern genetics and tests on speakers who languages currently lack certain color words has disproven this. Ancient Greek eyes were the same as ours. But did their lack of names for certain colors shape the way they perceived the world? This is the crux of the author's question: do we really see things if we don't have words to express them? I explored this once in a story published in Daily Science Fiction. Does naming something make it more real or at least more readily apparent?Part of the argument for color goes something like this. In primitive civilizations color doesn't matter a whole lot, and certain colors are rarely perceived on their own. Red is the color of blood, so a word to distinguish this comes fairly early in most cultures. But there are no large blue animals, few blue flowers, and blue dye was very difficult to make and unknown in many cultures. (Egypt was an exception, and apparently ancient Egyptian had a word for blue.) Because of this, there was no social or linguistic need to distinguish or name this hue. But what about the sea and the sky? The sea rarely looks straightforwardly blue, and the sky-- when completely clear-- was simply the sky. Since there was no cultural need to distinguish its color, it was simply the sky.The first half of the book is an investigation of the history of the color question, and if you're not quite satisfied with the answer I've given (and I'm not sure I am), you might not be satisfied with this portion of the book. For Deutscher though, color simply sets up the bigger question: how do we determine-- and then empirically test-- whether language actually shapes our perception and our thought processes? Are certain concepts (like ""The sky is blue"") simply inexpressible in some languages? Does this mean speakers of those languages are unable to conceive of certain statements and concepts? Deutscher's answer is no to these last two questions but a cautious yes to the first.An older, stronger claim would answer the final question of the above paragraph in the affirmative: language constrains thought. Because the Hopi Indians, for instance, have no verb tense in their language or expressions of time, they cannot perceive time as linear. Because other Native American languages do not distinguish between verb and subject, speakers of these languages have a more monistic, unified of nature. Deutscher disagrees and takes obvious pleasure in demolishing these claims, maintaining instead that any concept can be expressed in any language. His alternate claim is more subtle: it's not that some languages make it impossible to perceive or conceive certain things; rather, his claim is that certain languages obligate speakers to always be thinking of certain things.What does this mean? The author provides three examples. The first is that of a particular well-studied Australian aboriginal language that does not possess an egocentric coordinate system (i.e. behind, in front, left, right) but only an absolute system (north, east, south, west). Every positional expression voiced in this language, from things as simple as ""There's a bug beside your foot"" have to be given in terms of cardinal directions. (""There's a bug north of your foot."") This means that speakers of the language always have a sense of these directions from a very young age, and their experiences and memories are seen through that directional lens. The author discusses a variety of experiments in which it's shown that speakers of this language can recall details in this coordinate system, recounting orientations of experiences from years ago. (To put this in perspective, try calling up a particularly vivid memory and expressing it in terms of cardinal directions. Were you standing to the north or south of your spouse when you got married?) The language obligates its speakers to always have cardinal directions in mind and thus shapes their perceptions of the world accordingly.Languages with no egocentric coordinate system though are comparatively rare, so the author's second example is closer to home: languages like German or Spanish or many more with a developed gender system. In English-- at least since the century or so after the Norman Conquest, as the author points out in a fascinating historical treatment-- does not oblige its speakers to assign genders to inanimate objects. Yet many other modern languages do. Not much study has yet been done, according to Deutscher, on how this influences the thoughts of speakers of these languages, but he illustrates some of the implications with an example of the role this plays in translation and the subtle nuances and relations that can be lost moving from a gendered to a largely non-gendered language.Finally, he returns to color. Does our language's names for colors-- and the fact that these names don't exist in certain other languages-- influence the way we perceive the world? Recent studies, the author argues, indicate that yes, it does. He takes the case of light blue and dark blue, which in Russian have separate names. An English speaker would perceive these as shades of the same color. For a Russian speaker they would be separate colors. If this was indeed the case, one could expect that this linguistic obligation (that of the Russian speaker to give these separate hues different names) would allow Russians to more quickly distinguish between similar shades of blue if they lay on opposite sides of this distinction, in a similar manner to how an English speaker could more readily distinguish between greenish-blue and bluish-green than a speaker of a language that does not differentiate between green and blue. The author relates in detail the set-up of experiments to determine just that, which show the language-processing region of the brain active even when actively naming the hues was not part of the experiment. Russian speakers consistently differentiated between close shades of blue more quickly than English speakers.What does all this mean? It comes back to the central claim of the book, that languages, by obligating their speakers to pay attention to certain things in their structure, can function as a lens by which their speakers perceive the world.Consider this analogy (not given in the book): if your language has several different expressions for snow, so that each time you talk about snow you're obligated to take into consideration things like whether it's falling or on the ground, how long it's been on the ground, what its thickness and consistency is, then when you look at snow (or call up a memory containing snow) you're going to have a richer perception of the object than an English speaker who encapsulates all the varieties of snow under a single word. That doesn't mean that an English speaker can't conceptualize or express these nuances of snow. It just means her language doesn't habituate her to these perceptions.In these (possibly over-simplified) terms, Deutscher's argument seems almost self-evident, but the richness of his treatment comes in the historical and linguistic background he provides while exploring this idea and especially in his explanations of the rigor and structure of the experiments devised to verify such apparently straightforward claims about language and how it shapes our perceptions of the world."
116,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3514657-aya-zain,4,"The blurb of this book excited me so much. I've always wondered whether language has an influence on our intentions, our implications, and our culture. But Guy Deutscher made me think of the reverse scenario: that culture has had an impact on language, and that language is enforced every day thus leaving us no choice but to express ourselves in a somewhat outdated mode. Let me illustrate that further.I'm not sure what my mother tongue is. I'm of Arab descent, so it should be Arabic, however I was born and raised overseas where I focused on learning English instead. I became advanced in English and chose English as both a major and a minor for university, whereas my Arabic is intermediate to say the least. I can speak Arabic, but I always mess up the verb tenses -- feminine or masculine? So 'That table has a book on it' would turn into That (masculine) table (feminine) has a book on (feminine) it -- which is all incorrect, by the way! My Arabic just wasn't very good, and so I always confused the propositions and other articles.Arabic - like a few other languages - doesn't have gender neutrality, so that our every day language must determine what is masculine and what is feminine. And you can probably imagine that the more delicate inanimate objects usually took on the feminine form.Anyway - it goes further than that. And I once mentioned it to a high school classmate of mine in the 11th grade. I asked him: how come the verb conjugation of the plural masculine form gets a special (new and improved) conjugation, however the plural feminine verb conjugation is subjected to the same conjugation as the 'they' conjugation?He retaliated almost defensively, telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and that Arabic is the language of religion (Islam) and that I shouldn't challenge it because it is a flawless language. Which is exactly what is wrong with language -- he chose to take my argument personally as if it's offensive to his very nature. And that is exactly the problem.You can imagine how an every day reminder of what is feminine and what is masculine, or what is female and what is male has an impact on the way we perceive things. Take this for example: mowazafa (female office worker) and mowazaf (male office worker).Those involved in that sort of dialogue will have constant reminders to make gender distinctions, whether they like it or not. Their impressions are already preconceived when determining the nature of that thing they are referring to - be it female or male.I picked up on that because that's how I studied my subjects. I would put the information into images in my head and create a story, so it was easy to fall into the presumption that the feminine conjugation fell into the same category as the it conjugation due to sexist precursors.Arabic is not a flawless language. Arabic has stopped developing at one point in time, and refuses to change its methods to fit the modern-day society, and so people on some scale will be stuck expressing themselves in a language that doesn't fit a progressive society or lifestyle.If we try to think of ways to develop language so as to expand our neurological functions, we'll find that our cognitive abilities will also improve, thus making us smarter and more knowledgeable.I really like the examples that Deutscher drew out in his book, such as Guugu Yimithirr -- an Aboriginal Australian language that existed in Far North Queensland. They had the tendency to use the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) rather than egocentric coordinations (right, left, back and front). How does that make them see the world differently? They will never get lost. Even looking at Google Maps confuses me sometimes - am I supposed to turn a right or a left? However if my mind was brought up in the Gugu Ymithir community, I wouldn't have been so troubled as to figure out which direction to go. But then again, that could be just my terrible sense of direction.Another example was about the color blue. A mysterious color, in my opinion. It's barely seen in nature, yet it's everywhere. It's in the sky, it's in the sea that reflects the sky. However Deutscher mentions that when you take a look at Ancient literature, you'll find that the color blue is never mentioned. The sea is described as the color of wine, and the sky is not seen as blue. In daylight, it's white, and at night it's black. The word blue just wasn't necessary back then. However, now blue is everywhere, and the sky is just about as blue as the sea. We have so much blue that the Russians have not one, but two names for the color blue. They have two color distinctions that the average English speaker would call blue, but they call Siniy and Goluboy.  When taken in for experiments, it was found that the Russian speakers were able to distinguish between all colors faster than the English speakers did. This ability to perceive colors in a different way, while seeing the same colors, shows that language could really transform our potentials and increase our capabilities.Language is a dangerous weapon if not handled correctly. There has been no example of this though, so don't take my word on it. But I think that we can utilize language if we work on it meticulously to shape the society and the future that we want.Thanks Deutscher for such an informative book! There are so many great references in this book, and I was left with a lot more information on language than I had before."
117,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63279672-courtney-mosier-warren,3,"In general this was a very good book. I found many of the arguments to be interesting and worth exploring. That being said, at times this books felt a bit condescending. The tone that Mr. Deutscher uses comes across poorly, although I think it is unintentional. The condescending tone does not take away from the merit of the book, but it often left me feeling distracted by it."
118,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116092820-meg-briers,4,"A good read exploring how our mother tongue may be affecting our perceptions of colour, gender and space/coordinate system. A nice crossover between the fields of linguistics and psychology that really made you think about language and how it's having an influence on your day to day life. Very informative and gave a lot of new information without making the language too inaccessible as many other similar books seem to do, quite a nice gentle read!"
119,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"Guy Deutscher's Through the Language Glass, which looks at the relationship between language, culture and perception, wasn't quite what I'd expected. Honestly, I'd expected a variation of that old chestnut on the Eskimos having a gazillion words for the concept of ""snow"", to explain how our environment and culture shapes the language we speak. Deutscher's book surpassed those expectations. There are a few painful moments in the book, when Deutscher attempts to make some witty puns (this is a book on language after all). Wannabe gems like ""In their pronouncements on language, culture and thought, it seems that big thinkers in their grandes oeuvres have not always risen much above little thinkers over their hors d'oeuvres."" Or how about ""All the facts mentioned so far about the cones in the retina are correct to the best of my knowledge. But if you are under the impression that they actually explain our sensation of colour, then you have been coned!"" Do I detect some eye rolling here? But things look up once Deutscher gets serious. Dismissing many of the common fallacies or accepted wisdoms in linguistics - like how all languages are equally complex (how does one measure complexity? how do you trade off complexity in morphology against complexity in syntax, grammar rules, etc?) - Deutscher makes a tight and convincing case for what we can conclude about language. We can summarise the main thrusts of this case with the following 3 points:1. While nature may set the boundaries of how we perceive and relate to the world (it doesn't make sense to use the same word to describe red dogs and red roses for instance), culture significantly influences how we navigate within those boundaries. A more refined colour vocabulary, or one that emphasises hue over brightness, will lead to differences in how colours are named and classified. 2. Languages vary considerable in the amount of information they convey within words - e.g. tense, person performing the action, singularity/plurality, distance, etc. There is an inverse correlation between the complexity of society and word structure as communication among intimates often allows more compact, terse ways of expressing oneself. Conversely, the greater the number of speakers, more explicit markers for providing context (e.g. prepositions, subordinate clauses) are required and simplification through bastardisation of the language also occurs. 3. Language influences us not so much in what we are allowed to think but in the ""kinds of information each language habitually obliges [us] to think about"", from the way we see spatial relationships, to the attributes that we associate objects with (depending on whether one's language assigns a gender to that object). ""When a language forces its speakers to pay attention to certain aspects of the world each time they open their mouths or prick up their ears, such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills"". There are many things in Deutscher's book that are thought provoking. But perhaps the point that struck me the most was just how much gets lost in translation, when the associations we make with certain words just disappear when transplanted into another linguistic framework. As Deutscher notes: ""But if you native speakers of English are tempted to feel sorry for those of us who are shackled by the heavy load of an irrational gender system, then think again. I would never want to change places with you...my world has so much to it that you entirely miss out on, because the landscape of my language is so much more fertile than your arid desert of 'it's'. It goes without saying that genders are language's gift to poets. Heine's masculine pine tree longs for the feminine palm; Boris Pasternak's My Sister Life can only work because 'life' is feminine in Russian; English translations of Charles Beaudelaire's 'L'homme et la mer', however inspired, can never hope to capture the tempestuous relationship of attraction and antagonism that he evokes between 'him' (the man) and 'her' (the sea); nor can English do justice to Pablo Neruda's 'Ode to the Sea', in which the (masculine) el mar strikes a stone (una piedra) and then 'he caresses her, kisses her, drenches her, pounds his chest, repeating his own name' - the English 'it caresses it, kisses it, drenches it, pounds its chest' is not quite the same."""
120,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,3," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com I bought this book on February 1st at a bookstore in Aachen, Germany, during what they called 'Bye Bye-Brexit rabat' (Bye Bye Brexit Sale) which was 20% discount on all English books. Obviously, I couldn't resist. I went on to convince the book club I recently joined to read it as our next read, but unfortunately because of the entire Covid19 situation, we haven't had the possibility to discuss the book. I now feel a little bit sorry for them, as the book was not really what I hoped it would be. The subject fascinates me. When I was a small child, growing up speaking Dutch, for a time I believed (I am embarrassed to admit) that everyone always thought in Dutch, but that two French people for example, would then decide to speak French to each other. I quickly learned this was not the case, but it kept me interested in how someones language might influence how people think. Which is why I wanted to read Through the Language Glass.The author himself is very much interested in colors. And a large part of the book is in fact about the evolution of the naming of colors in languages. While interesting, I thought it was rather a bit too extensive. The remainder of the book was filled with some interesting facts, which might come to use at a pub quiz but the argument for the influence between language and thought was never very strong. Most interestingly I found the argument that some languages are forcing people to convey information in a certain sentence that other do not. For example, if your languages has changing verbs announcing how certain you are something happened, you have to think about it before making that sentence. If you have different verbs for something that happened one day or a week ago, again you have to think about. Same for languages who unlike English have gendered words. Ultimately, the effect that was measured was rather small, I'd argue. While difficult to measure objectively, is thinking colors are further apart from each other when they cross an arbitrary color-name boundary something that is important enough to consider this a significant effect of language on thought? I am not convinced. "
121,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"My interest in  Through the Language Glass came from a conversation with a friend about how the color blue was relatively recent 'invention.' This was not that the color blue didn't exist in antiquity, but rather that it didn't go by that name. How then, did the ancients view blue? How did they view colors? Like most things, there's a book for that. Through the Language Glass not only delves into the complicated world of how language and culture affects how we organize colors, and perhaps even how we see them, but also how the science of how we perceive color and name it developed over time. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is also delved into, as are the multitude of problems with it and where they just may have gotten things right. This book is dense with information, riveting in what new discoveries and alternative hypotheses it discusses, and rife with good humor. While this book was a dry read at times, it was one I could not put down for the sheer interesting nature of all it discusses. It's a shame that so much of these topics have yet to be thoroughly discussed, but this book seems to be bringing glad tidings of a shift in focus that is more welcoming towards how culture affects language and perception."

Well, disappointed in what I read ... the book focused almost exclusively on color, and how the way we describe or see color is related to language. The author is color-blind, I believe, which I suppose explains this. However, I was expecting a book about how we *feel* different when we switch from one language to another, and that's not what this was. On the other hand, I am also somewhat relieved that the book isn't what I thought, since that's the book that I've been wanting to write. Guess I can still do that, since Guy Deutscher didn't ....."

129,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages"".There is a cluster of myths about language, referred to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that looms large over this book. If you have ever heard that the Eskimo had 50 (or 500) words for snow, and that what language you speak determines how you think, you have heard echoes of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The author of this book is one of the first to tiptoe back into the blast crater that was left when the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was exploded a century ago.In its more extreme form, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (named for a couple early scholars in the study of languages) asserts that because different languages have different words for things, and some concepts which have a name in one language do not have a name in others (e.g. schadenfreude), the language(s) you speak can determine what concepts you are able to think. For example, Eskimos can (allegedly) notice all the many shades of difference between one type of snow and another (hard packed, fused to ice, tiny and 'dry' like powder, big wet flakes, etc.), because they have words for them, and we cannot.Leaving aside whether or not the Inuit languages have many more words for snow than others (the answer appears to be complicated, but essentially 'not really'), there is another flaw with this, and 'schadenfreude' is a good illustration of it. First off, even though English had no word for 'taking joy in the misfortunes of others', we had no problem stealing it from German, and this is not only something that English does. Second, do we really believe that an english speaker in the years prior to this did not understand that sometimes a person would take joy in the downfall of another? You don't need a word or phrase for 'esprit de corps' to understand that morale is important, and if you have common enough occasion to refer to it, you can invent a word in any language.Moreover, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was one of several justifications given for policies like taking Australian Aborigines or Native Americans children from their homes and making them speak English, so it acquired a bit of a moral taint. Believing that the language you speak influences what you think became not just a scientific question, but a bit of a moral one as well, and any answer other than 'of course not' was morally suspect.Deutscher (a native speaker of Hebrew, by the way) is ready to risk such an accusation, but he first has to spend a chapter or two explaining what Sapir-Whorf was, why it wasn't true, and otherwise reassuring us that he doesn't think all children should be forced to speak one language on the grounds that it is culturally more refined. Having done that, he begins the exploration of this minefield by talking about the relatively objectively measurable topic of color.My favorite factoid from this book: there are languages in the world (several, it turns out) which have only two words for color (which correspond more or less to 'black' and 'white'). In these languages, the sky is black (except when it's covered with clouds, in which case it's white), and the leaves of plants are white. Stunned anthropologists spent a couple generations in remote villages or travelling with hunter/gatherers, and asking them to compare and label colored tiles or swatches of cloth, and determined that the people who spoke these languages were not colorblind, they just honestly didn't see the need for more words for color than this.The reason seems to be that there just isn't much need for words for color, until you have dyes, paints, markers, and other ways of routinely making a given thing one color or another. If all plants are green, why do you need to say the 'green plant'? You can just say 'plant'. If a fruit can only either be green (when it's not ripe) or red (when it's ripe), you can just say 'ripe' (or 'not ripe'), and there's no great need for a word for the color. It's rather like how we don't have words for smell, really, we mostly just say 'smells like coffee' or 'smells like flowers', or some other simile. We don't add fragrances to things (routinely), they mostly just smell how they smell, so we don't need to say 'hand me the coffee-smelling hammer, not the flowery-smelling one'. We just say 'hand me the hammer', and what smell it has is irrelevant.There are also languages which have three words for color: black, white, and red. There are several of these, not all related. What's interesting is that there aren't any with words for black, white, and blue, or black, white, and green. If there is a third and final color name, and you ask speakers to point to the tile which best epitomizes that color, they will point to the red one.Languages with four colors will have black, white, red, and either yellow or green, and languages with a fifth word for color will have both yellow and green. Blue is apparently not all that important to humans, and only languages with at least six words for color will be able to say that the sky is blue. Before that, apparently, you just note that the sky is clear, and get on with life without bothering about what color that is. One wonders what small children can pester their parents about if they can't ask why the sky is blue (I bet they manage).Having demonstrated that languages can really be different, Deutscher moves on to his main thesis: languages do really change how we think, at least a little, but not based on what they have words for. Rather, languages affect our thinking not in what they allow, but in what they require. There are languages where you do not refer to something being on your left or right; it must always be referred to as being on your north, south, or whatever. This REQUIRES the speaker to always be aware of which way is north, and to reflect this in their speech many times a day. When telling a story of something that happened to them, they must think about what direction they were facing when they told it. One might suspect that such people have a sense of direction much more developed than ours, and experiments prove that you are right. Wake such a person up from a deep sleeop in the middle of the night, and ask them what direction they were facing when they met their spouse for the first time decades before, and they will be able to tell you (although they may slap you upside the head first).There are many languages where nearly every noun is either masculine or feminine, and many others where a goodly percentage of inanimate objects are, and you have to reflect this in your word endings or choice of articles (e.g. which form of 'the' you use when speaking about 'the pine tree'). Ask speakers of German (where the word for 'bridge' is feminine) and Spanish (where it is masculine) to describe bridges, and the former will say that they are beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender, while the latter will say that they are big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and towering.Deutscher has several other such examples, with ample citations of published studies to back him up, and enough studies of Victorian scholars cavorting with savages to entertain a reader like me who is amused by the image of a bemused hunter regarding a box of colored tiles that the crazy white man wants to ask him questions about. The field he is involved in is still very immature, by his own admission. He compares it to trying to study the behavior of a corporation by camping outside the headquarters and monitoring which rooms are lit up for how many hours a day. But, if he and others succeed in at least legitimizing the question of how language influences the way we think, then it is possible that in a generation or two we may be in a position to say a lot more about it (in any language we care to use)."
130,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52711508-max-lauber,4,"This book offers a history of the often (and rightly) maligned Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and details how the notion that language shapes people's perception of the world became an *idea non grata*. Deutscher takes the reader from William Gladstone's 19th century analysis of Homer to state-of-the-art neurolinguistics research in order to not only show how language affects perception, but also to show that the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is mostly just a high-flying fantasy. To summarize it in a sentence, Deutscher argues that culture, i.e. language, has a stronger effect on our thinking than we are comfortable to admit, but that the impact of language on thought is very different from what it was believed to be in the past.Specifically, he argues that there is no evidence that our mother tongue constrains our cognitive capacity or that it imposes limits on what we can understand. In other words, he says the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is bunk. Instead, he argues that ""the real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us - all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself"". He summarizes this idea in what he calls the Boas-Jakobson principle: Languages differ essentially in what they must convey, not in what they may convey.By surveying not only current research, but also methodologies and findings from the past 200 years, Deutscher makes a very plausible claim for the Boas-Jakobson principle and for his rejection of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and the linguistic dogma that language does not fundamentally affect the way we think. Although there is no dearth of substance in this book, Deutscher shines more brightly when it comes to style. He has a knack for explaining the history of ideas (particularly when it comes to the history of color and perception) and dropping quirky anecdotes at the right moment (i.e. almost all the time). In short, this is an engaging read that offers a rather nuanced take on one of the thorniest linguistic questions. As such, definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."
131,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about language, mostly because the information provided is done so with great verve and charm by the author. His chatty style is most disarming — this is a man who knows how to educate his readers almost effortlessly: he will occasionally lead you astray deliberately, so that he can later point out what further research has revealed. And it is quite rewarding!This book limits itself to three specific aspects of language: the words used in languages for colour; the method used in various cultures and languages for orientation of oneself within the world; and an examination of the use of 'gender' in many languages (with English being one of the few that seems to particularly eschew this quality). The overall objective seems to be that from his studies Deutscher tends to believe that, as the title tells us, the world does look different in other languages. He tends to leave it at that: to argue as to how different that world is, and whether this indicates anything further with regard to science, philosophy, religion, culture, etc. are obviously left for others to ponder.I used quotes around the word 'gender' above because it was in this section (entitled ""Sex and Syntax"") that I was not completely convinced by his argument. He uses the example of a poem by Heine in which a pine tree in the North dreams of a palm tree 'far in the East', and points out that in the original German language a pine tree is a masculine word, while a palm tree is a feminine word — thus there is a 'sexual overtone' found in the original which a simple English translation would fail to communicate. He seems to argue that this lack of gender makes English less rich in its connotations. (It also explains why often enough learners of English from a country where words have a sexual distinction applied to them will often make 'mistakes' with personal pronouns, and will apply them 'incorrectly' to English words: in other words, they are still thinking of a word in the sex of their original language.) What bothers me about this is that my background is Italian, a language which has male and female words, but I can never remember thinking that they had an actual sexual connotation. For example, the word for a fork in Italian is feminine, but it does not mean that there are sexual connotations connected to a fork. Maybe I am being too precious about this, but it did make me wonder about whether Deutscher's 'smooth talking' might not mask other aspects which might not be 'quite right'…Be that as it may, the book is still quite a wonderful read for anyone interested in languages in general."
132,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10298127-anne,0,"I can't really review this book, because if I'd known anything about linguistics, I wouldn't have to read this in the first place. But I'll give it a try.Through the Language Glass is a popular science book for people interested in how language and perception of reality work. It is easy to read (but not too easy) and Guy Deutscher uses interesting examples to show how differences between languages can cause (ever so tiny) differences in perception. He is quite critical of people jumping to conclusions, so this book doesn't convince you of some radical idea that your reality is completely different from that of someone with a different mother tongue. Instead, it shows how things like colour perception, grammatical gender, and direction through left-right or east-west can have a tiny influence on your sense of the world, if only because when tested, people who are confronted with something that clashes with their language's 'settings' take a tiny bit more time than others.So the good part is that he doesn't try to shove crazy theories down your throat, but tries to remain critical. The bad part is that he seems either to take pleasure in discrediting scientists who were wrong about things or that he just exaggerates for dramatic effect. Either way, not so great. In general, his tone is definitely less neutral than I would like, also when he talks about ""primitive tribes"" etc. He seems not to have fixed on one term that is satisfactory, and although he defends the complexity of their language, I think he is quite careless and unspecific (and a bit tactless) in his terms to describe these societies, and maybe he could have looked up anthropologists' terms and used those. I know it's a fluffy popular science book but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a more objective, scientific tone.If you're looking for a book that will convince you that language changes your reality or that it absolutely does not, this is not it. Deutscher uses three topics (colour, grammatical gender, direction) of which colour takes up the most space in the book. It was a nice read but if at all possible, it would have been nice to have some extra categories, and not just these three."
133,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"As other reviewers remarked, the title of this book is slightly misleading. A large part of the book deals with colours. How they are perceived, how their naming follows a similar pattern in most languages and why this is important. There are mentions of Homer and his ""wine coloured sea"", a pretty dense historical background and references to modern studies. This part I found most interesting, but it has not much to do with the fact that the world looks different in other languages. Because, in fact it does not.Other chapters explain that languages have very little influence on thoughts and that grammar is the only constraint to the way we express ourselves. People understand basic concepts more or less in the same way, but they have different grammar rules to express them. More than language, what shapes their thoughts is their culture.There is also some debate about the fact that we change slightly, when we speak a foreign language. Much is said about languages that have masculine and feminine nouns and those that have not. Personally, I speak four languages quite fluently and I must confess I never noticed any major change of personality when I switch from Italian to English, to French or Portuguese. But maybe it is just me. The absence of ""gender"" in English nouns is actually much welcomed, since I must deal with random feminine and masculine in the other three languages I know.For those not familiar, I can assure you it is pretty annoying having to learn that ""la fleur"" is feminine in French and ""a viagem"" is feminine in Portuguese, while both are masculine in Italian (""il fiore"",""il viaggio""). The total lack of logic of assigning genders to nouns can be mind-blowing, but still does not interfere with the fact that when I see a flower I know it is a flower and not a cat – whether I think in Italian, French, English or Portuguese."
134,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"This book uses three 'case studies' (colour, gender and spacial awareness) to look at how language affects our view of the world, our thinking and our memory.The first third of the book looks in depth at the history of the study of how colour is described by various international and classical cultures and how the differences have been (miss)interpreted by an assortment of learned gentlemen over the years. This gives a very nice springboard to the reader to see the types of pitfalls that such studies can fall into and prepare the ground for the second part of the book.The second section of the book goes into more depth on the subject of 'how can we study whether linguistic differences really affect our minds and the way they work?'. The Australian (and other) tribes that do all their directions in North, South, East and West rather than ever using left, right, in front or behind, were new to me and absolutely fascinating. Deutscher writes in an easily accessible style adding plenty of actual data from studies without letting it overwhelm the greater story. I felt that the arguments for and against certain viewpoints were well rehearsed in a relatively light hearted non-judgemental way that left one feeling enlightened and amused. This book has re-enforced my view that the human minds and human cultures are totally fascinating in their infintie variety, and left me looking for more non fiction in a similar vein. I have a few other books lined up. I hope they are as good. "
135,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"I enjoyed this book. The title for me was a bit misleading, at least for the first part of the book, which was mostly about out color sense and how we perceive colors and the role that language plays in that perception. I was not expecting this and so it threw me off a bit but the author’s excellent writing style quickly had me feeling at ease.About the writing style, it is relaxed and playful. The author is a punster and the book is littered with witty puns throughout (even the appendix has a pun thrown in) but this doesn’t take away from the excellent scientific research that is conveyed. I especially liked the second part of the book and the fascinating story of the Guugu Yimithirr, a group of native peoples whose language reflects the geography of the world. Where I (and most other people I know) use our bodies as the starting point for explaining directions to other people, the Guugu Yimithirr use the cardinal points of a compass, so that if I see a bug on your left foot I would state that, whereas a Guugu Yimithirr person would say that you have a bug on your ""West"" foot (if he was facing South and you were facing him.) This was amazing to me, and the author describes other equally fascinating cultures that use geography to describe the world. I have a lousy sense of direction but not so these other peoples, and this kind of thinking is not as rare as you would imagine.All in all, I feel this is an excellent book and would like to read it again to catch the things I missed. Highly recommended. "
136,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745423-simon,4,"One small criticism first: this was in some ways less far-ranging and comprehensive than I'd imagined, focussing on just three aspects of language and the perception of reality - colour, gender and spatial relations. And the sections on colour account for almost half the book. This can be forgiven as these are the only areas in which any serious and conclusive research has been done.But once you get past that narrowing of the scope, this is a still an eye-opening and enormously readble book, full of fascinating details and vividly described characters. What makes it work best is Deutscher's skill as a storyteller, with early sections tracing the historical development of theories about ancient Greeks' colour perception at times read like a particularly engrossing thriller (no, really). Deutscher is also a skilled prose writer, and not above slipping in the occasional linguistic witticism, but only where appropriate and never coming across as clever for its own sake.Highly recommended."
137,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Book about the way language influences the way we think -- and vice-versa. While the famous Sapir-Whorf thesis has been debunked (and is a bit of an embarrassment for linguists), in the end it seems that language and our thinking *do* have have some influence upon each other.I enjoyed the discussion of Homer and the weird usage of colors, and the way some Australian tribes use an absolute (well, with earth as the frame of reference) coordinate system rather than 'left of me', 'in front of me' etc.Also interesting was the discussion of the Matsés people of the Amazon. Their language has a built-in concept of evidentiality -- every time they say anything about anything, their language requires them to express the amount of evidence for the statement -- 'seen with my own eyes' until 'mere hearsay' paper. A great idea -- maybe we should import that concept in our languages as well?"

The color chapters are by far the strongest (first and last). He gives a careful dissecting of Whorfianism and showing why he's not defending that (a good debate strategy, to be sure); however, other works argue that the evidence presented therein really does have cause and effect backwards (as far as language and thought). I would strongly recommend reading this in conjunction with Christine Kennealy's ""The First Word"" and Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought,"" and drawing your own conclusions, assuming of course you're a linguistics nerd and have a lot of time on your hands. This, you'll get through fairly quickly: Pinker especially, though, will take you some chewing."

145,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23180960-stephen-case,3,"It started with a conversation with a student, who said he had read an article explaining that the color blue never appeared in ancient Greek writings. That led to some internet searching, and I quickly found this book, which claims to be a treatment of this puzzle and turns out to be an explanation of the way language shapes the way we see the world. Do people who speak different languages actually see the world differently? Or in other words, how much does the structure of our language mirror or constrain the structure of our thought?Deutscher-- a linguist with an axe to grind against some of the contemporary views in the field-- starts the exploration of this question with its most interesting manifestation: color. The realization that there was something strange going on in ancient accounts of color goes back to the philhellene and sometimes Prime Minister William Gladstone who noticed that blue never appears in Homer's writings. The sea and sky are not referred to as blue, and other colors are also used in questionable ways. Other researchers into ancient texts discovered similar things: many ancient languages didn't have a word for blue. Indeed, there seemed to be a order of appearance in which ""primitive"" languages (and the author offers examples of some contemporary languages as well) distinguish between dark and light and lump all colors together as reddish. Eventually words for yellows and browns appear and finally terms that distinguish between greens and blues. The differentiation of blue usually comes last, and there are still signs of this, for instance, in the fact that in old Japanese the word for blue and green is the same.What does this mean? Early theories speculated that there was an actual physiological evolution taking place, that as humans became less primitive their eyes developed to perceive a wider spectrum of colors. Modern genetics and tests on speakers who languages currently lack certain color words has disproven this. Ancient Greek eyes were the same as ours. But did their lack of names for certain colors shape the way they perceived the world? This is the crux of the author's question: do we really see things if we don't have words to express them? I explored this once in a story published in Daily Science Fiction. Does naming something make it more real or at least more readily apparent?Part of the argument for color goes something like this. In primitive civilizations color doesn't matter a whole lot, and certain colors are rarely perceived on their own. Red is the color of blood, so a word to distinguish this comes fairly early in most cultures. But there are no large blue animals, few blue flowers, and blue dye was very difficult to make and unknown in many cultures. (Egypt was an exception, and apparently ancient Egyptian had a word for blue.) Because of this, there was no social or linguistic need to distinguish or name this hue. But what about the sea and the sky? The sea rarely looks straightforwardly blue, and the sky-- when completely clear-- was simply the sky. Since there was no cultural need to distinguish its color, it was simply the sky.The first half of the book is an investigation of the history of the color question, and if you're not quite satisfied with the answer I've given (and I'm not sure I am), you might not be satisfied with this portion of the book. For Deutscher though, color simply sets up the bigger question: how do we determine-- and then empirically test-- whether language actually shapes our perception and our thought processes? Are certain concepts (like ""The sky is blue"") simply inexpressible in some languages? Does this mean speakers of those languages are unable to conceive of certain statements and concepts? Deutscher's answer is no to these last two questions but a cautious yes to the first.An older, stronger claim would answer the final question of the above paragraph in the affirmative: language constrains thought. Because the Hopi Indians, for instance, have no verb tense in their language or expressions of time, they cannot perceive time as linear. Because other Native American languages do not distinguish between verb and subject, speakers of these languages have a more monistic, unified of nature. Deutscher disagrees and takes obvious pleasure in demolishing these claims, maintaining instead that any concept can be expressed in any language. His alternate claim is more subtle: it's not that some languages make it impossible to perceive or conceive certain things; rather, his claim is that certain languages obligate speakers to always be thinking of certain things.What does this mean? The author provides three examples. The first is that of a particular well-studied Australian aboriginal language that does not possess an egocentric coordinate system (i.e. behind, in front, left, right) but only an absolute system (north, east, south, west). Every positional expression voiced in this language, from things as simple as ""There's a bug beside your foot"" have to be given in terms of cardinal directions. (""There's a bug north of your foot."") This means that speakers of the language always have a sense of these directions from a very young age, and their experiences and memories are seen through that directional lens. The author discusses a variety of experiments in which it's shown that speakers of this language can recall details in this coordinate system, recounting orientations of experiences from years ago. (To put this in perspective, try calling up a particularly vivid memory and expressing it in terms of cardinal directions. Were you standing to the north or south of your spouse when you got married?) The language obligates its speakers to always have cardinal directions in mind and thus shapes their perceptions of the world accordingly.Languages with no egocentric coordinate system though are comparatively rare, so the author's second example is closer to home: languages like German or Spanish or many more with a developed gender system. In English-- at least since the century or so after the Norman Conquest, as the author points out in a fascinating historical treatment-- does not oblige its speakers to assign genders to inanimate objects. Yet many other modern languages do. Not much study has yet been done, according to Deutscher, on how this influences the thoughts of speakers of these languages, but he illustrates some of the implications with an example of the role this plays in translation and the subtle nuances and relations that can be lost moving from a gendered to a largely non-gendered language.Finally, he returns to color. Does our language's names for colors-- and the fact that these names don't exist in certain other languages-- influence the way we perceive the world? Recent studies, the author argues, indicate that yes, it does. He takes the case of light blue and dark blue, which in Russian have separate names. An English speaker would perceive these as shades of the same color. For a Russian speaker they would be separate colors. If this was indeed the case, one could expect that this linguistic obligation (that of the Russian speaker to give these separate hues different names) would allow Russians to more quickly distinguish between similar shades of blue if they lay on opposite sides of this distinction, in a similar manner to how an English speaker could more readily distinguish between greenish-blue and bluish-green than a speaker of a language that does not differentiate between green and blue. The author relates in detail the set-up of experiments to determine just that, which show the language-processing region of the brain active even when actively naming the hues was not part of the experiment. Russian speakers consistently differentiated between close shades of blue more quickly than English speakers.What does all this mean? It comes back to the central claim of the book, that languages, by obligating their speakers to pay attention to certain things in their structure, can function as a lens by which their speakers perceive the world.Consider this analogy (not given in the book): if your language has several different expressions for snow, so that each time you talk about snow you're obligated to take into consideration things like whether it's falling or on the ground, how long it's been on the ground, what its thickness and consistency is, then when you look at snow (or call up a memory containing snow) you're going to have a richer perception of the object than an English speaker who encapsulates all the varieties of snow under a single word. That doesn't mean that an English speaker can't conceptualize or express these nuances of snow. It just means her language doesn't habituate her to these perceptions.In these (possibly over-simplified) terms, Deutscher's argument seems almost self-evident, but the richness of his treatment comes in the historical and linguistic background he provides while exploring this idea and especially in his explanations of the rigor and structure of the experiments devised to verify such apparently straightforward claims about language and how it shapes our perceptions of the world."
146,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3514657-aya-zain,4,"The blurb of this book excited me so much. I've always wondered whether language has an influence on our intentions, our implications, and our culture. But Guy Deutscher made me think of the reverse scenario: that culture has had an impact on language, and that language is enforced every day thus leaving us no choice but to express ourselves in a somewhat outdated mode. Let me illustrate that further.I'm not sure what my mother tongue is. I'm of Arab descent, so it should be Arabic, however I was born and raised overseas where I focused on learning English instead. I became advanced in English and chose English as both a major and a minor for university, whereas my Arabic is intermediate to say the least. I can speak Arabic, but I always mess up the verb tenses -- feminine or masculine? So 'That table has a book on it' would turn into That (masculine) table (feminine) has a book on (feminine) it -- which is all incorrect, by the way! My Arabic just wasn't very good, and so I always confused the propositions and other articles.Arabic - like a few other languages - doesn't have gender neutrality, so that our every day language must determine what is masculine and what is feminine. And you can probably imagine that the more delicate inanimate objects usually took on the feminine form.Anyway - it goes further than that. And I once mentioned it to a high school classmate of mine in the 11th grade. I asked him: how come the verb conjugation of the plural masculine form gets a special (new and improved) conjugation, however the plural feminine verb conjugation is subjected to the same conjugation as the 'they' conjugation?He retaliated almost defensively, telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and that Arabic is the language of religion (Islam) and that I shouldn't challenge it because it is a flawless language. Which is exactly what is wrong with language -- he chose to take my argument personally as if it's offensive to his very nature. And that is exactly the problem.You can imagine how an every day reminder of what is feminine and what is masculine, or what is female and what is male has an impact on the way we perceive things. Take this for example: mowazafa (female office worker) and mowazaf (male office worker).Those involved in that sort of dialogue will have constant reminders to make gender distinctions, whether they like it or not. Their impressions are already preconceived when determining the nature of that thing they are referring to - be it female or male.I picked up on that because that's how I studied my subjects. I would put the information into images in my head and create a story, so it was easy to fall into the presumption that the feminine conjugation fell into the same category as the it conjugation due to sexist precursors.Arabic is not a flawless language. Arabic has stopped developing at one point in time, and refuses to change its methods to fit the modern-day society, and so people on some scale will be stuck expressing themselves in a language that doesn't fit a progressive society or lifestyle.If we try to think of ways to develop language so as to expand our neurological functions, we'll find that our cognitive abilities will also improve, thus making us smarter and more knowledgeable.I really like the examples that Deutscher drew out in his book, such as Guugu Yimithirr -- an Aboriginal Australian language that existed in Far North Queensland. They had the tendency to use the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) rather than egocentric coordinations (right, left, back and front). How does that make them see the world differently? They will never get lost. Even looking at Google Maps confuses me sometimes - am I supposed to turn a right or a left? However if my mind was brought up in the Gugu Ymithir community, I wouldn't have been so troubled as to figure out which direction to go. But then again, that could be just my terrible sense of direction.Another example was about the color blue. A mysterious color, in my opinion. It's barely seen in nature, yet it's everywhere. It's in the sky, it's in the sea that reflects the sky. However Deutscher mentions that when you take a look at Ancient literature, you'll find that the color blue is never mentioned. The sea is described as the color of wine, and the sky is not seen as blue. In daylight, it's white, and at night it's black. The word blue just wasn't necessary back then. However, now blue is everywhere, and the sky is just about as blue as the sea. We have so much blue that the Russians have not one, but two names for the color blue. They have two color distinctions that the average English speaker would call blue, but they call Siniy and Goluboy.  When taken in for experiments, it was found that the Russian speakers were able to distinguish between all colors faster than the English speakers did. This ability to perceive colors in a different way, while seeing the same colors, shows that language could really transform our potentials and increase our capabilities.Language is a dangerous weapon if not handled correctly. There has been no example of this though, so don't take my word on it. But I think that we can utilize language if we work on it meticulously to shape the society and the future that we want.Thanks Deutscher for such an informative book! There are so many great references in this book, and I was left with a lot more information on language than I had before."
147,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63279672-courtney-mosier-warren,3,"In general this was a very good book. I found many of the arguments to be interesting and worth exploring. That being said, at times this books felt a bit condescending. The tone that Mr. Deutscher uses comes across poorly, although I think it is unintentional. The condescending tone does not take away from the merit of the book, but it often left me feeling distracted by it."
148,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116092820-meg-briers,4,"A good read exploring how our mother tongue may be affecting our perceptions of colour, gender and space/coordinate system. A nice crossover between the fields of linguistics and psychology that really made you think about language and how it's having an influence on your day to day life. Very informative and gave a lot of new information without making the language too inaccessible as many other similar books seem to do, quite a nice gentle read!"
149,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"Guy Deutscher's Through the Language Glass, which looks at the relationship between language, culture and perception, wasn't quite what I'd expected. Honestly, I'd expected a variation of that old chestnut on the Eskimos having a gazillion words for the concept of ""snow"", to explain how our environment and culture shapes the language we speak. Deutscher's book surpassed those expectations. There are a few painful moments in the book, when Deutscher attempts to make some witty puns (this is a book on language after all). Wannabe gems like ""In their pronouncements on language, culture and thought, it seems that big thinkers in their grandes oeuvres have not always risen much above little thinkers over their hors d'oeuvres."" Or how about ""All the facts mentioned so far about the cones in the retina are correct to the best of my knowledge. But if you are under the impression that they actually explain our sensation of colour, then you have been coned!"" Do I detect some eye rolling here? But things look up once Deutscher gets serious. Dismissing many of the common fallacies or accepted wisdoms in linguistics - like how all languages are equally complex (how does one measure complexity? how do you trade off complexity in morphology against complexity in syntax, grammar rules, etc?) - Deutscher makes a tight and convincing case for what we can conclude about language. We can summarise the main thrusts of this case with the following 3 points:1. While nature may set the boundaries of how we perceive and relate to the world (it doesn't make sense to use the same word to describe red dogs and red roses for instance), culture significantly influences how we navigate within those boundaries. A more refined colour vocabulary, or one that emphasises hue over brightness, will lead to differences in how colours are named and classified. 2. Languages vary considerable in the amount of information they convey within words - e.g. tense, person performing the action, singularity/plurality, distance, etc. There is an inverse correlation between the complexity of society and word structure as communication among intimates often allows more compact, terse ways of expressing oneself. Conversely, the greater the number of speakers, more explicit markers for providing context (e.g. prepositions, subordinate clauses) are required and simplification through bastardisation of the language also occurs. 3. Language influences us not so much in what we are allowed to think but in the ""kinds of information each language habitually obliges [us] to think about"", from the way we see spatial relationships, to the attributes that we associate objects with (depending on whether one's language assigns a gender to that object). ""When a language forces its speakers to pay attention to certain aspects of the world each time they open their mouths or prick up their ears, such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills"". There are many things in Deutscher's book that are thought provoking. But perhaps the point that struck me the most was just how much gets lost in translation, when the associations we make with certain words just disappear when transplanted into another linguistic framework. As Deutscher notes: ""But if you native speakers of English are tempted to feel sorry for those of us who are shackled by the heavy load of an irrational gender system, then think again. I would never want to change places with you...my world has so much to it that you entirely miss out on, because the landscape of my language is so much more fertile than your arid desert of 'it's'. It goes without saying that genders are language's gift to poets. Heine's masculine pine tree longs for the feminine palm; Boris Pasternak's My Sister Life can only work because 'life' is feminine in Russian; English translations of Charles Beaudelaire's 'L'homme et la mer', however inspired, can never hope to capture the tempestuous relationship of attraction and antagonism that he evokes between 'him' (the man) and 'her' (the sea); nor can English do justice to Pablo Neruda's 'Ode to the Sea', in which the (masculine) el mar strikes a stone (una piedra) and then 'he caresses her, kisses her, drenches her, pounds his chest, repeating his own name' - the English 'it caresses it, kisses it, drenches it, pounds its chest' is not quite the same."""
150,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,3," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com I bought this book on February 1st at a bookstore in Aachen, Germany, during what they called 'Bye Bye-Brexit rabat' (Bye Bye Brexit Sale) which was 20% discount on all English books. Obviously, I couldn't resist. I went on to convince the book club I recently joined to read it as our next read, but unfortunately because of the entire Covid19 situation, we haven't had the possibility to discuss the book. I now feel a little bit sorry for them, as the book was not really what I hoped it would be. The subject fascinates me. When I was a small child, growing up speaking Dutch, for a time I believed (I am embarrassed to admit) that everyone always thought in Dutch, but that two French people for example, would then decide to speak French to each other. I quickly learned this was not the case, but it kept me interested in how someones language might influence how people think. Which is why I wanted to read Through the Language Glass.The author himself is very much interested in colors. And a large part of the book is in fact about the evolution of the naming of colors in languages. While interesting, I thought it was rather a bit too extensive. The remainder of the book was filled with some interesting facts, which might come to use at a pub quiz but the argument for the influence between language and thought was never very strong. Most interestingly I found the argument that some languages are forcing people to convey information in a certain sentence that other do not. For example, if your languages has changing verbs announcing how certain you are something happened, you have to think about it before making that sentence. If you have different verbs for something that happened one day or a week ago, again you have to think about. Same for languages who unlike English have gendered words. Ultimately, the effect that was measured was rather small, I'd argue. While difficult to measure objectively, is thinking colors are further apart from each other when they cross an arbitrary color-name boundary something that is important enough to consider this a significant effect of language on thought? I am not convinced. "
151,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"My interest in  Through the Language Glass came from a conversation with a friend about how the color blue was relatively recent 'invention.' This was not that the color blue didn't exist in antiquity, but rather that it didn't go by that name. How then, did the ancients view blue? How did they view colors? Like most things, there's a book for that. Through the Language Glass not only delves into the complicated world of how language and culture affects how we organize colors, and perhaps even how we see them, but also how the science of how we perceive color and name it developed over time. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is also delved into, as are the multitude of problems with it and where they just may have gotten things right. This book is dense with information, riveting in what new discoveries and alternative hypotheses it discusses, and rife with good humor. While this book was a dry read at times, it was one I could not put down for the sheer interesting nature of all it discusses. It's a shame that so much of these topics have yet to be thoroughly discussed, but this book seems to be bringing glad tidings of a shift in focus that is more welcoming towards how culture affects language and perception."
152,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2974294-jessica,1,"DNF a little more than 100 pages into it because the author's casual use of the words ""primitive"" and ""savage"" to describe indigenous peoples and peoples from pre-literate societies was extremely distasteful. And by that, I mean racist. And his discussion of creole/pidgin languages was similarly limited. Jade goes into more detail in her review than I care to.I'm going to save myself the energy and frustration, and just move on to  The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language instead."

Well, disappointed in what I read ... the book focused almost exclusively on color, and how the way we describe or see color is related to language. The author is color-blind, I believe, which I suppose explains this. However, I was expecting a book about how we *feel* different when we switch from one language to another, and that's not what this was. On the other hand, I am also somewhat relieved that the book isn't what I thought, since that's the book that I've been wanting to write. Guess I can still do that, since Guy Deutscher didn't ....."

159,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages"".There is a cluster of myths about language, referred to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that looms large over this book. If you have ever heard that the Eskimo had 50 (or 500) words for snow, and that what language you speak determines how you think, you have heard echoes of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The author of this book is one of the first to tiptoe back into the blast crater that was left when the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was exploded a century ago.In its more extreme form, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (named for a couple early scholars in the study of languages) asserts that because different languages have different words for things, and some concepts which have a name in one language do not have a name in others (e.g. schadenfreude), the language(s) you speak can determine what concepts you are able to think. For example, Eskimos can (allegedly) notice all the many shades of difference between one type of snow and another (hard packed, fused to ice, tiny and 'dry' like powder, big wet flakes, etc.), because they have words for them, and we cannot.Leaving aside whether or not the Inuit languages have many more words for snow than others (the answer appears to be complicated, but essentially 'not really'), there is another flaw with this, and 'schadenfreude' is a good illustration of it. First off, even though English had no word for 'taking joy in the misfortunes of others', we had no problem stealing it from German, and this is not only something that English does. Second, do we really believe that an english speaker in the years prior to this did not understand that sometimes a person would take joy in the downfall of another? You don't need a word or phrase for 'esprit de corps' to understand that morale is important, and if you have common enough occasion to refer to it, you can invent a word in any language.Moreover, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was one of several justifications given for policies like taking Australian Aborigines or Native Americans children from their homes and making them speak English, so it acquired a bit of a moral taint. Believing that the language you speak influences what you think became not just a scientific question, but a bit of a moral one as well, and any answer other than 'of course not' was morally suspect.Deutscher (a native speaker of Hebrew, by the way) is ready to risk such an accusation, but he first has to spend a chapter or two explaining what Sapir-Whorf was, why it wasn't true, and otherwise reassuring us that he doesn't think all children should be forced to speak one language on the grounds that it is culturally more refined. Having done that, he begins the exploration of this minefield by talking about the relatively objectively measurable topic of color.My favorite factoid from this book: there are languages in the world (several, it turns out) which have only two words for color (which correspond more or less to 'black' and 'white'). In these languages, the sky is black (except when it's covered with clouds, in which case it's white), and the leaves of plants are white. Stunned anthropologists spent a couple generations in remote villages or travelling with hunter/gatherers, and asking them to compare and label colored tiles or swatches of cloth, and determined that the people who spoke these languages were not colorblind, they just honestly didn't see the need for more words for color than this.The reason seems to be that there just isn't much need for words for color, until you have dyes, paints, markers, and other ways of routinely making a given thing one color or another. If all plants are green, why do you need to say the 'green plant'? You can just say 'plant'. If a fruit can only either be green (when it's not ripe) or red (when it's ripe), you can just say 'ripe' (or 'not ripe'), and there's no great need for a word for the color. It's rather like how we don't have words for smell, really, we mostly just say 'smells like coffee' or 'smells like flowers', or some other simile. We don't add fragrances to things (routinely), they mostly just smell how they smell, so we don't need to say 'hand me the coffee-smelling hammer, not the flowery-smelling one'. We just say 'hand me the hammer', and what smell it has is irrelevant.There are also languages which have three words for color: black, white, and red. There are several of these, not all related. What's interesting is that there aren't any with words for black, white, and blue, or black, white, and green. If there is a third and final color name, and you ask speakers to point to the tile which best epitomizes that color, they will point to the red one.Languages with four colors will have black, white, red, and either yellow or green, and languages with a fifth word for color will have both yellow and green. Blue is apparently not all that important to humans, and only languages with at least six words for color will be able to say that the sky is blue. Before that, apparently, you just note that the sky is clear, and get on with life without bothering about what color that is. One wonders what small children can pester their parents about if they can't ask why the sky is blue (I bet they manage).Having demonstrated that languages can really be different, Deutscher moves on to his main thesis: languages do really change how we think, at least a little, but not based on what they have words for. Rather, languages affect our thinking not in what they allow, but in what they require. There are languages where you do not refer to something being on your left or right; it must always be referred to as being on your north, south, or whatever. This REQUIRES the speaker to always be aware of which way is north, and to reflect this in their speech many times a day. When telling a story of something that happened to them, they must think about what direction they were facing when they told it. One might suspect that such people have a sense of direction much more developed than ours, and experiments prove that you are right. Wake such a person up from a deep sleeop in the middle of the night, and ask them what direction they were facing when they met their spouse for the first time decades before, and they will be able to tell you (although they may slap you upside the head first).There are many languages where nearly every noun is either masculine or feminine, and many others where a goodly percentage of inanimate objects are, and you have to reflect this in your word endings or choice of articles (e.g. which form of 'the' you use when speaking about 'the pine tree'). Ask speakers of German (where the word for 'bridge' is feminine) and Spanish (where it is masculine) to describe bridges, and the former will say that they are beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender, while the latter will say that they are big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and towering.Deutscher has several other such examples, with ample citations of published studies to back him up, and enough studies of Victorian scholars cavorting with savages to entertain a reader like me who is amused by the image of a bemused hunter regarding a box of colored tiles that the crazy white man wants to ask him questions about. The field he is involved in is still very immature, by his own admission. He compares it to trying to study the behavior of a corporation by camping outside the headquarters and monitoring which rooms are lit up for how many hours a day. But, if he and others succeed in at least legitimizing the question of how language influences the way we think, then it is possible that in a generation or two we may be in a position to say a lot more about it (in any language we care to use)."
160,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52711508-max-lauber,4,"This book offers a history of the often (and rightly) maligned Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and details how the notion that language shapes people's perception of the world became an *idea non grata*. Deutscher takes the reader from William Gladstone's 19th century analysis of Homer to state-of-the-art neurolinguistics research in order to not only show how language affects perception, but also to show that the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is mostly just a high-flying fantasy. To summarize it in a sentence, Deutscher argues that culture, i.e. language, has a stronger effect on our thinking than we are comfortable to admit, but that the impact of language on thought is very different from what it was believed to be in the past.Specifically, he argues that there is no evidence that our mother tongue constrains our cognitive capacity or that it imposes limits on what we can understand. In other words, he says the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is bunk. Instead, he argues that ""the real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us - all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself"". He summarizes this idea in what he calls the Boas-Jakobson principle: Languages differ essentially in what they must convey, not in what they may convey.By surveying not only current research, but also methodologies and findings from the past 200 years, Deutscher makes a very plausible claim for the Boas-Jakobson principle and for his rejection of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and the linguistic dogma that language does not fundamentally affect the way we think. Although there is no dearth of substance in this book, Deutscher shines more brightly when it comes to style. He has a knack for explaining the history of ideas (particularly when it comes to the history of color and perception) and dropping quirky anecdotes at the right moment (i.e. almost all the time). In short, this is an engaging read that offers a rather nuanced take on one of the thorniest linguistic questions. As such, definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."
161,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about language, mostly because the information provided is done so with great verve and charm by the author. His chatty style is most disarming — this is a man who knows how to educate his readers almost effortlessly: he will occasionally lead you astray deliberately, so that he can later point out what further research has revealed. And it is quite rewarding!This book limits itself to three specific aspects of language: the words used in languages for colour; the method used in various cultures and languages for orientation of oneself within the world; and an examination of the use of 'gender' in many languages (with English being one of the few that seems to particularly eschew this quality). The overall objective seems to be that from his studies Deutscher tends to believe that, as the title tells us, the world does look different in other languages. He tends to leave it at that: to argue as to how different that world is, and whether this indicates anything further with regard to science, philosophy, religion, culture, etc. are obviously left for others to ponder.I used quotes around the word 'gender' above because it was in this section (entitled ""Sex and Syntax"") that I was not completely convinced by his argument. He uses the example of a poem by Heine in which a pine tree in the North dreams of a palm tree 'far in the East', and points out that in the original German language a pine tree is a masculine word, while a palm tree is a feminine word — thus there is a 'sexual overtone' found in the original which a simple English translation would fail to communicate. He seems to argue that this lack of gender makes English less rich in its connotations. (It also explains why often enough learners of English from a country where words have a sexual distinction applied to them will often make 'mistakes' with personal pronouns, and will apply them 'incorrectly' to English words: in other words, they are still thinking of a word in the sex of their original language.) What bothers me about this is that my background is Italian, a language which has male and female words, but I can never remember thinking that they had an actual sexual connotation. For example, the word for a fork in Italian is feminine, but it does not mean that there are sexual connotations connected to a fork. Maybe I am being too precious about this, but it did make me wonder about whether Deutscher's 'smooth talking' might not mask other aspects which might not be 'quite right'…Be that as it may, the book is still quite a wonderful read for anyone interested in languages in general."
162,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10298127-anne,0,"I can't really review this book, because if I'd known anything about linguistics, I wouldn't have to read this in the first place. But I'll give it a try.Through the Language Glass is a popular science book for people interested in how language and perception of reality work. It is easy to read (but not too easy) and Guy Deutscher uses interesting examples to show how differences between languages can cause (ever so tiny) differences in perception. He is quite critical of people jumping to conclusions, so this book doesn't convince you of some radical idea that your reality is completely different from that of someone with a different mother tongue. Instead, it shows how things like colour perception, grammatical gender, and direction through left-right or east-west can have a tiny influence on your sense of the world, if only because when tested, people who are confronted with something that clashes with their language's 'settings' take a tiny bit more time than others.So the good part is that he doesn't try to shove crazy theories down your throat, but tries to remain critical. The bad part is that he seems either to take pleasure in discrediting scientists who were wrong about things or that he just exaggerates for dramatic effect. Either way, not so great. In general, his tone is definitely less neutral than I would like, also when he talks about ""primitive tribes"" etc. He seems not to have fixed on one term that is satisfactory, and although he defends the complexity of their language, I think he is quite careless and unspecific (and a bit tactless) in his terms to describe these societies, and maybe he could have looked up anthropologists' terms and used those. I know it's a fluffy popular science book but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a more objective, scientific tone.If you're looking for a book that will convince you that language changes your reality or that it absolutely does not, this is not it. Deutscher uses three topics (colour, grammatical gender, direction) of which colour takes up the most space in the book. It was a nice read but if at all possible, it would have been nice to have some extra categories, and not just these three."
163,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"As other reviewers remarked, the title of this book is slightly misleading. A large part of the book deals with colours. How they are perceived, how their naming follows a similar pattern in most languages and why this is important. There are mentions of Homer and his ""wine coloured sea"", a pretty dense historical background and references to modern studies. This part I found most interesting, but it has not much to do with the fact that the world looks different in other languages. Because, in fact it does not.Other chapters explain that languages have very little influence on thoughts and that grammar is the only constraint to the way we express ourselves. People understand basic concepts more or less in the same way, but they have different grammar rules to express them. More than language, what shapes their thoughts is their culture.There is also some debate about the fact that we change slightly, when we speak a foreign language. Much is said about languages that have masculine and feminine nouns and those that have not. Personally, I speak four languages quite fluently and I must confess I never noticed any major change of personality when I switch from Italian to English, to French or Portuguese. But maybe it is just me. The absence of ""gender"" in English nouns is actually much welcomed, since I must deal with random feminine and masculine in the other three languages I know.For those not familiar, I can assure you it is pretty annoying having to learn that ""la fleur"" is feminine in French and ""a viagem"" is feminine in Portuguese, while both are masculine in Italian (""il fiore"",""il viaggio""). The total lack of logic of assigning genders to nouns can be mind-blowing, but still does not interfere with the fact that when I see a flower I know it is a flower and not a cat – whether I think in Italian, French, English or Portuguese."
164,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"This book uses three 'case studies' (colour, gender and spacial awareness) to look at how language affects our view of the world, our thinking and our memory.The first third of the book looks in depth at the history of the study of how colour is described by various international and classical cultures and how the differences have been (miss)interpreted by an assortment of learned gentlemen over the years. This gives a very nice springboard to the reader to see the types of pitfalls that such studies can fall into and prepare the ground for the second part of the book.The second section of the book goes into more depth on the subject of 'how can we study whether linguistic differences really affect our minds and the way they work?'. The Australian (and other) tribes that do all their directions in North, South, East and West rather than ever using left, right, in front or behind, were new to me and absolutely fascinating. Deutscher writes in an easily accessible style adding plenty of actual data from studies without letting it overwhelm the greater story. I felt that the arguments for and against certain viewpoints were well rehearsed in a relatively light hearted non-judgemental way that left one feeling enlightened and amused. This book has re-enforced my view that the human minds and human cultures are totally fascinating in their infintie variety, and left me looking for more non fiction in a similar vein. I have a few other books lined up. I hope they are as good. "
165,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"I enjoyed this book. The title for me was a bit misleading, at least for the first part of the book, which was mostly about out color sense and how we perceive colors and the role that language plays in that perception. I was not expecting this and so it threw me off a bit but the author’s excellent writing style quickly had me feeling at ease.About the writing style, it is relaxed and playful. The author is a punster and the book is littered with witty puns throughout (even the appendix has a pun thrown in) but this doesn’t take away from the excellent scientific research that is conveyed. I especially liked the second part of the book and the fascinating story of the Guugu Yimithirr, a group of native peoples whose language reflects the geography of the world. Where I (and most other people I know) use our bodies as the starting point for explaining directions to other people, the Guugu Yimithirr use the cardinal points of a compass, so that if I see a bug on your left foot I would state that, whereas a Guugu Yimithirr person would say that you have a bug on your ""West"" foot (if he was facing South and you were facing him.) This was amazing to me, and the author describes other equally fascinating cultures that use geography to describe the world. I have a lousy sense of direction but not so these other peoples, and this kind of thinking is not as rare as you would imagine.All in all, I feel this is an excellent book and would like to read it again to catch the things I missed. Highly recommended. "
166,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745423-simon,4,"One small criticism first: this was in some ways less far-ranging and comprehensive than I'd imagined, focussing on just three aspects of language and the perception of reality - colour, gender and spatial relations. And the sections on colour account for almost half the book. This can be forgiven as these are the only areas in which any serious and conclusive research has been done.But once you get past that narrowing of the scope, this is a still an eye-opening and enormously readble book, full of fascinating details and vividly described characters. What makes it work best is Deutscher's skill as a storyteller, with early sections tracing the historical development of theories about ancient Greeks' colour perception at times read like a particularly engrossing thriller (no, really). Deutscher is also a skilled prose writer, and not above slipping in the occasional linguistic witticism, but only where appropriate and never coming across as clever for its own sake.Highly recommended."
167,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Book about the way language influences the way we think -- and vice-versa. While the famous Sapir-Whorf thesis has been debunked (and is a bit of an embarrassment for linguists), in the end it seems that language and our thinking *do* have have some influence upon each other.I enjoyed the discussion of Homer and the weird usage of colors, and the way some Australian tribes use an absolute (well, with earth as the frame of reference) coordinate system rather than 'left of me', 'in front of me' etc.Also interesting was the discussion of the Matsés people of the Amazon. Their language has a built-in concept of evidentiality -- every time they say anything about anything, their language requires them to express the amount of evidence for the statement -- 'seen with my own eyes' until 'mere hearsay' paper. A great idea -- maybe we should import that concept in our languages as well?"

He gives a careful dissecting of Whorfianism and showing why he's not defending that (a good debate strategy, to be sure); however, other works argue that the evidence presented therein really does have cause and effect backwards (as far as language and thought). I would strongly recommend reading this in conjunction with Christine Kennealy's ""The First Word"" and Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought,"" and drawing your own conclusions, assuming of course you're a linguistics nerd and have a lot of time on your hands. This, you'll get through fairly quickly: Pinker especially, though, will take you some chewing."

175,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23180960-stephen-case,3,"It started with a conversation with a student, who said he had read an article explaining that the color blue never appeared in ancient Greek writings. That led to some internet searching, and I quickly found this book, which claims to be a treatment of this puzzle and turns out to be an explanation of the way language shapes the way we see the world. Do people who speak different languages actually see the world differently? Or in other words, how much does the structure of our language mirror or constrain the structure of our thought?Deutscher-- a linguist with an axe to grind against some of the contemporary views in the field-- starts the exploration of this question with its most interesting manifestation: color. The realization that there was something strange going on in ancient accounts of color goes back to the philhellene and sometimes Prime Minister William Gladstone who noticed that blue never appears in Homer's writings. The sea and sky are not referred to as blue, and other colors are also used in questionable ways. Other researchers into ancient texts discovered similar things: many ancient languages didn't have a word for blue. Indeed, there seemed to be a order of appearance in which ""primitive"" languages (and the author offers examples of some contemporary languages as well) distinguish between dark and light and lump all colors together as reddish. Eventually words for yellows and browns appear and finally terms that distinguish between greens and blues. The differentiation of blue usually comes last, and there are still signs of this, for instance, in the fact that in old Japanese the word for blue and green is the same.What does this mean? Early theories speculated that there was an actual physiological evolution taking place, that as humans became less primitive their eyes developed to perceive a wider spectrum of colors. Modern genetics and tests on speakers who languages currently lack certain color words has disproven this. Ancient Greek eyes were the same as ours. But did their lack of names for certain colors shape the way they perceived the world? This is the crux of the author's question: do we really see things if we don't have words to express them? I explored this once in a story published in Daily Science Fiction. Does naming something make it more real or at least more readily apparent?Part of the argument for color goes something like this. In primitive civilizations color doesn't matter a whole lot, and certain colors are rarely perceived on their own. Red is the color of blood, so a word to distinguish this comes fairly early in most cultures. But there are no large blue animals, few blue flowers, and blue dye was very difficult to make and unknown in many cultures. (Egypt was an exception, and apparently ancient Egyptian had a word for blue.) Because of this, there was no social or linguistic need to distinguish or name this hue. But what about the sea and the sky? The sea rarely looks straightforwardly blue, and the sky-- when completely clear-- was simply the sky. Since there was no cultural need to distinguish its color, it was simply the sky.The first half of the book is an investigation of the history of the color question, and if you're not quite satisfied with the answer I've given (and I'm not sure I am), you might not be satisfied with this portion of the book. For Deutscher though, color simply sets up the bigger question: how do we determine-- and then empirically test-- whether language actually shapes our perception and our thought processes? Are certain concepts (like ""The sky is blue"") simply inexpressible in some languages? Does this mean speakers of those languages are unable to conceive of certain statements and concepts? Deutscher's answer is no to these last two questions but a cautious yes to the first.An older, stronger claim would answer the final question of the above paragraph in the affirmative: language constrains thought. Because the Hopi Indians, for instance, have no verb tense in their language or expressions of time, they cannot perceive time as linear. Because other Native American languages do not distinguish between verb and subject, speakers of these languages have a more monistic, unified of nature. Deutscher disagrees and takes obvious pleasure in demolishing these claims, maintaining instead that any concept can be expressed in any language. His alternate claim is more subtle: it's not that some languages make it impossible to perceive or conceive certain things; rather, his claim is that certain languages obligate speakers to always be thinking of certain things.What does this mean? The author provides three examples. The first is that of a particular well-studied Australian aboriginal language that does not possess an egocentric coordinate system (i.e. behind, in front, left, right) but only an absolute system (north, east, south, west). Every positional expression voiced in this language, from things as simple as ""There's a bug beside your foot"" have to be given in terms of cardinal directions. (""There's a bug north of your foot."") This means that speakers of the language always have a sense of these directions from a very young age, and their experiences and memories are seen through that directional lens. The author discusses a variety of experiments in which it's shown that speakers of this language can recall details in this coordinate system, recounting orientations of experiences from years ago. (To put this in perspective, try calling up a particularly vivid memory and expressing it in terms of cardinal directions. Were you standing to the north or south of your spouse when you got married?) The language obligates its speakers to always have cardinal directions in mind and thus shapes their perceptions of the world accordingly.Languages with no egocentric coordinate system though are comparatively rare, so the author's second example is closer to home: languages like German or Spanish or many more with a developed gender system. In English-- at least since the century or so after the Norman Conquest, as the author points out in a fascinating historical treatment-- does not oblige its speakers to assign genders to inanimate objects. Yet many other modern languages do. Not much study has yet been done, according to Deutscher, on how this influences the thoughts of speakers of these languages, but he illustrates some of the implications with an example of the role this plays in translation and the subtle nuances and relations that can be lost moving from a gendered to a largely non-gendered language.Finally, he returns to color. Does our language's names for colors-- and the fact that these names don't exist in certain other languages-- influence the way we perceive the world? Recent studies, the author argues, indicate that yes, it does. He takes the case of light blue and dark blue, which in Russian have separate names. An English speaker would perceive these as shades of the same color. For a Russian speaker they would be separate colors. If this was indeed the case, one could expect that this linguistic obligation (that of the Russian speaker to give these separate hues different names) would allow Russians to more quickly distinguish between similar shades of blue if they lay on opposite sides of this distinction, in a similar manner to how an English speaker could more readily distinguish between greenish-blue and bluish-green than a speaker of a language that does not differentiate between green and blue. The author relates in detail the set-up of experiments to determine just that, which show the language-processing region of the brain active even when actively naming the hues was not part of the experiment. Russian speakers consistently differentiated between close shades of blue more quickly than English speakers.What does all this mean? It comes back to the central claim of the book, that languages, by obligating their speakers to pay attention to certain things in their structure, can function as a lens by which their speakers perceive the world.Consider this analogy (not given in the book): if your language has several different expressions for snow, so that each time you talk about snow you're obligated to take into consideration things like whether it's falling or on the ground, how long it's been on the ground, what its thickness and consistency is, then when you look at snow (or call up a memory containing snow) you're going to have a richer perception of the object than an English speaker who encapsulates all the varieties of snow under a single word. That doesn't mean that an English speaker can't conceptualize or express these nuances of snow. It just means her language doesn't habituate her to these perceptions.In these (possibly over-simplified) terms, Deutscher's argument seems almost self-evident, but the richness of his treatment comes in the historical and linguistic background he provides while exploring this idea and especially in his explanations of the rigor and structure of the experiments devised to verify such apparently straightforward claims about language and how it shapes our perceptions of the world."
176,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3514657-aya-zain,4,"The blurb of this book excited me so much. I've always wondered whether language has an influence on our intentions, our implications, and our culture. But Guy Deutscher made me think of the reverse scenario: that culture has had an impact on language, and that language is enforced every day thus leaving us no choice but to express ourselves in a somewhat outdated mode. Let me illustrate that further.I'm not sure what my mother tongue is. I'm of Arab descent, so it should be Arabic, however I was born and raised overseas where I focused on learning English instead. I became advanced in English and chose English as both a major and a minor for university, whereas my Arabic is intermediate to say the least. I can speak Arabic, but I always mess up the verb tenses -- feminine or masculine? So 'That table has a book on it' would turn into That (masculine) table (feminine) has a book on (feminine) it -- which is all incorrect, by the way! My Arabic just wasn't very good, and so I always confused the propositions and other articles.Arabic - like a few other languages - doesn't have gender neutrality, so that our every day language must determine what is masculine and what is feminine. And you can probably imagine that the more delicate inanimate objects usually took on the feminine form.Anyway - it goes further than that. And I once mentioned it to a high school classmate of mine in the 11th grade. I asked him: how come the verb conjugation of the plural masculine form gets a special (new and improved) conjugation, however the plural feminine verb conjugation is subjected to the same conjugation as the 'they' conjugation?He retaliated almost defensively, telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and that Arabic is the language of religion (Islam) and that I shouldn't challenge it because it is a flawless language. Which is exactly what is wrong with language -- he chose to take my argument personally as if it's offensive to his very nature. And that is exactly the problem.You can imagine how an every day reminder of what is feminine and what is masculine, or what is female and what is male has an impact on the way we perceive things. Take this for example: mowazafa (female office worker) and mowazaf (male office worker).Those involved in that sort of dialogue will have constant reminders to make gender distinctions, whether they like it or not. Their impressions are already preconceived when determining the nature of that thing they are referring to - be it female or male.I picked up on that because that's how I studied my subjects. I would put the information into images in my head and create a story, so it was easy to fall into the presumption that the feminine conjugation fell into the same category as the it conjugation due to sexist precursors.Arabic is not a flawless language. Arabic has stopped developing at one point in time, and refuses to change its methods to fit the modern-day society, and so people on some scale will be stuck expressing themselves in a language that doesn't fit a progressive society or lifestyle.If we try to think of ways to develop language so as to expand our neurological functions, we'll find that our cognitive abilities will also improve, thus making us smarter and more knowledgeable.I really like the examples that Deutscher drew out in his book, such as Guugu Yimithirr -- an Aboriginal Australian language that existed in Far North Queensland. They had the tendency to use the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) rather than egocentric coordinations (right, left, back and front). How does that make them see the world differently? They will never get lost. Even looking at Google Maps confuses me sometimes - am I supposed to turn a right or a left? However if my mind was brought up in the Gugu Ymithir community, I wouldn't have been so troubled as to figure out which direction to go. But then again, that could be just my terrible sense of direction.Another example was about the color blue. A mysterious color, in my opinion. It's barely seen in nature, yet it's everywhere. It's in the sky, it's in the sea that reflects the sky. However Deutscher mentions that when you take a look at Ancient literature, you'll find that the color blue is never mentioned. The sea is described as the color of wine, and the sky is not seen as blue. In daylight, it's white, and at night it's black. The word blue just wasn't necessary back then. However, now blue is everywhere, and the sky is just about as blue as the sea. We have so much blue that the Russians have not one, but two names for the color blue. They have two color distinctions that the average English speaker would call blue, but they call Siniy and Goluboy.  When taken in for experiments, it was found that the Russian speakers were able to distinguish between all colors faster than the English speakers did. This ability to perceive colors in a different way, while seeing the same colors, shows that language could really transform our potentials and increase our capabilities.Language is a dangerous weapon if not handled correctly. There has been no example of this though, so don't take my word on it. But I think that we can utilize language if we work on it meticulously to shape the society and the future that we want.Thanks Deutscher for such an informative book! There are so many great references in this book, and I was left with a lot more information on language than I had before."

That being said, at times this books felt a bit condescending. The tone that Mr. Deutscher uses comes across poorly, although I think it is unintentional. The condescending tone does not take away from the merit of the book, but it often left me feeling distracted by it."
178,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116092820-meg-briers,4,"A good read exploring how our mother tongue may be affecting our perceptions of colour, gender and space/coordinate system. A nice crossover between the fields of linguistics and psychology that really made you think about language and how it's having an influence on your day to day life. Very informative and gave a lot of new information without making the language too inaccessible as many other similar books seem to do, quite a nice gentle read!"
179,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"Guy Deutscher's Through the Language Glass, which looks at the relationship between language, culture and perception, wasn't quite what I'd expected. Honestly, I'd expected a variation of that old chestnut on the Eskimos having a gazillion words for the concept of ""snow"", to explain how our environment and culture shapes the language we speak. Deutscher's book surpassed those expectations. There are a few painful moments in the book, when Deutscher attempts to make some witty puns (this is a book on language after all). Wannabe gems like ""In their pronouncements on language, culture and thought, it seems that big thinkers in their grandes oeuvres have not always risen much above little thinkers over their hors d'oeuvres."" Or how about ""All the facts mentioned so far about the cones in the retina are correct to the best of my knowledge. But if you are under the impression that they actually explain our sensation of colour, then you have been coned!"" Do I detect some eye rolling here? But things look up once Deutscher gets serious. Dismissing many of the common fallacies or accepted wisdoms in linguistics - like how all languages are equally complex (how does one measure complexity? how do you trade off complexity in morphology against complexity in syntax, grammar rules, etc?) - Deutscher makes a tight and convincing case for what we can conclude about language. We can summarise the main thrusts of this case with the following 3 points:1. While nature may set the boundaries of how we perceive and relate to the world (it doesn't make sense to use the same word to describe red dogs and red roses for instance), culture significantly influences how we navigate within those boundaries. A more refined colour vocabulary, or one that emphasises hue over brightness, will lead to differences in how colours are named and classified. 2. Languages vary considerable in the amount of information they convey within words - e.g. tense, person performing the action, singularity/plurality, distance, etc. There is an inverse correlation between the complexity of society and word structure as communication among intimates often allows more compact, terse ways of expressing oneself. Conversely, the greater the number of speakers, more explicit markers for providing context (e.g. prepositions, subordinate clauses) are required and simplification through bastardisation of the language also occurs. 3. Language influences us not so much in what we are allowed to think but in the ""kinds of information each language habitually obliges [us] to think about"", from the way we see spatial relationships, to the attributes that we associate objects with (depending on whether one's language assigns a gender to that object). ""When a language forces its speakers to pay attention to certain aspects of the world each time they open their mouths or prick up their ears, such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills"". There are many things in Deutscher's book that are thought provoking. But perhaps the point that struck me the most was just how much gets lost in translation, when the associations we make with certain words just disappear when transplanted into another linguistic framework. As Deutscher notes: ""But if you native speakers of English are tempted to feel sorry for those of us who are shackled by the heavy load of an irrational gender system, then think again. I would never want to change places with you...my world has so much to it that you entirely miss out on, because the landscape of my language is so much more fertile than your arid desert of 'it's'. It goes without saying that genders are language's gift to poets. Heine's masculine pine tree longs for the feminine palm; Boris Pasternak's My Sister Life can only work because 'life' is feminine in Russian; English translations of Charles Beaudelaire's 'L'homme et la mer', however inspired, can never hope to capture the tempestuous relationship of attraction and antagonism that he evokes between 'him' (the man) and 'her' (the sea); nor can English do justice to Pablo Neruda's 'Ode to the Sea', in which the (masculine) el mar strikes a stone (una piedra) and then 'he caresses her, kisses her, drenches her, pounds his chest, repeating his own name' - the English 'it caresses it, kisses it, drenches it, pounds its chest' is not quite the same."""
180,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,3," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com I bought this book on February 1st at a bookstore in Aachen, Germany, during what they called 'Bye Bye-Brexit rabat' (Bye Bye Brexit Sale) which was 20% discount on all English books. Obviously, I couldn't resist. I went on to convince the book club I recently joined to read it as our next read, but unfortunately because of the entire Covid19 situation, we haven't had the possibility to discuss the book. I now feel a little bit sorry for them, as the book was not really what I hoped it would be. The subject fascinates me. When I was a small child, growing up speaking Dutch, for a time I believed (I am embarrassed to admit) that everyone always thought in Dutch, but that two French people for example, would then decide to speak French to each other. I quickly learned this was not the case, but it kept me interested in how someones language might influence how people think. Which is why I wanted to read Through the Language Glass.The author himself is very much interested in colors. And a large part of the book is in fact about the evolution of the naming of colors in languages. While interesting, I thought it was rather a bit too extensive. The remainder of the book was filled with some interesting facts, which might come to use at a pub quiz but the argument for the influence between language and thought was never very strong. Most interestingly I found the argument that some languages are forcing people to convey information in a certain sentence that other do not. For example, if your languages has changing verbs announcing how certain you are something happened, you have to think about it before making that sentence. If you have different verbs for something that happened one day or a week ago, again you have to think about. Same for languages who unlike English have gendered words. Ultimately, the effect that was measured was rather small, I'd argue. While difficult to measure objectively, is thinking colors are further apart from each other when they cross an arbitrary color-name boundary something that is important enough to consider this a significant effect of language on thought? I am not convinced. "
181,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"My interest in  Through the Language Glass came from a conversation with a friend about how the color blue was relatively recent 'invention.' This was not that the color blue didn't exist in antiquity, but rather that it didn't go by that name. How then, did the ancients view blue? How did they view colors? Like most things, there's a book for that. Through the Language Glass not only delves into the complicated world of how language and culture affects how we organize colors, and perhaps even how we see them, but also how the science of how we perceive color and name it developed over time. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is also delved into, as are the multitude of problems with it and where they just may have gotten things right. This book is dense with information, riveting in what new discoveries and alternative hypotheses it discusses, and rife with good humor. While this book was a dry read at times, it was one I could not put down for the sheer interesting nature of all it discusses. It's a shame that so much of these topics have yet to be thoroughly discussed, but this book seems to be bringing glad tidings of a shift in focus that is more welcoming towards how culture affects language and perception."

Well, disappointed in what I read ... the book focused almost exclusively on color, and how the way we describe or see color is related to language. The author is color-blind, I believe, which I suppose explains this. However, I was expecting a book about how we *feel* different when we switch from one language to another, and that's not what this was. On the other hand, I am also somewhat relieved that the book isn't what I thought, since that's the book that I've been wanting to write. Guess I can still do that, since Guy Deutscher didn't ....."

189,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages"".There is a cluster of myths about language, referred to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that looms large over this book. If you have ever heard that the Eskimo had 50 (or 500) words for snow, and that what language you speak determines how you think, you have heard echoes of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The author of this book is one of the first to tiptoe back into the blast crater that was left when the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was exploded a century ago.In its more extreme form, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (named for a couple early scholars in the study of languages) asserts that because different languages have different words for things, and some concepts which have a name in one language do not have a name in others (e.g. schadenfreude), the language(s) you speak can determine what concepts you are able to think. For example, Eskimos can (allegedly) notice all the many shades of difference between one type of snow and another (hard packed, fused to ice, tiny and 'dry' like powder, big wet flakes, etc.), because they have words for them, and we cannot.Leaving aside whether or not the Inuit languages have many more words for snow than others (the answer appears to be complicated, but essentially 'not really'), there is another flaw with this, and 'schadenfreude' is a good illustration of it. First off, even though English had no word for 'taking joy in the misfortunes of others', we had no problem stealing it from German, and this is not only something that English does. Second, do we really believe that an english speaker in the years prior to this did not understand that sometimes a person would take joy in the downfall of another? You don't need a word or phrase for 'esprit de corps' to understand that morale is important, and if you have common enough occasion to refer to it, you can invent a word in any language.Moreover, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was one of several justifications given for policies like taking Australian Aborigines or Native Americans children from their homes and making them speak English, so it acquired a bit of a moral taint. Believing that the language you speak influences what you think became not just a scientific question, but a bit of a moral one as well, and any answer other than 'of course not' was morally suspect.Deutscher (a native speaker of Hebrew, by the way) is ready to risk such an accusation, but he first has to spend a chapter or two explaining what Sapir-Whorf was, why it wasn't true, and otherwise reassuring us that he doesn't think all children should be forced to speak one language on the grounds that it is culturally more refined. Having done that, he begins the exploration of this minefield by talking about the relatively objectively measurable topic of color.My favorite factoid from this book: there are languages in the world (several, it turns out) which have only two words for color (which correspond more or less to 'black' and 'white'). In these languages, the sky is black (except when it's covered with clouds, in which case it's white), and the leaves of plants are white. Stunned anthropologists spent a couple generations in remote villages or travelling with hunter/gatherers, and asking them to compare and label colored tiles or swatches of cloth, and determined that the people who spoke these languages were not colorblind, they just honestly didn't see the need for more words for color than this.The reason seems to be that there just isn't much need for words for color, until you have dyes, paints, markers, and other ways of routinely making a given thing one color or another. If all plants are green, why do you need to say the 'green plant'? You can just say 'plant'. If a fruit can only either be green (when it's not ripe) or red (when it's ripe), you can just say 'ripe' (or 'not ripe'), and there's no great need for a word for the color. It's rather like how we don't have words for smell, really, we mostly just say 'smells like coffee' or 'smells like flowers', or some other simile. We don't add fragrances to things (routinely), they mostly just smell how they smell, so we don't need to say 'hand me the coffee-smelling hammer, not the flowery-smelling one'. We just say 'hand me the hammer', and what smell it has is irrelevant.There are also languages which have three words for color: black, white, and red. There are several of these, not all related. What's interesting is that there aren't any with words for black, white, and blue, or black, white, and green. If there is a third and final color name, and you ask speakers to point to the tile which best epitomizes that color, they will point to the red one.Languages with four colors will have black, white, red, and either yellow or green, and languages with a fifth word for color will have both yellow and green. Blue is apparently not all that important to humans, and only languages with at least six words for color will be able to say that the sky is blue. Before that, apparently, you just note that the sky is clear, and get on with life without bothering about what color that is. One wonders what small children can pester their parents about if they can't ask why the sky is blue (I bet they manage).Having demonstrated that languages can really be different, Deutscher moves on to his main thesis: languages do really change how we think, at least a little, but not based on what they have words for. Rather, languages affect our thinking not in what they allow, but in what they require. There are languages where you do not refer to something being on your left or right; it must always be referred to as being on your north, south, or whatever. This REQUIRES the speaker to always be aware of which way is north, and to reflect this in their speech many times a day. When telling a story of something that happened to them, they must think about what direction they were facing when they told it. One might suspect that such people have a sense of direction much more developed than ours, and experiments prove that you are right. Wake such a person up from a deep sleeop in the middle of the night, and ask them what direction they were facing when they met their spouse for the first time decades before, and they will be able to tell you (although they may slap you upside the head first).There are many languages where nearly every noun is either masculine or feminine, and many others where a goodly percentage of inanimate objects are, and you have to reflect this in your word endings or choice of articles (e.g. which form of 'the' you use when speaking about 'the pine tree'). Ask speakers of German (where the word for 'bridge' is feminine) and Spanish (where it is masculine) to describe bridges, and the former will say that they are beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender, while the latter will say that they are big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and towering.Deutscher has several other such examples, with ample citations of published studies to back him up, and enough studies of Victorian scholars cavorting with savages to entertain a reader like me who is amused by the image of a bemused hunter regarding a box of colored tiles that the crazy white man wants to ask him questions about. The field he is involved in is still very immature, by his own admission. He compares it to trying to study the behavior of a corporation by camping outside the headquarters and monitoring which rooms are lit up for how many hours a day. But, if he and others succeed in at least legitimizing the question of how language influences the way we think, then it is possible that in a generation or two we may be in a position to say a lot more about it (in any language we care to use)."
190,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52711508-max-lauber,4,"This book offers a history of the often (and rightly) maligned Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and details how the notion that language shapes people's perception of the world became an *idea non grata*. Deutscher takes the reader from William Gladstone's 19th century analysis of Homer to state-of-the-art neurolinguistics research in order to not only show how language affects perception, but also to show that the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is mostly just a high-flying fantasy. To summarize it in a sentence, Deutscher argues that culture, i.e. language, has a stronger effect on our thinking than we are comfortable to admit, but that the impact of language on thought is very different from what it was believed to be in the past.Specifically, he argues that there is no evidence that our mother tongue constrains our cognitive capacity or that it imposes limits on what we can understand. In other words, he says the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is bunk. Instead, he argues that ""the real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us - all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself"". He summarizes this idea in what he calls the Boas-Jakobson principle: Languages differ essentially in what they must convey, not in what they may convey.By surveying not only current research, but also methodologies and findings from the past 200 years, Deutscher makes a very plausible claim for the Boas-Jakobson principle and for his rejection of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and the linguistic dogma that language does not fundamentally affect the way we think. Although there is no dearth of substance in this book, Deutscher shines more brightly when it comes to style. He has a knack for explaining the history of ideas (particularly when it comes to the history of color and perception) and dropping quirky anecdotes at the right moment (i.e. almost all the time). In short, this is an engaging read that offers a rather nuanced take on one of the thorniest linguistic questions. As such, definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."
191,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about language, mostly because the information provided is done so with great verve and charm by the author. His chatty style is most disarming — this is a man who knows how to educate his readers almost effortlessly: he will occasionally lead you astray deliberately, so that he can later point out what further research has revealed. And it is quite rewarding!This book limits itself to three specific aspects of language: the words used in languages for colour; the method used in various cultures and languages for orientation of oneself within the world; and an examination of the use of 'gender' in many languages (with English being one of the few that seems to particularly eschew this quality). The overall objective seems to be that from his studies Deutscher tends to believe that, as the title tells us, the world does look different in other languages. He tends to leave it at that: to argue as to how different that world is, and whether this indicates anything further with regard to science, philosophy, religion, culture, etc. are obviously left for others to ponder.I used quotes around the word 'gender' above because it was in this section (entitled ""Sex and Syntax"") that I was not completely convinced by his argument. He uses the example of a poem by Heine in which a pine tree in the North dreams of a palm tree 'far in the East', and points out that in the original German language a pine tree is a masculine word, while a palm tree is a feminine word — thus there is a 'sexual overtone' found in the original which a simple English translation would fail to communicate. He seems to argue that this lack of gender makes English less rich in its connotations. (It also explains why often enough learners of English from a country where words have a sexual distinction applied to them will often make 'mistakes' with personal pronouns, and will apply them 'incorrectly' to English words: in other words, they are still thinking of a word in the sex of their original language.) What bothers me about this is that my background is Italian, a language which has male and female words, but I can never remember thinking that they had an actual sexual connotation. For example, the word for a fork in Italian is feminine, but it does not mean that there are sexual connotations connected to a fork. Maybe I am being too precious about this, but it did make me wonder about whether Deutscher's 'smooth talking' might not mask other aspects which might not be 'quite right'…Be that as it may, the book is still quite a wonderful read for anyone interested in languages in general."
192,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10298127-anne,0,"I can't really review this book, because if I'd known anything about linguistics, I wouldn't have to read this in the first place. But I'll give it a try.Through the Language Glass is a popular science book for people interested in how language and perception of reality work. It is easy to read (but not too easy) and Guy Deutscher uses interesting examples to show how differences between languages can cause (ever so tiny) differences in perception. He is quite critical of people jumping to conclusions, so this book doesn't convince you of some radical idea that your reality is completely different from that of someone with a different mother tongue. Instead, it shows how things like colour perception, grammatical gender, and direction through left-right or east-west can have a tiny influence on your sense of the world, if only because when tested, people who are confronted with something that clashes with their language's 'settings' take a tiny bit more time than others.So the good part is that he doesn't try to shove crazy theories down your throat, but tries to remain critical. The bad part is that he seems either to take pleasure in discrediting scientists who were wrong about things or that he just exaggerates for dramatic effect. Either way, not so great. In general, his tone is definitely less neutral than I would like, also when he talks about ""primitive tribes"" etc. He seems not to have fixed on one term that is satisfactory, and although he defends the complexity of their language, I think he is quite careless and unspecific (and a bit tactless) in his terms to describe these societies, and maybe he could have looked up anthropologists' terms and used those. I know it's a fluffy popular science book but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a more objective, scientific tone.If you're looking for a book that will convince you that language changes your reality or that it absolutely does not, this is not it. Deutscher uses three topics (colour, grammatical gender, direction) of which colour takes up the most space in the book. It was a nice read but if at all possible, it would have been nice to have some extra categories, and not just these three."
193,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"As other reviewers remarked, the title of this book is slightly misleading. A large part of the book deals with colours. How they are perceived, how their naming follows a similar pattern in most languages and why this is important. There are mentions of Homer and his ""wine coloured sea"", a pretty dense historical background and references to modern studies. This part I found most interesting, but it has not much to do with the fact that the world looks different in other languages. Because, in fact it does not.Other chapters explain that languages have very little influence on thoughts and that grammar is the only constraint to the way we express ourselves. People understand basic concepts more or less in the same way, but they have different grammar rules to express them. More than language, what shapes their thoughts is their culture.There is also some debate about the fact that we change slightly, when we speak a foreign language. Much is said about languages that have masculine and feminine nouns and those that have not. Personally, I speak four languages quite fluently and I must confess I never noticed any major change of personality when I switch from Italian to English, to French or Portuguese. But maybe it is just me. The absence of ""gender"" in English nouns is actually much welcomed, since I must deal with random feminine and masculine in the other three languages I know.For those not familiar, I can assure you it is pretty annoying having to learn that ""la fleur"" is feminine in French and ""a viagem"" is feminine in Portuguese, while both are masculine in Italian (""il fiore"",""il viaggio""). The total lack of logic of assigning genders to nouns can be mind-blowing, but still does not interfere with the fact that when I see a flower I know it is a flower and not a cat – whether I think in Italian, French, English or Portuguese."
194,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"This book uses three 'case studies' (colour, gender and spacial awareness) to look at how language affects our view of the world, our thinking and our memory.The first third of the book looks in depth at the history of the study of how colour is described by various international and classical cultures and how the differences have been (miss)interpreted by an assortment of learned gentlemen over the years. This gives a very nice springboard to the reader to see the types of pitfalls that such studies can fall into and prepare the ground for the second part of the book.The second section of the book goes into more depth on the subject of 'how can we study whether linguistic differences really affect our minds and the way they work?'. The Australian (and other) tribes that do all their directions in North, South, East and West rather than ever using left, right, in front or behind, were new to me and absolutely fascinating. Deutscher writes in an easily accessible style adding plenty of actual data from studies without letting it overwhelm the greater story. I felt that the arguments for and against certain viewpoints were well rehearsed in a relatively light hearted non-judgemental way that left one feeling enlightened and amused. This book has re-enforced my view that the human minds and human cultures are totally fascinating in their infintie variety, and left me looking for more non fiction in a similar vein. I have a few other books lined up. I hope they are as good. "
195,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"I enjoyed this book. The title for me was a bit misleading, at least for the first part of the book, which was mostly about out color sense and how we perceive colors and the role that language plays in that perception. I was not expecting this and so it threw me off a bit but the author’s excellent writing style quickly had me feeling at ease.About the writing style, it is relaxed and playful. The author is a punster and the book is littered with witty puns throughout (even the appendix has a pun thrown in) but this doesn’t take away from the excellent scientific research that is conveyed. I especially liked the second part of the book and the fascinating story of the Guugu Yimithirr, a group of native peoples whose language reflects the geography of the world. Where I (and most other people I know) use our bodies as the starting point for explaining directions to other people, the Guugu Yimithirr use the cardinal points of a compass, so that if I see a bug on your left foot I would state that, whereas a Guugu Yimithirr person would say that you have a bug on your ""West"" foot (if he was facing South and you were facing him.) This was amazing to me, and the author describes other equally fascinating cultures that use geography to describe the world. I have a lousy sense of direction but not so these other peoples, and this kind of thinking is not as rare as you would imagine.All in all, I feel this is an excellent book and would like to read it again to catch the things I missed. Highly recommended. "
196,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745423-simon,4,"One small criticism first: this was in some ways less far-ranging and comprehensive than I'd imagined, focussing on just three aspects of language and the perception of reality - colour, gender and spatial relations. And the sections on colour account for almost half the book. This can be forgiven as these are the only areas in which any serious and conclusive research has been done.But once you get past that narrowing of the scope, this is a still an eye-opening and enormously readble book, full of fascinating details and vividly described characters. What makes it work best is Deutscher's skill as a storyteller, with early sections tracing the historical development of theories about ancient Greeks' colour perception at times read like a particularly engrossing thriller (no, really). Deutscher is also a skilled prose writer, and not above slipping in the occasional linguistic witticism, but only where appropriate and never coming across as clever for its own sake.Highly recommended."
197,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Book about the way language influences the way we think -- and vice-versa. While the famous Sapir-Whorf thesis has been debunked (and is a bit of an embarrassment for linguists), in the end it seems that language and our thinking *do* have have some influence upon each other.I enjoyed the discussion of Homer and the weird usage of colors, and the way some Australian tribes use an absolute (well, with earth as the frame of reference) coordinate system rather than 'left of me', 'in front of me' etc.Also interesting was the discussion of the Matsés people of the Amazon. Their language has a built-in concept of evidentiality -- every time they say anything about anything, their language requires them to express the amount of evidence for the statement -- 'seen with my own eyes' until 'mere hearsay' paper. A great idea -- maybe we should import that concept in our languages as well?"

The color chapters are by far the strongest (first and last). He gives a careful dissecting of Whorfianism and showing why he's not defending that (a good debate strategy, to be sure); however, other works argue that the evidence presented therein really does have cause and effect backwards (as far as language and thought). I would strongly recommend reading this in conjunction with Christine Kennealy's ""The First Word"" and Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought,"" and drawing your own conclusions, assuming of course you're a linguistics nerd and have a lot of time on your hands. This, you'll get through fairly quickly: Pinker especially, though, will take you some chewing."

205,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23180960-stephen-case,3,"It started with a conversation with a student, who said he had read an article explaining that the color blue never appeared in ancient Greek writings. That led to some internet searching, and I quickly found this book, which claims to be a treatment of this puzzle and turns out to be an explanation of the way language shapes the way we see the world. Do people who speak different languages actually see the world differently? Or in other words, how much does the structure of our language mirror or constrain the structure of our thought?Deutscher-- a linguist with an axe to grind against some of the contemporary views in the field-- starts the exploration of this question with its most interesting manifestation: color. The realization that there was something strange going on in ancient accounts of color goes back to the philhellene and sometimes Prime Minister William Gladstone who noticed that blue never appears in Homer's writings. The sea and sky are not referred to as blue, and other colors are also used in questionable ways. Other researchers into ancient texts discovered similar things: many ancient languages didn't have a word for blue. Indeed, there seemed to be a order of appearance in which ""primitive"" languages (and the author offers examples of some contemporary languages as well) distinguish between dark and light and lump all colors together as reddish. Eventually words for yellows and browns appear and finally terms that distinguish between greens and blues. The differentiation of blue usually comes last, and there are still signs of this, for instance, in the fact that in old Japanese the word for blue and green is the same.What does this mean? Early theories speculated that there was an actual physiological evolution taking place, that as humans became less primitive their eyes developed to perceive a wider spectrum of colors. Modern genetics and tests on speakers who languages currently lack certain color words has disproven this. Ancient Greek eyes were the same as ours. But did their lack of names for certain colors shape the way they perceived the world? This is the crux of the author's question: do we really see things if we don't have words to express them? I explored this once in a story published in Daily Science Fiction. Does naming something make it more real or at least more readily apparent?Part of the argument for color goes something like this. In primitive civilizations color doesn't matter a whole lot, and certain colors are rarely perceived on their own. Red is the color of blood, so a word to distinguish this comes fairly early in most cultures. But there are no large blue animals, few blue flowers, and blue dye was very difficult to make and unknown in many cultures. (Egypt was an exception, and apparently ancient Egyptian had a word for blue.) Because of this, there was no social or linguistic need to distinguish or name this hue. But what about the sea and the sky? The sea rarely looks straightforwardly blue, and the sky-- when completely clear-- was simply the sky. Since there was no cultural need to distinguish its color, it was simply the sky.The first half of the book is an investigation of the history of the color question, and if you're not quite satisfied with the answer I've given (and I'm not sure I am), you might not be satisfied with this portion of the book. For Deutscher though, color simply sets up the bigger question: how do we determine-- and then empirically test-- whether language actually shapes our perception and our thought processes? Are certain concepts (like ""The sky is blue"") simply inexpressible in some languages? Does this mean speakers of those languages are unable to conceive of certain statements and concepts? Deutscher's answer is no to these last two questions but a cautious yes to the first.An older, stronger claim would answer the final question of the above paragraph in the affirmative: language constrains thought. Because the Hopi Indians, for instance, have no verb tense in their language or expressions of time, they cannot perceive time as linear. Because other Native American languages do not distinguish between verb and subject, speakers of these languages have a more monistic, unified of nature. Deutscher disagrees and takes obvious pleasure in demolishing these claims, maintaining instead that any concept can be expressed in any language. His alternate claim is more subtle: it's not that some languages make it impossible to perceive or conceive certain things; rather, his claim is that certain languages obligate speakers to always be thinking of certain things.What does this mean? The author provides three examples. The first is that of a particular well-studied Australian aboriginal language that does not possess an egocentric coordinate system (i.e. behind, in front, left, right) but only an absolute system (north, east, south, west). Every positional expression voiced in this language, from things as simple as ""There's a bug beside your foot"" have to be given in terms of cardinal directions. (""There's a bug north of your foot."") This means that speakers of the language always have a sense of these directions from a very young age, and their experiences and memories are seen through that directional lens. The author discusses a variety of experiments in which it's shown that speakers of this language can recall details in this coordinate system, recounting orientations of experiences from years ago. (To put this in perspective, try calling up a particularly vivid memory and expressing it in terms of cardinal directions. Were you standing to the north or south of your spouse when you got married?) The language obligates its speakers to always have cardinal directions in mind and thus shapes their perceptions of the world accordingly.Languages with no egocentric coordinate system though are comparatively rare, so the author's second example is closer to home: languages like German or Spanish or many more with a developed gender system. In English-- at least since the century or so after the Norman Conquest, as the author points out in a fascinating historical treatment-- does not oblige its speakers to assign genders to inanimate objects. Yet many other modern languages do. Not much study has yet been done, according to Deutscher, on how this influences the thoughts of speakers of these languages, but he illustrates some of the implications with an example of the role this plays in translation and the subtle nuances and relations that can be lost moving from a gendered to a largely non-gendered language.Finally, he returns to color. Does our language's names for colors-- and the fact that these names don't exist in certain other languages-- influence the way we perceive the world? Recent studies, the author argues, indicate that yes, it does. He takes the case of light blue and dark blue, which in Russian have separate names. An English speaker would perceive these as shades of the same color. For a Russian speaker they would be separate colors. If this was indeed the case, one could expect that this linguistic obligation (that of the Russian speaker to give these separate hues different names) would allow Russians to more quickly distinguish between similar shades of blue if they lay on opposite sides of this distinction, in a similar manner to how an English speaker could more readily distinguish between greenish-blue and bluish-green than a speaker of a language that does not differentiate between green and blue. The author relates in detail the set-up of experiments to determine just that, which show the language-processing region of the brain active even when actively naming the hues was not part of the experiment. Russian speakers consistently differentiated between close shades of blue more quickly than English speakers.What does all this mean? It comes back to the central claim of the book, that languages, by obligating their speakers to pay attention to certain things in their structure, can function as a lens by which their speakers perceive the world.Consider this analogy (not given in the book): if your language has several different expressions for snow, so that each time you talk about snow you're obligated to take into consideration things like whether it's falling or on the ground, how long it's been on the ground, what its thickness and consistency is, then when you look at snow (or call up a memory containing snow) you're going to have a richer perception of the object than an English speaker who encapsulates all the varieties of snow under a single word. That doesn't mean that an English speaker can't conceptualize or express these nuances of snow. It just means her language doesn't habituate her to these perceptions.In these (possibly over-simplified) terms, Deutscher's argument seems almost self-evident, but the richness of his treatment comes in the historical and linguistic background he provides while exploring this idea and especially in his explanations of the rigor and structure of the experiments devised to verify such apparently straightforward claims about language and how it shapes our perceptions of the world."
206,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3514657-aya-zain,4,"The blurb of this book excited me so much. I've always wondered whether language has an influence on our intentions, our implications, and our culture. But Guy Deutscher made me think of the reverse scenario: that culture has had an impact on language, and that language is enforced every day thus leaving us no choice but to express ourselves in a somewhat outdated mode. Let me illustrate that further.I'm not sure what my mother tongue is. I'm of Arab descent, so it should be Arabic, however I was born and raised overseas where I focused on learning English instead. I became advanced in English and chose English as both a major and a minor for university, whereas my Arabic is intermediate to say the least. I can speak Arabic, but I always mess up the verb tenses -- feminine or masculine? So 'That table has a book on it' would turn into That (masculine) table (feminine) has a book on (feminine) it -- which is all incorrect, by the way! My Arabic just wasn't very good, and so I always confused the propositions and other articles.Arabic - like a few other languages - doesn't have gender neutrality, so that our every day language must determine what is masculine and what is feminine. And you can probably imagine that the more delicate inanimate objects usually took on the feminine form.Anyway - it goes further than that. And I once mentioned it to a high school classmate of mine in the 11th grade. I asked him: how come the verb conjugation of the plural masculine form gets a special (new and improved) conjugation, however the plural feminine verb conjugation is subjected to the same conjugation as the 'they' conjugation?He retaliated almost defensively, telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and that Arabic is the language of religion (Islam) and that I shouldn't challenge it because it is a flawless language. Which is exactly what is wrong with language -- he chose to take my argument personally as if it's offensive to his very nature. And that is exactly the problem.You can imagine how an every day reminder of what is feminine and what is masculine, or what is female and what is male has an impact on the way we perceive things. Take this for example: mowazafa (female office worker) and mowazaf (male office worker).Those involved in that sort of dialogue will have constant reminders to make gender distinctions, whether they like it or not. Their impressions are already preconceived when determining the nature of that thing they are referring to - be it female or male.I picked up on that because that's how I studied my subjects. I would put the information into images in my head and create a story, so it was easy to fall into the presumption that the feminine conjugation fell into the same category as the it conjugation due to sexist precursors.Arabic is not a flawless language. Arabic has stopped developing at one point in time, and refuses to change its methods to fit the modern-day society, and so people on some scale will be stuck expressing themselves in a language that doesn't fit a progressive society or lifestyle.If we try to think of ways to develop language so as to expand our neurological functions, we'll find that our cognitive abilities will also improve, thus making us smarter and more knowledgeable.I really like the examples that Deutscher drew out in his book, such as Guugu Yimithirr -- an Aboriginal Australian language that existed in Far North Queensland. They had the tendency to use the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) rather than egocentric coordinations (right, left, back and front). How does that make them see the world differently? They will never get lost. Even looking at Google Maps confuses me sometimes - am I supposed to turn a right or a left? However if my mind was brought up in the Gugu Ymithir community, I wouldn't have been so troubled as to figure out which direction to go. But then again, that could be just my terrible sense of direction.Another example was about the color blue. A mysterious color, in my opinion. It's barely seen in nature, yet it's everywhere. It's in the sky, it's in the sea that reflects the sky. However Deutscher mentions that when you take a look at Ancient literature, you'll find that the color blue is never mentioned. The sea is described as the color of wine, and the sky is not seen as blue. In daylight, it's white, and at night it's black. The word blue just wasn't necessary back then. However, now blue is everywhere, and the sky is just about as blue as the sea. We have so much blue that the Russians have not one, but two names for the color blue. They have two color distinctions that the average English speaker would call blue, but they call Siniy and Goluboy.  When taken in for experiments, it was found that the Russian speakers were able to distinguish between all colors faster than the English speakers did. This ability to perceive colors in a different way, while seeing the same colors, shows that language could really transform our potentials and increase our capabilities.Language is a dangerous weapon if not handled correctly. There has been no example of this though, so don't take my word on it. But I think that we can utilize language if we work on it meticulously to shape the society and the future that we want.Thanks Deutscher for such an informative book! There are so many great references in this book, and I was left with a lot more information on language than I had before."
207,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63279672-courtney-mosier-warren,3,"In general this was a very good book. I found many of the arguments to be interesting and worth exploring. That being said, at times this books felt a bit condescending. The tone that Mr. Deutscher uses comes across poorly, although I think it is unintentional. The condescending tone does not take away from the merit of the book, but it often left me feeling distracted by it."
208,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116092820-meg-briers,4,"A good read exploring how our mother tongue may be affecting our perceptions of colour, gender and space/coordinate system. A nice crossover between the fields of linguistics and psychology that really made you think about language and how it's having an influence on your day to day life. Very informative and gave a lot of new information without making the language too inaccessible as many other similar books seem to do, quite a nice gentle read!"
209,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"Guy Deutscher's Through the Language Glass, which looks at the relationship between language, culture and perception, wasn't quite what I'd expected. Honestly, I'd expected a variation of that old chestnut on the Eskimos having a gazillion words for the concept of ""snow"", to explain how our environment and culture shapes the language we speak. Deutscher's book surpassed those expectations. There are a few painful moments in the book, when Deutscher attempts to make some witty puns (this is a book on language after all). Wannabe gems like ""In their pronouncements on language, culture and thought, it seems that big thinkers in their grandes oeuvres have not always risen much above little thinkers over their hors d'oeuvres."" Or how about ""All the facts mentioned so far about the cones in the retina are correct to the best of my knowledge. But if you are under the impression that they actually explain our sensation of colour, then you have been coned!"" Do I detect some eye rolling here? But things look up once Deutscher gets serious. Dismissing many of the common fallacies or accepted wisdoms in linguistics - like how all languages are equally complex (how does one measure complexity? how do you trade off complexity in morphology against complexity in syntax, grammar rules, etc?) - Deutscher makes a tight and convincing case for what we can conclude about language. We can summarise the main thrusts of this case with the following 3 points:1. While nature may set the boundaries of how we perceive and relate to the world (it doesn't make sense to use the same word to describe red dogs and red roses for instance), culture significantly influences how we navigate within those boundaries. A more refined colour vocabulary, or one that emphasises hue over brightness, will lead to differences in how colours are named and classified. 2. Languages vary considerable in the amount of information they convey within words - e.g. tense, person performing the action, singularity/plurality, distance, etc. There is an inverse correlation between the complexity of society and word structure as communication among intimates often allows more compact, terse ways of expressing oneself. Conversely, the greater the number of speakers, more explicit markers for providing context (e.g. prepositions, subordinate clauses) are required and simplification through bastardisation of the language also occurs. 3. Language influences us not so much in what we are allowed to think but in the ""kinds of information each language habitually obliges [us] to think about"", from the way we see spatial relationships, to the attributes that we associate objects with (depending on whether one's language assigns a gender to that object). ""When a language forces its speakers to pay attention to certain aspects of the world each time they open their mouths or prick up their ears, such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills"". There are many things in Deutscher's book that are thought provoking. But perhaps the point that struck me the most was just how much gets lost in translation, when the associations we make with certain words just disappear when transplanted into another linguistic framework. As Deutscher notes: ""But if you native speakers of English are tempted to feel sorry for those of us who are shackled by the heavy load of an irrational gender system, then think again. I would never want to change places with you...my world has so much to it that you entirely miss out on, because the landscape of my language is so much more fertile than your arid desert of 'it's'. It goes without saying that genders are language's gift to poets. Heine's masculine pine tree longs for the feminine palm; Boris Pasternak's My Sister Life can only work because 'life' is feminine in Russian; English translations of Charles Beaudelaire's 'L'homme et la mer', however inspired, can never hope to capture the tempestuous relationship of attraction and antagonism that he evokes between 'him' (the man) and 'her' (the sea); nor can English do justice to Pablo Neruda's 'Ode to the Sea', in which the (masculine) el mar strikes a stone (una piedra) and then 'he caresses her, kisses her, drenches her, pounds his chest, repeating his own name' - the English 'it caresses it, kisses it, drenches it, pounds its chest' is not quite the same."""
210,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,3," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com I bought this book on February 1st at a bookstore in Aachen, Germany, during what they called 'Bye Bye-Brexit rabat' (Bye Bye Brexit Sale) which was 20% discount on all English books. Obviously, I couldn't resist. I went on to convince the book club I recently joined to read it as our next read, but unfortunately because of the entire Covid19 situation, we haven't had the possibility to discuss the book. I now feel a little bit sorry for them, as the book was not really what I hoped it would be. The subject fascinates me. When I was a small child, growing up speaking Dutch, for a time I believed (I am embarrassed to admit) that everyone always thought in Dutch, but that two French people for example, would then decide to speak French to each other. I quickly learned this was not the case, but it kept me interested in how someones language might influence how people think. Which is why I wanted to read Through the Language Glass.The author himself is very much interested in colors. And a large part of the book is in fact about the evolution of the naming of colors in languages. While interesting, I thought it was rather a bit too extensive. The remainder of the book was filled with some interesting facts, which might come to use at a pub quiz but the argument for the influence between language and thought was never very strong. Most interestingly I found the argument that some languages are forcing people to convey information in a certain sentence that other do not. For example, if your languages has changing verbs announcing how certain you are something happened, you have to think about it before making that sentence. If you have different verbs for something that happened one day or a week ago, again you have to think about. Same for languages who unlike English have gendered words. Ultimately, the effect that was measured was rather small, I'd argue. While difficult to measure objectively, is thinking colors are further apart from each other when they cross an arbitrary color-name boundary something that is important enough to consider this a significant effect of language on thought? I am not convinced. "
211,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"My interest in  Through the Language Glass came from a conversation with a friend about how the color blue was relatively recent 'invention.' This was not that the color blue didn't exist in antiquity, but rather that it didn't go by that name. How then, did the ancients view blue? How did they view colors? Like most things, there's a book for that. Through the Language Glass not only delves into the complicated world of how language and culture affects how we organize colors, and perhaps even how we see them, but also how the science of how we perceive color and name it developed over time. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is also delved into, as are the multitude of problems with it and where they just may have gotten things right. This book is dense with information, riveting in what new discoveries and alternative hypotheses it discusses, and rife with good humor. While this book was a dry read at times, it was one I could not put down for the sheer interesting nature of all it discusses. It's a shame that so much of these topics have yet to be thoroughly discussed, but this book seems to be bringing glad tidings of a shift in focus that is more welcoming towards how culture affects language and perception."
212,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2974294-jessica,1,"DNF a little more than 100 pages into it because the author's casual use of the words ""primitive"" and ""savage"" to describe indigenous peoples and peoples from pre-literate societies was extremely distasteful. And by that, I mean racist. And his discussion of creole/pidgin languages was similarly limited. Jade goes into more detail in her review than I care to.I'm going to save myself the energy and frustration, and just move on to  The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language instead."

Well, disappointed in what I read ... the book focused almost exclusively on color, and how the way we describe or see color is related to language. The author is color-blind, I believe, which I suppose explains this. However, I was expecting a book about how we *feel* different when we switch from one language to another, and that's not what this was. On the other hand, I am also somewhat relieved that the book isn't what I thought, since that's the book that I've been wanting to write. Guess I can still do that, since Guy Deutscher didn't ....."

219,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages"".There is a cluster of myths about language, referred to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that looms large over this book. If you have ever heard that the Eskimo had 50 (or 500) words for snow, and that what language you speak determines how you think, you have heard echoes of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The author of this book is one of the first to tiptoe back into the blast crater that was left when the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was exploded a century ago.In its more extreme form, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (named for a couple early scholars in the study of languages) asserts that because different languages have different words for things, and some concepts which have a name in one language do not have a name in others (e.g. schadenfreude), the language(s) you speak can determine what concepts you are able to think. For example, Eskimos can (allegedly) notice all the many shades of difference between one type of snow and another (hard packed, fused to ice, tiny and 'dry' like powder, big wet flakes, etc.), because they have words for them, and we cannot.Leaving aside whether or not the Inuit languages have many more words for snow than others (the answer appears to be complicated, but essentially 'not really'), there is another flaw with this, and 'schadenfreude' is a good illustration of it. First off, even though English had no word for 'taking joy in the misfortunes of others', we had no problem stealing it from German, and this is not only something that English does. Second, do we really believe that an english speaker in the years prior to this did not understand that sometimes a person would take joy in the downfall of another? You don't need a word or phrase for 'esprit de corps' to understand that morale is important, and if you have common enough occasion to refer to it, you can invent a word in any language.Moreover, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was one of several justifications given for policies like taking Australian Aborigines or Native Americans children from their homes and making them speak English, so it acquired a bit of a moral taint. Believing that the language you speak influences what you think became not just a scientific question, but a bit of a moral one as well, and any answer other than 'of course not' was morally suspect.Deutscher (a native speaker of Hebrew, by the way) is ready to risk such an accusation, but he first has to spend a chapter or two explaining what Sapir-Whorf was, why it wasn't true, and otherwise reassuring us that he doesn't think all children should be forced to speak one language on the grounds that it is culturally more refined. Having done that, he begins the exploration of this minefield by talking about the relatively objectively measurable topic of color.My favorite factoid from this book: there are languages in the world (several, it turns out) which have only two words for color (which correspond more or less to 'black' and 'white'). In these languages, the sky is black (except when it's covered with clouds, in which case it's white), and the leaves of plants are white. Stunned anthropologists spent a couple generations in remote villages or travelling with hunter/gatherers, and asking them to compare and label colored tiles or swatches of cloth, and determined that the people who spoke these languages were not colorblind, they just honestly didn't see the need for more words for color than this.The reason seems to be that there just isn't much need for words for color, until you have dyes, paints, markers, and other ways of routinely making a given thing one color or another. If all plants are green, why do you need to say the 'green plant'? You can just say 'plant'. If a fruit can only either be green (when it's not ripe) or red (when it's ripe), you can just say 'ripe' (or 'not ripe'), and there's no great need for a word for the color. It's rather like how we don't have words for smell, really, we mostly just say 'smells like coffee' or 'smells like flowers', or some other simile. We don't add fragrances to things (routinely), they mostly just smell how they smell, so we don't need to say 'hand me the coffee-smelling hammer, not the flowery-smelling one'. We just say 'hand me the hammer', and what smell it has is irrelevant.There are also languages which have three words for color: black, white, and red. There are several of these, not all related. What's interesting is that there aren't any with words for black, white, and blue, or black, white, and green. If there is a third and final color name, and you ask speakers to point to the tile which best epitomizes that color, they will point to the red one.Languages with four colors will have black, white, red, and either yellow or green, and languages with a fifth word for color will have both yellow and green. Blue is apparently not all that important to humans, and only languages with at least six words for color will be able to say that the sky is blue. Before that, apparently, you just note that the sky is clear, and get on with life without bothering about what color that is. One wonders what small children can pester their parents about if they can't ask why the sky is blue (I bet they manage).Having demonstrated that languages can really be different, Deutscher moves on to his main thesis: languages do really change how we think, at least a little, but not based on what they have words for. Rather, languages affect our thinking not in what they allow, but in what they require. There are languages where you do not refer to something being on your left or right; it must always be referred to as being on your north, south, or whatever. This REQUIRES the speaker to always be aware of which way is north, and to reflect this in their speech many times a day. When telling a story of something that happened to them, they must think about what direction they were facing when they told it. One might suspect that such people have a sense of direction much more developed than ours, and experiments prove that you are right. Wake such a person up from a deep sleeop in the middle of the night, and ask them what direction they were facing when they met their spouse for the first time decades before, and they will be able to tell you (although they may slap you upside the head first).There are many languages where nearly every noun is either masculine or feminine, and many others where a goodly percentage of inanimate objects are, and you have to reflect this in your word endings or choice of articles (e.g. which form of 'the' you use when speaking about 'the pine tree'). Ask speakers of German (where the word for 'bridge' is feminine) and Spanish (where it is masculine) to describe bridges, and the former will say that they are beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender, while the latter will say that they are big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and towering.Deutscher has several other such examples, with ample citations of published studies to back him up, and enough studies of Victorian scholars cavorting with savages to entertain a reader like me who is amused by the image of a bemused hunter regarding a box of colored tiles that the crazy white man wants to ask him questions about. The field he is involved in is still very immature, by his own admission. He compares it to trying to study the behavior of a corporation by camping outside the headquarters and monitoring which rooms are lit up for how many hours a day. But, if he and others succeed in at least legitimizing the question of how language influences the way we think, then it is possible that in a generation or two we may be in a position to say a lot more about it (in any language we care to use)."
220,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52711508-max-lauber,4,"This book offers a history of the often (and rightly) maligned Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and details how the notion that language shapes people's perception of the world became an *idea non grata*. Deutscher takes the reader from William Gladstone's 19th century analysis of Homer to state-of-the-art neurolinguistics research in order to not only show how language affects perception, but also to show that the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is mostly just a high-flying fantasy. To summarize it in a sentence, Deutscher argues that culture, i.e. language, has a stronger effect on our thinking than we are comfortable to admit, but that the impact of language on thought is very different from what it was believed to be in the past.Specifically, he argues that there is no evidence that our mother tongue constrains our cognitive capacity or that it imposes limits on what we can understand. In other words, he says the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is bunk. Instead, he argues that ""the real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us - all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself"". He summarizes this idea in what he calls the Boas-Jakobson principle: Languages differ essentially in what they must convey, not in what they may convey.By surveying not only current research, but also methodologies and findings from the past 200 years, Deutscher makes a very plausible claim for the Boas-Jakobson principle and for his rejection of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and the linguistic dogma that language does not fundamentally affect the way we think. Although there is no dearth of substance in this book, Deutscher shines more brightly when it comes to style. He has a knack for explaining the history of ideas (particularly when it comes to the history of color and perception) and dropping quirky anecdotes at the right moment (i.e. almost all the time). In short, this is an engaging read that offers a rather nuanced take on one of the thorniest linguistic questions. As such, definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."
221,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about language, mostly because the information provided is done so with great verve and charm by the author. His chatty style is most disarming — this is a man who knows how to educate his readers almost effortlessly: he will occasionally lead you astray deliberately, so that he can later point out what further research has revealed. And it is quite rewarding!This book limits itself to three specific aspects of language: the words used in languages for colour; the method used in various cultures and languages for orientation of oneself within the world; and an examination of the use of 'gender' in many languages (with English being one of the few that seems to particularly eschew this quality). The overall objective seems to be that from his studies Deutscher tends to believe that, as the title tells us, the world does look different in other languages. He tends to leave it at that: to argue as to how different that world is, and whether this indicates anything further with regard to science, philosophy, religion, culture, etc. are obviously left for others to ponder.I used quotes around the word 'gender' above because it was in this section (entitled ""Sex and Syntax"") that I was not completely convinced by his argument. He uses the example of a poem by Heine in which a pine tree in the North dreams of a palm tree 'far in the East', and points out that in the original German language a pine tree is a masculine word, while a palm tree is a feminine word — thus there is a 'sexual overtone' found in the original which a simple English translation would fail to communicate. He seems to argue that this lack of gender makes English less rich in its connotations. (It also explains why often enough learners of English from a country where words have a sexual distinction applied to them will often make 'mistakes' with personal pronouns, and will apply them 'incorrectly' to English words: in other words, they are still thinking of a word in the sex of their original language.) What bothers me about this is that my background is Italian, a language which has male and female words, but I can never remember thinking that they had an actual sexual connotation. For example, the word for a fork in Italian is feminine, but it does not mean that there are sexual connotations connected to a fork. Maybe I am being too precious about this, but it did make me wonder about whether Deutscher's 'smooth talking' might not mask other aspects which might not be 'quite right'…Be that as it may, the book is still quite a wonderful read for anyone interested in languages in general."
222,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10298127-anne,0,"I can't really review this book, because if I'd known anything about linguistics, I wouldn't have to read this in the first place. But I'll give it a try.Through the Language Glass is a popular science book for people interested in how language and perception of reality work. It is easy to read (but not too easy) and Guy Deutscher uses interesting examples to show how differences between languages can cause (ever so tiny) differences in perception. He is quite critical of people jumping to conclusions, so this book doesn't convince you of some radical idea that your reality is completely different from that of someone with a different mother tongue. Instead, it shows how things like colour perception, grammatical gender, and direction through left-right or east-west can have a tiny influence on your sense of the world, if only because when tested, people who are confronted with something that clashes with their language's 'settings' take a tiny bit more time than others.So the good part is that he doesn't try to shove crazy theories down your throat, but tries to remain critical. The bad part is that he seems either to take pleasure in discrediting scientists who were wrong about things or that he just exaggerates for dramatic effect. Either way, not so great. In general, his tone is definitely less neutral than I would like, also when he talks about ""primitive tribes"" etc. He seems not to have fixed on one term that is satisfactory, and although he defends the complexity of their language, I think he is quite careless and unspecific (and a bit tactless) in his terms to describe these societies, and maybe he could have looked up anthropologists' terms and used those. I know it's a fluffy popular science book but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a more objective, scientific tone.If you're looking for a book that will convince you that language changes your reality or that it absolutely does not, this is not it. Deutscher uses three topics (colour, grammatical gender, direction) of which colour takes up the most space in the book. It was a nice read but if at all possible, it would have been nice to have some extra categories, and not just these three."
223,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"As other reviewers remarked, the title of this book is slightly misleading. A large part of the book deals with colours. How they are perceived, how their naming follows a similar pattern in most languages and why this is important. There are mentions of Homer and his ""wine coloured sea"", a pretty dense historical background and references to modern studies. This part I found most interesting, but it has not much to do with the fact that the world looks different in other languages. Because, in fact it does not.Other chapters explain that languages have very little influence on thoughts and that grammar is the only constraint to the way we express ourselves. People understand basic concepts more or less in the same way, but they have different grammar rules to express them. More than language, what shapes their thoughts is their culture.There is also some debate about the fact that we change slightly, when we speak a foreign language. Much is said about languages that have masculine and feminine nouns and those that have not. Personally, I speak four languages quite fluently and I must confess I never noticed any major change of personality when I switch from Italian to English, to French or Portuguese. But maybe it is just me. The absence of ""gender"" in English nouns is actually much welcomed, since I must deal with random feminine and masculine in the other three languages I know.For those not familiar, I can assure you it is pretty annoying having to learn that ""la fleur"" is feminine in French and ""a viagem"" is feminine in Portuguese, while both are masculine in Italian (""il fiore"",""il viaggio""). The total lack of logic of assigning genders to nouns can be mind-blowing, but still does not interfere with the fact that when I see a flower I know it is a flower and not a cat – whether I think in Italian, French, English or Portuguese."
224,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"This book uses three 'case studies' (colour, gender and spacial awareness) to look at how language affects our view of the world, our thinking and our memory.The first third of the book looks in depth at the history of the study of how colour is described by various international and classical cultures and how the differences have been (miss)interpreted by an assortment of learned gentlemen over the years. This gives a very nice springboard to the reader to see the types of pitfalls that such studies can fall into and prepare the ground for the second part of the book.The second section of the book goes into more depth on the subject of 'how can we study whether linguistic differences really affect our minds and the way they work?'. The Australian (and other) tribes that do all their directions in North, South, East and West rather than ever using left, right, in front or behind, were new to me and absolutely fascinating. Deutscher writes in an easily accessible style adding plenty of actual data from studies without letting it overwhelm the greater story. I felt that the arguments for and against certain viewpoints were well rehearsed in a relatively light hearted non-judgemental way that left one feeling enlightened and amused. This book has re-enforced my view that the human minds and human cultures are totally fascinating in their infintie variety, and left me looking for more non fiction in a similar vein. I have a few other books lined up. I hope they are as good. "
225,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"I enjoyed this book. The title for me was a bit misleading, at least for the first part of the book, which was mostly about out color sense and how we perceive colors and the role that language plays in that perception. I was not expecting this and so it threw me off a bit but the author’s excellent writing style quickly had me feeling at ease.About the writing style, it is relaxed and playful. The author is a punster and the book is littered with witty puns throughout (even the appendix has a pun thrown in) but this doesn’t take away from the excellent scientific research that is conveyed. I especially liked the second part of the book and the fascinating story of the Guugu Yimithirr, a group of native peoples whose language reflects the geography of the world. Where I (and most other people I know) use our bodies as the starting point for explaining directions to other people, the Guugu Yimithirr use the cardinal points of a compass, so that if I see a bug on your left foot I would state that, whereas a Guugu Yimithirr person would say that you have a bug on your ""West"" foot (if he was facing South and you were facing him.) This was amazing to me, and the author describes other equally fascinating cultures that use geography to describe the world. I have a lousy sense of direction but not so these other peoples, and this kind of thinking is not as rare as you would imagine.All in all, I feel this is an excellent book and would like to read it again to catch the things I missed. Highly recommended. "
226,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745423-simon,4,"One small criticism first: this was in some ways less far-ranging and comprehensive than I'd imagined, focussing on just three aspects of language and the perception of reality - colour, gender and spatial relations. And the sections on colour account for almost half the book. This can be forgiven as these are the only areas in which any serious and conclusive research has been done.But once you get past that narrowing of the scope, this is a still an eye-opening and enormously readble book, full of fascinating details and vividly described characters. What makes it work best is Deutscher's skill as a storyteller, with early sections tracing the historical development of theories about ancient Greeks' colour perception at times read like a particularly engrossing thriller (no, really). Deutscher is also a skilled prose writer, and not above slipping in the occasional linguistic witticism, but only where appropriate and never coming across as clever for its own sake.Highly recommended."
227,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Book about the way language influences the way we think -- and vice-versa. While the famous Sapir-Whorf thesis has been debunked (and is a bit of an embarrassment for linguists), in the end it seems that language and our thinking *do* have have some influence upon each other.I enjoyed the discussion of Homer and the weird usage of colors, and the way some Australian tribes use an absolute (well, with earth as the frame of reference) coordinate system rather than 'left of me', 'in front of me' etc.Also interesting was the discussion of the Matsés people of the Amazon. Their language has a built-in concept of evidentiality -- every time they say anything about anything, their language requires them to express the amount of evidence for the statement -- 'seen with my own eyes' until 'mere hearsay' paper. A great idea -- maybe we should import that concept in our languages as well?"

He gives a careful dissecting of Whorfianism and showing why he's not defending that (a good debate strategy, to be sure); however, other works argue that the evidence presented therein really does have cause and effect backwards (as far as language and thought). I would strongly recommend reading this in conjunction with Christine Kennealy's ""The First Word"" and Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought,"" and drawing your own conclusions, assuming of course you're a linguistics nerd and have a lot of time on your hands. This, you'll get through fairly quickly: Pinker especially, though, will take you some chewing."

235,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23180960-stephen-case,3,"It started with a conversation with a student, who said he had read an article explaining that the color blue never appeared in ancient Greek writings. That led to some internet searching, and I quickly found this book, which claims to be a treatment of this puzzle and turns out to be an explanation of the way language shapes the way we see the world. Do people who speak different languages actually see the world differently? Or in other words, how much does the structure of our language mirror or constrain the structure of our thought?Deutscher-- a linguist with an axe to grind against some of the contemporary views in the field-- starts the exploration of this question with its most interesting manifestation: color. The realization that there was something strange going on in ancient accounts of color goes back to the philhellene and sometimes Prime Minister William Gladstone who noticed that blue never appears in Homer's writings. The sea and sky are not referred to as blue, and other colors are also used in questionable ways. Other researchers into ancient texts discovered similar things: many ancient languages didn't have a word for blue. Indeed, there seemed to be a order of appearance in which ""primitive"" languages (and the author offers examples of some contemporary languages as well) distinguish between dark and light and lump all colors together as reddish. Eventually words for yellows and browns appear and finally terms that distinguish between greens and blues. The differentiation of blue usually comes last, and there are still signs of this, for instance, in the fact that in old Japanese the word for blue and green is the same.What does this mean? Early theories speculated that there was an actual physiological evolution taking place, that as humans became less primitive their eyes developed to perceive a wider spectrum of colors. Modern genetics and tests on speakers who languages currently lack certain color words has disproven this. Ancient Greek eyes were the same as ours. But did their lack of names for certain colors shape the way they perceived the world? This is the crux of the author's question: do we really see things if we don't have words to express them? I explored this once in a story published in Daily Science Fiction. Does naming something make it more real or at least more readily apparent?Part of the argument for color goes something like this. In primitive civilizations color doesn't matter a whole lot, and certain colors are rarely perceived on their own. Red is the color of blood, so a word to distinguish this comes fairly early in most cultures. But there are no large blue animals, few blue flowers, and blue dye was very difficult to make and unknown in many cultures. (Egypt was an exception, and apparently ancient Egyptian had a word for blue.) Because of this, there was no social or linguistic need to distinguish or name this hue. But what about the sea and the sky? The sea rarely looks straightforwardly blue, and the sky-- when completely clear-- was simply the sky. Since there was no cultural need to distinguish its color, it was simply the sky.The first half of the book is an investigation of the history of the color question, and if you're not quite satisfied with the answer I've given (and I'm not sure I am), you might not be satisfied with this portion of the book. For Deutscher though, color simply sets up the bigger question: how do we determine-- and then empirically test-- whether language actually shapes our perception and our thought processes? Are certain concepts (like ""The sky is blue"") simply inexpressible in some languages? Does this mean speakers of those languages are unable to conceive of certain statements and concepts? Deutscher's answer is no to these last two questions but a cautious yes to the first.An older, stronger claim would answer the final question of the above paragraph in the affirmative: language constrains thought. Because the Hopi Indians, for instance, have no verb tense in their language or expressions of time, they cannot perceive time as linear. Because other Native American languages do not distinguish between verb and subject, speakers of these languages have a more monistic, unified of nature. Deutscher disagrees and takes obvious pleasure in demolishing these claims, maintaining instead that any concept can be expressed in any language. His alternate claim is more subtle: it's not that some languages make it impossible to perceive or conceive certain things; rather, his claim is that certain languages obligate speakers to always be thinking of certain things.What does this mean? The author provides three examples. The first is that of a particular well-studied Australian aboriginal language that does not possess an egocentric coordinate system (i.e. behind, in front, left, right) but only an absolute system (north, east, south, west). Every positional expression voiced in this language, from things as simple as ""There's a bug beside your foot"" have to be given in terms of cardinal directions. (""There's a bug north of your foot."") This means that speakers of the language always have a sense of these directions from a very young age, and their experiences and memories are seen through that directional lens. The author discusses a variety of experiments in which it's shown that speakers of this language can recall details in this coordinate system, recounting orientations of experiences from years ago. (To put this in perspective, try calling up a particularly vivid memory and expressing it in terms of cardinal directions. Were you standing to the north or south of your spouse when you got married?) The language obligates its speakers to always have cardinal directions in mind and thus shapes their perceptions of the world accordingly.Languages with no egocentric coordinate system though are comparatively rare, so the author's second example is closer to home: languages like German or Spanish or many more with a developed gender system. In English-- at least since the century or so after the Norman Conquest, as the author points out in a fascinating historical treatment-- does not oblige its speakers to assign genders to inanimate objects. Yet many other modern languages do. Not much study has yet been done, according to Deutscher, on how this influences the thoughts of speakers of these languages, but he illustrates some of the implications with an example of the role this plays in translation and the subtle nuances and relations that can be lost moving from a gendered to a largely non-gendered language.Finally, he returns to color. Does our language's names for colors-- and the fact that these names don't exist in certain other languages-- influence the way we perceive the world? Recent studies, the author argues, indicate that yes, it does. He takes the case of light blue and dark blue, which in Russian have separate names. An English speaker would perceive these as shades of the same color. For a Russian speaker they would be separate colors. If this was indeed the case, one could expect that this linguistic obligation (that of the Russian speaker to give these separate hues different names) would allow Russians to more quickly distinguish between similar shades of blue if they lay on opposite sides of this distinction, in a similar manner to how an English speaker could more readily distinguish between greenish-blue and bluish-green than a speaker of a language that does not differentiate between green and blue. The author relates in detail the set-up of experiments to determine just that, which show the language-processing region of the brain active even when actively naming the hues was not part of the experiment. Russian speakers consistently differentiated between close shades of blue more quickly than English speakers.What does all this mean? It comes back to the central claim of the book, that languages, by obligating their speakers to pay attention to certain things in their structure, can function as a lens by which their speakers perceive the world.Consider this analogy (not given in the book): if your language has several different expressions for snow, so that each time you talk about snow you're obligated to take into consideration things like whether it's falling or on the ground, how long it's been on the ground, what its thickness and consistency is, then when you look at snow (or call up a memory containing snow) you're going to have a richer perception of the object than an English speaker who encapsulates all the varieties of snow under a single word. That doesn't mean that an English speaker can't conceptualize or express these nuances of snow. It just means her language doesn't habituate her to these perceptions.In these (possibly over-simplified) terms, Deutscher's argument seems almost self-evident, but the richness of his treatment comes in the historical and linguistic background he provides while exploring this idea and especially in his explanations of the rigor and structure of the experiments devised to verify such apparently straightforward claims about language and how it shapes our perceptions of the world."
236,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3514657-aya-zain,4,"The blurb of this book excited me so much. I've always wondered whether language has an influence on our intentions, our implications, and our culture. But Guy Deutscher made me think of the reverse scenario: that culture has had an impact on language, and that language is enforced every day thus leaving us no choice but to express ourselves in a somewhat outdated mode. Let me illustrate that further.I'm not sure what my mother tongue is. I'm of Arab descent, so it should be Arabic, however I was born and raised overseas where I focused on learning English instead. I became advanced in English and chose English as both a major and a minor for university, whereas my Arabic is intermediate to say the least. I can speak Arabic, but I always mess up the verb tenses -- feminine or masculine? So 'That table has a book on it' would turn into That (masculine) table (feminine) has a book on (feminine) it -- which is all incorrect, by the way! My Arabic just wasn't very good, and so I always confused the propositions and other articles.Arabic - like a few other languages - doesn't have gender neutrality, so that our every day language must determine what is masculine and what is feminine. And you can probably imagine that the more delicate inanimate objects usually took on the feminine form.Anyway - it goes further than that. And I once mentioned it to a high school classmate of mine in the 11th grade. I asked him: how come the verb conjugation of the plural masculine form gets a special (new and improved) conjugation, however the plural feminine verb conjugation is subjected to the same conjugation as the 'they' conjugation?He retaliated almost defensively, telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and that Arabic is the language of religion (Islam) and that I shouldn't challenge it because it is a flawless language. Which is exactly what is wrong with language -- he chose to take my argument personally as if it's offensive to his very nature. And that is exactly the problem.You can imagine how an every day reminder of what is feminine and what is masculine, or what is female and what is male has an impact on the way we perceive things. Take this for example: mowazafa (female office worker) and mowazaf (male office worker).Those involved in that sort of dialogue will have constant reminders to make gender distinctions, whether they like it or not. Their impressions are already preconceived when determining the nature of that thing they are referring to - be it female or male.I picked up on that because that's how I studied my subjects. I would put the information into images in my head and create a story, so it was easy to fall into the presumption that the feminine conjugation fell into the same category as the it conjugation due to sexist precursors.Arabic is not a flawless language. Arabic has stopped developing at one point in time, and refuses to change its methods to fit the modern-day society, and so people on some scale will be stuck expressing themselves in a language that doesn't fit a progressive society or lifestyle.If we try to think of ways to develop language so as to expand our neurological functions, we'll find that our cognitive abilities will also improve, thus making us smarter and more knowledgeable.I really like the examples that Deutscher drew out in his book, such as Guugu Yimithirr -- an Aboriginal Australian language that existed in Far North Queensland. They had the tendency to use the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) rather than egocentric coordinations (right, left, back and front). How does that make them see the world differently? They will never get lost. Even looking at Google Maps confuses me sometimes - am I supposed to turn a right or a left? However if my mind was brought up in the Gugu Ymithir community, I wouldn't have been so troubled as to figure out which direction to go. But then again, that could be just my terrible sense of direction.Another example was about the color blue. A mysterious color, in my opinion. It's barely seen in nature, yet it's everywhere. It's in the sky, it's in the sea that reflects the sky. However Deutscher mentions that when you take a look at Ancient literature, you'll find that the color blue is never mentioned. The sea is described as the color of wine, and the sky is not seen as blue. In daylight, it's white, and at night it's black. The word blue just wasn't necessary back then. However, now blue is everywhere, and the sky is just about as blue as the sea. We have so much blue that the Russians have not one, but two names for the color blue. They have two color distinctions that the average English speaker would call blue, but they call Siniy and Goluboy.  When taken in for experiments, it was found that the Russian speakers were able to distinguish between all colors faster than the English speakers did. This ability to perceive colors in a different way, while seeing the same colors, shows that language could really transform our potentials and increase our capabilities.Language is a dangerous weapon if not handled correctly. There has been no example of this though, so don't take my word on it. But I think that we can utilize language if we work on it meticulously to shape the society and the future that we want.Thanks Deutscher for such an informative book! There are so many great references in this book, and I was left with a lot more information on language than I had before."
237,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63279672-courtney-mosier-warren,3,"In general this was a very good book. I found many of the arguments to be interesting and worth exploring. That being said, at times this books felt a bit condescending. The tone that Mr. Deutscher uses comes across poorly, although I think it is unintentional. The condescending tone does not take away from the merit of the book, but it often left me feeling distracted by it."
238,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116092820-meg-briers,4,"A good read exploring how our mother tongue may be affecting our perceptions of colour, gender and space/coordinate system. A nice crossover between the fields of linguistics and psychology that really made you think about language and how it's having an influence on your day to day life. Very informative and gave a lot of new information without making the language too inaccessible as many other similar books seem to do, quite a nice gentle read!"
239,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"Guy Deutscher's Through the Language Glass, which looks at the relationship between language, culture and perception, wasn't quite what I'd expected. Honestly, I'd expected a variation of that old chestnut on the Eskimos having a gazillion words for the concept of ""snow"", to explain how our environment and culture shapes the language we speak. Deutscher's book surpassed those expectations. There are a few painful moments in the book, when Deutscher attempts to make some witty puns (this is a book on language after all). Wannabe gems like ""In their pronouncements on language, culture and thought, it seems that big thinkers in their grandes oeuvres have not always risen much above little thinkers over their hors d'oeuvres."" Or how about ""All the facts mentioned so far about the cones in the retina are correct to the best of my knowledge. But if you are under the impression that they actually explain our sensation of colour, then you have been coned!"" Do I detect some eye rolling here? But things look up once Deutscher gets serious. Dismissing many of the common fallacies or accepted wisdoms in linguistics - like how all languages are equally complex (how does one measure complexity? how do you trade off complexity in morphology against complexity in syntax, grammar rules, etc?) - Deutscher makes a tight and convincing case for what we can conclude about language. We can summarise the main thrusts of this case with the following 3 points:1. While nature may set the boundaries of how we perceive and relate to the world (it doesn't make sense to use the same word to describe red dogs and red roses for instance), culture significantly influences how we navigate within those boundaries. A more refined colour vocabulary, or one that emphasises hue over brightness, will lead to differences in how colours are named and classified. 2. Languages vary considerable in the amount of information they convey within words - e.g. tense, person performing the action, singularity/plurality, distance, etc. There is an inverse correlation between the complexity of society and word structure as communication among intimates often allows more compact, terse ways of expressing oneself. Conversely, the greater the number of speakers, more explicit markers for providing context (e.g. prepositions, subordinate clauses) are required and simplification through bastardisation of the language also occurs. 3. Language influences us not so much in what we are allowed to think but in the ""kinds of information each language habitually obliges [us] to think about"", from the way we see spatial relationships, to the attributes that we associate objects with (depending on whether one's language assigns a gender to that object). ""When a language forces its speakers to pay attention to certain aspects of the world each time they open their mouths or prick up their ears, such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills"". There are many things in Deutscher's book that are thought provoking. But perhaps the point that struck me the most was just how much gets lost in translation, when the associations we make with certain words just disappear when transplanted into another linguistic framework. As Deutscher notes: ""But if you native speakers of English are tempted to feel sorry for those of us who are shackled by the heavy load of an irrational gender system, then think again. I would never want to change places with you...my world has so much to it that you entirely miss out on, because the landscape of my language is so much more fertile than your arid desert of 'it's'. It goes without saying that genders are language's gift to poets. Heine's masculine pine tree longs for the feminine palm; Boris Pasternak's My Sister Life can only work because 'life' is feminine in Russian; English translations of Charles Beaudelaire's 'L'homme et la mer', however inspired, can never hope to capture the tempestuous relationship of attraction and antagonism that he evokes between 'him' (the man) and 'her' (the sea); nor can English do justice to Pablo Neruda's 'Ode to the Sea', in which the (masculine) el mar strikes a stone (una piedra) and then 'he caresses her, kisses her, drenches her, pounds his chest, repeating his own name' - the English 'it caresses it, kisses it, drenches it, pounds its chest' is not quite the same."""
240,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,3," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com I bought this book on February 1st at a bookstore in Aachen, Germany, during what they called 'Bye Bye-Brexit rabat' (Bye Bye Brexit Sale) which was 20% discount on all English books. Obviously, I couldn't resist. I went on to convince the book club I recently joined to read it as our next read, but unfortunately because of the entire Covid19 situation, we haven't had the possibility to discuss the book. I now feel a little bit sorry for them, as the book was not really what I hoped it would be. The subject fascinates me. When I was a small child, growing up speaking Dutch, for a time I believed (I am embarrassed to admit) that everyone always thought in Dutch, but that two French people for example, would then decide to speak French to each other. I quickly learned this was not the case, but it kept me interested in how someones language might influence how people think. Which is why I wanted to read Through the Language Glass.The author himself is very much interested in colors. And a large part of the book is in fact about the evolution of the naming of colors in languages. While interesting, I thought it was rather a bit too extensive. The remainder of the book was filled with some interesting facts, which might come to use at a pub quiz but the argument for the influence between language and thought was never very strong. Most interestingly I found the argument that some languages are forcing people to convey information in a certain sentence that other do not. For example, if your languages has changing verbs announcing how certain you are something happened, you have to think about it before making that sentence. If you have different verbs for something that happened one day or a week ago, again you have to think about. Same for languages who unlike English have gendered words. Ultimately, the effect that was measured was rather small, I'd argue. While difficult to measure objectively, is thinking colors are further apart from each other when they cross an arbitrary color-name boundary something that is important enough to consider this a significant effect of language on thought? I am not convinced. "
241,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"My interest in  Through the Language Glass came from a conversation with a friend about how the color blue was relatively recent 'invention.' This was not that the color blue didn't exist in antiquity, but rather that it didn't go by that name. How then, did the ancients view blue? How did they view colors? Like most things, there's a book for that. Through the Language Glass not only delves into the complicated world of how language and culture affects how we organize colors, and perhaps even how we see them, but also how the science of how we perceive color and name it developed over time. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is also delved into, as are the multitude of problems with it and where they just may have gotten things right. This book is dense with information, riveting in what new discoveries and alternative hypotheses it discusses, and rife with good humor. While this book was a dry read at times, it was one I could not put down for the sheer interesting nature of all it discusses. It's a shame that so much of these topics have yet to be thoroughly discussed, but this book seems to be bringing glad tidings of a shift in focus that is more welcoming towards how culture affects language and perception."

Well, disappointed in what I read ... the book focused almost exclusively on color, and how the way we describe or see color is related to language. The author is color-blind, I believe, which I suppose explains this. However, I was expecting a book about how we *feel* different when we switch from one language to another, and that's not what this was. On the other hand, I am also somewhat relieved that the book isn't what I thought, since that's the book that I've been wanting to write. Guess I can still do that, since Guy Deutscher didn't ....."

249,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages"".There is a cluster of myths about language, referred to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that looms large over this book. If you have ever heard that the Eskimo had 50 (or 500) words for snow, and that what language you speak determines how you think, you have heard echoes of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The author of this book is one of the first to tiptoe back into the blast crater that was left when the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was exploded a century ago.In its more extreme form, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (named for a couple early scholars in the study of languages) asserts that because different languages have different words for things, and some concepts which have a name in one language do not have a name in others (e.g. schadenfreude), the language(s) you speak can determine what concepts you are able to think. For example, Eskimos can (allegedly) notice all the many shades of difference between one type of snow and another (hard packed, fused to ice, tiny and 'dry' like powder, big wet flakes, etc.), because they have words for them, and we cannot.Leaving aside whether or not the Inuit languages have many more words for snow than others (the answer appears to be complicated, but essentially 'not really'), there is another flaw with this, and 'schadenfreude' is a good illustration of it. First off, even though English had no word for 'taking joy in the misfortunes of others', we had no problem stealing it from German, and this is not only something that English does. Second, do we really believe that an english speaker in the years prior to this did not understand that sometimes a person would take joy in the downfall of another? You don't need a word or phrase for 'esprit de corps' to understand that morale is important, and if you have common enough occasion to refer to it, you can invent a word in any language.Moreover, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was one of several justifications given for policies like taking Australian Aborigines or Native Americans children from their homes and making them speak English, so it acquired a bit of a moral taint. Believing that the language you speak influences what you think became not just a scientific question, but a bit of a moral one as well, and any answer other than 'of course not' was morally suspect.Deutscher (a native speaker of Hebrew, by the way) is ready to risk such an accusation, but he first has to spend a chapter or two explaining what Sapir-Whorf was, why it wasn't true, and otherwise reassuring us that he doesn't think all children should be forced to speak one language on the grounds that it is culturally more refined. Having done that, he begins the exploration of this minefield by talking about the relatively objectively measurable topic of color.My favorite factoid from this book: there are languages in the world (several, it turns out) which have only two words for color (which correspond more or less to 'black' and 'white'). In these languages, the sky is black (except when it's covered with clouds, in which case it's white), and the leaves of plants are white. Stunned anthropologists spent a couple generations in remote villages or travelling with hunter/gatherers, and asking them to compare and label colored tiles or swatches of cloth, and determined that the people who spoke these languages were not colorblind, they just honestly didn't see the need for more words for color than this.The reason seems to be that there just isn't much need for words for color, until you have dyes, paints, markers, and other ways of routinely making a given thing one color or another. If all plants are green, why do you need to say the 'green plant'? You can just say 'plant'. If a fruit can only either be green (when it's not ripe) or red (when it's ripe), you can just say 'ripe' (or 'not ripe'), and there's no great need for a word for the color. It's rather like how we don't have words for smell, really, we mostly just say 'smells like coffee' or 'smells like flowers', or some other simile. We don't add fragrances to things (routinely), they mostly just smell how they smell, so we don't need to say 'hand me the coffee-smelling hammer, not the flowery-smelling one'. We just say 'hand me the hammer', and what smell it has is irrelevant.There are also languages which have three words for color: black, white, and red. There are several of these, not all related. What's interesting is that there aren't any with words for black, white, and blue, or black, white, and green. If there is a third and final color name, and you ask speakers to point to the tile which best epitomizes that color, they will point to the red one.Languages with four colors will have black, white, red, and either yellow or green, and languages with a fifth word for color will have both yellow and green. Blue is apparently not all that important to humans, and only languages with at least six words for color will be able to say that the sky is blue. Before that, apparently, you just note that the sky is clear, and get on with life without bothering about what color that is. One wonders what small children can pester their parents about if they can't ask why the sky is blue (I bet they manage).Having demonstrated that languages can really be different, Deutscher moves on to his main thesis: languages do really change how we think, at least a little, but not based on what they have words for. Rather, languages affect our thinking not in what they allow, but in what they require. There are languages where you do not refer to something being on your left or right; it must always be referred to as being on your north, south, or whatever. This REQUIRES the speaker to always be aware of which way is north, and to reflect this in their speech many times a day. When telling a story of something that happened to them, they must think about what direction they were facing when they told it. One might suspect that such people have a sense of direction much more developed than ours, and experiments prove that you are right. Wake such a person up from a deep sleeop in the middle of the night, and ask them what direction they were facing when they met their spouse for the first time decades before, and they will be able to tell you (although they may slap you upside the head first).There are many languages where nearly every noun is either masculine or feminine, and many others where a goodly percentage of inanimate objects are, and you have to reflect this in your word endings or choice of articles (e.g. which form of 'the' you use when speaking about 'the pine tree'). Ask speakers of German (where the word for 'bridge' is feminine) and Spanish (where it is masculine) to describe bridges, and the former will say that they are beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender, while the latter will say that they are big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and towering.Deutscher has several other such examples, with ample citations of published studies to back him up, and enough studies of Victorian scholars cavorting with savages to entertain a reader like me who is amused by the image of a bemused hunter regarding a box of colored tiles that the crazy white man wants to ask him questions about. The field he is involved in is still very immature, by his own admission. He compares it to trying to study the behavior of a corporation by camping outside the headquarters and monitoring which rooms are lit up for how many hours a day. But, if he and others succeed in at least legitimizing the question of how language influences the way we think, then it is possible that in a generation or two we may be in a position to say a lot more about it (in any language we care to use)."
250,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52711508-max-lauber,4,"This book offers a history of the often (and rightly) maligned Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and details how the notion that language shapes people's perception of the world became an *idea non grata*. Deutscher takes the reader from William Gladstone's 19th century analysis of Homer to state-of-the-art neurolinguistics research in order to not only show how language affects perception, but also to show that the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is mostly just a high-flying fantasy. To summarize it in a sentence, Deutscher argues that culture, i.e. language, has a stronger effect on our thinking than we are comfortable to admit, but that the impact of language on thought is very different from what it was believed to be in the past.Specifically, he argues that there is no evidence that our mother tongue constrains our cognitive capacity or that it imposes limits on what we can understand. In other words, he says the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is bunk. Instead, he argues that ""the real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us - all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself"". He summarizes this idea in what he calls the Boas-Jakobson principle: Languages differ essentially in what they must convey, not in what they may convey.By surveying not only current research, but also methodologies and findings from the past 200 years, Deutscher makes a very plausible claim for the Boas-Jakobson principle and for his rejection of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and the linguistic dogma that language does not fundamentally affect the way we think. Although there is no dearth of substance in this book, Deutscher shines more brightly when it comes to style. He has a knack for explaining the history of ideas (particularly when it comes to the history of color and perception) and dropping quirky anecdotes at the right moment (i.e. almost all the time). In short, this is an engaging read that offers a rather nuanced take on one of the thorniest linguistic questions. As such, definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."
251,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about language, mostly because the information provided is done so with great verve and charm by the author. His chatty style is most disarming — this is a man who knows how to educate his readers almost effortlessly: he will occasionally lead you astray deliberately, so that he can later point out what further research has revealed. And it is quite rewarding!This book limits itself to three specific aspects of language: the words used in languages for colour; the method used in various cultures and languages for orientation of oneself within the world; and an examination of the use of 'gender' in many languages (with English being one of the few that seems to particularly eschew this quality). The overall objective seems to be that from his studies Deutscher tends to believe that, as the title tells us, the world does look different in other languages. He tends to leave it at that: to argue as to how different that world is, and whether this indicates anything further with regard to science, philosophy, religion, culture, etc. are obviously left for others to ponder.I used quotes around the word 'gender' above because it was in this section (entitled ""Sex and Syntax"") that I was not completely convinced by his argument. He uses the example of a poem by Heine in which a pine tree in the North dreams of a palm tree 'far in the East', and points out that in the original German language a pine tree is a masculine word, while a palm tree is a feminine word — thus there is a 'sexual overtone' found in the original which a simple English translation would fail to communicate. He seems to argue that this lack of gender makes English less rich in its connotations. (It also explains why often enough learners of English from a country where words have a sexual distinction applied to them will often make 'mistakes' with personal pronouns, and will apply them 'incorrectly' to English words: in other words, they are still thinking of a word in the sex of their original language.) What bothers me about this is that my background is Italian, a language which has male and female words, but I can never remember thinking that they had an actual sexual connotation. For example, the word for a fork in Italian is feminine, but it does not mean that there are sexual connotations connected to a fork. Maybe I am being too precious about this, but it did make me wonder about whether Deutscher's 'smooth talking' might not mask other aspects which might not be 'quite right'…Be that as it may, the book is still quite a wonderful read for anyone interested in languages in general."
252,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10298127-anne,0,"I can't really review this book, because if I'd known anything about linguistics, I wouldn't have to read this in the first place. But I'll give it a try.Through the Language Glass is a popular science book for people interested in how language and perception of reality work. It is easy to read (but not too easy) and Guy Deutscher uses interesting examples to show how differences between languages can cause (ever so tiny) differences in perception. He is quite critical of people jumping to conclusions, so this book doesn't convince you of some radical idea that your reality is completely different from that of someone with a different mother tongue. Instead, it shows how things like colour perception, grammatical gender, and direction through left-right or east-west can have a tiny influence on your sense of the world, if only because when tested, people who are confronted with something that clashes with their language's 'settings' take a tiny bit more time than others.So the good part is that he doesn't try to shove crazy theories down your throat, but tries to remain critical. The bad part is that he seems either to take pleasure in discrediting scientists who were wrong about things or that he just exaggerates for dramatic effect. Either way, not so great. In general, his tone is definitely less neutral than I would like, also when he talks about ""primitive tribes"" etc. He seems not to have fixed on one term that is satisfactory, and although he defends the complexity of their language, I think he is quite careless and unspecific (and a bit tactless) in his terms to describe these societies, and maybe he could have looked up anthropologists' terms and used those. I know it's a fluffy popular science book but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a more objective, scientific tone.If you're looking for a book that will convince you that language changes your reality or that it absolutely does not, this is not it. Deutscher uses three topics (colour, grammatical gender, direction) of which colour takes up the most space in the book. It was a nice read but if at all possible, it would have been nice to have some extra categories, and not just these three."
253,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"As other reviewers remarked, the title of this book is slightly misleading. A large part of the book deals with colours. How they are perceived, how their naming follows a similar pattern in most languages and why this is important. There are mentions of Homer and his ""wine coloured sea"", a pretty dense historical background and references to modern studies. This part I found most interesting, but it has not much to do with the fact that the world looks different in other languages. Because, in fact it does not.Other chapters explain that languages have very little influence on thoughts and that grammar is the only constraint to the way we express ourselves. People understand basic concepts more or less in the same way, but they have different grammar rules to express them. More than language, what shapes their thoughts is their culture.There is also some debate about the fact that we change slightly, when we speak a foreign language. Much is said about languages that have masculine and feminine nouns and those that have not. Personally, I speak four languages quite fluently and I must confess I never noticed any major change of personality when I switch from Italian to English, to French or Portuguese. But maybe it is just me. The absence of ""gender"" in English nouns is actually much welcomed, since I must deal with random feminine and masculine in the other three languages I know.For those not familiar, I can assure you it is pretty annoying having to learn that ""la fleur"" is feminine in French and ""a viagem"" is feminine in Portuguese, while both are masculine in Italian (""il fiore"",""il viaggio""). The total lack of logic of assigning genders to nouns can be mind-blowing, but still does not interfere with the fact that when I see a flower I know it is a flower and not a cat – whether I think in Italian, French, English or Portuguese."
254,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"This book uses three 'case studies' (colour, gender and spacial awareness) to look at how language affects our view of the world, our thinking and our memory.The first third of the book looks in depth at the history of the study of how colour is described by various international and classical cultures and how the differences have been (miss)interpreted by an assortment of learned gentlemen over the years. This gives a very nice springboard to the reader to see the types of pitfalls that such studies can fall into and prepare the ground for the second part of the book.The second section of the book goes into more depth on the subject of 'how can we study whether linguistic differences really affect our minds and the way they work?'. The Australian (and other) tribes that do all their directions in North, South, East and West rather than ever using left, right, in front or behind, were new to me and absolutely fascinating. Deutscher writes in an easily accessible style adding plenty of actual data from studies without letting it overwhelm the greater story. I felt that the arguments for and against certain viewpoints were well rehearsed in a relatively light hearted non-judgemental way that left one feeling enlightened and amused. This book has re-enforced my view that the human minds and human cultures are totally fascinating in their infintie variety, and left me looking for more non fiction in a similar vein. I have a few other books lined up. I hope they are as good. "
255,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"I enjoyed this book. The title for me was a bit misleading, at least for the first part of the book, which was mostly about out color sense and how we perceive colors and the role that language plays in that perception. I was not expecting this and so it threw me off a bit but the author’s excellent writing style quickly had me feeling at ease.About the writing style, it is relaxed and playful. The author is a punster and the book is littered with witty puns throughout (even the appendix has a pun thrown in) but this doesn’t take away from the excellent scientific research that is conveyed. I especially liked the second part of the book and the fascinating story of the Guugu Yimithirr, a group of native peoples whose language reflects the geography of the world. Where I (and most other people I know) use our bodies as the starting point for explaining directions to other people, the Guugu Yimithirr use the cardinal points of a compass, so that if I see a bug on your left foot I would state that, whereas a Guugu Yimithirr person would say that you have a bug on your ""West"" foot (if he was facing South and you were facing him.) This was amazing to me, and the author describes other equally fascinating cultures that use geography to describe the world. I have a lousy sense of direction but not so these other peoples, and this kind of thinking is not as rare as you would imagine.All in all, I feel this is an excellent book and would like to read it again to catch the things I missed. Highly recommended. "
256,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745423-simon,4,"One small criticism first: this was in some ways less far-ranging and comprehensive than I'd imagined, focussing on just three aspects of language and the perception of reality - colour, gender and spatial relations. And the sections on colour account for almost half the book. This can be forgiven as these are the only areas in which any serious and conclusive research has been done.But once you get past that narrowing of the scope, this is a still an eye-opening and enormously readble book, full of fascinating details and vividly described characters. What makes it work best is Deutscher's skill as a storyteller, with early sections tracing the historical development of theories about ancient Greeks' colour perception at times read like a particularly engrossing thriller (no, really). Deutscher is also a skilled prose writer, and not above slipping in the occasional linguistic witticism, but only where appropriate and never coming across as clever for its own sake.Highly recommended."
257,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Book about the way language influences the way we think -- and vice-versa. While the famous Sapir-Whorf thesis has been debunked (and is a bit of an embarrassment for linguists), in the end it seems that language and our thinking *do* have have some influence upon each other.I enjoyed the discussion of Homer and the weird usage of colors, and the way some Australian tribes use an absolute (well, with earth as the frame of reference) coordinate system rather than 'left of me', 'in front of me' etc.Also interesting was the discussion of the Matsés people of the Amazon. Their language has a built-in concept of evidentiality -- every time they say anything about anything, their language requires them to express the amount of evidence for the statement -- 'seen with my own eyes' until 'mere hearsay' paper. A great idea -- maybe we should import that concept in our languages as well?"

The color chapters are by far the strongest (first and last). He gives a careful dissecting of Whorfianism and showing why he's not defending that (a good debate strategy, to be sure); however, other works argue that the evidence presented therein really does have cause and effect backwards (as far as language and thought). I would strongly recommend reading this in conjunction with Christine Kennealy's ""The First Word"" and Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought,"" and drawing your own conclusions, assuming of course you're a linguistics nerd and have a lot of time on your hands. This, you'll get through fairly quickly: Pinker especially, though, will take you some chewing."

265,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23180960-stephen-case,3,"It started with a conversation with a student, who said he had read an article explaining that the color blue never appeared in ancient Greek writings. That led to some internet searching, and I quickly found this book, which claims to be a treatment of this puzzle and turns out to be an explanation of the way language shapes the way we see the world. Do people who speak different languages actually see the world differently? Or in other words, how much does the structure of our language mirror or constrain the structure of our thought?Deutscher-- a linguist with an axe to grind against some of the contemporary views in the field-- starts the exploration of this question with its most interesting manifestation: color. The realization that there was something strange going on in ancient accounts of color goes back to the philhellene and sometimes Prime Minister William Gladstone who noticed that blue never appears in Homer's writings. The sea and sky are not referred to as blue, and other colors are also used in questionable ways. Other researchers into ancient texts discovered similar things: many ancient languages didn't have a word for blue. Indeed, there seemed to be a order of appearance in which ""primitive"" languages (and the author offers examples of some contemporary languages as well) distinguish between dark and light and lump all colors together as reddish. Eventually words for yellows and browns appear and finally terms that distinguish between greens and blues. The differentiation of blue usually comes last, and there are still signs of this, for instance, in the fact that in old Japanese the word for blue and green is the same.What does this mean? Early theories speculated that there was an actual physiological evolution taking place, that as humans became less primitive their eyes developed to perceive a wider spectrum of colors. Modern genetics and tests on speakers who languages currently lack certain color words has disproven this. Ancient Greek eyes were the same as ours. But did their lack of names for certain colors shape the way they perceived the world? This is the crux of the author's question: do we really see things if we don't have words to express them? I explored this once in a story published in Daily Science Fiction. Does naming something make it more real or at least more readily apparent?Part of the argument for color goes something like this. In primitive civilizations color doesn't matter a whole lot, and certain colors are rarely perceived on their own. Red is the color of blood, so a word to distinguish this comes fairly early in most cultures. But there are no large blue animals, few blue flowers, and blue dye was very difficult to make and unknown in many cultures. (Egypt was an exception, and apparently ancient Egyptian had a word for blue.) Because of this, there was no social or linguistic need to distinguish or name this hue. But what about the sea and the sky? The sea rarely looks straightforwardly blue, and the sky-- when completely clear-- was simply the sky. Since there was no cultural need to distinguish its color, it was simply the sky.The first half of the book is an investigation of the history of the color question, and if you're not quite satisfied with the answer I've given (and I'm not sure I am), you might not be satisfied with this portion of the book. For Deutscher though, color simply sets up the bigger question: how do we determine-- and then empirically test-- whether language actually shapes our perception and our thought processes? Are certain concepts (like ""The sky is blue"") simply inexpressible in some languages? Does this mean speakers of those languages are unable to conceive of certain statements and concepts? Deutscher's answer is no to these last two questions but a cautious yes to the first.An older, stronger claim would answer the final question of the above paragraph in the affirmative: language constrains thought. Because the Hopi Indians, for instance, have no verb tense in their language or expressions of time, they cannot perceive time as linear. Because other Native American languages do not distinguish between verb and subject, speakers of these languages have a more monistic, unified of nature. Deutscher disagrees and takes obvious pleasure in demolishing these claims, maintaining instead that any concept can be expressed in any language. His alternate claim is more subtle: it's not that some languages make it impossible to perceive or conceive certain things; rather, his claim is that certain languages obligate speakers to always be thinking of certain things.What does this mean? The author provides three examples. The first is that of a particular well-studied Australian aboriginal language that does not possess an egocentric coordinate system (i.e. behind, in front, left, right) but only an absolute system (north, east, south, west). Every positional expression voiced in this language, from things as simple as ""There's a bug beside your foot"" have to be given in terms of cardinal directions. (""There's a bug north of your foot."") This means that speakers of the language always have a sense of these directions from a very young age, and their experiences and memories are seen through that directional lens. The author discusses a variety of experiments in which it's shown that speakers of this language can recall details in this coordinate system, recounting orientations of experiences from years ago. (To put this in perspective, try calling up a particularly vivid memory and expressing it in terms of cardinal directions. Were you standing to the north or south of your spouse when you got married?) The language obligates its speakers to always have cardinal directions in mind and thus shapes their perceptions of the world accordingly.Languages with no egocentric coordinate system though are comparatively rare, so the author's second example is closer to home: languages like German or Spanish or many more with a developed gender system. In English-- at least since the century or so after the Norman Conquest, as the author points out in a fascinating historical treatment-- does not oblige its speakers to assign genders to inanimate objects. Yet many other modern languages do. Not much study has yet been done, according to Deutscher, on how this influences the thoughts of speakers of these languages, but he illustrates some of the implications with an example of the role this plays in translation and the subtle nuances and relations that can be lost moving from a gendered to a largely non-gendered language.Finally, he returns to color. Does our language's names for colors-- and the fact that these names don't exist in certain other languages-- influence the way we perceive the world? Recent studies, the author argues, indicate that yes, it does. He takes the case of light blue and dark blue, which in Russian have separate names. An English speaker would perceive these as shades of the same color. For a Russian speaker they would be separate colors. If this was indeed the case, one could expect that this linguistic obligation (that of the Russian speaker to give these separate hues different names) would allow Russians to more quickly distinguish between similar shades of blue if they lay on opposite sides of this distinction, in a similar manner to how an English speaker could more readily distinguish between greenish-blue and bluish-green than a speaker of a language that does not differentiate between green and blue. The author relates in detail the set-up of experiments to determine just that, which show the language-processing region of the brain active even when actively naming the hues was not part of the experiment. Russian speakers consistently differentiated between close shades of blue more quickly than English speakers.What does all this mean? It comes back to the central claim of the book, that languages, by obligating their speakers to pay attention to certain things in their structure, can function as a lens by which their speakers perceive the world.Consider this analogy (not given in the book): if your language has several different expressions for snow, so that each time you talk about snow you're obligated to take into consideration things like whether it's falling or on the ground, how long it's been on the ground, what its thickness and consistency is, then when you look at snow (or call up a memory containing snow) you're going to have a richer perception of the object than an English speaker who encapsulates all the varieties of snow under a single word. That doesn't mean that an English speaker can't conceptualize or express these nuances of snow. It just means her language doesn't habituate her to these perceptions.In these (possibly over-simplified) terms, Deutscher's argument seems almost self-evident, but the richness of his treatment comes in the historical and linguistic background he provides while exploring this idea and especially in his explanations of the rigor and structure of the experiments devised to verify such apparently straightforward claims about language and how it shapes our perceptions of the world."
266,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3514657-aya-zain,4,"The blurb of this book excited me so much. I've always wondered whether language has an influence on our intentions, our implications, and our culture. But Guy Deutscher made me think of the reverse scenario: that culture has had an impact on language, and that language is enforced every day thus leaving us no choice but to express ourselves in a somewhat outdated mode. Let me illustrate that further.I'm not sure what my mother tongue is. I'm of Arab descent, so it should be Arabic, however I was born and raised overseas where I focused on learning English instead. I became advanced in English and chose English as both a major and a minor for university, whereas my Arabic is intermediate to say the least. I can speak Arabic, but I always mess up the verb tenses -- feminine or masculine? So 'That table has a book on it' would turn into That (masculine) table (feminine) has a book on (feminine) it -- which is all incorrect, by the way! My Arabic just wasn't very good, and so I always confused the propositions and other articles.Arabic - like a few other languages - doesn't have gender neutrality, so that our every day language must determine what is masculine and what is feminine. And you can probably imagine that the more delicate inanimate objects usually took on the feminine form.Anyway - it goes further than that. And I once mentioned it to a high school classmate of mine in the 11th grade. I asked him: how come the verb conjugation of the plural masculine form gets a special (new and improved) conjugation, however the plural feminine verb conjugation is subjected to the same conjugation as the 'they' conjugation?He retaliated almost defensively, telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and that Arabic is the language of religion (Islam) and that I shouldn't challenge it because it is a flawless language. Which is exactly what is wrong with language -- he chose to take my argument personally as if it's offensive to his very nature. And that is exactly the problem.You can imagine how an every day reminder of what is feminine and what is masculine, or what is female and what is male has an impact on the way we perceive things. Take this for example: mowazafa (female office worker) and mowazaf (male office worker).Those involved in that sort of dialogue will have constant reminders to make gender distinctions, whether they like it or not. Their impressions are already preconceived when determining the nature of that thing they are referring to - be it female or male.I picked up on that because that's how I studied my subjects. I would put the information into images in my head and create a story, so it was easy to fall into the presumption that the feminine conjugation fell into the same category as the it conjugation due to sexist precursors.Arabic is not a flawless language. Arabic has stopped developing at one point in time, and refuses to change its methods to fit the modern-day society, and so people on some scale will be stuck expressing themselves in a language that doesn't fit a progressive society or lifestyle.If we try to think of ways to develop language so as to expand our neurological functions, we'll find that our cognitive abilities will also improve, thus making us smarter and more knowledgeable.I really like the examples that Deutscher drew out in his book, such as Guugu Yimithirr -- an Aboriginal Australian language that existed in Far North Queensland. They had the tendency to use the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) rather than egocentric coordinations (right, left, back and front). How does that make them see the world differently? They will never get lost. Even looking at Google Maps confuses me sometimes - am I supposed to turn a right or a left? However if my mind was brought up in the Gugu Ymithir community, I wouldn't have been so troubled as to figure out which direction to go. But then again, that could be just my terrible sense of direction.Another example was about the color blue. A mysterious color, in my opinion. It's barely seen in nature, yet it's everywhere. It's in the sky, it's in the sea that reflects the sky. However Deutscher mentions that when you take a look at Ancient literature, you'll find that the color blue is never mentioned. The sea is described as the color of wine, and the sky is not seen as blue. In daylight, it's white, and at night it's black. The word blue just wasn't necessary back then. However, now blue is everywhere, and the sky is just about as blue as the sea. We have so much blue that the Russians have not one, but two names for the color blue. They have two color distinctions that the average English speaker would call blue, but they call Siniy and Goluboy.  When taken in for experiments, it was found that the Russian speakers were able to distinguish between all colors faster than the English speakers did. This ability to perceive colors in a different way, while seeing the same colors, shows that language could really transform our potentials and increase our capabilities.Language is a dangerous weapon if not handled correctly. There has been no example of this though, so don't take my word on it. But I think that we can utilize language if we work on it meticulously to shape the society and the future that we want.Thanks Deutscher for such an informative book! There are so many great references in this book, and I was left with a lot more information on language than I had before."
267,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63279672-courtney-mosier-warren,3,"In general this was a very good book. I found many of the arguments to be interesting and worth exploring. That being said, at times this books felt a bit condescending. The tone that Mr. Deutscher uses comes across poorly, although I think it is unintentional. The condescending tone does not take away from the merit of the book, but it often left me feeling distracted by it."
268,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116092820-meg-briers,4,"A good read exploring how our mother tongue may be affecting our perceptions of colour, gender and space/coordinate system. A nice crossover between the fields of linguistics and psychology that really made you think about language and how it's having an influence on your day to day life. Very informative and gave a lot of new information without making the language too inaccessible as many other similar books seem to do, quite a nice gentle read!"
269,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"Guy Deutscher's Through the Language Glass, which looks at the relationship between language, culture and perception, wasn't quite what I'd expected. Honestly, I'd expected a variation of that old chestnut on the Eskimos having a gazillion words for the concept of ""snow"", to explain how our environment and culture shapes the language we speak. Deutscher's book surpassed those expectations. There are a few painful moments in the book, when Deutscher attempts to make some witty puns (this is a book on language after all). Wannabe gems like ""In their pronouncements on language, culture and thought, it seems that big thinkers in their grandes oeuvres have not always risen much above little thinkers over their hors d'oeuvres."" Or how about ""All the facts mentioned so far about the cones in the retina are correct to the best of my knowledge. But if you are under the impression that they actually explain our sensation of colour, then you have been coned!"" Do I detect some eye rolling here? But things look up once Deutscher gets serious. Dismissing many of the common fallacies or accepted wisdoms in linguistics - like how all languages are equally complex (how does one measure complexity? how do you trade off complexity in morphology against complexity in syntax, grammar rules, etc?) - Deutscher makes a tight and convincing case for what we can conclude about language. We can summarise the main thrusts of this case with the following 3 points:1. While nature may set the boundaries of how we perceive and relate to the world (it doesn't make sense to use the same word to describe red dogs and red roses for instance), culture significantly influences how we navigate within those boundaries. A more refined colour vocabulary, or one that emphasises hue over brightness, will lead to differences in how colours are named and classified. 2. Languages vary considerable in the amount of information they convey within words - e.g. tense, person performing the action, singularity/plurality, distance, etc. There is an inverse correlation between the complexity of society and word structure as communication among intimates often allows more compact, terse ways of expressing oneself. Conversely, the greater the number of speakers, more explicit markers for providing context (e.g. prepositions, subordinate clauses) are required and simplification through bastardisation of the language also occurs. 3. Language influences us not so much in what we are allowed to think but in the ""kinds of information each language habitually obliges [us] to think about"", from the way we see spatial relationships, to the attributes that we associate objects with (depending on whether one's language assigns a gender to that object). ""When a language forces its speakers to pay attention to certain aspects of the world each time they open their mouths or prick up their ears, such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills"". There are many things in Deutscher's book that are thought provoking. But perhaps the point that struck me the most was just how much gets lost in translation, when the associations we make with certain words just disappear when transplanted into another linguistic framework. As Deutscher notes: ""But if you native speakers of English are tempted to feel sorry for those of us who are shackled by the heavy load of an irrational gender system, then think again. I would never want to change places with you...my world has so much to it that you entirely miss out on, because the landscape of my language is so much more fertile than your arid desert of 'it's'. It goes without saying that genders are language's gift to poets. Heine's masculine pine tree longs for the feminine palm; Boris Pasternak's My Sister Life can only work because 'life' is feminine in Russian; English translations of Charles Beaudelaire's 'L'homme et la mer', however inspired, can never hope to capture the tempestuous relationship of attraction and antagonism that he evokes between 'him' (the man) and 'her' (the sea); nor can English do justice to Pablo Neruda's 'Ode to the Sea', in which the (masculine) el mar strikes a stone (una piedra) and then 'he caresses her, kisses her, drenches her, pounds his chest, repeating his own name' - the English 'it caresses it, kisses it, drenches it, pounds its chest' is not quite the same."""
270,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,3," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com I bought this book on February 1st at a bookstore in Aachen, Germany, during what they called 'Bye Bye-Brexit rabat' (Bye Bye Brexit Sale) which was 20% discount on all English books. Obviously, I couldn't resist. I went on to convince the book club I recently joined to read it as our next read, but unfortunately because of the entire Covid19 situation, we haven't had the possibility to discuss the book. I now feel a little bit sorry for them, as the book was not really what I hoped it would be. The subject fascinates me. When I was a small child, growing up speaking Dutch, for a time I believed (I am embarrassed to admit) that everyone always thought in Dutch, but that two French people for example, would then decide to speak French to each other. I quickly learned this was not the case, but it kept me interested in how someones language might influence how people think. Which is why I wanted to read Through the Language Glass.The author himself is very much interested in colors. And a large part of the book is in fact about the evolution of the naming of colors in languages. While interesting, I thought it was rather a bit too extensive. The remainder of the book was filled with some interesting facts, which might come to use at a pub quiz but the argument for the influence between language and thought was never very strong. Most interestingly I found the argument that some languages are forcing people to convey information in a certain sentence that other do not. For example, if your languages has changing verbs announcing how certain you are something happened, you have to think about it before making that sentence. If you have different verbs for something that happened one day or a week ago, again you have to think about. Same for languages who unlike English have gendered words. Ultimately, the effect that was measured was rather small, I'd argue. While difficult to measure objectively, is thinking colors are further apart from each other when they cross an arbitrary color-name boundary something that is important enough to consider this a significant effect of language on thought? I am not convinced. "
271,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"My interest in  Through the Language Glass came from a conversation with a friend about how the color blue was relatively recent 'invention.' This was not that the color blue didn't exist in antiquity, but rather that it didn't go by that name. How then, did the ancients view blue? How did they view colors? Like most things, there's a book for that. Through the Language Glass not only delves into the complicated world of how language and culture affects how we organize colors, and perhaps even how we see them, but also how the science of how we perceive color and name it developed over time. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is also delved into, as are the multitude of problems with it and where they just may have gotten things right. This book is dense with information, riveting in what new discoveries and alternative hypotheses it discusses, and rife with good humor. While this book was a dry read at times, it was one I could not put down for the sheer interesting nature of all it discusses. It's a shame that so much of these topics have yet to be thoroughly discussed, but this book seems to be bringing glad tidings of a shift in focus that is more welcoming towards how culture affects language and perception."
272,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2974294-jessica,1,"DNF a little more than 100 pages into it because the author's casual use of the words ""primitive"" and ""savage"" to describe indigenous peoples and peoples from pre-literate societies was extremely distasteful. And by that, I mean racist. And his discussion of creole/pidgin languages was similarly limited. Jade goes into more detail in her review than I care to.I'm going to save myself the energy and frustration, and just move on to  The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language instead."

Well, disappointed in what I read ... the book focused almost exclusively on color, and how the way we describe or see color is related to language. The author is color-blind, I believe, which I suppose explains this. However, I was expecting a book about how we *feel* different when we switch from one language to another, and that's not what this was. On the other hand, I am also somewhat relieved that the book isn't what I thought, since that's the book that I've been wanting to write. Guess I can still do that, since Guy Deutscher didn't ....."

279,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages"".There is a cluster of myths about language, referred to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, that looms large over this book. If you have ever heard that the Eskimo had 50 (or 500) words for snow, and that what language you speak determines how you think, you have heard echoes of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The author of this book is one of the first to tiptoe back into the blast crater that was left when the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was exploded a century ago.In its more extreme form, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (named for a couple early scholars in the study of languages) asserts that because different languages have different words for things, and some concepts which have a name in one language do not have a name in others (e.g. schadenfreude), the language(s) you speak can determine what concepts you are able to think. For example, Eskimos can (allegedly) notice all the many shades of difference between one type of snow and another (hard packed, fused to ice, tiny and 'dry' like powder, big wet flakes, etc.), because they have words for them, and we cannot.Leaving aside whether or not the Inuit languages have many more words for snow than others (the answer appears to be complicated, but essentially 'not really'), there is another flaw with this, and 'schadenfreude' is a good illustration of it. First off, even though English had no word for 'taking joy in the misfortunes of others', we had no problem stealing it from German, and this is not only something that English does. Second, do we really believe that an english speaker in the years prior to this did not understand that sometimes a person would take joy in the downfall of another? You don't need a word or phrase for 'esprit de corps' to understand that morale is important, and if you have common enough occasion to refer to it, you can invent a word in any language.Moreover, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was one of several justifications given for policies like taking Australian Aborigines or Native Americans children from their homes and making them speak English, so it acquired a bit of a moral taint. Believing that the language you speak influences what you think became not just a scientific question, but a bit of a moral one as well, and any answer other than 'of course not' was morally suspect.Deutscher (a native speaker of Hebrew, by the way) is ready to risk such an accusation, but he first has to spend a chapter or two explaining what Sapir-Whorf was, why it wasn't true, and otherwise reassuring us that he doesn't think all children should be forced to speak one language on the grounds that it is culturally more refined. Having done that, he begins the exploration of this minefield by talking about the relatively objectively measurable topic of color.My favorite factoid from this book: there are languages in the world (several, it turns out) which have only two words for color (which correspond more or less to 'black' and 'white'). In these languages, the sky is black (except when it's covered with clouds, in which case it's white), and the leaves of plants are white. Stunned anthropologists spent a couple generations in remote villages or travelling with hunter/gatherers, and asking them to compare and label colored tiles or swatches of cloth, and determined that the people who spoke these languages were not colorblind, they just honestly didn't see the need for more words for color than this.The reason seems to be that there just isn't much need for words for color, until you have dyes, paints, markers, and other ways of routinely making a given thing one color or another. If all plants are green, why do you need to say the 'green plant'? You can just say 'plant'. If a fruit can only either be green (when it's not ripe) or red (when it's ripe), you can just say 'ripe' (or 'not ripe'), and there's no great need for a word for the color. It's rather like how we don't have words for smell, really, we mostly just say 'smells like coffee' or 'smells like flowers', or some other simile. We don't add fragrances to things (routinely), they mostly just smell how they smell, so we don't need to say 'hand me the coffee-smelling hammer, not the flowery-smelling one'. We just say 'hand me the hammer', and what smell it has is irrelevant.There are also languages which have three words for color: black, white, and red. There are several of these, not all related. What's interesting is that there aren't any with words for black, white, and blue, or black, white, and green. If there is a third and final color name, and you ask speakers to point to the tile which best epitomizes that color, they will point to the red one.Languages with four colors will have black, white, red, and either yellow or green, and languages with a fifth word for color will have both yellow and green. Blue is apparently not all that important to humans, and only languages with at least six words for color will be able to say that the sky is blue. Before that, apparently, you just note that the sky is clear, and get on with life without bothering about what color that is. One wonders what small children can pester their parents about if they can't ask why the sky is blue (I bet they manage).Having demonstrated that languages can really be different, Deutscher moves on to his main thesis: languages do really change how we think, at least a little, but not based on what they have words for. Rather, languages affect our thinking not in what they allow, but in what they require. There are languages where you do not refer to something being on your left or right; it must always be referred to as being on your north, south, or whatever. This REQUIRES the speaker to always be aware of which way is north, and to reflect this in their speech many times a day. When telling a story of something that happened to them, they must think about what direction they were facing when they told it. One might suspect that such people have a sense of direction much more developed than ours, and experiments prove that you are right. Wake such a person up from a deep sleeop in the middle of the night, and ask them what direction they were facing when they met their spouse for the first time decades before, and they will be able to tell you (although they may slap you upside the head first).There are many languages where nearly every noun is either masculine or feminine, and many others where a goodly percentage of inanimate objects are, and you have to reflect this in your word endings or choice of articles (e.g. which form of 'the' you use when speaking about 'the pine tree'). Ask speakers of German (where the word for 'bridge' is feminine) and Spanish (where it is masculine) to describe bridges, and the former will say that they are beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender, while the latter will say that they are big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and towering.Deutscher has several other such examples, with ample citations of published studies to back him up, and enough studies of Victorian scholars cavorting with savages to entertain a reader like me who is amused by the image of a bemused hunter regarding a box of colored tiles that the crazy white man wants to ask him questions about. The field he is involved in is still very immature, by his own admission. He compares it to trying to study the behavior of a corporation by camping outside the headquarters and monitoring which rooms are lit up for how many hours a day. But, if he and others succeed in at least legitimizing the question of how language influences the way we think, then it is possible that in a generation or two we may be in a position to say a lot more about it (in any language we care to use)."
280,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52711508-max-lauber,4,"This book offers a history of the often (and rightly) maligned Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and details how the notion that language shapes people's perception of the world became an *idea non grata*. Deutscher takes the reader from William Gladstone's 19th century analysis of Homer to state-of-the-art neurolinguistics research in order to not only show how language affects perception, but also to show that the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is mostly just a high-flying fantasy. To summarize it in a sentence, Deutscher argues that culture, i.e. language, has a stronger effect on our thinking than we are comfortable to admit, but that the impact of language on thought is very different from what it was believed to be in the past.Specifically, he argues that there is no evidence that our mother tongue constrains our cognitive capacity or that it imposes limits on what we can understand. In other words, he says the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is bunk. Instead, he argues that ""the real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. The concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, the details it requires us to be attentive to, and the repeated associations it imposes on us - all these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself"". He summarizes this idea in what he calls the Boas-Jakobson principle: Languages differ essentially in what they must convey, not in what they may convey.By surveying not only current research, but also methodologies and findings from the past 200 years, Deutscher makes a very plausible claim for the Boas-Jakobson principle and for his rejection of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and the linguistic dogma that language does not fundamentally affect the way we think. Although there is no dearth of substance in this book, Deutscher shines more brightly when it comes to style. He has a knack for explaining the history of ideas (particularly when it comes to the history of color and perception) and dropping quirky anecdotes at the right moment (i.e. almost all the time). In short, this is an engaging read that offers a rather nuanced take on one of the thorniest linguistic questions. As such, definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."
281,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about language, mostly because the information provided is done so with great verve and charm by the author. His chatty style is most disarming — this is a man who knows how to educate his readers almost effortlessly: he will occasionally lead you astray deliberately, so that he can later point out what further research has revealed. And it is quite rewarding!This book limits itself to three specific aspects of language: the words used in languages for colour; the method used in various cultures and languages for orientation of oneself within the world; and an examination of the use of 'gender' in many languages (with English being one of the few that seems to particularly eschew this quality). The overall objective seems to be that from his studies Deutscher tends to believe that, as the title tells us, the world does look different in other languages. He tends to leave it at that: to argue as to how different that world is, and whether this indicates anything further with regard to science, philosophy, religion, culture, etc. are obviously left for others to ponder.I used quotes around the word 'gender' above because it was in this section (entitled ""Sex and Syntax"") that I was not completely convinced by his argument. He uses the example of a poem by Heine in which a pine tree in the North dreams of a palm tree 'far in the East', and points out that in the original German language a pine tree is a masculine word, while a palm tree is a feminine word — thus there is a 'sexual overtone' found in the original which a simple English translation would fail to communicate. He seems to argue that this lack of gender makes English less rich in its connotations. (It also explains why often enough learners of English from a country where words have a sexual distinction applied to them will often make 'mistakes' with personal pronouns, and will apply them 'incorrectly' to English words: in other words, they are still thinking of a word in the sex of their original language.) What bothers me about this is that my background is Italian, a language which has male and female words, but I can never remember thinking that they had an actual sexual connotation. For example, the word for a fork in Italian is feminine, but it does not mean that there are sexual connotations connected to a fork. Maybe I am being too precious about this, but it did make me wonder about whether Deutscher's 'smooth talking' might not mask other aspects which might not be 'quite right'…Be that as it may, the book is still quite a wonderful read for anyone interested in languages in general."
282,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10298127-anne,0,"I can't really review this book, because if I'd known anything about linguistics, I wouldn't have to read this in the first place. But I'll give it a try.Through the Language Glass is a popular science book for people interested in how language and perception of reality work. It is easy to read (but not too easy) and Guy Deutscher uses interesting examples to show how differences between languages can cause (ever so tiny) differences in perception. He is quite critical of people jumping to conclusions, so this book doesn't convince you of some radical idea that your reality is completely different from that of someone with a different mother tongue. Instead, it shows how things like colour perception, grammatical gender, and direction through left-right or east-west can have a tiny influence on your sense of the world, if only because when tested, people who are confronted with something that clashes with their language's 'settings' take a tiny bit more time than others.So the good part is that he doesn't try to shove crazy theories down your throat, but tries to remain critical. The bad part is that he seems either to take pleasure in discrediting scientists who were wrong about things or that he just exaggerates for dramatic effect. Either way, not so great. In general, his tone is definitely less neutral than I would like, also when he talks about ""primitive tribes"" etc. He seems not to have fixed on one term that is satisfactory, and although he defends the complexity of their language, I think he is quite careless and unspecific (and a bit tactless) in his terms to describe these societies, and maybe he could have looked up anthropologists' terms and used those. I know it's a fluffy popular science book but I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a more objective, scientific tone.If you're looking for a book that will convince you that language changes your reality or that it absolutely does not, this is not it. Deutscher uses three topics (colour, grammatical gender, direction) of which colour takes up the most space in the book. It was a nice read but if at all possible, it would have been nice to have some extra categories, and not just these three."
283,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"As other reviewers remarked, the title of this book is slightly misleading. A large part of the book deals with colours. How they are perceived, how their naming follows a similar pattern in most languages and why this is important. There are mentions of Homer and his ""wine coloured sea"", a pretty dense historical background and references to modern studies. This part I found most interesting, but it has not much to do with the fact that the world looks different in other languages. Because, in fact it does not.Other chapters explain that languages have very little influence on thoughts and that grammar is the only constraint to the way we express ourselves. People understand basic concepts more or less in the same way, but they have different grammar rules to express them. More than language, what shapes their thoughts is their culture.There is also some debate about the fact that we change slightly, when we speak a foreign language. Much is said about languages that have masculine and feminine nouns and those that have not. Personally, I speak four languages quite fluently and I must confess I never noticed any major change of personality when I switch from Italian to English, to French or Portuguese. But maybe it is just me. The absence of ""gender"" in English nouns is actually much welcomed, since I must deal with random feminine and masculine in the other three languages I know.For those not familiar, I can assure you it is pretty annoying having to learn that ""la fleur"" is feminine in French and ""a viagem"" is feminine in Portuguese, while both are masculine in Italian (""il fiore"",""il viaggio""). The total lack of logic of assigning genders to nouns can be mind-blowing, but still does not interfere with the fact that when I see a flower I know it is a flower and not a cat – whether I think in Italian, French, English or Portuguese."
284,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,5,"This book uses three 'case studies' (colour, gender and spacial awareness) to look at how language affects our view of the world, our thinking and our memory.The first third of the book looks in depth at the history of the study of how colour is described by various international and classical cultures and how the differences have been (miss)interpreted by an assortment of learned gentlemen over the years. This gives a very nice springboard to the reader to see the types of pitfalls that such studies can fall into and prepare the ground for the second part of the book.The second section of the book goes into more depth on the subject of 'how can we study whether linguistic differences really affect our minds and the way they work?'. The Australian (and other) tribes that do all their directions in North, South, East and West rather than ever using left, right, in front or behind, were new to me and absolutely fascinating. Deutscher writes in an easily accessible style adding plenty of actual data from studies without letting it overwhelm the greater story. I felt that the arguments for and against certain viewpoints were well rehearsed in a relatively light hearted non-judgemental way that left one feeling enlightened and amused. This book has re-enforced my view that the human minds and human cultures are totally fascinating in their infintie variety, and left me looking for more non fiction in a similar vein. I have a few other books lined up. I hope they are as good. "
285,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"I enjoyed this book. The title for me was a bit misleading, at least for the first part of the book, which was mostly about out color sense and how we perceive colors and the role that language plays in that perception. I was not expecting this and so it threw me off a bit but the author’s excellent writing style quickly had me feeling at ease.About the writing style, it is relaxed and playful. The author is a punster and the book is littered with witty puns throughout (even the appendix has a pun thrown in) but this doesn’t take away from the excellent scientific research that is conveyed. I especially liked the second part of the book and the fascinating story of the Guugu Yimithirr, a group of native peoples whose language reflects the geography of the world. Where I (and most other people I know) use our bodies as the starting point for explaining directions to other people, the Guugu Yimithirr use the cardinal points of a compass, so that if I see a bug on your left foot I would state that, whereas a Guugu Yimithirr person would say that you have a bug on your ""West"" foot (if he was facing South and you were facing him.) This was amazing to me, and the author describes other equally fascinating cultures that use geography to describe the world. I have a lousy sense of direction but not so these other peoples, and this kind of thinking is not as rare as you would imagine.All in all, I feel this is an excellent book and would like to read it again to catch the things I missed. Highly recommended. "
286,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745423-simon,4,"One small criticism first: this was in some ways less far-ranging and comprehensive than I'd imagined, focussing on just three aspects of language and the perception of reality - colour, gender and spatial relations. And the sections on colour account for almost half the book. This can be forgiven as these are the only areas in which any serious and conclusive research has been done.But once you get past that narrowing of the scope, this is a still an eye-opening and enormously readble book, full of fascinating details and vividly described characters. What makes it work best is Deutscher's skill as a storyteller, with early sections tracing the historical development of theories about ancient Greeks' colour perception at times read like a particularly engrossing thriller (no, really). Deutscher is also a skilled prose writer, and not above slipping in the occasional linguistic witticism, but only where appropriate and never coming across as clever for its own sake.Highly recommended."
287,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Book about the way language influences the way we think -- and vice-versa. While the famous Sapir-Whorf thesis has been debunked (and is a bit of an embarrassment for linguists), in the end it seems that language and our thinking *do* have have some influence upon each other.I enjoyed the discussion of Homer and the weird usage of colors, and the way some Australian tribes use an absolute (well, with earth as the frame of reference) coordinate system rather than 'left of me', 'in front of me' etc.Also interesting was the discussion of the Matsés people of the Amazon. Their language has a built-in concept of evidentiality -- every time they say anything about anything, their language requires them to express the amount of evidence for the statement -- 'seen with my own eyes' until 'mere hearsay' paper. A great idea -- maybe we should import that concept in our languages as well?"

He gives a careful dissecting of Whorfianism and showing why he's not defending that (a good debate strategy, to be sure); however, other works argue that the evidence presented therein really does have cause and effect backwards (as far as language and thought). I would strongly recommend reading this in conjunction with Christine Kennealy's ""The First Word"" and Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought,"" and drawing your own conclusions, assuming of course you're a linguistics nerd and have a lot of time on your hands. This, you'll get through fairly quickly: Pinker especially, though, will take you some chewing."

295,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23180960-stephen-case,3,"It started with a conversation with a student, who said he had read an article explaining that the color blue never appeared in ancient Greek writings. That led to some internet searching, and I quickly found this book, which claims to be a treatment of this puzzle and turns out to be an explanation of the way language shapes the way we see the world. Do people who speak different languages actually see the world differently? Or in other words, how much does the structure of our language mirror or constrain the structure of our thought?Deutscher-- a linguist with an axe to grind against some of the contemporary views in the field-- starts the exploration of this question with its most interesting manifestation: color. The realization that there was something strange going on in ancient accounts of color goes back to the philhellene and sometimes Prime Minister William Gladstone who noticed that blue never appears in Homer's writings. The sea and sky are not referred to as blue, and other colors are also used in questionable ways. Other researchers into ancient texts discovered similar things: many ancient languages didn't have a word for blue. Indeed, there seemed to be a order of appearance in which ""primitive"" languages (and the author offers examples of some contemporary languages as well) distinguish between dark and light and lump all colors together as reddish. Eventually words for yellows and browns appear and finally terms that distinguish between greens and blues. The differentiation of blue usually comes last, and there are still signs of this, for instance, in the fact that in old Japanese the word for blue and green is the same.What does this mean? Early theories speculated that there was an actual physiological evolution taking place, that as humans became less primitive their eyes developed to perceive a wider spectrum of colors. Modern genetics and tests on speakers who languages currently lack certain color words has disproven this. Ancient Greek eyes were the same as ours. But did their lack of names for certain colors shape the way they perceived the world? This is the crux of the author's question: do we really see things if we don't have words to express them? I explored this once in a story published in Daily Science Fiction. Does naming something make it more real or at least more readily apparent?Part of the argument for color goes something like this. In primitive civilizations color doesn't matter a whole lot, and certain colors are rarely perceived on their own. Red is the color of blood, so a word to distinguish this comes fairly early in most cultures. But there are no large blue animals, few blue flowers, and blue dye was very difficult to make and unknown in many cultures. (Egypt was an exception, and apparently ancient Egyptian had a word for blue.) Because of this, there was no social or linguistic need to distinguish or name this hue. But what about the sea and the sky? The sea rarely looks straightforwardly blue, and the sky-- when completely clear-- was simply the sky. Since there was no cultural need to distinguish its color, it was simply the sky.The first half of the book is an investigation of the history of the color question, and if you're not quite satisfied with the answer I've given (and I'm not sure I am), you might not be satisfied with this portion of the book. For Deutscher though, color simply sets up the bigger question: how do we determine-- and then empirically test-- whether language actually shapes our perception and our thought processes? Are certain concepts (like ""The sky is blue"") simply inexpressible in some languages? Does this mean speakers of those languages are unable to conceive of certain statements and concepts? Deutscher's answer is no to these last two questions but a cautious yes to the first.An older, stronger claim would answer the final question of the above paragraph in the affirmative: language constrains thought. Because the Hopi Indians, for instance, have no verb tense in their language or expressions of time, they cannot perceive time as linear. Because other Native American languages do not distinguish between verb and subject, speakers of these languages have a more monistic, unified of nature. Deutscher disagrees and takes obvious pleasure in demolishing these claims, maintaining instead that any concept can be expressed in any language. His alternate claim is more subtle: it's not that some languages make it impossible to perceive or conceive certain things; rather, his claim is that certain languages obligate speakers to always be thinking of certain things.What does this mean? The author provides three examples. The first is that of a particular well-studied Australian aboriginal language that does not possess an egocentric coordinate system (i.e. behind, in front, left, right) but only an absolute system (north, east, south, west). Every positional expression voiced in this language, from things as simple as ""There's a bug beside your foot"" have to be given in terms of cardinal directions. (""There's a bug north of your foot."") This means that speakers of the language always have a sense of these directions from a very young age, and their experiences and memories are seen through that directional lens. The author discusses a variety of experiments in which it's shown that speakers of this language can recall details in this coordinate system, recounting orientations of experiences from years ago. (To put this in perspective, try calling up a particularly vivid memory and expressing it in terms of cardinal directions. Were you standing to the north or south of your spouse when you got married?) The language obligates its speakers to always have cardinal directions in mind and thus shapes their perceptions of the world accordingly.Languages with no egocentric coordinate system though are comparatively rare, so the author's second example is closer to home: languages like German or Spanish or many more with a developed gender system. In English-- at least since the century or so after the Norman Conquest, as the author points out in a fascinating historical treatment-- does not oblige its speakers to assign genders to inanimate objects. Yet many other modern languages do. Not much study has yet been done, according to Deutscher, on how this influences the thoughts of speakers of these languages, but he illustrates some of the implications with an example of the role this plays in translation and the subtle nuances and relations that can be lost moving from a gendered to a largely non-gendered language.Finally, he returns to color. Does our language's names for colors-- and the fact that these names don't exist in certain other languages-- influence the way we perceive the world? Recent studies, the author argues, indicate that yes, it does. He takes the case of light blue and dark blue, which in Russian have separate names. An English speaker would perceive these as shades of the same color. For a Russian speaker they would be separate colors. If this was indeed the case, one could expect that this linguistic obligation (that of the Russian speaker to give these separate hues different names) would allow Russians to more quickly distinguish between similar shades of blue if they lay on opposite sides of this distinction, in a similar manner to how an English speaker could more readily distinguish between greenish-blue and bluish-green than a speaker of a language that does not differentiate between green and blue. The author relates in detail the set-up of experiments to determine just that, which show the language-processing region of the brain active even when actively naming the hues was not part of the experiment. Russian speakers consistently differentiated between close shades of blue more quickly than English speakers.What does all this mean? It comes back to the central claim of the book, that languages, by obligating their speakers to pay attention to certain things in their structure, can function as a lens by which their speakers perceive the world.Consider this analogy (not given in the book): if your language has several different expressions for snow, so that each time you talk about snow you're obligated to take into consideration things like whether it's falling or on the ground, how long it's been on the ground, what its thickness and consistency is, then when you look at snow (or call up a memory containing snow) you're going to have a richer perception of the object than an English speaker who encapsulates all the varieties of snow under a single word. That doesn't mean that an English speaker can't conceptualize or express these nuances of snow. It just means her language doesn't habituate her to these perceptions.In these (possibly over-simplified) terms, Deutscher's argument seems almost self-evident, but the richness of his treatment comes in the historical and linguistic background he provides while exploring this idea and especially in his explanations of the rigor and structure of the experiments devised to verify such apparently straightforward claims about language and how it shapes our perceptions of the world."
296,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3514657-aya-zain,4,"The blurb of this book excited me so much. I've always wondered whether language has an influence on our intentions, our implications, and our culture. But Guy Deutscher made me think of the reverse scenario: that culture has had an impact on language, and that language is enforced every day thus leaving us no choice but to express ourselves in a somewhat outdated mode. Let me illustrate that further.I'm not sure what my mother tongue is. I'm of Arab descent, so it should be Arabic, however I was born and raised overseas where I focused on learning English instead. I became advanced in English and chose English as both a major and a minor for university, whereas my Arabic is intermediate to say the least. I can speak Arabic, but I always mess up the verb tenses -- feminine or masculine? So 'That table has a book on it' would turn into That (masculine) table (feminine) has a book on (feminine) it -- which is all incorrect, by the way! My Arabic just wasn't very good, and so I always confused the propositions and other articles.Arabic - like a few other languages - doesn't have gender neutrality, so that our every day language must determine what is masculine and what is feminine. And you can probably imagine that the more delicate inanimate objects usually took on the feminine form.Anyway - it goes further than that. And I once mentioned it to a high school classmate of mine in the 11th grade. I asked him: how come the verb conjugation of the plural masculine form gets a special (new and improved) conjugation, however the plural feminine verb conjugation is subjected to the same conjugation as the 'they' conjugation?He retaliated almost defensively, telling me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and that Arabic is the language of religion (Islam) and that I shouldn't challenge it because it is a flawless language. Which is exactly what is wrong with language -- he chose to take my argument personally as if it's offensive to his very nature. And that is exactly the problem.You can imagine how an every day reminder of what is feminine and what is masculine, or what is female and what is male has an impact on the way we perceive things. Take this for example: mowazafa (female office worker) and mowazaf (male office worker).Those involved in that sort of dialogue will have constant reminders to make gender distinctions, whether they like it or not. Their impressions are already preconceived when determining the nature of that thing they are referring to - be it female or male.I picked up on that because that's how I studied my subjects. I would put the information into images in my head and create a story, so it was easy to fall into the presumption that the feminine conjugation fell into the same category as the it conjugation due to sexist precursors.Arabic is not a flawless language. Arabic has stopped developing at one point in time, and refuses to change its methods to fit the modern-day society, and so people on some scale will be stuck expressing themselves in a language that doesn't fit a progressive society or lifestyle.If we try to think of ways to develop language so as to expand our neurological functions, we'll find that our cognitive abilities will also improve, thus making us smarter and more knowledgeable.I really like the examples that Deutscher drew out in his book, such as Guugu Yimithirr -- an Aboriginal Australian language that existed in Far North Queensland. They had the tendency to use the four cardinal directions (North, East, South, West) rather than egocentric coordinations (right, left, back and front). How does that make them see the world differently? They will never get lost. Even looking at Google Maps confuses me sometimes - am I supposed to turn a right or a left? However if my mind was brought up in the Gugu Ymithir community, I wouldn't have been so troubled as to figure out which direction to go. But then again, that could be just my terrible sense of direction.Another example was about the color blue. A mysterious color, in my opinion. It's barely seen in nature, yet it's everywhere. It's in the sky, it's in the sea that reflects the sky. However Deutscher mentions that when you take a look at Ancient literature, you'll find that the color blue is never mentioned. The sea is described as the color of wine, and the sky is not seen as blue. In daylight, it's white, and at night it's black. The word blue just wasn't necessary back then. However, now blue is everywhere, and the sky is just about as blue as the sea. We have so much blue that the Russians have not one, but two names for the color blue. They have two color distinctions that the average English speaker would call blue, but they call Siniy and Goluboy.  When taken in for experiments, it was found that the Russian speakers were able to distinguish between all colors faster than the English speakers did. This ability to perceive colors in a different way, while seeing the same colors, shows that language could really transform our potentials and increase our capabilities.Language is a dangerous weapon if not handled correctly. There has been no example of this though, so don't take my word on it. But I think that we can utilize language if we work on it meticulously to shape the society and the future that we want.Thanks Deutscher for such an informative book! There are so many great references in this book, and I was left with a lot more information on language than I had before."

That being said, at times this books felt a bit condescending. The tone that Mr. Deutscher uses comes across poorly, although I think it is unintentional. The condescending tone does not take away from the merit of the book, but it often left me feeling distracted by it."
298,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116092820-meg-briers,4,"A good read exploring how our mother tongue may be affecting our perceptions of colour, gender and space/coordinate system. A nice crossover between the fields of linguistics and psychology that really made you think about language and how it's having an influence on your day to day life. Very informative and gave a lot of new information without making the language too inaccessible as many other similar books seem to do, quite a nice gentle read!"
299,080508195X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"Guy Deutscher's Through the Language Glass, which looks at the relationship between language, culture and perception, wasn't quite what I'd expected. Honestly, I'd expected a variation of that old chestnut on the Eskimos having a gazillion words for the concept of ""snow"", to explain how our environment and culture shapes the language we speak. Deutscher's book surpassed those expectations. There are a few painful moments in the book, when Deutscher attempts to make some witty puns (this is a book on language after all). Wannabe gems like ""In their pronouncements on language, culture and thought, it seems that big thinkers in their grandes oeuvres have not always risen much above little thinkers over their hors d'oeuvres."" Or how about ""All the facts mentioned so far about the cones in the retina are correct to the best of my knowledge. But if you are under the impression that they actually explain our sensation of colour, then you have been coned!"" Do I detect some eye rolling here? But things look up once Deutscher gets serious. Dismissing many of the common fallacies or accepted wisdoms in linguistics - like how all languages are equally complex (how does one measure complexity? how do you trade off complexity in morphology against complexity in syntax, grammar rules, etc?) - Deutscher makes a tight and convincing case for what we can conclude about language. We can summarise the main thrusts of this case with the following 3 points:1. While nature may set the boundaries of how we perceive and relate to the world (it doesn't make sense to use the same word to describe red dogs and red roses for instance), culture significantly influences how we navigate within those boundaries. A more refined colour vocabulary, or one that emphasises hue over brightness, will lead to differences in how colours are named and classified. 2. Languages vary considerable in the amount of information they convey within words - e.g. tense, person performing the action, singularity/plurality, distance, etc. There is an inverse correlation between the complexity of society and word structure as communication among intimates often allows more compact, terse ways of expressing oneself. Conversely, the greater the number of speakers, more explicit markers for providing context (e.g. prepositions, subordinate clauses) are required and simplification through bastardisation of the language also occurs. 3. Language influences us not so much in what we are allowed to think but in the ""kinds of information each language habitually obliges [us] to think about"", from the way we see spatial relationships, to the attributes that we associate objects with (depending on whether one's language assigns a gender to that object). ""When a language forces its speakers to pay attention to certain aspects of the world each time they open their mouths or prick up their ears, such habits of speech can eventually settle into habits of mind with consequences for memory, or perception, or associations, or even practical skills"". There are many things in Deutscher's book that are thought provoking. But perhaps the point that struck me the most was just how much gets lost in translation, when the associations we make with certain words just disappear when transplanted into another linguistic framework. As Deutscher notes: ""But if you native speakers of English are tempted to feel sorry for those of us who are shackled by the heavy load of an irrational gender system, then think again. I would never want to change places with you...my world has so much to it that you entirely miss out on, because the landscape of my language is so much more fertile than your arid desert of 'it's'. It goes without saying that genders are language's gift to poets. Heine's masculine pine tree longs for the feminine palm; Boris Pasternak's My Sister Life can only work because 'life' is feminine in Russian; English translations of Charles Beaudelaire's 'L'homme et la mer', however inspired, can never hope to capture the tempestuous relationship of attraction and antagonism that he evokes between 'him' (the man) and 'her' (the sea); nor can English do justice to Pablo Neruda's 'Ode to the Sea', in which the (masculine) el mar strikes a stone (una piedra) and then 'he caresses her, kisses her, drenches her, pounds his chest, repeating his own name' - the English 'it caresses it, kisses it, drenches it, pounds its chest' is not quite the same."""
