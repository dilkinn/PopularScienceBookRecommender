You can love his as a scientist, as a man, as a genius, as a teacher, as an iconoclast. He is the real deal.  'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' is a series of 13 speeches, articles, essays, interviews by or with Richard Feynman. These are guilty pleasure reads for people who adore those great physicists of the early 2oth centuries who were lucky AND brilliant enough to be physicists when physics jumped from classical to quantum. These guys were amazing. Feynman wasn't among the first wave of theoretical physicists to dance in the quantum space, but he was a huge member of the second wave.The thing that makes Feynman so interesting is just his unpretentious quirkiness, his love of telling stories, his ability to quickly grasp the root of a problem (whether in physics, biology, or religion) and give you an honest answer. The only drawback to this collection is it repeats several stories. Feynman retold many of his favorite stories (locks at Los Alamos) or ideas (cargo cult science). So if you've read Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character or Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman many of these stories have been heard before. Even inside of this book a couple stories get retold a bit. It is unavoidable, but still a bit of a draw back.Anyway, this isn't a deep dive into science. It is a flirtation with the curiosity that drives scientists. It is the recollections of one of the most fascinating characters to come out of the Manhattan Project and the post-quantum revolution period of physics. So, if you haven't read much on Feynman I might recommend reading 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!' first, but I'd still not neglect to check this out as well."
1,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,3,"Here's the problem with having high expectations: they're so often dashed.In my years trawling the web and being a science nerd, I've heard a lot about Richard Feynman. There are legends about him, that he was the Puck of physics - brilliant, untamed, and really, really funny. When I got the book, I was expecting to read a lightning-quick volley of ideas that would set my mind alight with the wonder and infinite possibilities continued within a lifetime's pursuit of science.Yeah, that didn't quite happen.Don't get me wrong - Feynman is indisputably brilliant, and far from the classic mold of the physicist. He had no patience for titles or honors, and in fact couldn't give a damn about them as long as he had science to do. He would tell Nobel laureates - men whose names were bywords for scientific brilliance - that they were wrong, without hedging or worrying about their egos. He liked to play the bongos, loved a good party, and delighted in playing tricks. One of his more irritating hobbies was safe-cracking, and by the time he left Los Alamos labs after the Manhattan Project there were no places left to hide secrets from Feynman.So Feynman was no doubt a really cool guy, the kind of scientist you would want to invite to your party without hesitation. His first interest was science, and as scientist go, he was one of the best.That doesn't mean that reading him is entirely entertaining.The book is, for me, not very readable for two reasons. The first is that it goes get terribly technical at times, and while I love science, I am not educated enough in it to grasp a lot of the technical details. Indeed, it broke my heart when Feynman said that, when it comes to physics, if you don't know the math, you don't know the science. True, yes. Humbling, yes. But still.... Were I editing a collection of Feynman's work, I would have started with the Big Ideas, defenses of science as an integral function of humanity's ultimate progress. Then, having made the reader comfortable with how Feynman thought, they could have gotten into what Feynman thought.But no, the book starts of with highly technical lectures on quantum electrodynamics and the difficulties in getting parallel computers to work. If you don't know a lot about how computers work, or you don't have a detailed awareness of atomic theory, you're going to be a little lost. Or a lot lost. Even his minority opinion on the Challenger accident, something I was especially keen to read, was far too dry to be enjoyable.The second reason why I didn't really enjoy this book is because a lot of it is transcripts of speeches and interviews. Very few people are able to speak in a readable manner, and someone with a mind like Feynman's - always moving, always active - isn't one of them. There are a lot of asides and false starts, wandering thoughts and truncated paragraphs. Even his more structured speeches aren't structured very well for the reader. Perhaps it would be different to listen to him, to sit in the audience and watch the man speak. I reckon that he had the kind of infectious energy and enthusiasm that would make it easy to gloss over structural problems and really enjoy the speech. But turning speech into print is always dangerous, and here I think it fails.For different people - people who are deeply involved in physics or who are Feynman acolytes - this book is probably a fascinating look into the mind of one of the 20th century's greatest scientists. For the rest of us, we're going to have to find other things to enjoy from the text, and it is there. One of those is, indeed, the title of the book - the pleasure of finding things out.For Feynman, science wasn't a rigor or a job, it was a joy. He attributes a lot of that attitude to his father, an unlikely fan of science. As a uniform salesman, Feynman's father was not a scientist and had no scientific training. But he raised his son to think about the world. Rather than tell him why, for example, a bird picked at its feathers with its beak, encouraged Richard to observe the bird, to form a hypothesis and then see if observations confirmed it. His father taught him to question everything, to form his own opinions about the world, and by doing so, made him into a scientist from an early age.It is that attitude which should be the dominant theme of this book, rather than Feynman's technical genius. He says, over and over, to doubt everything. Ask yourself why things are the way they are, rather than just relying on what other people tell you. Observe, experiment and test, and you're doing science.He has some disdain for social sciences, and a pretty healthy dose of misogyny in a couple of places, but if he is arrogant, then it is probably deserved. Feynman was a man fascinated with how the universe worked, all the way down to its smallest components, and that was his passion. Not awards, not titles, not praise - just the work, the discovery and the pleasure."
2,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/777050-andrew-martin,2,"Whatever your opinion of Feynman, you need to reconcile the fact that he's got unbearably retrograde opinions:""When I was at Cornell, I was rather fascinated by the student body, which seems to me was a dilute mixture of some sensible people in a big mass of dumb people studying home economics, etc, including lots of girls. I used to sit in the cafeteria with the students and eat and try to overhear their conversations and see if there was one intelligent word coming out. You can imagine my surprise when I discovered a tremendous thing, it seemed to me. I listened to a conversation between two girls, and one was explaining that if you want to make a straight line, you see, you go over a certain number to the right for each row you go up, that is, if you go over each time the same amount when you go up a row, you make a straight line. A deep principle of analytic geometry! It went on. I was rather amazed. I didn't realize the female mind was capable of understanding analytic geometry.She went on and said, 'Suppose you have another line coming in from the other side and you want to figure out where they are going to intersect.' Suppose on one line you go over two to the right for every one you go up, and the other line goes over three to the right for every one that it goes up, and they start twenty steps apart, etc.-I was flabbergasted. She figured out where the intersection was! It turned out that one girl was explaining to the other how to knit argyle socks.I, therefore, did learn a lesson: The female mind is capable of understanding analytic geometry. Those people who have for ears been insisting (in the face of all obvious evidence to the contrary) that the male and female are equal and capable of rational thought may have something. The difficulty may just be that we have never yet discovered a way to communicate with the female mind. If it is done in the right way, you may be able to get something out of it."" (p. 175-76, which is somewhat hilariously indexed as ""Geometry"")This is pretty ugly even for 1966.Hard to reconcile that this is the same guy who espouses""I don't believe in the idea that there are a few peculiar people capable of understanding math, and the rest of the world is normal. Math is a human discovery, and it's no more complicated than humans can understand"" (194) - until you realize when he says people he means men."
3,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,4,"In my opinion, Richard Feynman was and will remain the most charismatic scientist ever. His lectures are a joy to listen. We need more people/professors like him, to induce in children love for nature, science and curiosity about all the wonders around us.This book contains some of his most popular lectures, and many of them can be seen in the documentary with the same name, which I wholeheartedly recommend. His enthusiasm and love for nature, science, music and life are contagious and you’ll enjoy it immensely.If you’re new to Feynman, you may choose either this one or 
Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character
; it is almost the same book, with the same lectures. I enjoyed the latter more due to the way it was structured, but nonetheless, I very much liked rereading them here."
4,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Feynman is brilliant, arrogant and emotionally cold. He was the youngest brilliant mind working on the atomic bomb in Los Alamos in the 1940's and later won the Nobel Prize in physics. This book is an unintegrated collection of essays, transcripts of speeches, interviews and memoirs. As such it gets repetitive. We hear three or four times about how his father taught him to observe and we hear three or four times the identical story about the Cargo Cults in New Guinea after WW II. His father, who was not a scientist, turned out to be an excellent teacher specializing in teaching his son to learn by observing. Feynman and his school buddies also had basement ""workshops"" so that helped their intellectual development. It's fun to see a mind at work, punching the envelope, too undisciplined and too powerful to be contained within a skull."
5,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7691619-jj,4,"I love this man. He is brilliant, seems humble, and funny as hell. This is an excellent collection of some of his ideas and stories, mostly about his life experiences and how he became who he was. Even if you do not have a good understanding of physics or even math you will still enjoy this book. It is not a tractate or a manual but rather a collections of anecdotal stories and interviews that allow anyone to take a peek into the mind of this true badass."
6,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53458752-scot-parker,4,"This book is a compilation of some of Dr. Feynman's more notable writings and talks from over the years. I imagine it was a daunting task (even for Feynman himself) to choose which 300 pages of his work to include, given his brilliance and his storied life, but I found the collection here to be an excellent representation of many of the more notable adventures of Feynman's life and some of his more interesting ideas. Of course, only a fraction of his body of work could be included here.There is some overlap with other works, mostly with ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"": Further Adventures of a Curious Character. I didn't find that this detracted from the book, however. This work is fundamentally different in its aim; ""What Do You Care..."" comes across as a bit of an addendum to Feynman's first biography, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, and a bit of a stand-alone biography, although particularly focused on a couple of periods of Feynman's life rather than his life as a whole, while this book is first and foremost a collection of notable lectures and writings. The stories that overlap between these works tend to be, in my opinion, notable enough that they bear repeating, such as the method through which Feynman learned what the ""valve"" symbol was on a particular set of blueprints, or how people working on the Manhattan Project were able to access important files in locked filing cabinets while the cabinets' owner(s) was away.Unfortunately, nobody is free from flaws, and perhaps Feynman's most notable flaw in my opinion was his sexism; this shows through in a couple places in this book, so be aware.Overall, I strongly recommend this book, though I suggest starting with ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character. Feynman, despite his flaws, was a fascinating, brilliant person, lived a storied life, and came up with quite a few brilliant, world-changing ideas across a variety of academic disciplines. He is worth reading about."
7,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,4,"For those who might not know, Richard Feynman was a Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicist, canny self-promoter and renowned teacher who worked on the Manhatten Project before he had even finished his Doctoral Thesis. Many books by and about him have been published and he has become a kind of miniature industry since his death; almost anybody who attended one of his lectures and scribbled some notes has tried to get them published, there are biographies and a volume of letters, CDs of impromtu drumming - the list goes on...I was put off reading this book for several years by the fact that ""all but one"" chapter had been published elsewhere; I was figuring I already owned most of its contents.That turned out to be wrong; although published, most of these essays, anecdotes and lectures had not seen the mainstream and fewer than 6 of them had I read before. Unfortunately some of the material covers territory that is widely available elsewhere and hence adds nothing in terms of ideas or anecdotes for the Feynman fan of long standing.The material that was entirely new to me was interesting and made the book worthwhile on its own, but a characteristic of this book is that Feynman's own voice comes through strongly, unfiltered through editors and that made even familiar stories interesting. Feynman's voice comes through because many of the pieces are transcriptions of talks or interviews he gave. The book also covers a wide range from the silly stories to the serious science to the discussions on the nature and ethics of science.Feynman fans should read it and people who want to know what the Feynman Fuss is about could do worse than start here."
8,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3817259-frances,4,"OH MAN I LOVE YOU RICHARD FEYNMAN.While significantly more technical than Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! I still really appreciated the writing and his insights into the physical universe. I feel like more teenagers should read Feynman - he believes so strongly in LIVING and THINKING and WORKING while still enjoying oneself that he could do so much good for that age bracket. Also, as an aside - can you even imagine the conversations between this guy and Neil Degrasse Tyson? CAN YOU. "
9,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"Richard Feynman is a founder of Quantum Field theory and among the greatest physicists of the 20th century. He is also an interesting and irreverent personality. Reading him is refreshing and his mercurial skepticism is and down to earth style make him fun to read. He covers personal anecdotes like safecracking at Los Alamos, to his report on the space shuttle and some interesting science talks two of which for saw miniturization as the path forward for computers and see a future in what is called nanotechnology today. Definitely fun to read this down to earth genius."
10,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Brilliance and charm: Feynman as a teacherI very much enjoyed this entertaining and delightful collection of lectures, talks and essays by the world-renown and sorely missed Professor Feynman, Nobel Prize winning physicist, idiosyncratic genius and one of the great men of the twentieth century.I particularly enjoyed the subtle yet unmistakable way he scolded the people at NASA for putting their political butts before the safety of the space program they were managing in his famous ""Minority Report to the Space Shuttle Challenger Inquiry."" But the chapter that really sold me on Richard P. Feynman, boy wonder grown up, was ""It's as Simple as One, Two, Three"" in which he explores the ability to do two things at once through an experiment with counting. Such a delight he took in learning as a kid from his friend Bernie that we sometimes think in pictures and not in words. And then the further delight he took in learning that some people count with their inner voice (himself), and others (his friend John Tukey) count by visualization. I was also loved the chapter, ""What is Science?"", a talk to science teachers in which Feynman demonstrates that the real difference between science and other ways of ""knowing"" (e.g., religion) is the ability to doubt. In science we learn, as Feynman said he himself learned, to live with doubt. But in the religious way of ""knowing"" doubt is intolerable. Feynman gives an evolutionary illustration of why doubt is essential. He begins with the ""intelligent"" animals ""which can learn something from experience (like cats)."" At this stage, he says, each animal learned ""from its own experience."" Then came some animals that could learn more rapidly and from the experience of others by watching. Then came something ""completely new...things could be learned by one animal, passed on to another, and another, fast enough that...[the knowledge:] was not lost to the race...,"" and could be passed on to a new generation.Now, let's stop for a moment. What a great teacher does--and here and elsewhere Feynman proves himself to be a great teacher (although he said he doubted that!)--is to guide the student just enough so that the student arrives at or anticipates the point of the lesson before the teacher gets there. What is the punch line of this lesson for the science teachers? Namely this: with the passing of knowledge from one generation to the next it became also possible to pass on false knowledge or ""mistaken ideas."" Feynman calls this a ""disease.""""Then a way of avoiding the disease was discovered. This is to doubt that what is being passed from the past is in fact true, and to try to find out ab initio, again from experience, what the situation is, rather than trusting the experience of the past...""In other words, don't blindly accept the word of authority. Test it for yourself! And this is what science does. It tests and it tests again, and it doubts and it doubts--always. I loved this because one of my dictums is ""always guide the experts""--the lawyer, the doctor, the insurance adjustor, et al. Always guide them because, although they are the experts, you're the one who really cares. To this I can now add that you should also doubt the experts because even though they are experts they can be wrong. And, as Feynman showed in his report on the Challenge disaster, they can be wrong for reasons that have nothing to do with their expertise.I also liked the commencement address he gave at Caltech on ""Cargo Cult Science...and How to Not Fool Yourself."" We fool ourselves a lot. The managers at NASA fooled themselves; what's their names of cold fusion delusion fame fooled themselves. Feynman has noted that he has fooled himself. Science, he avers, is a tool to help us to not fool ourselves. He is profoundly right. Without science we would go on fooling ourselves with all sorts of mumbo-jumbo, ""revealed"" religiosity and scientific-seeming stuff such as Rhine's ESP experiments some years ago at Duke, the entire litany of New Age pseudobabblese, and--yes!--such stuff as the amazing Cargo Cult Science in which some Pacific Islanders, in an attempt to attract the big birds of the sky with their cargoes of goodies, built ""nests,"" that is, landing fields with empty cargo boxes, and faux towers, etc. in the hope that the planes flying overhead would see them and land on their island. Feynman has taken this as an example of pseudoscience, that is, behavior in the form of science without the substance of science, without the ""integrity"" of science.The integrity of science, Feynman advised the graduates, demands that all the information about the experiment be given, even detrimental facts. Feynman contrasts this idea with that of advertizing in which only that which makes the product look good is given.When reading this book it helps to imagine that one is listening to Feynman speak. The text includes repetitions and the omissions which he no doubt conveyed with his voice, expression or gesture. When one reads him this way, some of Feynman's endearing charm and the gentle, self-effacing humor for which he is famous comes through. Here's a joke from pages 206-207: He is at Esalen in a hot bath with another man and a girl. The man begins to massage the girl's foot. He feels something in her big toe. He asks his instructor, ""Is that the pituitary?"" The girl says, ""No, that's not the way it feels."" Feynman injects, ""You're a hell of a long way from the pituitary, man."" And they both look at him. ""I had blown my cover, you see--and she said, It's reflexology. So I closed my eyes and appeared to be meditating."" Yes, Feynman is a long way from reflexology. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
11,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,4,"Richard Feynman is one of my heroes, and this short, very accessible book compiles some of his most engaging writings, as well as a couple of interviews and the report he wrote on the space shuttle Challenger disaster. It's not as biographical as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character or as technical as Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics By Its Most Brilliant Teacher, and I think this would be a good place to start for anyone interested in learning about this fascinating man. This collection highlights throughout Feynman's deeply-held belief that doubt should be at the heart of good science. It also reveals his quirky, inquisitive character--I particularly love his explanation of how he learned to pick combination locks. For further reading, I also recommend Tuva or Bust!: Richard Feynman's Last Journey, which is funny and sad at the same time.The Pleasure of Finding Things Out was compiled nearly twenty years ago, and part of the charm is seeing which of Feynman's predictions came true, and where science has gone since the late twentieth century. Overall, though, I like seeing how Feynman thought--and doing a little check to see how well my understanding of science holds up."
12,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28112297-nico-scagliarini,3,"I have always been wary of scientists and scientific literature, because being apparently the ""artsy"" type I have been struggling with hard sciences my whole life: I always found them fascinating and scary at the same time and I only managed to make peace with Mathematics a few years ago. Never with Physics or Chemistry, and I always thought people who do them for a living were some kind of aliens. And they are (and so one more fond of science might say about artists), but after reading this book I can say that Feynman's way of thinking is simply brilliant, revolutionary and unique. It does not relate pretty much to anything else but his curiosity for what he calls ""the wonders of the world"", therefore in its uniqueness it's also not too far away from the artist's point of view. Feynman looked for answers he was aware he might not find, he was also aware of his potential and one might not agree with some of his ideas about gender equality (women do not strike him as smart creatures), religion (he does believe in God, despite not in the traditional/christian way) and morals (he kept on working on the development of the atomic bomb after Nazis had long gone) but there is no denying that trying to see the world through his eyes is enlightening. Some parts of the book are very technical and especially towards the end his thoughts and his way of expressing them are repeated in an almost redundant way, but this can easily be forgiven considering that the book it was not written by him but is a collection of transcripts of his speech and interviews."

NO Dr.Feynman, don't do it please !I will investigate the world without defining it !  -- Although what I think about his last articles, I've really enjoyed with him his anecdotes, childhood stories, and his justified positions about "" titles, uniforms, prizes, ..

There is a marked difference in the way people talk about something when they enjoy doing the thing and are good at it than when they don't enjoy it very much. That is very noticeable in this book. Feynman has a way of making his sense of wonder and the hunger of understanding things very contagious. The biggest takeaway that a person not involved in the sciences can get from this book is a solid understanding of what is and what is not science.What makes the book a bit difficult to read is that the book is almost a direct transcription of his speeches - which means the prose is less than exemplary.. Feynman's rambling style of speaking, with omissions and repetitions here and there do not make for an easy reading experience."

I’ve met Feynman several years ago on mine. Among all other physicist Feynman was the one most distinctively standing out as he was the one who could do the best job of familiarizing the layman with the ways of nature and things hard to grasp intuitively. I also like Sagan, but I found him more like inspirational guy, Feynman was one with magnificent explanations. A lot of that stuff can be found on youtube, but maybe the most precious fruits of his work I found in Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics By Its Most Brilliant Teacher and Six Not-So-Easy Pieces: Einstein's Relativity, Symmetry, and Space-Time. For anyone wanting to get better understanding of physics and acquiring basics those are invaluable-do-not-miss. This book, although not bad, is not what you would want to get out of him. It will offer you glance at his personality, life and way of thinking but Feynman’s real treasure is in him talking physics. This one can be viewed as desert after getting main dish. Nevertheless I liked it, because it is impossible not to like his genius and personality. Once again he motivated me to go and dive deeper in wonders of universe."

I had some expectations based on some of the stories I heard and his general fame, but the actual Feynman turned to be much deeper and interesting than just those glimpses in popular myths.The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is going to give you just that. Through the speeches and essays in this book you will see the workings of an extraordinary mind and learn much about the process of science and its place in our world. You will witness historic events, such as the construction of the first atom bomb, meet famous physicists, such as Einstein, Fermi, Bohr, and others, and hear ideas which kickstarted whole fields of science, such as nanotechnology and parallel computing. And as a side effect, you'll find out one way to raise your kid to be a scientist, and learn a bit about the art of safecracking.All in all, this was a truly inspirational read, and I can't recommend it enough."

Some of the stories are entertaining, some show a brilliant scientific mind at work, and some provide thought-provoking insights into the role of science in society. Still there is an inelegance to the whole thing. Most of the pieces are from lectures, talks, and interviews that Feynman gave at one time or another, and while I'm sure he is an engaging speaker, they don't transfer to the page all that well. There are also various repetitions of Feynman's pet ideas, which lose a bit of their luster when repeated more than once. I enjoyed it but not as much as I hoped I would."

There is some overlap in the stories between these two works (and apparently in his other more famous work Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!). I continue to enjoy the perspective that Feynman brings to life. He wants to better understand the world and enjoys solving problems, getting a ""kick out of the discovery"" of a solution that others can use. Feynman embraces doubt/uncertainty as the basis for understanding the world. Because without it we don't ask questions and thus leave no room for progress or learning. science is not finding out the truth... but that this or [that] is more or less likely ... to different degrees of certaintyFeynman's epistemology is rooted in the idea: we can't know anything with certainty. He goes so far as to answer the question ""what is science"" with doubt. A doubt that must include the theories that scientists advocate.science is the belief in the ignorance of expertsThis uncertainty is part of his idea of ""scientific morality"". A view in which ideas/beliefs are evaluated, evidence is examined, and findings are presented with integrity. This integrity requires including known problems and challenges to the theory/idea being advocated for. This scientific morality is contrasted with the untested/unproven ideas of pseudoscience, the propoganda of advertising and politics, and with ""religion"" which values absolute certainty. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.The stories about his experiences at Los Alamos working on the atomic bomb was fascinating. In this part of the book, we see Feynman's approach to wrestling with ideas. I'm dumb about one thing. I never knew who I was talking to. I was always worried about the physics. If the idea looked lousy, I said it looked lousy. If the ideas looked good, I said it looked good. Simple proposition. I've always lived that way.His willingness to approach ideas in this way was appreciated by Niels Bohr. when I hear about physics, I just think about physics, and I don’t know who I’m talking to, so I say dopey things like “no, no, you’re wrong,” or “you’re crazy.” But it turned out that’s exactly what [Bohr] needed. ... [Feynman] is the only guy who's not afraid of me and will say when I've got a crazy idea. So next time we need to discuss ideas we [need to] get that guy first This ""scientific morality"" (which is really an approach that values philosophical integrity and critical thinking) is brought out further when Feynman urges the importance of being ""less polite"" in discussing opposing views. By engaging in discussion we have to defend our views. And when we are defending our views it requires learning more about the views that one disagrees with. Further, discussions about different ideas should help us avoid cognitive dissonance, requiring us to evaluate the potentially competing ideas we might hold together as true. I believe we should demand that people try in their own minds to obtain for themselves a more consistent picture of their own world. That they not permit themselves the luxury of ... never trying to compare the two points of view because we have learned that by trying to put the points of view that we have in our head together and comparing one to the other we make some progress in our understanding...And while he doesn't seem to have much room for religion, in part due to his epistemology, he offers the following:I do not believe that science can disprove the existence of God; I think that is impossible. And if it is impossible, is not a belief in science and in a God — an ordinary God of religion — a consistent possibility? Yes, it is consistent. Feynman sees the conflict between science and religion at the level of metaphysics. Why? Because they can arrive at different answers to the same questions. However, he argues that science and the morality of religion can coexist. This is because science can't answer moral questions like ""should I do this?"" Science can only say what will happen if you do it.science can be defined as a method for, and a body of information obtained by, trying to answer only questions which can be put into the form: If I do this, what will happen"
27,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,4,"""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"" is a collection of speeches, lectures, and published papers of one of the greatest physicists in the 20th century, Richard P. Feynman's. If you have read his autobiography ""Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feynman"", you'll be familiar with his curiosity and playful characters, cracking safes, playing pranks on colleagues, and observing his surrounding no matter how mad he might appear to other people. ""I'm not responsible for what other people think I am able to do,"" he said, ""I don't have to be good because people think I'm going to be good.""However, I personally have some problems with this book. Despite his enthusiasm in some of the chapters in the book, quite a number of technical issues are beyond my ability to comprehend. Those lectures were delivered to audience that had medium to high scientific literacy, which is why an ordinary reader like me found it very challenging to digest those ideas. I've noticed three important, but complicated speeches on three different special occasions: first is the investigation on Challenger Space Shuttle disaster, the moment that haunted NASA as well as forced them to be more careful in their future missions; second is nanotechnology, which Feynman himself was one of the pioneers; and third, the speech related to quantum electrodynamic, the subject that won him a Nobel Prize. Heaven knows how much I want to understand the science behind those speeches!In spite of those technical stuffs, readers could learn a great deal about his way of learning science, his standpoint on the relationship between science and religions, etc. Feynman repeatedly reminisced his father involvement in his early scientific experience. Although not being a scientist himself, Feynman's father was eager to show his son how to observe, question, and breaking up the knowledge of their surroundings into comprehensible information.I love his stand on science. ""The first way in which science is of value is familiar to everyone,"" he reasoned, ""It is that scientific knowledge enables us to do all kinds of things and to make all kinds of things. Of course if we make good things, it is not only to the credit of science; it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work. Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad–but it does not carry instructions on how to use it. Such power has evident value–even though the power may be negated by what one does."""
28,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213820-chad,3,"I really enjoyed reading my first book by Richard Feynman. The only problem is, this isn't really a book by Richard Feynman. It's a collection of some of his speeches, along with (what has to be only a portion? of) his Minority Report on the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster. Feynman is brilliant and has a quirky sense of humor and playfulness, and that comes out in his speeches. But it felt like some of the rigor of his scientific prowess was missing, simply because the format of a speech is so different from the format of a book. That said, I wouldn't recommend you specifically avoid this book because of that, but if you are going to read it, you should go into it knowing that its feel tends toward the incohesive and the extemporaneous rather than the methodical and structured. This is a great way to get a feel for his personality, though, which you probably wouldn't get with a normal book. So if you read it, plan on picking it up here and there and diving into a chapter at a time. It's enjoyable.I especially liked reading about his perspectives on what science is, and how he was introduced to the concept of science as a child. He praises his father for asking him questions, and then, no matter the answer that Richard gave back, examining through observation and comparing to Richard's hypothesis. He talks about his ability to accept the fact that he might not know something, and how that wasn't just ""not bad,"" but rather it was useful as a way to approach science without preconceived ideas of the results. Maybe that was just something that felt especially attractive to me because of where I am in my life right now, but it really impressed me that he has lived most of his life that way."
29,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21430140-jerry,5,"I think it’s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I’m not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don’t know anything about…This is a collection of “the best short works of Richard P. Feynman”. As such, if you’ve read Feynman’s two biographical works, a couple of the chapters there are reproduced here, and many of the stories from there are told in different form here. I recognized quite a bit from the other two books.It also reprints an interview he did with Omni that I may well have read at the time, but don’t remember anymore. I don’t remember when I started to read Omni, and I don’t know where, if they still exist, my copies are.And there are several pieces I’ve not read at all before. If you’re a fan of Feynman’s writings, you’ll probably find this a rewarding read, even if you skip over parts. If you haven’t read Feynman yet, this is a great place to start. It covers a wide variety of topics, showcases his unique humor, much of it scientifically self-deprecating, and especially focuses on the scientific viewpoint, of the necessity of doubt so that you don’t end up fooling yourself, “because you are the easiest person to fool.”That is essential to progress, both scientific and social."
30,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77291875-ramu-vairavan,4,"This is a fine collection of Feynman's lectures, interviews and writing that introduces us to the man, scientist and Nobel laureate. Through his stories, Feynman paints an enigmatic character out of his father that rivals his own. And so we really get to meet two interesting people.A few things I gathered from this collection: Feynman is all about ideas. He plays with them like a child plays with toys. His imagination is vast, he dreamed up advancements in nanotechnology decades before they were made. He's very gutsy too, not afraid to ask questions. He's a serial fun-seeker, and he saw much pleasure in figuring things out. This is evident in his little adventures and funny anecdotes, of which I found his lock picking exploits at Los Alamos and his story about turning himself into a lab rat in a counting experiment memorable.One grudge I have is that brilliant people often don't talk enough to share their thoughts with us while others talk too much without being asked. Feynman distinguished himself as being both brilliant and vocal. His take on scientific matters was fresh in his day and is still so.Would recommend this book to folks who like getting to know other curious folks, Feynman definitely was one. It may get a little repetitive as Feynman rehashes stories at different occasions, but there's still good material in there - a good mix of technical and non-technical pieces from a range of topics/settings."
31,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,5,"This book has helped me understand better the highly intellectual man, Richard Feynman, whom I have come to love so very much. This compilation of talks, interviews, and lectures throw light on Feynman's work, ideas, relationships, and philosophy. The essay 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' shows the inception of Feynman's disposition to science and the didactic relationship with his father, while 'Los Alamos from Below' shows his playful relationship with his wife, and how he constantly tries to push boundaries. 'It's as simple as One, Two, Three' shows his curious and restless nature, his love for experimenting absurdities, and his need for proving or disproving things. Many of the more scientific essays involve his ideas and thoughts on computing machines, improving efficiencies, and trying to constantly challenge science.The essays I enjoyed the most had more philosophical undertones and covered the topics of religion, pseudoscience, the value and role of science. His approach to the untruths and the half-truths is empathetic, and he strongly encourages deeper exploration and uprooting rather than dismissing them on the face of it. His attitude to the unknown is very easy on the conscience, and seems to be what keeps him going actively.A few essays have redundant points and incidents, but as an admirer of the queer and wise Feynman, it was my pleasure to indulge in the repeats."

33,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43687-elena,4,"Like my affinity for Harold Bloom, Richard Feynman can do no wrong in my book. He was a man that thought outside the box, and was ahead beyond the technology of his time. However, what left the most lasting impression in this book is when Feynman turns into a bit of a philosopher and it made me think for days.Feynman discusses the Heritages of Western Civilization:Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientifice spirit of adventure- the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it-the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics- the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual- the humility of the spirit. How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of Western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem our time?It is this question that has left me after reading all of his lectures. "

I did not know a lot about Feynman before reading it ,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.I really loved Feynman's view of the world , the way he saw things and how he talked about what he liked , one could easily feel his passion ,the genuineness of his words, the genius mind he had. the only problem was that it was too ""scientific"" for me at some points ,thus this ""non scientific"" review , but that is not the book's fault.I have to say though that I didn't necessarily agree with everything he said , but overall I liked his points of view , and how he expressed them, and had a lot of fun reading them."

That book was deep, thoughtful, inspirational.This book isn't bad, definitely, but the format is slightly different. Because the book consists of a set of interviews, the narration is not that smooth, different ""chapters"" has similar ideas just because each chapter is just a speech that Mr Faynman gave at some time. And of course, they won't be that deep either.I would say that if you didn't read ""You're Joking"", read it. If you'll like it (and you definitely will) you can read this book next year, just to remind yourself about one of the greatest minds of the century."
36,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"Feynman has a wonderfully readable voice. 90% of this wasn't too over-my-head technical, the pieces selected for this collection were mostly Feynman musing about things or sharing stories. His enthusiasm for physics and discovery reminded me of Carl Sagan's similar enthusiasm that comes through in his books. I have to wonder why none of my science and math classes in school did anything to exposure us to this enthusiasm. People really, really like science and math! Who knew? None of my teachers, apparently."
37,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67146179-april,5,"Must read! This collection of pieces is telling of Feynman's unmistakable character of no nonsense, and therefore meaningful insight into concepts of science, and of science and its relationship with factions of life, including a great postulation on the meaning of life. His ideas are refreshingly logical, comically anecdotal, and are articulated in a pleasing conversational tone which articulates concepts so fluidly. I found that Feynman actually indirectly offers a great way to approach life and its challenges, one parallel to the logic he offers."

Indeed, his thoughts on social science are still debated today, particularly about the balance of applying the scientific method with art of explaining human behaviour, as well as the problem of disincetivized replication. In any case, this collection of short works is a great introduction to the thoughts of the brilliant Richard Feynman, from his childhood and father, to his involvement in the Manhattan Project."
39,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419583-kimber,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Richard Feynman is such a character and an interesting person. I especially like the topic because my research is in nanoengineering and he is considered the father of nanotechnology. This is a collection of interviews and speeches so it's a little different from normal writing. I got such a kick out of chapter 3. It's fairly technical, but it's worth it once you get to the end. I plan on reading more of his books."

I also enjoyed his recollections of his work on quantum electodynamics while teaching at Cornell University, the work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. I was much less interested in most of the rest of this book and had some difficulty getting through it."
41,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,2,"The problem with The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is that it wasn't pleasurable. I didn't find Feynman to be that clear of a communicator. His core ideas, questions, metaphors and examples were solid and interesting. However, despite the anthologist's desire to have Feynman's speeches transcribed exactly, these selections could have benefited from a stricter and more heartless editor, and rearrangement in a more sensible order. Perhaps it would have been better in an audio format."
42,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8910683-nicol-s-rivas,2,"An ego book. All that is interesting in this book is only interesting because Feynman said it. Remove the author and the anecdotes are boring, the philosophy shallow (although clear, precise) and there is no real science in the book.

More than half scientists are atheists. Science is about doubt and uncertainty. In science there are no absolute false and true things. Ignorance is acknowledged.This scientific mentality of doubt is the applied to all areas of thinking. The question is there a God is replaced with how sure is it that there is a God? This subtle change is of utmost importance and represents the difference between religion and science. Absolute certainty doesn't exists in true scientists even the religious ones.Facts of science also challenge religious vlaims.Morality without religion.Atheism and communism. In communism all the answers (political and moral) are provided without explanation or doubt. This is the antithesis of science. Democracy is closer to science with its discussion and ability for modification.Science doesn't impact the ethical aspect of religion [or life].There is a conflic in fact and in spirit between science and religion when it comes to the metaphysical claims of religion [he means the factualy claims of religion and the certainty of it vs the uncertainty of science].Moral questions outside of the scope of science. Therefore science is not against religious ethics.Two great pillars of Western civilization:1. Acknowledging the unknown and ignorance. Huminilty.2. Christian ethics.How do we draw inspiration without the two getting into conflict? The question of our age."

It's not a book that will teach you about relativity or quantum mechanics or any other area of physics or science. If you're going in expecting a bunch of explanations about how the world works - this ain't that book.What, then, is the point of reading this book, titled ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"", if it doesn't tell you any of the fun stuff?You see, we spend all these years in school ""learning"" science. We call ourselves scientific and all, but no - we ARE NOT. All we do is take the works of the previous scientists for granted, as long as they don't directly contradict our own beliefs and prejudices. But science isn't about blind belief. It's about constantly doubting your understanding of nature. In fact that's what experimental science is all about - finding data that our theories can't explain, leading to better theories. We tend to think of science as ""the subject that gives you all the answers"". No, that's not science. That's never science. Science is about constant questioning of your previous assumptions.Feynman puts it this way: ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."" But that's not all. If you just keep on believing that the experts are wrong - that ain't science either. You have to TEST your (and the experts') beliefs to call your opinion scientific. And that testing too has to be rigorous, eliminating biases, minimizing false positives and all that. We have a tendency of calling everything ""scientific"" nowadays, because that gives things a humongous shield of credibility, though a major portion of those are, in reality, pseudoscience. They tell you ""this is a scientifically proven way of teaching best"" ""this is a scientifically proven way of pooping"" or stuff like that, but most of those are poorly experimented - people just believe those are true with little asking for evidence. This book serves as a guide for living in this world, for understanding why ""unscientific"" isn't always bad. This teaches you the REAL essence of the scientific method - which probably was never taught to you in school. A must read for any man wishing to live in this era of science where distinguishing between real science and pseudoscience has become tougher than ever for the lay people."
51,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9084927-marsha,5,"So many aspects and interesting points! Richard P Feynman's father appears to have been wonderful! Education, by him, was finding out how to find out. He personally had no scientific training or education, but he knew about science and what it was and what learning it was!This book is a collection of stories that Feynman has given or commented on over the years. It's a fascinating collection of knowledge and thoughts. I like the fact that it confirms my belief that science is not about knowledge, and doubt is an essential part of life. The problem with pseudoscience and fundamental religion is that they require certainty and they do not allow for ""I don't know"" or ""I have doubt, but let's see what there is and how reality works"". And the ""recognition"" really doesn't mean anything, the important thing is learning; it's answering questions.And his sequence on ""what use is it?"" really hit home with me, particularly his thoughts about the age of the universe and faraway stars that really don't affect us. These are things that my husband finds interesting, but I don't understand why he studies them. The answer is"" to find out! It's interesting!"" I don't agree that it's interesting for the most part, but ""to find out"" is, as Feynman points out, are perfectly legitimate answer!Some of his stories are well represented in the past (like the ""Cargo Cult"") but this makes a good compendium.a"
52,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51883014-abby,4,"The dude is obviously very smart. He has a very interesting perspective on the world, really seeking to understand why things work rather than just knowing names for certain phenomena. He also really emphasizes the importance of doubt and skepticism in both science and life. Today this is extra important; not many people understand this. Absolutes, unless they are tautologies, are probably false. This is most apparent in the fields of politics and religion (and scarily, one side of the former is becoming more and more like the later). Anyways, this was an interesting read, and you can split it up, as the chapters read just the same stand alone. A couple of the parts made me do a double take, as they were tinged with the sexism of the day. But overall, a good insight into this genius’s mind. "
53,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35021800-tarang-shah,4,"This one is a simple collection of Feynman's interviews and speeches, along with some stories from the other two books (Surely you're joking and What do you care what other people think).Since Feynman gave the interviews and speeches independent of each other, and much before anybody thought to publish this kind of book, there is quite a bit of repetition. Keeping that in mind, the net content of this book is pretty good and helps you learn more about the technical bits and about Feynman's approach to things. If you've read the other 2 books focused on stories by Feynman, this book can be skimmed."

However, only half of this book accomplished this: the articles were oscillating between super boring (for me at least) and fascinating. Favourite one: ""It's as simple as one, two, three""."
55,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5284687-albin-james,5,Prof. Feynman is very lucid and sincere. He emphasises scientific integrity and dialectics and is quite serious about these.

60,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77291875-ramu-vairavan,4,"This is a fine collection of Feynman's lectures, interviews and writing that introduces us to the man, scientist and Nobel laureate. Through his stories, Feynman paints an enigmatic character out of his father that rivals his own. And so we really get to meet two interesting people.A few things I gathered from this collection: Feynman is all about ideas. He plays with them like a child plays with toys. His imagination is vast, he dreamed up advancements in nanotechnology decades before they were made. He's very gutsy too, not afraid to ask questions. He's a serial fun-seeker, and he saw much pleasure in figuring things out. This is evident in his little adventures and funny anecdotes, of which I found his lock picking exploits at Los Alamos and his story about turning himself into a lab rat in a counting experiment memorable.One grudge I have is that brilliant people often don't talk enough to share their thoughts with us while others talk too much without being asked. Feynman distinguished himself as being both brilliant and vocal. His take on scientific matters was fresh in his day and is still so.Would recommend this book to folks who like getting to know other curious folks, Feynman definitely was one. It may get a little repetitive as Feynman rehashes stories at different occasions, but there's still good material in there - a good mix of technical and non-technical pieces from a range of topics/settings."
61,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,5,"This book has helped me understand better the highly intellectual man, Richard Feynman, whom I have come to love so very much. This compilation of talks, interviews, and lectures throw light on Feynman's work, ideas, relationships, and philosophy. The essay 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' shows the inception of Feynman's disposition to science and the didactic relationship with his father, while 'Los Alamos from Below' shows his playful relationship with his wife, and how he constantly tries to push boundaries. 'It's as simple as One, Two, Three' shows his curious and restless nature, his love for experimenting absurdities, and his need for proving or disproving things. Many of the more scientific essays involve his ideas and thoughts on computing machines, improving efficiencies, and trying to constantly challenge science.The essays I enjoyed the most had more philosophical undertones and covered the topics of religion, pseudoscience, the value and role of science. His approach to the untruths and the half-truths is empathetic, and he strongly encourages deeper exploration and uprooting rather than dismissing them on the face of it. His attitude to the unknown is very easy on the conscience, and seems to be what keeps him going actively.A few essays have redundant points and incidents, but as an admirer of the queer and wise Feynman, it was my pleasure to indulge in the repeats."

63,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43687-elena,4,"Like my affinity for Harold Bloom, Richard Feynman can do no wrong in my book. He was a man that thought outside the box, and was ahead beyond the technology of his time. However, what left the most lasting impression in this book is when Feynman turns into a bit of a philosopher and it made me think for days.Feynman discusses the Heritages of Western Civilization:Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientifice spirit of adventure- the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it-the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics- the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual- the humility of the spirit. How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of Western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem our time?It is this question that has left me after reading all of his lectures. "

I did not know a lot about Feynman before reading it ,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.I really loved Feynman's view of the world , the way he saw things and how he talked about what he liked , one could easily feel his passion ,the genuineness of his words, the genius mind he had. the only problem was that it was too ""scientific"" for me at some points ,thus this ""non scientific"" review , but that is not the book's fault.I have to say though that I didn't necessarily agree with everything he said , but overall I liked his points of view , and how he expressed them, and had a lot of fun reading them."

That book was deep, thoughtful, inspirational.This book isn't bad, definitely, but the format is slightly different. Because the book consists of a set of interviews, the narration is not that smooth, different ""chapters"" has similar ideas just because each chapter is just a speech that Mr Faynman gave at some time. And of course, they won't be that deep either.I would say that if you didn't read ""You're Joking"", read it. If you'll like it (and you definitely will) you can read this book next year, just to remind yourself about one of the greatest minds of the century."
66,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"Feynman has a wonderfully readable voice. 90% of this wasn't too over-my-head technical, the pieces selected for this collection were mostly Feynman musing about things or sharing stories. His enthusiasm for physics and discovery reminded me of Carl Sagan's similar enthusiasm that comes through in his books. I have to wonder why none of my science and math classes in school did anything to exposure us to this enthusiasm. People really, really like science and math! Who knew? None of my teachers, apparently."
67,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67146179-april,5,"Must read! This collection of pieces is telling of Feynman's unmistakable character of no nonsense, and therefore meaningful insight into concepts of science, and of science and its relationship with factions of life, including a great postulation on the meaning of life. His ideas are refreshingly logical, comically anecdotal, and are articulated in a pleasing conversational tone which articulates concepts so fluidly. I found that Feynman actually indirectly offers a great way to approach life and its challenges, one parallel to the logic he offers."

Indeed, his thoughts on social science are still debated today, particularly about the balance of applying the scientific method with art of explaining human behaviour, as well as the problem of disincetivized replication. In any case, this collection of short works is a great introduction to the thoughts of the brilliant Richard Feynman, from his childhood and father, to his involvement in the Manhattan Project."
69,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419583-kimber,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Richard Feynman is such a character and an interesting person. I especially like the topic because my research is in nanoengineering and he is considered the father of nanotechnology. This is a collection of interviews and speeches so it's a little different from normal writing. I got such a kick out of chapter 3. It's fairly technical, but it's worth it once you get to the end. I plan on reading more of his books."
70,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175087-brian,2,"The parts about Feynman's descriptions of how his father taught him to be curious about nature and his humorous accounts of his time at Los Alamos were the best parts of the book. I also enjoyed his recollections of his work on quantum electodynamics while teaching at Cornell University, the work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. I was much less interested in most of the rest of this book and had some difficulty getting through it."
71,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,2,"The problem with The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is that it wasn't pleasurable. I didn't find Feynman to be that clear of a communicator. His core ideas, questions, metaphors and examples were solid and interesting. However, despite the anthologist's desire to have Feynman's speeches transcribed exactly, these selections could have benefited from a stricter and more heartless editor, and rearrangement in a more sensible order. Perhaps it would have been better in an audio format."
72,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8910683-nicol-s-rivas,2,"An ego book. All that is interesting in this book is only interesting because Feynman said it. Remove the author and the anecdotes are boring, the philosophy shallow (although clear, precise) and there is no real science in the book. Feynman shines when he talks about physics, his Lectures books are impressive, masterful, but there's is very little of that in this book."
73,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,This is a fantastic book about being a scientist and academic while still keeping you feet grounded.I think it would be helpful for junior high school children to read to show them how having an observant and inquisitive mindset about reality can be rewarding.I recommend this for everyone 15 years and older.

And that testing too has to be rigorous, eliminating biases, minimizing false positives and all that. We have a tendency of calling everything ""scientific"" nowadays, because that gives things a humongous shield of credibility, though a major portion of those are, in reality, pseudoscience. They tell you ""this is a scientifically proven way of teaching best"" ""this is a scientifically proven way of pooping"" or stuff like that, but most of those are poorly experimented - people just believe those are true with little asking for evidence. This book serves as a guide for living in this world, for understanding why ""unscientific"" isn't always bad. This teaches you the REAL essence of the scientific method - which probably was never taught to you in school. A must read for any man wishing to live in this era of science where distinguishing between real science and pseudoscience has become tougher than ever for the lay people."

Education, by him, was finding out how to find out. He personally had no scientific training or education, but he knew about science and what it was and what learning it was!This book is a collection of stories that Feynman has given or commented on over the years. It's a fascinating collection of knowledge and thoughts. I like the fact that it confirms my belief that science is not about knowledge, and doubt is an essential part of life. The problem with pseudoscience and fundamental religion is that they require certainty and they do not allow for ""I don't know"" or ""I have doubt, but let's see what there is and how reality works"". And the ""recognition"" really doesn't mean anything, the important thing is learning; it's answering questions.And his sequence on ""what use is it?"" really hit home with me, particularly his thoughts about the age of the universe and faraway stars that really don't affect us. These are things that my husband finds interesting, but I don't understand why he studies them. The answer is"" to find out! It's interesting!"" I don't agree that it's interesting for the most part, but ""to find out"" is, as Feynman points out, are perfectly legitimate answer!Some of his stories are well represented in the past (like the ""Cargo Cult"") but this makes a good compendium.a"
82,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51883014-abby,4,"The dude is obviously very smart. He has a very interesting perspective on the world, really seeking to understand why things work rather than just knowing names for certain phenomena. He also really emphasizes the importance of doubt and skepticism in both science and life. Today this is extra important; not many people understand this. Absolutes, unless they are tautologies, are probably false. This is most apparent in the fields of politics and religion (and scarily, one side of the former is becoming more and more like the later). Anyways, this was an interesting read, and you can split it up, as the chapters read just the same stand alone. A couple of the parts made me do a double take, as they were tinged with the sexism of the day. But overall, a good insight into this genius’s mind. "
83,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35021800-tarang-shah,4,"This one is a simple collection of Feynman's interviews and speeches, along with some stories from the other two books (Surely you're joking and What do you care what other people think).Since Feynman gave the interviews and speeches independent of each other, and much before anybody thought to publish this kind of book, there is quite a bit of repetition. Keeping that in mind, the net content of this book is pretty good and helps you learn more about the technical bits and about Feynman's approach to things. If you've read the other 2 books focused on stories by Feynman, this book can be skimmed."
84,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51903588-ioana-barcan,3,"What I like most about books by / about Feynmann is that they leave me with a thirst for knowledge, a curiosity about the world around me. However, only half of this book accomplished this: the articles were oscillating between super boring (for me at least) and fascinating. Favourite one: ""It's as simple as one, two, three""."
85,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5284687-albin-james,5,Prof. Feynman is very lucid and sincere. He emphasises scientific integrity and dialectics and is quite serious about these.

89,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52134193-marko-simunovic,5,Loved every page of it. Feynman is the kind of person that the more you know about the more you appreciate the mark they left on the world.
90,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77291875-ramu-vairavan,4,"This is a fine collection of Feynman's lectures, interviews and writing that introduces us to the man, scientist and Nobel laureate. Through his stories, Feynman paints an enigmatic character out of his father that rivals his own. And so we really get to meet two interesting people.A few things I gathered from this collection: Feynman is all about ideas. He plays with them like a child plays with toys. His imagination is vast, he dreamed up advancements in nanotechnology decades before they were made. He's very gutsy too, not afraid to ask questions. He's a serial fun-seeker, and he saw much pleasure in figuring things out. This is evident in his little adventures and funny anecdotes, of which I found his lock picking exploits at Los Alamos and his story about turning himself into a lab rat in a counting experiment memorable.One grudge I have is that brilliant people often don't talk enough to share their thoughts with us while others talk too much without being asked. Feynman distinguished himself as being both brilliant and vocal. His take on scientific matters was fresh in his day and is still so.Would recommend this book to folks who like getting to know other curious folks, Feynman definitely was one. It may get a little repetitive as Feynman rehashes stories at different occasions, but there's still good material in there - a good mix of technical and non-technical pieces from a range of topics/settings."
91,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,5,"This book has helped me understand better the highly intellectual man, Richard Feynman, whom I have come to love so very much. This compilation of talks, interviews, and lectures throw light on Feynman's work, ideas, relationships, and philosophy. The essay 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' shows the inception of Feynman's disposition to science and the didactic relationship with his father, while 'Los Alamos from Below' shows his playful relationship with his wife, and how he constantly tries to push boundaries. 'It's as simple as One, Two, Three' shows his curious and restless nature, his love for experimenting absurdities, and his need for proving or disproving things. Many of the more scientific essays involve his ideas and thoughts on computing machines, improving efficiencies, and trying to constantly challenge science.The essays I enjoyed the most had more philosophical undertones and covered the topics of religion, pseudoscience, the value and role of science. His approach to the untruths and the half-truths is empathetic, and he strongly encourages deeper exploration and uprooting rather than dismissing them on the face of it. His attitude to the unknown is very easy on the conscience, and seems to be what keeps him going actively.A few essays have redundant points and incidents, but as an admirer of the queer and wise Feynman, it was my pleasure to indulge in the repeats."

ON THE OTHER HAND MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WHICH ADDS SURPLUS IN ME COMPENSATING THE LOSS, IS MY SOUL AND EVERY DAY LIFE FILLING UP WITH THE CAREFREE FINDINGS AND KNOWING ABOUT THE WORLD.All I'd like to say and what I feel after going through life time and again is ""I don't know what to do with all these joys, with all the knowledge and the enthusiasm that feels me up when I address the true beauty of the Nature. I couldn't do anything now but have plans, just need some guidance and the comfort that everything is going to be okay in the end. If it doesn't seem to be okay, well if its not the end. Hope I could feel me up with these thing. To see things as they are and appreciate the true beauty.The point is not to be him but I see myself as an atomic part of him; which I believe that people who follow him see as I see him. I still don't know 'what to do with the things I know. What to add up to the knowledge of the things, things that I would love to do, things which would spark a ignition in me.' I seek some answers which I can't get but to go through the current time.""

93,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43687-elena,4,"Like my affinity for Harold Bloom, Richard Feynman can do no wrong in my book. He was a man that thought outside the box, and was ahead beyond the technology of his time. However, what left the most lasting impression in this book is when Feynman turns into a bit of a philosopher and it made me think for days.Feynman discusses the Heritages of Western Civilization:Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientifice spirit of adventure- the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it-the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics- the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual- the humility of the spirit. How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of Western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem our time?It is this question that has left me after reading all of his lectures. "

I did not know a lot about Feynman before reading it ,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.I really loved Feynman's view of the world , the way he saw things and how he talked about what he liked , one could easily feel his passion ,the genuineness of his words, the genius mind he had. the only problem was that it was too ""scientific"" for me at some points ,thus this ""non scientific"" review , but that is not the book's fault.I have to say though that I didn't necessarily agree with everything he said , but overall I liked his points of view , and how he expressed them, and had a lot of fun reading them."
95,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7292913-sergey-teplyakov,3,"When I first read a fabulous ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" I was shocked. That book was deep, thoughtful, inspirational.This book isn't bad, definitely, but the format is slightly different. Because the book consists of a set of interviews, the narration is not that smooth, different ""chapters"" has similar ideas just because each chapter is just a speech that Mr Faynman gave at some time. And of course, they won't be that deep either.I would say that if you didn't read ""You're Joking"", read it. If you'll like it (and you definitely will) you can read this book next year, just to remind yourself about one of the greatest minds of the century."
96,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"Feynman has a wonderfully readable voice. 90% of this wasn't too over-my-head technical, the pieces selected for this collection were mostly Feynman musing about things or sharing stories. His enthusiasm for physics and discovery reminded me of Carl Sagan's similar enthusiasm that comes through in his books. I have to wonder why none of my science and math classes in school did anything to exposure us to this enthusiasm. People really, really like science and math! Who knew? None of my teachers, apparently."
97,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67146179-april,5,"Must read! This collection of pieces is telling of Feynman's unmistakable character of no nonsense, and therefore meaningful insight into concepts of science, and of science and its relationship with factions of life, including a great postulation on the meaning of life. His ideas are refreshingly logical, comically anecdotal, and are articulated in a pleasing conversational tone which articulates concepts so fluidly. I found that Feynman actually indirectly offers a great way to approach life and its challenges, one parallel to the logic he offers."
98,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,4,"You know someone is truly remarkable when you can't help but nod in agreement when they call your general field of study a cargo cult science. Indeed, his thoughts on social science are still debated today, particularly about the balance of applying the scientific method with art of explaining human behaviour, as well as the problem of disincetivized replication. In any case, this collection of short works is a great introduction to the thoughts of the brilliant Richard Feynman, from his childhood and father, to his involvement in the Manhattan Project."
99,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419583-kimber,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Richard Feynman is such a character and an interesting person. I especially like the topic because my research is in nanoengineering and he is considered the father of nanotechnology. This is a collection of interviews and speeches so it's a little different from normal writing. I got such a kick out of chapter 3. It's fairly technical, but it's worth it once you get to the end. I plan on reading more of his books."
100,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175087-brian,2,"The parts about Feynman's descriptions of how his father taught him to be curious about nature and his humorous accounts of his time at Los Alamos were the best parts of the book. I also enjoyed his recollections of his work on quantum electodynamics while teaching at Cornell University, the work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. I was much less interested in most of the rest of this book and had some difficulty getting through it."
101,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,2,"The problem with The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is that it wasn't pleasurable. I didn't find Feynman to be that clear of a communicator. His core ideas, questions, metaphors and examples were solid and interesting. However, despite the anthologist's desire to have Feynman's speeches transcribed exactly, these selections could have benefited from a stricter and more heartless editor, and rearrangement in a more sensible order. Perhaps it would have been better in an audio format."
102,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8910683-nicol-s-rivas,2,"An ego book. All that is interesting in this book is only interesting because Feynman said it. Remove the author and the anecdotes are boring, the philosophy shallow (although clear, precise) and there is no real science in the book. Feynman shines when he talks about physics, his Lectures books are impressive, masterful, but there's is very little of that in this book."
103,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,This is a fantastic book about being a scientist and academic while still keeping you feet grounded.I think it would be helpful for junior high school children to read to show them how having an observant and inquisitive mindset about reality can be rewarding.I recommend this for everyone 15 years and older.
104,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3972188-ian,4,"Most of the ideas and stories here are in, Surely You're Joking... or What Do You Care... but they're good enough that I enjoyed hearing them again.

The back cover is so excited but didn't follow my expectations, although i underline many quotes. Feynman memorizes his father's way to teach him things and ways to develop his ability to think. Nice examples for new fathers between the lines of physics, bombs and computers"

More than half scientists are atheists. Science is about doubt and uncertainty. In science there are no absolute false and true things. Ignorance is acknowledged.This scientific mentality of doubt is the applied to all areas of thinking. The question is there a God is replaced with how sure is it that there is a God? This subtle change is of utmost importance and represents the difference between religion and science. Absolute certainty doesn't exists in true scientists even the religious ones.Facts of science also challenge religious vlaims.Morality without religion.Atheism and communism. In communism all the answers (political and moral) are provided without explanation or doubt. This is the antithesis of science. Democracy is closer to science with its discussion and ability for modification.Science doesn't impact the ethical aspect of religion [or life].There is a conflic in fact and in spirit between science and religion when it comes to the metaphysical claims of religion [he means the factualy claims of religion and the certainty of it vs the uncertainty of science].Moral questions outside of the scope of science. Therefore science is not against religious ethics.Two great pillars of Western civilization:1. Acknowledging the unknown and ignorance. Huminilty.2. Christian ethics.How do we draw inspiration without the two getting into conflict? The question of our age."

We call ourselves scientific and all, but no - we ARE NOT. All we do is take the works of the previous scientists for granted, as long as they don't directly contradict our own beliefs and prejudices. But science isn't about blind belief. It's about constantly doubting your understanding of nature. In fact that's what experimental science is all about - finding data that our theories can't explain, leading to better theories. We tend to think of science as ""the subject that gives you all the answers"". No, that's not science. That's never science. Science is about constant questioning of your previous assumptions.Feynman puts it this way: ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."" But that's not all. If you just keep on believing that the experts are wrong - that ain't science either. You have to TEST your (and the experts') beliefs to call your opinion scientific.

And the ""recognition"" really doesn't mean anything, the important thing is learning; it's answering questions.And his sequence on ""what use is it?"" really hit home with me, particularly his thoughts about the age of the universe and faraway stars that really don't affect us. These are things that my husband finds interesting, but I don't understand why he studies them. The answer is"" to find out! It's interesting!"" I don't agree that it's interesting for the most part, but ""to find out"" is, as Feynman points out, are perfectly legitimate answer!Some of his stories are well represented in the past (like the ""Cargo Cult"") but this makes a good compendium.a"

Absolutes, unless they are tautologies, are probably false. This is most apparent in the fields of politics and religion (and scarily, one side of the former is becoming more and more like the later).

Keeping that in mind, the net content of this book is pretty good and helps you learn more about the technical bits and about Feynman's approach to things. If you've read the other 2 books focused on stories by Feynman, this book can be skimmed."

However, only half of this book accomplished this: the articles were oscillating between super boring (for me at least) and fascinating. Favourite one: ""It's as simple as one, two, three""."
115,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5284687-albin-james,5,Prof. Feynman is very lucid and sincere. He emphasises scientific integrity and dialectics and is quite serious about these.

120,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77291875-ramu-vairavan,4,"This is a fine collection of Feynman's lectures, interviews and writing that introduces us to the man, scientist and Nobel laureate. Through his stories, Feynman paints an enigmatic character out of his father that rivals his own. And so we really get to meet two interesting people.A few things I gathered from this collection: Feynman is all about ideas. He plays with them like a child plays with toys. His imagination is vast, he dreamed up advancements in nanotechnology decades before they were made. He's very gutsy too, not afraid to ask questions. He's a serial fun-seeker, and he saw much pleasure in figuring things out. This is evident in his little adventures and funny anecdotes, of which I found his lock picking exploits at Los Alamos and his story about turning himself into a lab rat in a counting experiment memorable.One grudge I have is that brilliant people often don't talk enough to share their thoughts with us while others talk too much without being asked. Feynman distinguished himself as being both brilliant and vocal. His take on scientific matters was fresh in his day and is still so.Would recommend this book to folks who like getting to know other curious folks, Feynman definitely was one. It may get a little repetitive as Feynman rehashes stories at different occasions, but there's still good material in there - a good mix of technical and non-technical pieces from a range of topics/settings."
121,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,5,"This book has helped me understand better the highly intellectual man, Richard Feynman, whom I have come to love so very much. This compilation of talks, interviews, and lectures throw light on Feynman's work, ideas, relationships, and philosophy. The essay 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' shows the inception of Feynman's disposition to science and the didactic relationship with his father, while 'Los Alamos from Below' shows his playful relationship with his wife, and how he constantly tries to push boundaries. 'It's as simple as One, Two, Three' shows his curious and restless nature, his love for experimenting absurdities, and his need for proving or disproving things. Many of the more scientific essays involve his ideas and thoughts on computing machines, improving efficiencies, and trying to constantly challenge science.The essays I enjoyed the most had more philosophical undertones and covered the topics of religion, pseudoscience, the value and role of science. His approach to the untruths and the half-truths is empathetic, and he strongly encourages deeper exploration and uprooting rather than dismissing them on the face of it. His attitude to the unknown is very easy on the conscience, and seems to be what keeps him going actively.A few essays have redundant points and incidents, but as an admirer of the queer and wise Feynman, it was my pleasure to indulge in the repeats."

123,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43687-elena,4,"Like my affinity for Harold Bloom, Richard Feynman can do no wrong in my book. He was a man that thought outside the box, and was ahead beyond the technology of his time. However, what left the most lasting impression in this book is when Feynman turns into a bit of a philosopher and it made me think for days.Feynman discusses the Heritages of Western Civilization:Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientifice spirit of adventure- the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it-the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics- the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual- the humility of the spirit. How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of Western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem our time?It is this question that has left me after reading all of his lectures. "

I did not know a lot about Feynman before reading it ,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.I really loved Feynman's view of the world , the way he saw things and how he talked about what he liked , one could easily feel his passion ,the genuineness of his words, the genius mind he had. the only problem was that it was too ""scientific"" for me at some points ,thus this ""non scientific"" review , but that is not the book's fault.I have to say though that I didn't necessarily agree with everything he said , but overall I liked his points of view , and how he expressed them, and had a lot of fun reading them."
125,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7292913-sergey-teplyakov,3,"When I first read a fabulous ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" I was shocked. That book was deep, thoughtful, inspirational.This book isn't bad, definitely, but the format is slightly different. Because the book consists of a set of interviews, the narration is not that smooth, different ""chapters"" has similar ideas just because each chapter is just a speech that Mr Faynman gave at some time. And of course, they won't be that deep either.I would say that if you didn't read ""You're Joking"", read it. If you'll like it (and you definitely will) you can read this book next year, just to remind yourself about one of the greatest minds of the century."
126,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"Feynman has a wonderfully readable voice. 90% of this wasn't too over-my-head technical, the pieces selected for this collection were mostly Feynman musing about things or sharing stories. His enthusiasm for physics and discovery reminded me of Carl Sagan's similar enthusiasm that comes through in his books. I have to wonder why none of my science and math classes in school did anything to exposure us to this enthusiasm. People really, really like science and math! Who knew? None of my teachers, apparently."
127,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67146179-april,5,"Must read! This collection of pieces is telling of Feynman's unmistakable character of no nonsense, and therefore meaningful insight into concepts of science, and of science and its relationship with factions of life, including a great postulation on the meaning of life. His ideas are refreshingly logical, comically anecdotal, and are articulated in a pleasing conversational tone which articulates concepts so fluidly. I found that Feynman actually indirectly offers a great way to approach life and its challenges, one parallel to the logic he offers."

Indeed, his thoughts on social science are still debated today, particularly about the balance of applying the scientific method with art of explaining human behaviour, as well as the problem of disincetivized replication. In any case, this collection of short works is a great introduction to the thoughts of the brilliant Richard Feynman, from his childhood and father, to his involvement in the Manhattan Project."
129,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419583-kimber,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Richard Feynman is such a character and an interesting person. I especially like the topic because my research is in nanoengineering and he is considered the father of nanotechnology. This is a collection of interviews and speeches so it's a little different from normal writing. I got such a kick out of chapter 3. It's fairly technical, but it's worth it once you get to the end. I plan on reading more of his books."
130,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175087-brian,2,"The parts about Feynman's descriptions of how his father taught him to be curious about nature and his humorous accounts of his time at Los Alamos were the best parts of the book. I also enjoyed his recollections of his work on quantum electodynamics while teaching at Cornell University, the work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. I was much less interested in most of the rest of this book and had some difficulty getting through it."
131,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,2,"The problem with The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is that it wasn't pleasurable. I didn't find Feynman to be that clear of a communicator. His core ideas, questions, metaphors and examples were solid and interesting. However, despite the anthologist's desire to have Feynman's speeches transcribed exactly, these selections could have benefited from a stricter and more heartless editor, and rearrangement in a more sensible order. Perhaps it would have been better in an audio format."
132,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8910683-nicol-s-rivas,2,"An ego book. All that is interesting in this book is only interesting because Feynman said it. Remove the author and the anecdotes are boring, the philosophy shallow (although clear, precise) and there is no real science in the book. Feynman shines when he talks about physics, his Lectures books are impressive, masterful, but there's is very little of that in this book."
133,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,This is a fantastic book about being a scientist and academic while still keeping you feet grounded.I think it would be helpful for junior high school children to read to show them how having an observant and inquisitive mindset about reality can be rewarding.I recommend this for everyone 15 years and older.

More than half scientists are atheists. Science is about doubt and uncertainty. In science there are no absolute false and true things. Ignorance is acknowledged.This scientific mentality of doubt is the applied to all areas of thinking. The question is there a God is replaced with how sure is it that there is a God? This subtle change is of utmost importance and represents the difference between religion and science. Absolute certainty doesn't exists in true scientists even the religious ones.Facts of science also challenge religious vlaims.Morality without religion.Atheism and communism. In communism all the answers (political and moral) are provided without explanation or doubt. This is the antithesis of science. Democracy is closer to science with its discussion and ability for modification.Science doesn't impact the ethical aspect of religion [or life].There is a conflic in fact and in spirit between science and religion when it comes to the metaphysical claims of religion [he means the factualy claims of religion and the certainty of it vs the uncertainty of science].Moral questions outside of the scope of science. Therefore science is not against religious ethics.Two great pillars of Western civilization:1. Acknowledging the unknown and ignorance. Huminilty.2. Christian ethics.How do we draw inspiration without the two getting into conflict? The question of our age."

It's not a book that will teach you about relativity or quantum mechanics or any other area of physics or science. If you're going in expecting a bunch of explanations about how the world works - this ain't that book.What, then, is the point of reading this book, titled ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"", if it doesn't tell you any of the fun stuff?You see, we spend all these years in school ""learning"" science. We call ourselves scientific and all, but no - we ARE NOT. All we do is take the works of the previous scientists for granted, as long as they don't directly contradict our own beliefs and prejudices. But science isn't about blind belief. It's about constantly doubting your understanding of nature. In fact that's what experimental science is all about - finding data that our theories can't explain, leading to better theories. We tend to think of science as ""the subject that gives you all the answers"". No, that's not science. That's never science. Science is about constant questioning of your previous assumptions.Feynman puts it this way: ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."" But that's not all. If you just keep on believing that the experts are wrong - that ain't science either. You have to TEST your (and the experts') beliefs to call your opinion scientific. And that testing too has to be rigorous, eliminating biases, minimizing false positives and all that. We have a tendency of calling everything ""scientific"" nowadays, because that gives things a humongous shield of credibility, though a major portion of those are, in reality, pseudoscience. They tell you ""this is a scientifically proven way of teaching best"" ""this is a scientifically proven way of pooping"" or stuff like that, but most of those are poorly experimented - people just believe those are true with little asking for evidence. This book serves as a guide for living in this world, for understanding why ""unscientific"" isn't always bad. This teaches you the REAL essence of the scientific method - which probably was never taught to you in school. A must read for any man wishing to live in this era of science where distinguishing between real science and pseudoscience has become tougher than ever for the lay people."

150,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77291875-ramu-vairavan,4,"This is a fine collection of Feynman's lectures, interviews and writing that introduces us to the man, scientist and Nobel laureate. Through his stories, Feynman paints an enigmatic character out of his father that rivals his own. And so we really get to meet two interesting people.A few things I gathered from this collection: Feynman is all about ideas. He plays with them like a child plays with toys. His imagination is vast, he dreamed up advancements in nanotechnology decades before they were made. He's very gutsy too, not afraid to ask questions. He's a serial fun-seeker, and he saw much pleasure in figuring things out. This is evident in his little adventures and funny anecdotes, of which I found his lock picking exploits at Los Alamos and his story about turning himself into a lab rat in a counting experiment memorable.One grudge I have is that brilliant people often don't talk enough to share their thoughts with us while others talk too much without being asked. Feynman distinguished himself as being both brilliant and vocal. His take on scientific matters was fresh in his day and is still so.Would recommend this book to folks who like getting to know other curious folks, Feynman definitely was one. It may get a little repetitive as Feynman rehashes stories at different occasions, but there's still good material in there - a good mix of technical and non-technical pieces from a range of topics/settings."
151,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,5,"This book has helped me understand better the highly intellectual man, Richard Feynman, whom I have come to love so very much. This compilation of talks, interviews, and lectures throw light on Feynman's work, ideas, relationships, and philosophy. The essay 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' shows the inception of Feynman's disposition to science and the didactic relationship with his father, while 'Los Alamos from Below' shows his playful relationship with his wife, and how he constantly tries to push boundaries. 'It's as simple as One, Two, Three' shows his curious and restless nature, his love for experimenting absurdities, and his need for proving or disproving things. Many of the more scientific essays involve his ideas and thoughts on computing machines, improving efficiencies, and trying to constantly challenge science.The essays I enjoyed the most had more philosophical undertones and covered the topics of religion, pseudoscience, the value and role of science. His approach to the untruths and the half-truths is empathetic, and he strongly encourages deeper exploration and uprooting rather than dismissing them on the face of it. His attitude to the unknown is very easy on the conscience, and seems to be what keeps him going actively.A few essays have redundant points and incidents, but as an admirer of the queer and wise Feynman, it was my pleasure to indulge in the repeats."

153,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43687-elena,4,"Like my affinity for Harold Bloom, Richard Feynman can do no wrong in my book. He was a man that thought outside the box, and was ahead beyond the technology of his time. However, what left the most lasting impression in this book is when Feynman turns into a bit of a philosopher and it made me think for days.Feynman discusses the Heritages of Western Civilization:Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientifice spirit of adventure- the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it-the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics- the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual- the humility of the spirit. How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of Western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem our time?It is this question that has left me after reading all of his lectures. "

I did not know a lot about Feynman before reading it ,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.I really loved Feynman's view of the world , the way he saw things and how he talked about what he liked , one could easily feel his passion ,the genuineness of his words, the genius mind he had. the only problem was that it was too ""scientific"" for me at some points ,thus this ""non scientific"" review , but that is not the book's fault.I have to say though that I didn't necessarily agree with everything he said , but overall I liked his points of view , and how he expressed them, and had a lot of fun reading them."

That book was deep, thoughtful, inspirational.This book isn't bad, definitely, but the format is slightly different. Because the book consists of a set of interviews, the narration is not that smooth, different ""chapters"" has similar ideas just because each chapter is just a speech that Mr Faynman gave at some time. And of course, they won't be that deep either.I would say that if you didn't read ""You're Joking"", read it. If you'll like it (and you definitely will) you can read this book next year, just to remind yourself about one of the greatest minds of the century."
156,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"Feynman has a wonderfully readable voice. 90% of this wasn't too over-my-head technical, the pieces selected for this collection were mostly Feynman musing about things or sharing stories. His enthusiasm for physics and discovery reminded me of Carl Sagan's similar enthusiasm that comes through in his books. I have to wonder why none of my science and math classes in school did anything to exposure us to this enthusiasm. People really, really like science and math! Who knew? None of my teachers, apparently."
157,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67146179-april,5,"Must read! This collection of pieces is telling of Feynman's unmistakable character of no nonsense, and therefore meaningful insight into concepts of science, and of science and its relationship with factions of life, including a great postulation on the meaning of life. His ideas are refreshingly logical, comically anecdotal, and are articulated in a pleasing conversational tone which articulates concepts so fluidly. I found that Feynman actually indirectly offers a great way to approach life and its challenges, one parallel to the logic he offers."

Indeed, his thoughts on social science are still debated today, particularly about the balance of applying the scientific method with art of explaining human behaviour, as well as the problem of disincetivized replication. In any case, this collection of short works is a great introduction to the thoughts of the brilliant Richard Feynman, from his childhood and father, to his involvement in the Manhattan Project."
159,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419583-kimber,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Richard Feynman is such a character and an interesting person. I especially like the topic because my research is in nanoengineering and he is considered the father of nanotechnology. This is a collection of interviews and speeches so it's a little different from normal writing. I got such a kick out of chapter 3. It's fairly technical, but it's worth it once you get to the end. I plan on reading more of his books."

I also enjoyed his recollections of his work on quantum electodynamics while teaching at Cornell University, the work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. I was much less interested in most of the rest of this book and had some difficulty getting through it."
161,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,2,"The problem with The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is that it wasn't pleasurable. I didn't find Feynman to be that clear of a communicator. His core ideas, questions, metaphors and examples were solid and interesting. However, despite the anthologist's desire to have Feynman's speeches transcribed exactly, these selections could have benefited from a stricter and more heartless editor, and rearrangement in a more sensible order. Perhaps it would have been better in an audio format."
162,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8910683-nicol-s-rivas,2,"An ego book. All that is interesting in this book is only interesting because Feynman said it. Remove the author and the anecdotes are boring, the philosophy shallow (although clear, precise) and there is no real science in the book. Feynman shines when he talks about physics, his Lectures books are impressive, masterful, but there's is very little of that in this book."

More than half scientists are atheists. Science is about doubt and uncertainty. In science there are no absolute false and true things. Ignorance is acknowledged.This scientific mentality of doubt is the applied to all areas of thinking. The question is there a God is replaced with how sure is it that there is a God? This subtle change is of utmost importance and represents the difference between religion and science. Absolute certainty doesn't exists in true scientists even the religious ones.Facts of science also challenge religious vlaims.Morality without religion.Atheism and communism. In communism all the answers (political and moral) are provided without explanation or doubt. This is the antithesis of science. Democracy is closer to science with its discussion and ability for modification.Science doesn't impact the ethical aspect of religion [or life].There is a conflic in fact and in spirit between science and religion when it comes to the metaphysical claims of religion [he means the factualy claims of religion and the certainty of it vs the uncertainty of science].Moral questions outside of the scope of science. Therefore science is not against religious ethics.Two great pillars of Western civilization:1. Acknowledging the unknown and ignorance. Huminilty.2. Christian ethics.How do we draw inspiration without the two getting into conflict? The question of our age."
170,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81414366-susmit-islam,5,"First let me tell you what this book ISN'T about. It's not a book that will teach you about relativity or quantum mechanics or any other area of physics or science. If you're going in expecting a bunch of explanations about how the world works - this ain't that book.What, then, is the point of reading this book, titled ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"", if it doesn't tell you any of the fun stuff?You see, we spend all these years in school ""learning"" science. We call ourselves scientific and all, but no - we ARE NOT. All we do is take the works of the previous scientists for granted, as long as they don't directly contradict our own beliefs and prejudices. But science isn't about blind belief. It's about constantly doubting your understanding of nature. In fact that's what experimental science is all about - finding data that our theories can't explain, leading to better theories. We tend to think of science as ""the subject that gives you all the answers"". No, that's not science. That's never science. Science is about constant questioning of your previous assumptions.Feynman puts it this way: ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."" But that's not all. If you just keep on believing that the experts are wrong - that ain't science either. You have to TEST your (and the experts') beliefs to call your opinion scientific. And that testing too has to be rigorous, eliminating biases, minimizing false positives and all that. We have a tendency of calling everything ""scientific"" nowadays, because that gives things a humongous shield of credibility, though a major portion of those are, in reality, pseudoscience. They tell you ""this is a scientifically proven way of teaching best"" ""this is a scientifically proven way of pooping"" or stuff like that, but most of those are poorly experimented - people just believe those are true with little asking for evidence. This book serves as a guide for living in this world, for understanding why ""unscientific"" isn't always bad. This teaches you the REAL essence of the scientific method - which probably was never taught to you in school. A must read for any man wishing to live in this era of science where distinguishing between real science and pseudoscience has become tougher than ever for the lay people."

Education, by him, was finding out how to find out. He personally had no scientific training or education, but he knew about science and what it was and what learning it was!This book is a collection of stories that Feynman has given or commented on over the years. It's a fascinating collection of knowledge and thoughts. I like the fact that it confirms my belief that science is not about knowledge, and doubt is an essential part of life. The problem with pseudoscience and fundamental religion is that they require certainty and they do not allow for ""I don't know"" or ""I have doubt, but let's see what there is and how reality works"". And the ""recognition"" really doesn't mean anything, the important thing is learning; it's answering questions.And his sequence on ""what use is it?"" really hit home with me, particularly his thoughts about the age of the universe and faraway stars that really don't affect us. These are things that my husband finds interesting, but I don't understand why he studies them. The answer is"" to find out! It's interesting!"" I don't agree that it's interesting for the most part, but ""to find out"" is, as Feynman points out, are perfectly legitimate answer!Some of his stories are well represented in the past (like the ""Cargo Cult"") but this makes a good compendium.a"

180,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77291875-ramu-vairavan,4,"This is a fine collection of Feynman's lectures, interviews and writing that introduces us to the man, scientist and Nobel laureate. Through his stories, Feynman paints an enigmatic character out of his father that rivals his own. And so we really get to meet two interesting people.A few things I gathered from this collection: Feynman is all about ideas. He plays with them like a child plays with toys. His imagination is vast, he dreamed up advancements in nanotechnology decades before they were made. He's very gutsy too, not afraid to ask questions. He's a serial fun-seeker, and he saw much pleasure in figuring things out. This is evident in his little adventures and funny anecdotes, of which I found his lock picking exploits at Los Alamos and his story about turning himself into a lab rat in a counting experiment memorable.One grudge I have is that brilliant people often don't talk enough to share their thoughts with us while others talk too much without being asked. Feynman distinguished himself as being both brilliant and vocal. His take on scientific matters was fresh in his day and is still so.Would recommend this book to folks who like getting to know other curious folks, Feynman definitely was one. It may get a little repetitive as Feynman rehashes stories at different occasions, but there's still good material in there - a good mix of technical and non-technical pieces from a range of topics/settings."
181,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,5,"This book has helped me understand better the highly intellectual man, Richard Feynman, whom I have come to love so very much. This compilation of talks, interviews, and lectures throw light on Feynman's work, ideas, relationships, and philosophy. The essay 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' shows the inception of Feynman's disposition to science and the didactic relationship with his father, while 'Los Alamos from Below' shows his playful relationship with his wife, and how he constantly tries to push boundaries. 'It's as simple as One, Two, Three' shows his curious and restless nature, his love for experimenting absurdities, and his need for proving or disproving things. Many of the more scientific essays involve his ideas and thoughts on computing machines, improving efficiencies, and trying to constantly challenge science.The essays I enjoyed the most had more philosophical undertones and covered the topics of religion, pseudoscience, the value and role of science. His approach to the untruths and the half-truths is empathetic, and he strongly encourages deeper exploration and uprooting rather than dismissing them on the face of it. His attitude to the unknown is very easy on the conscience, and seems to be what keeps him going actively.A few essays have redundant points and incidents, but as an admirer of the queer and wise Feynman, it was my pleasure to indulge in the repeats."

183,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43687-elena,4,"Like my affinity for Harold Bloom, Richard Feynman can do no wrong in my book. He was a man that thought outside the box, and was ahead beyond the technology of his time. However, what left the most lasting impression in this book is when Feynman turns into a bit of a philosopher and it made me think for days.Feynman discusses the Heritages of Western Civilization:Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientifice spirit of adventure- the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it-the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics- the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual- the humility of the spirit. How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of Western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem our time?It is this question that has left me after reading all of his lectures. "

I did not know a lot about Feynman before reading it ,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.I really loved Feynman's view of the world , the way he saw things and how he talked about what he liked , one could easily feel his passion ,the genuineness of his words, the genius mind he had. the only problem was that it was too ""scientific"" for me at some points ,thus this ""non scientific"" review , but that is not the book's fault.I have to say though that I didn't necessarily agree with everything he said , but overall I liked his points of view , and how he expressed them, and had a lot of fun reading them."

That book was deep, thoughtful, inspirational.This book isn't bad, definitely, but the format is slightly different. Because the book consists of a set of interviews, the narration is not that smooth, different ""chapters"" has similar ideas just because each chapter is just a speech that Mr Faynman gave at some time. And of course, they won't be that deep either.I would say that if you didn't read ""You're Joking"", read it. If you'll like it (and you definitely will) you can read this book next year, just to remind yourself about one of the greatest minds of the century."
186,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"Feynman has a wonderfully readable voice. 90% of this wasn't too over-my-head technical, the pieces selected for this collection were mostly Feynman musing about things or sharing stories. His enthusiasm for physics and discovery reminded me of Carl Sagan's similar enthusiasm that comes through in his books. I have to wonder why none of my science and math classes in school did anything to exposure us to this enthusiasm. People really, really like science and math! Who knew? None of my teachers, apparently."
187,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67146179-april,5,"Must read! This collection of pieces is telling of Feynman's unmistakable character of no nonsense, and therefore meaningful insight into concepts of science, and of science and its relationship with factions of life, including a great postulation on the meaning of life. His ideas are refreshingly logical, comically anecdotal, and are articulated in a pleasing conversational tone which articulates concepts so fluidly. I found that Feynman actually indirectly offers a great way to approach life and its challenges, one parallel to the logic he offers."

Indeed, his thoughts on social science are still debated today, particularly about the balance of applying the scientific method with art of explaining human behaviour, as well as the problem of disincetivized replication. In any case, this collection of short works is a great introduction to the thoughts of the brilliant Richard Feynman, from his childhood and father, to his involvement in the Manhattan Project."
189,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419583-kimber,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Richard Feynman is such a character and an interesting person. I especially like the topic because my research is in nanoengineering and he is considered the father of nanotechnology. This is a collection of interviews and speeches so it's a little different from normal writing. I got such a kick out of chapter 3. It's fairly technical, but it's worth it once you get to the end. I plan on reading more of his books."
190,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175087-brian,2,"The parts about Feynman's descriptions of how his father taught him to be curious about nature and his humorous accounts of his time at Los Alamos were the best parts of the book. I also enjoyed his recollections of his work on quantum electodynamics while teaching at Cornell University, the work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. I was much less interested in most of the rest of this book and had some difficulty getting through it."
191,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,2,"The problem with The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is that it wasn't pleasurable. I didn't find Feynman to be that clear of a communicator. His core ideas, questions, metaphors and examples were solid and interesting. However, despite the anthologist's desire to have Feynman's speeches transcribed exactly, these selections could have benefited from a stricter and more heartless editor, and rearrangement in a more sensible order. Perhaps it would have been better in an audio format."
192,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8910683-nicol-s-rivas,2,"An ego book. All that is interesting in this book is only interesting because Feynman said it. Remove the author and the anecdotes are boring, the philosophy shallow (although clear, precise) and there is no real science in the book. Feynman shines when he talks about physics, his Lectures books are impressive, masterful, but there's is very little of that in this book."

More than half scientists are atheists. Science is about doubt and uncertainty. In science there are no absolute false and true things. Ignorance is acknowledged.This scientific mentality of doubt is the applied to all areas of thinking. The question is there a God is replaced with how sure is it that there is a God? This subtle change is of utmost importance and represents the difference between religion and science. Absolute certainty doesn't exists in true scientists even the religious ones.Facts of science also challenge religious vlaims.Morality without religion.Atheism and communism. In communism all the answers (political and moral) are provided without explanation or doubt. This is the antithesis of science. Democracy is closer to science with its discussion and ability for modification.Science doesn't impact the ethical aspect of religion [or life].There is a conflic in fact and in spirit between science and religion when it comes to the metaphysical claims of religion [he means the factualy claims of religion and the certainty of it vs the uncertainty of science].Moral questions outside of the scope of science. Therefore science is not against religious ethics.Two great pillars of Western civilization:1. Acknowledging the unknown and ignorance. Huminilty.2. Christian ethics.How do we draw inspiration without the two getting into conflict? The question of our age."
200,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81414366-susmit-islam,5,"First let me tell you what this book ISN'T about. It's not a book that will teach you about relativity or quantum mechanics or any other area of physics or science. If you're going in expecting a bunch of explanations about how the world works - this ain't that book.What, then, is the point of reading this book, titled ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"", if it doesn't tell you any of the fun stuff?You see, we spend all these years in school ""learning"" science. We call ourselves scientific and all, but no - we ARE NOT. All we do is take the works of the previous scientists for granted, as long as they don't directly contradict our own beliefs and prejudices. But science isn't about blind belief. It's about constantly doubting your understanding of nature. In fact that's what experimental science is all about - finding data that our theories can't explain, leading to better theories. We tend to think of science as ""the subject that gives you all the answers"". No, that's not science. That's never science. Science is about constant questioning of your previous assumptions.Feynman puts it this way: ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."" But that's not all. If you just keep on believing that the experts are wrong - that ain't science either. You have to TEST your (and the experts') beliefs to call your opinion scientific. And that testing too has to be rigorous, eliminating biases, minimizing false positives and all that. We have a tendency of calling everything ""scientific"" nowadays, because that gives things a humongous shield of credibility, though a major portion of those are, in reality, pseudoscience. They tell you ""this is a scientifically proven way of teaching best"" ""this is a scientifically proven way of pooping"" or stuff like that, but most of those are poorly experimented - people just believe those are true with little asking for evidence. This book serves as a guide for living in this world, for understanding why ""unscientific"" isn't always bad. This teaches you the REAL essence of the scientific method - which probably was never taught to you in school. A must read for any man wishing to live in this era of science where distinguishing between real science and pseudoscience has become tougher than ever for the lay people."
201,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9084927-marsha,5,"So many aspects and interesting points! Richard P Feynman's father appears to have been wonderful! Education, by him, was finding out how to find out. He personally had no scientific training or education, but he knew about science and what it was and what learning it was!This book is a collection of stories that Feynman has given or commented on over the years. It's a fascinating collection of knowledge and thoughts. I like the fact that it confirms my belief that science is not about knowledge, and doubt is an essential part of life. The problem with pseudoscience and fundamental religion is that they require certainty and they do not allow for ""I don't know"" or ""I have doubt, but let's see what there is and how reality works"". And the ""recognition"" really doesn't mean anything, the important thing is learning; it's answering questions.And his sequence on ""what use is it?"" really hit home with me, particularly his thoughts about the age of the universe and faraway stars that really don't affect us. These are things that my husband finds interesting, but I don't understand why he studies them. The answer is"" to find out! It's interesting!"" I don't agree that it's interesting for the most part, but ""to find out"" is, as Feynman points out, are perfectly legitimate answer!Some of his stories are well represented in the past (like the ""Cargo Cult"") but this makes a good compendium.a"

He has a very interesting perspective on the world, really seeking to understand why things work rather than just knowing names for certain phenomena. He also really emphasizes the importance of doubt and skepticism in both science and life. Today this is extra important; not many people understand this. Absolutes, unless they are tautologies, are probably false. This is most apparent in the fields of politics and religion (and scarily, one side of the former is becoming more and more like the later). Anyways, this was an interesting read, and you can split it up, as the chapters read just the same stand alone. A couple of the parts made me do a double take, as they were tinged with the sexism of the day. But overall, a good insight into this genius’s mind. "

Keeping that in mind, the net content of this book is pretty good and helps you learn more about the technical bits and about Feynman's approach to things.

210,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77291875-ramu-vairavan,4,"This is a fine collection of Feynman's lectures, interviews and writing that introduces us to the man, scientist and Nobel laureate. Through his stories, Feynman paints an enigmatic character out of his father that rivals his own. And so we really get to meet two interesting people.A few things I gathered from this collection: Feynman is all about ideas. He plays with them like a child plays with toys. His imagination is vast, he dreamed up advancements in nanotechnology decades before they were made. He's very gutsy too, not afraid to ask questions. He's a serial fun-seeker, and he saw much pleasure in figuring things out. This is evident in his little adventures and funny anecdotes, of which I found his lock picking exploits at Los Alamos and his story about turning himself into a lab rat in a counting experiment memorable.One grudge I have is that brilliant people often don't talk enough to share their thoughts with us while others talk too much without being asked. Feynman distinguished himself as being both brilliant and vocal. His take on scientific matters was fresh in his day and is still so.Would recommend this book to folks who like getting to know other curious folks, Feynman definitely was one. It may get a little repetitive as Feynman rehashes stories at different occasions, but there's still good material in there - a good mix of technical and non-technical pieces from a range of topics/settings."
211,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,5,"This book has helped me understand better the highly intellectual man, Richard Feynman, whom I have come to love so very much. This compilation of talks, interviews, and lectures throw light on Feynman's work, ideas, relationships, and philosophy. The essay 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' shows the inception of Feynman's disposition to science and the didactic relationship with his father, while 'Los Alamos from Below' shows his playful relationship with his wife, and how he constantly tries to push boundaries. 'It's as simple as One, Two, Three' shows his curious and restless nature, his love for experimenting absurdities, and his need for proving or disproving things. Many of the more scientific essays involve his ideas and thoughts on computing machines, improving efficiencies, and trying to constantly challenge science.The essays I enjoyed the most had more philosophical undertones and covered the topics of religion, pseudoscience, the value and role of science. His approach to the untruths and the half-truths is empathetic, and he strongly encourages deeper exploration and uprooting rather than dismissing them on the face of it. His attitude to the unknown is very easy on the conscience, and seems to be what keeps him going actively.A few essays have redundant points and incidents, but as an admirer of the queer and wise Feynman, it was my pleasure to indulge in the repeats."

213,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43687-elena,4,"Like my affinity for Harold Bloom, Richard Feynman can do no wrong in my book. He was a man that thought outside the box, and was ahead beyond the technology of his time. However, what left the most lasting impression in this book is when Feynman turns into a bit of a philosopher and it made me think for days.Feynman discusses the Heritages of Western Civilization:Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientifice spirit of adventure- the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it-the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics- the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual- the humility of the spirit. How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of Western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem our time?It is this question that has left me after reading all of his lectures. "

I did not know a lot about Feynman before reading it ,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.I really loved Feynman's view of the world , the way he saw things and how he talked about what he liked , one could easily feel his passion ,the genuineness of his words, the genius mind he had. the only problem was that it was too ""scientific"" for me at some points ,thus this ""non scientific"" review , but that is not the book's fault.I have to say though that I didn't necessarily agree with everything he said , but overall I liked his points of view , and how he expressed them, and had a lot of fun reading them."
215,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7292913-sergey-teplyakov,3,"When I first read a fabulous ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" I was shocked. That book was deep, thoughtful, inspirational.This book isn't bad, definitely, but the format is slightly different. Because the book consists of a set of interviews, the narration is not that smooth, different ""chapters"" has similar ideas just because each chapter is just a speech that Mr Faynman gave at some time. And of course, they won't be that deep either.I would say that if you didn't read ""You're Joking"", read it. If you'll like it (and you definitely will) you can read this book next year, just to remind yourself about one of the greatest minds of the century."
216,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"Feynman has a wonderfully readable voice. 90% of this wasn't too over-my-head technical, the pieces selected for this collection were mostly Feynman musing about things or sharing stories. His enthusiasm for physics and discovery reminded me of Carl Sagan's similar enthusiasm that comes through in his books. I have to wonder why none of my science and math classes in school did anything to exposure us to this enthusiasm. People really, really like science and math! Who knew? None of my teachers, apparently."
217,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67146179-april,5,"Must read! This collection of pieces is telling of Feynman's unmistakable character of no nonsense, and therefore meaningful insight into concepts of science, and of science and its relationship with factions of life, including a great postulation on the meaning of life. His ideas are refreshingly logical, comically anecdotal, and are articulated in a pleasing conversational tone which articulates concepts so fluidly. I found that Feynman actually indirectly offers a great way to approach life and its challenges, one parallel to the logic he offers."
218,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,4,"You know someone is truly remarkable when you can't help but nod in agreement when they call your general field of study a cargo cult science. Indeed, his thoughts on social science are still debated today, particularly about the balance of applying the scientific method with art of explaining human behaviour, as well as the problem of disincetivized replication. In any case, this collection of short works is a great introduction to the thoughts of the brilliant Richard Feynman, from his childhood and father, to his involvement in the Manhattan Project."
219,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419583-kimber,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Richard Feynman is such a character and an interesting person. I especially like the topic because my research is in nanoengineering and he is considered the father of nanotechnology. This is a collection of interviews and speeches so it's a little different from normal writing. I got such a kick out of chapter 3. It's fairly technical, but it's worth it once you get to the end. I plan on reading more of his books."
220,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175087-brian,2,"The parts about Feynman's descriptions of how his father taught him to be curious about nature and his humorous accounts of his time at Los Alamos were the best parts of the book. I also enjoyed his recollections of his work on quantum electodynamics while teaching at Cornell University, the work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. I was much less interested in most of the rest of this book and had some difficulty getting through it."
221,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,2,"The problem with The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is that it wasn't pleasurable. I didn't find Feynman to be that clear of a communicator. His core ideas, questions, metaphors and examples were solid and interesting. However, despite the anthologist's desire to have Feynman's speeches transcribed exactly, these selections could have benefited from a stricter and more heartless editor, and rearrangement in a more sensible order. Perhaps it would have been better in an audio format."
222,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8910683-nicol-s-rivas,2,"An ego book. All that is interesting in this book is only interesting because Feynman said it. Remove the author and the anecdotes are boring, the philosophy shallow (although clear, precise) and there is no real science in the book. Feynman shines when he talks about physics, his Lectures books are impressive, masterful, but there's is very little of that in this book."
223,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,This is a fantastic book about being a scientist and academic while still keeping you feet grounded.I think it would be helpful for junior high school children to read to show them how having an observant and inquisitive mindset about reality can be rewarding.I recommend this for everyone 15 years and older.
224,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3972188-ian,4,"Most of the ideas and stories here are in, Surely You're Joking... or What Do You Care... but they're good enough that I enjoyed hearing them again. In fact, a bunch of the ideas get repeated from essay to essay within the book. The new content was just as fun and surprising as anything from the memoirs."
225,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77786871-dimitris-gabriel,3,"Nice overview of things from an enthusiastic physicist with many details that may cause you to jump lines as you read. The back cover is so excited but didn't follow my expectations, although i underline many quotes. Feynman memorizes his father's way to teach him things and ways to develop his ability to think. Nice examples for new fathers between the lines of physics, bombs and computers"
226,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,3,"I was pleasantly surprised that Richard Feynman has done some serious thinking about computing. I absolutely loved to read about his thoughts on that!Other than that this book leaves you with the usual awe towards Richard Feynman, and an inevitable longing to attain his intellectual heights."
227,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30909695-juan-duarte,3,while an enjoyable read the author tends to ramble and go on tangents. It's interesting to read some of the ideas he had and seeing them in production today one quickly comes to realize how sharp his mind was.

How he was requruited by a friend.Liked Rober Oppenheimer and his care about everyone. Beautiful scenes in Los Alamos.Relationship with Hans Beta. Beta was really good at arithmetic and Feyan learnt from him.Feynman picked a room next to the girls dormitory. He does a trick by placing his wife's clothes on the top bed so that no one shares the room with him. He didn't know, but this caused the town to prevent women from getting into men dormitory.Letter censorship and checking by government.

More than half scientists are atheists. Science is about doubt and uncertainty. In science there are no absolute false and true things. Ignorance is acknowledged.This scientific mentality of doubt is the applied to all areas of thinking. The question is there a God is replaced with how sure is it that there is a God? This subtle change is of utmost importance and represents the difference between religion and science. Absolute certainty doesn't exists in true scientists even the religious ones.Facts of science also challenge religious vlaims.Morality without religion.Atheism and communism. In communism all the answers (political and moral) are provided without explanation or doubt. This is the antithesis of science. Democracy is closer to science with its discussion and ability for modification.Science doesn't impact the ethical aspect of religion [or life].There is a conflic in fact and in spirit between science and religion when it comes to the metaphysical claims of religion [he means the factualy claims of religion and the certainty of it vs the uncertainty of science].Moral questions outside of the scope of science. Therefore science is not against religious ethics.Two great pillars of Western civilization:1. Acknowledging the unknown and ignorance. Huminilty.2. Christian ethics.How do we draw inspiration without the two getting into conflict? The question of our age."
230,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81414366-susmit-islam,5,"First let me tell you what this book ISN'T about. It's not a book that will teach you about relativity or quantum mechanics or any other area of physics or science. If you're going in expecting a bunch of explanations about how the world works - this ain't that book.What, then, is the point of reading this book, titled ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"", if it doesn't tell you any of the fun stuff?You see, we spend all these years in school ""learning"" science. We call ourselves scientific and all, but no - we ARE NOT. All we do is take the works of the previous scientists for granted, as long as they don't directly contradict our own beliefs and prejudices. But science isn't about blind belief. It's about constantly doubting your understanding of nature. In fact that's what experimental science is all about - finding data that our theories can't explain, leading to better theories. We tend to think of science as ""the subject that gives you all the answers"". No, that's not science. That's never science. Science is about constant questioning of your previous assumptions.Feynman puts it this way: ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."" But that's not all. If you just keep on believing that the experts are wrong - that ain't science either. You have to TEST your (and the experts') beliefs to call your opinion scientific. And that testing too has to be rigorous, eliminating biases, minimizing false positives and all that. We have a tendency of calling everything ""scientific"" nowadays, because that gives things a humongous shield of credibility, though a major portion of those are, in reality, pseudoscience. They tell you ""this is a scientifically proven way of teaching best"" ""this is a scientifically proven way of pooping"" or stuff like that, but most of those are poorly experimented - people just believe those are true with little asking for evidence. This book serves as a guide for living in this world, for understanding why ""unscientific"" isn't always bad. This teaches you the REAL essence of the scientific method - which probably was never taught to you in school. A must read for any man wishing to live in this era of science where distinguishing between real science and pseudoscience has become tougher than ever for the lay people."
231,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9084927-marsha,5,"So many aspects and interesting points! Richard P Feynman's father appears to have been wonderful! Education, by him, was finding out how to find out. He personally had no scientific training or education, but he knew about science and what it was and what learning it was!This book is a collection of stories that Feynman has given or commented on over the years. It's a fascinating collection of knowledge and thoughts. I like the fact that it confirms my belief that science is not about knowledge, and doubt is an essential part of life. The problem with pseudoscience and fundamental religion is that they require certainty and they do not allow for ""I don't know"" or ""I have doubt, but let's see what there is and how reality works"". And the ""recognition"" really doesn't mean anything, the important thing is learning; it's answering questions.And his sequence on ""what use is it?"" really hit home with me, particularly his thoughts about the age of the universe and faraway stars that really don't affect us. These are things that my husband finds interesting, but I don't understand why he studies them. The answer is"" to find out! It's interesting!"" I don't agree that it's interesting for the most part, but ""to find out"" is, as Feynman points out, are perfectly legitimate answer!Some of his stories are well represented in the past (like the ""Cargo Cult"") but this makes a good compendium.a"
232,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51883014-abby,4,"The dude is obviously very smart. He has a very interesting perspective on the world, really seeking to understand why things work rather than just knowing names for certain phenomena. He also really emphasizes the importance of doubt and skepticism in both science and life. Today this is extra important; not many people understand this. Absolutes, unless they are tautologies, are probably false. This is most apparent in the fields of politics and religion (and scarily, one side of the former is becoming more and more like the later). Anyways, this was an interesting read, and you can split it up, as the chapters read just the same stand alone. A couple of the parts made me do a double take, as they were tinged with the sexism of the day. But overall, a good insight into this genius’s mind. "

Keeping that in mind, the net content of this book is pretty good and helps you learn more about the technical bits and about Feynman's approach to things. If you've read the other 2 books focused on stories by Feynman, this book can be skimmed."

This compilation of talks, interviews, and lectures throw light on Feynman's work, ideas, relationships, and philosophy. The essay 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out' shows the inception of Feynman's disposition to science and the didactic relationship with his father, while 'Los Alamos from Below' shows his playful relationship with his wife, and how he constantly tries to push boundaries. 'It's as simple as One, Two, Three' shows his curious and restless nature, his love for experimenting absurdities, and his need for proving or disproving things. Many of the more scientific essays involve his ideas and thoughts on computing machines, improving efficiencies, and trying to constantly challenge science.The essays I enjoyed the most had more philosophical undertones and covered the topics of religion, pseudoscience, the value and role of science. His approach to the untruths and the half-truths is empathetic, and he strongly encourages deeper exploration and uprooting rather than dismissing them on the face of it. His attitude to the unknown is very easy on the conscience, and seems to be what keeps him going actively.A few essays have redundant points and incidents, but as an admirer of the queer and wise Feynman, it was my pleasure to indulge in the repeats."

243,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43687-elena,4,"Like my affinity for Harold Bloom, Richard Feynman can do no wrong in my book. He was a man that thought outside the box, and was ahead beyond the technology of his time. However, what left the most lasting impression in this book is when Feynman turns into a bit of a philosopher and it made me think for days.Feynman discusses the Heritages of Western Civilization:Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientifice spirit of adventure- the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it-the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics- the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual- the humility of the spirit. How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of Western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem our time?It is this question that has left me after reading all of his lectures. "

I did not know a lot about Feynman before reading it ,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.I really loved Feynman's view of the world , the way he saw things and how he talked about what he liked , one could easily feel his passion ,the genuineness of his words, the genius mind he had. the only problem was that it was too ""scientific"" for me at some points ,thus this ""non scientific"" review , but that is not the book's fault.I have to say though that I didn't necessarily agree with everything he said , but overall I liked his points of view , and how he expressed them, and had a lot of fun reading them."
245,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7292913-sergey-teplyakov,3,"When I first read a fabulous ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" I was shocked. That book was deep, thoughtful, inspirational.This book isn't bad, definitely, but the format is slightly different. Because the book consists of a set of interviews, the narration is not that smooth, different ""chapters"" has similar ideas just because each chapter is just a speech that Mr Faynman gave at some time. And of course, they won't be that deep either.I would say that if you didn't read ""You're Joking"", read it. If you'll like it (and you definitely will) you can read this book next year, just to remind yourself about one of the greatest minds of the century."
246,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"Feynman has a wonderfully readable voice. 90% of this wasn't too over-my-head technical, the pieces selected for this collection were mostly Feynman musing about things or sharing stories. His enthusiasm for physics and discovery reminded me of Carl Sagan's similar enthusiasm that comes through in his books. I have to wonder why none of my science and math classes in school did anything to exposure us to this enthusiasm. People really, really like science and math! Who knew? None of my teachers, apparently."
247,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67146179-april,5,"Must read! This collection of pieces is telling of Feynman's unmistakable character of no nonsense, and therefore meaningful insight into concepts of science, and of science and its relationship with factions of life, including a great postulation on the meaning of life. His ideas are refreshingly logical, comically anecdotal, and are articulated in a pleasing conversational tone which articulates concepts so fluidly. I found that Feynman actually indirectly offers a great way to approach life and its challenges, one parallel to the logic he offers."
248,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,4,"You know someone is truly remarkable when you can't help but nod in agreement when they call your general field of study a cargo cult science. Indeed, his thoughts on social science are still debated today, particularly about the balance of applying the scientific method with art of explaining human behaviour, as well as the problem of disincetivized replication. In any case, this collection of short works is a great introduction to the thoughts of the brilliant Richard Feynman, from his childhood and father, to his involvement in the Manhattan Project."
249,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419583-kimber,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Richard Feynman is such a character and an interesting person. I especially like the topic because my research is in nanoengineering and he is considered the father of nanotechnology. This is a collection of interviews and speeches so it's a little different from normal writing. I got such a kick out of chapter 3. It's fairly technical, but it's worth it once you get to the end. I plan on reading more of his books."
250,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175087-brian,2,"The parts about Feynman's descriptions of how his father taught him to be curious about nature and his humorous accounts of his time at Los Alamos were the best parts of the book. I also enjoyed his recollections of his work on quantum electodynamics while teaching at Cornell University, the work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. I was much less interested in most of the rest of this book and had some difficulty getting through it."
251,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,2,"The problem with The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is that it wasn't pleasurable. I didn't find Feynman to be that clear of a communicator. His core ideas, questions, metaphors and examples were solid and interesting. However, despite the anthologist's desire to have Feynman's speeches transcribed exactly, these selections could have benefited from a stricter and more heartless editor, and rearrangement in a more sensible order. Perhaps it would have been better in an audio format."
252,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8910683-nicol-s-rivas,2,"An ego book. All that is interesting in this book is only interesting because Feynman said it. Remove the author and the anecdotes are boring, the philosophy shallow (although clear, precise) and there is no real science in the book. Feynman shines when he talks about physics, his Lectures books are impressive, masterful, but there's is very little of that in this book."
253,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,This is a fantastic book about being a scientist and academic while still keeping you feet grounded.I think it would be helpful for junior high school children to read to show them how having an observant and inquisitive mindset about reality can be rewarding.I recommend this for everyone 15 years and older.
254,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3972188-ian,4,"Most of the ideas and stories here are in, Surely You're Joking... or What Do You Care... but they're good enough that I enjoyed hearing them again. In fact, a bunch of the ideas get repeated from essay to essay within the book. The new content was just as fun and surprising as anything from the memoirs."

The back cover is so excited but didn't follow my expectations, although i underline many quotes. Feynman memorizes his father's way to teach him things and ways to develop his ability to think. Nice examples for new fathers between the lines of physics, bombs and computers"

How he was requruited by a friend.Liked Rober Oppenheimer and his care about everyone. Beautiful scenes in Los Alamos.Relationship with Hans Beta. Beta was really good at arithmetic and Feyan learnt from him.Feynman picked a room next to the girls dormitory. He does a trick by placing his wife's clothes on the top bed so that no one shares the room with him. He didn't know, but this caused the town to prevent women from getting into men dormitory.Letter censorship and checking by government.

More than half scientists are atheists. Science is about doubt and uncertainty. In science there are no absolute false and true things. Ignorance is acknowledged.This scientific mentality of doubt is the applied to all areas of thinking. The question is there a God is replaced with how sure is it that there is a God? This subtle change is of utmost importance and represents the difference between religion and science. Absolute certainty doesn't exists in true scientists even the religious ones.Facts of science also challenge religious vlaims.Morality without religion.Atheism and communism. In communism all the answers (political and moral) are provided without explanation or doubt. This is the antithesis of science. Democracy is closer to science with its discussion and ability for modification.Science doesn't impact the ethical aspect of religion [or life].There is a conflic in fact and in spirit between science and religion when it comes to the metaphysical claims of religion [he means the factualy claims of religion and the certainty of it vs the uncertainty of science].Moral questions outside of the scope of science. Therefore science is not against religious ethics.Two great pillars of Western civilization:1. Acknowledging the unknown and ignorance. Huminilty.2. Christian ethics.How do we draw inspiration without the two getting into conflict? The question of our age."
260,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81414366-susmit-islam,5,"First let me tell you what this book ISN'T about. It's not a book that will teach you about relativity or quantum mechanics or any other area of physics or science. If you're going in expecting a bunch of explanations about how the world works - this ain't that book.What, then, is the point of reading this book, titled ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"", if it doesn't tell you any of the fun stuff?You see, we spend all these years in school ""learning"" science. We call ourselves scientific and all, but no - we ARE NOT. All we do is take the works of the previous scientists for granted, as long as they don't directly contradict our own beliefs and prejudices. But science isn't about blind belief. It's about constantly doubting your understanding of nature. In fact that's what experimental science is all about - finding data that our theories can't explain, leading to better theories. We tend to think of science as ""the subject that gives you all the answers"". No, that's not science. That's never science. Science is about constant questioning of your previous assumptions.Feynman puts it this way: ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."" But that's not all. If you just keep on believing that the experts are wrong - that ain't science either. You have to TEST your (and the experts') beliefs to call your opinion scientific. And that testing too has to be rigorous, eliminating biases, minimizing false positives and all that. We have a tendency of calling everything ""scientific"" nowadays, because that gives things a humongous shield of credibility, though a major portion of those are, in reality, pseudoscience. They tell you ""this is a scientifically proven way of teaching best"" ""this is a scientifically proven way of pooping"" or stuff like that, but most of those are poorly experimented - people just believe those are true with little asking for evidence. This book serves as a guide for living in this world, for understanding why ""unscientific"" isn't always bad. This teaches you the REAL essence of the scientific method - which probably was never taught to you in school. A must read for any man wishing to live in this era of science where distinguishing between real science and pseudoscience has become tougher than ever for the lay people."
261,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9084927-marsha,5,"So many aspects and interesting points! Richard P Feynman's father appears to have been wonderful! Education, by him, was finding out how to find out. He personally had no scientific training or education, but he knew about science and what it was and what learning it was!This book is a collection of stories that Feynman has given or commented on over the years. It's a fascinating collection of knowledge and thoughts. I like the fact that it confirms my belief that science is not about knowledge, and doubt is an essential part of life. The problem with pseudoscience and fundamental religion is that they require certainty and they do not allow for ""I don't know"" or ""I have doubt, but let's see what there is and how reality works"". And the ""recognition"" really doesn't mean anything, the important thing is learning; it's answering questions.And his sequence on ""what use is it?"" really hit home with me, particularly his thoughts about the age of the universe and faraway stars that really don't affect us. These are things that my husband finds interesting, but I don't understand why he studies them. The answer is"" to find out! It's interesting!"" I don't agree that it's interesting for the most part, but ""to find out"" is, as Feynman points out, are perfectly legitimate answer!Some of his stories are well represented in the past (like the ""Cargo Cult"") but this makes a good compendium.a"
262,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51883014-abby,4,"The dude is obviously very smart. He has a very interesting perspective on the world, really seeking to understand why things work rather than just knowing names for certain phenomena. He also really emphasizes the importance of doubt and skepticism in both science and life. Today this is extra important; not many people understand this. Absolutes, unless they are tautologies, are probably false. This is most apparent in the fields of politics and religion (and scarily, one side of the former is becoming more and more like the later). Anyways, this was an interesting read, and you can split it up, as the chapters read just the same stand alone. A couple of the parts made me do a double take, as they were tinged with the sexism of the day. But overall, a good insight into this genius’s mind. "
263,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35021800-tarang-shah,4,"This one is a simple collection of Feynman's interviews and speeches, along with some stories from the other two books (Surely you're joking and What do you care what other people think).Since Feynman gave the interviews and speeches independent of each other, and much before anybody thought to publish this kind of book, there is quite a bit of repetition. Keeping that in mind, the net content of this book is pretty good and helps you learn more about the technical bits and about Feynman's approach to things. If you've read the other 2 books focused on stories by Feynman, this book can be skimmed."

Through his stories, Feynman paints an enigmatic character out of his father that rivals his own. And so we really get to meet two interesting people.A few things I gathered from this collection: Feynman is all about ideas. He plays with them like a child plays with toys. His imagination is vast, he dreamed up advancements in nanotechnology decades before they were made. He's very gutsy too, not afraid to ask questions. He's a serial fun-seeker, and he saw much pleasure in figuring things out. This is evident in his little adventures and funny anecdotes, of which I found his lock picking exploits at Los Alamos and his story about turning himself into a lab rat in a counting experiment memorable.One grudge I have is that brilliant people often don't talk enough to share their thoughts with us while others talk too much without being asked. Feynman distinguished himself as being both brilliant and vocal. His take on scientific matters was fresh in his day and is still so.Would recommend this book to folks who like getting to know other curious folks, Feynman definitely was one. It may get a little repetitive as Feynman rehashes stories at different occasions, but there's still good material in there - a good mix of technical and non-technical pieces from a range of topics/settings."

273,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43687-elena,4,"Like my affinity for Harold Bloom, Richard Feynman can do no wrong in my book. He was a man that thought outside the box, and was ahead beyond the technology of his time. However, what left the most lasting impression in this book is when Feynman turns into a bit of a philosopher and it made me think for days.Feynman discusses the Heritages of Western Civilization:Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientifice spirit of adventure- the adventure into the unknown, an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered; the attitude that all is uncertain; to summarize it-the humility of the intellect. The other great heritage is Christian ethics- the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual- the humility of the spirit. How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of Western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor, mutually unafraid? Is this not the central problem our time?It is this question that has left me after reading all of his lectures. "

I did not know a lot about Feynman before reading it ,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.I really loved Feynman's view of the world , the way he saw things and how he talked about what he liked , one could easily feel his passion ,the genuineness of his words, the genius mind he had. the only problem was that it was too ""scientific"" for me at some points ,thus this ""non scientific"" review , but that is not the book's fault.I have to say though that I didn't necessarily agree with everything he said , but overall I liked his points of view , and how he expressed them, and had a lot of fun reading them."
275,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7292913-sergey-teplyakov,3,"When I first read a fabulous ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" I was shocked. That book was deep, thoughtful, inspirational.This book isn't bad, definitely, but the format is slightly different. Because the book consists of a set of interviews, the narration is not that smooth, different ""chapters"" has similar ideas just because each chapter is just a speech that Mr Faynman gave at some time. And of course, they won't be that deep either.I would say that if you didn't read ""You're Joking"", read it. If you'll like it (and you definitely will) you can read this book next year, just to remind yourself about one of the greatest minds of the century."
276,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"Feynman has a wonderfully readable voice. 90% of this wasn't too over-my-head technical, the pieces selected for this collection were mostly Feynman musing about things or sharing stories. His enthusiasm for physics and discovery reminded me of Carl Sagan's similar enthusiasm that comes through in his books. I have to wonder why none of my science and math classes in school did anything to exposure us to this enthusiasm. People really, really like science and math! Who knew? None of my teachers, apparently."
277,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67146179-april,5,"Must read! This collection of pieces is telling of Feynman's unmistakable character of no nonsense, and therefore meaningful insight into concepts of science, and of science and its relationship with factions of life, including a great postulation on the meaning of life. His ideas are refreshingly logical, comically anecdotal, and are articulated in a pleasing conversational tone which articulates concepts so fluidly. I found that Feynman actually indirectly offers a great way to approach life and its challenges, one parallel to the logic he offers."
278,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,4,"You know someone is truly remarkable when you can't help but nod in agreement when they call your general field of study a cargo cult science. Indeed, his thoughts on social science are still debated today, particularly about the balance of applying the scientific method with art of explaining human behaviour, as well as the problem of disincetivized replication. In any case, this collection of short works is a great introduction to the thoughts of the brilliant Richard Feynman, from his childhood and father, to his involvement in the Manhattan Project."
279,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419583-kimber,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Richard Feynman is such a character and an interesting person. I especially like the topic because my research is in nanoengineering and he is considered the father of nanotechnology. This is a collection of interviews and speeches so it's a little different from normal writing. I got such a kick out of chapter 3. It's fairly technical, but it's worth it once you get to the end. I plan on reading more of his books."
280,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175087-brian,2,"The parts about Feynman's descriptions of how his father taught him to be curious about nature and his humorous accounts of his time at Los Alamos were the best parts of the book. I also enjoyed his recollections of his work on quantum electodynamics while teaching at Cornell University, the work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. I was much less interested in most of the rest of this book and had some difficulty getting through it."
281,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,2,"The problem with The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is that it wasn't pleasurable. I didn't find Feynman to be that clear of a communicator. His core ideas, questions, metaphors and examples were solid and interesting. However, despite the anthologist's desire to have Feynman's speeches transcribed exactly, these selections could have benefited from a stricter and more heartless editor, and rearrangement in a more sensible order. Perhaps it would have been better in an audio format."
282,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8910683-nicol-s-rivas,2,"An ego book. All that is interesting in this book is only interesting because Feynman said it. Remove the author and the anecdotes are boring, the philosophy shallow (although clear, precise) and there is no real science in the book. Feynman shines when he talks about physics, his Lectures books are impressive, masterful, but there's is very little of that in this book."
283,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,This is a fantastic book about being a scientist and academic while still keeping you feet grounded.I think it would be helpful for junior high school children to read to show them how having an observant and inquisitive mindset about reality can be rewarding.I recommend this for everyone 15 years and older.

The back cover is so excited but didn't follow my expectations, although i underline many quotes. Feynman memorizes his father's way to teach him things and ways to develop his ability to think. Nice examples for new fathers between the lines of physics, bombs and computers"

How he was requruited by a friend.Liked Rober Oppenheimer and his care about everyone. Beautiful scenes in Los Alamos.Relationship with Hans Beta. Beta was really good at arithmetic and Feyan learnt from him.Feynman picked a room next to the girls dormitory. He does a trick by placing his wife's clothes on the top bed so that no one shares the room with him. He didn't know, but this caused the town to prevent women from getting into men dormitory.Letter censorship and checking by government. On first day he gets 2 coded letters, one from his father and one from his wife.

Celebrations after the success of the test, except for one person who was actually the only person (Bob) who really thought about the matter.Feynman later thinks about it as well. He became very pessimistic afterwards and thought the world was going to end and that building anything is wrong. [He is still midly pessimistic here giving human race 30 years to survive.

More than half scientists are atheists. Science is about doubt and uncertainty. In science there are no absolute false and true things. Ignorance is acknowledged.This scientific mentality of doubt is the applied to all areas of thinking. The question is there a God is replaced with how sure is it that there is a God? This subtle change is of utmost importance and represents the difference between religion and science. Absolute certainty doesn't exists in true scientists even the religious ones.Facts of science also challenge religious vlaims.Morality without religion.Atheism and communism. In communism all the answers (political and moral) are provided without explanation or doubt. This is the antithesis of science. Democracy is closer to science with its discussion and ability for modification.Science doesn't impact the ethical aspect of religion [or life].There is a conflic in fact and in spirit between science and religion when it comes to the metaphysical claims of religion [he means the factualy claims of religion and the certainty of it vs the uncertainty of science].Moral questions outside of the scope of science. Therefore science is not against religious ethics.Two great pillars of Western civilization:1. Acknowledging the unknown and ignorance. Huminilty.2. Christian ethics.How do we draw inspiration without the two getting into conflict? The question of our age."
290,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81414366-susmit-islam,5,"First let me tell you what this book ISN'T about. It's not a book that will teach you about relativity or quantum mechanics or any other area of physics or science. If you're going in expecting a bunch of explanations about how the world works - this ain't that book.What, then, is the point of reading this book, titled ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"", if it doesn't tell you any of the fun stuff?You see, we spend all these years in school ""learning"" science. We call ourselves scientific and all, but no - we ARE NOT. All we do is take the works of the previous scientists for granted, as long as they don't directly contradict our own beliefs and prejudices. But science isn't about blind belief. It's about constantly doubting your understanding of nature. In fact that's what experimental science is all about - finding data that our theories can't explain, leading to better theories. We tend to think of science as ""the subject that gives you all the answers"". No, that's not science. That's never science. Science is about constant questioning of your previous assumptions.Feynman puts it this way: ""Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."" But that's not all. If you just keep on believing that the experts are wrong - that ain't science either. You have to TEST your (and the experts') beliefs to call your opinion scientific. And that testing too has to be rigorous, eliminating biases, minimizing false positives and all that. We have a tendency of calling everything ""scientific"" nowadays, because that gives things a humongous shield of credibility, though a major portion of those are, in reality, pseudoscience. They tell you ""this is a scientifically proven way of teaching best"" ""this is a scientifically proven way of pooping"" or stuff like that, but most of those are poorly experimented - people just believe those are true with little asking for evidence. This book serves as a guide for living in this world, for understanding why ""unscientific"" isn't always bad. This teaches you the REAL essence of the scientific method - which probably was never taught to you in school. A must read for any man wishing to live in this era of science where distinguishing between real science and pseudoscience has become tougher than ever for the lay people."
291,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9084927-marsha,5,"So many aspects and interesting points! Richard P Feynman's father appears to have been wonderful! Education, by him, was finding out how to find out. He personally had no scientific training or education, but he knew about science and what it was and what learning it was!This book is a collection of stories that Feynman has given or commented on over the years. It's a fascinating collection of knowledge and thoughts. I like the fact that it confirms my belief that science is not about knowledge, and doubt is an essential part of life. The problem with pseudoscience and fundamental religion is that they require certainty and they do not allow for ""I don't know"" or ""I have doubt, but let's see what there is and how reality works"". And the ""recognition"" really doesn't mean anything, the important thing is learning; it's answering questions.And his sequence on ""what use is it?"" really hit home with me, particularly his thoughts about the age of the universe and faraway stars that really don't affect us. These are things that my husband finds interesting, but I don't understand why he studies them. The answer is"" to find out! It's interesting!"" I don't agree that it's interesting for the most part, but ""to find out"" is, as Feynman points out, are perfectly legitimate answer!Some of his stories are well represented in the past (like the ""Cargo Cult"") but this makes a good compendium.a"
292,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51883014-abby,4,"The dude is obviously very smart. He has a very interesting perspective on the world, really seeking to understand why things work rather than just knowing names for certain phenomena. He also really emphasizes the importance of doubt and skepticism in both science and life. Today this is extra important; not many people understand this. Absolutes, unless they are tautologies, are probably false. This is most apparent in the fields of politics and religion (and scarily, one side of the former is becoming more and more like the later). Anyways, this was an interesting read, and you can split it up, as the chapters read just the same stand alone. A couple of the parts made me do a double take, as they were tinged with the sexism of the day. But overall, a good insight into this genius’s mind. "
293,0465013120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35021800-tarang-shah,4,"This one is a simple collection of Feynman's interviews and speeches, along with some stories from the other two books (Surely you're joking and What do you care what other people think).Since Feynman gave the interviews and speeches independent of each other, and much before anybody thought to publish this kind of book, there is quite a bit of repetition. Keeping that in mind, the net content of this book is pretty good and helps you learn more about the technical bits and about Feynman's approach to things. If you've read the other 2 books focused on stories by Feynman, this book can be skimmed."
