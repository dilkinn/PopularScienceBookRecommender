0,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I had forgotten just how good this book actually is. I’ve read most of the popular stuff Diamond has written and enjoyed all of them. My favourite is Guns, Germs and Steel, but this one is also very good.Although this one has a particularly fine title I have to say that it does make me want to ask another equally important question – why are there so few really good television documentaries that come out of the USA. I mean, there was Cosmos, which was mind-blowing, but there have been few that reach the heights of some of the stuff that comes out of the BBC. Connections, Life of Earth, The Ascent of Man, Civilisation, The Body in Question, The Light Fantastic, The Root of All Evil, and these just to name a few life altering documentaries from the BBC (and also just for the sheer joy of listing them).It is not as if good pop science books don’t come out of the USA. In fact, the best pop science books and pop psychology books all come from the US. This is a discrepancy I find completely puzzling.The book asks, and mostly answers, a series of intriguing questions about human sexuality. The questions themselves are so interesting that if I was designing the cover I would just list them there. Not just the first question – and if you ever wanted to sell a book, I’d have thought it would be hard to come up with a better title. But the book is bursting with similarly fascinating questions.Why do we have sex even when there is no chance of pregnancy? This needs answering because most of the other mammals in the world would look at us as incredibly strange for engaging in such odd behaviour.Why don’t men breastfeed? We have most of the equipment and men have been known to produce milk – even without scientific intervention. So, why not?I’m only going to answer one of his questions – he asks, what are men good for? And his answer? Not a lot. Men come out of this book looking rather pathetic. We don’t do nearly as much helping out as women do, we don’t do hardly anything at all except some occasional hunting and ‘alpha’ posing. It is quite unattractive – and that does seem to conform to my understanding of what most men seem to be like.There are lots of other questions in the book, why menopause? Why are women pretty? Why do women have large breasts? And the most surprising ‘answer’ in the book is to the question, why do men have such large penises?The best thing about this book is that it shows that many of these questions have not been completely settled. The questions are clearly important, they are all very easy to ask, but the answers many not be nearly so easy to come by. Diamond presents some of the alternatives here and this makes for a fantastic insight into the scientific method, particularly as it applies to the evolution of various traits and behaviours.This is either a short book or a long essay, take you’re pick, either way, it is a quick read and very interesting.

1,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5194069-jenbebookish,3," While sort of dating somebody that was very, very ill suited for me...so much that I was absolutely certain that we had no future, he would never be introduced to my family, et cetera et cetera, I really started being interested in the subject of sex. Attraction. The difference between women and men's approaches to it, the difference between pure physical attraction and what people call ""chemistry."" Pure, simple sexual attraction and then the kind of attraction that develops. While ultimately I didn't place much stock in the relationship, the undercurrent of sexual tension that buzzed between us was undeniable. I would find myself gazing at him in total awe, body abuzz. And then I'd wonder... why? Sure, I'd found him gorgeous at first sight but it was being in each others company that had done it, now my feelings/opinions had multiplied and it seemed like there had never been anybody MORE gorgeous. the first time he reached for my hand I was buzzin. And I couldn't make sense of it, it was totally out of my hands. Whether or not I wished to be attracted to him this way, I was. Of course I am a human being and with my evolved brain am able to grasp the weight of my choices and their consequences so I am not a slave to my body, but it was my body's reaction that piqued my interest. Like why this person? I'd been around beautiful men plenty, men technically more beautiful than he, why so enamored with this one? And so I've picked up a few books on sex, this one being the 2nd I've read, Bonk by Mary Roach the 1st. So, the fact that I had been looking to learn about something that was kind of specific, this book was a little bit of a let down. But only in the sense that there wasn't enough info on what I wanted to know. Sure, there was a brief mentioning of pheromones and how they are potentially responsible for the ""chemistry"" thing. I guess I wanted them to be a little more specific, like explain what's happening.. draw me a diagram of the route these pheromones take thru me, the synapses and nerves, the brain waves and activity. Maybe I'm just crazy for wanting an explanation for my attractions! There was a lot of random educational info, stuff I am less inclined to care about like the sex lives of animals and the anomalies and rarities that exist in them. An entire one out of the 6 chapters in the book is devoted to animal sex actually, including gems like listing other animals that enjoy sex, others that partake in same sex sex, others that have sex in private like humans instead of out in the open. There was a chapter on menopause (which according to this book is something that happens only to human females.) A chapter on breast feeding and the supposed non-evolution of male lactation, A chapter on gender roles in sex, yadda yadda. It's all interesting enough to read about, but that's because SEX in general is interesting to read about. I still prefer this book to Mary Roach's Bonk because it reported facts in an interesting and witty way without laying on the lame jokes so heavily and ""breaking the fourth wall"" constantly the way Roach does. Also Mary Roach isn't a Dr. or professor on the subject, or any subject, which causes me to mistrust a little more. Jared Diamond (who also wrote Guns, Germs, and Steel) is both a Dr. and Professor of human sexuality. That lends him a little more credibility in my eyes, and it shows in his writing which isn't amateurish the way Roach's is.SO. For anyone looking for a quick and interesting read, sort of random facts about sex/human sexuality this shouldn't disappoint. It's short, and mostly interesting... and written in a manner that an average person can enjoy it. You don't have to be a dr or a scientist to understand it, is what I mean. Tho, it won't explain to you why you just can't seem to get enough of your new gf/bf, or why the sex with your plain jane neighbor is soo much more amazing than with your smoking hot ex. Or why you aren't attracted to Mr. Perfect with the body like a greek god, and yet you are borderline obsessive about the cute cater waiter from last night's dinner. I have two more books on the subject but something tells me that searching for an explanation of my attraction to a man is like searching for the meaning in life...destined to be fruitless forever... but at least reading about sex is never dull ;)"

3,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Writing as a Jared Diamond fan, I am sorry to report that Why is Sex Fun? is a letdown. His central hypothesis is that sex is applied selfish genetics, without so naming it.He argues that the act of procreation in a given specie is predictable given knowns such as is the relative energy investment in the developing egg and what is the certainty of the embryo being the genetic product of either parent. The reader is assumed to have a background in evolution theory and this book applies that information to possible arguments. By extension the argument is that the basics of normal human sexuality are a practical application of that same theory. The title question is answered, if not directly or in so many words. The book is out of date, not much of a standalone book and less interesting than the title promises. The book may have been intended for inclusion in a larger undergraduate reading list. I cannot recommend it.Despite what other reviewers say the title question is answered. Just not in so many words. The answer is more or less the point of Chapter 4, subtitled The Evolution of Recreational Sex.That this book is dated is not entirely Prof. Diamond’s fault. In terms of Evolutionary Science the 20 years since its original publication is a long time. I am not sure it is represents a contribution great enough as to valuable as to justify a rewrite.Prof Diamond asks several questions built around relatively unique aspects of the human sex act. Hidden ovulation; preference for private performance; copulation during times and ages when pregnancy is unlikely or impossible. Some of these things are rare in most animals or at least among our fellow primates. Answering each of the questions is the theme of each chapter. The answer is almost always a matter of applying the rule that adult members of a breeding pair assume roles based on the individual mates energy investment in the young, certainty that the young possess the genetic make of the parent; and that no later sex act or relationship endangers that embryo.Given the brevity of the book there is little space for competing theories or even much discussion of evolutionary theory. Nor is there much in the way of supporting research. In an undergraduate course other reading material may provide for these absences but as a stand-alone book it is not up to the standard of other books by the same author.Prof. Diamond’s explanations can be interesting. He will usually include a survey of species that have or may have had similar practices. The discussion, with diagrams that help to show that the fossil records can provide clues about which extinct species may have practiced some of these behaviors is worth a read. The problem is that he simply states that this kind of analysis is possible and never makes much effort to prove this possibility. Prof Diamond in effect invokes his authority as a sufficient proof. This may work in an undergraduate course, and especially if there are other texts in use in that class. It is not sufficient to make this a standalone read for the general public."
4,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27613955-ashley-reid,2,This was a mostly tedious book to get through. The only thing that stopped it from being 1 star was a few interesting facts and details that bumped the rating.
5,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129343-charity,2,"Why is sex fun? Who the eff cares??? It just IS...if you're doing it right, that is. Ha!I thought the book had a lot of promise, but it failed to deliver on many, many levels. Diamond's lack of footnotes really irked me and I was left questioning a lot of his research. I mean sure, learning about the number of hermaphroditic fashion models really boosted my self-esteem, but hello? Source please! I don't have time to go digging around through his entire bibliography looking for relevance. Ultimately, I learned a lot about animals and very little about humans. C'est la vie."
6,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana,3,"I'll admit I cam into this expecting sociology with a little bit of biology, but instead I got the reverse. There are a lot of comparisons drawn between humans and other species, as an evolutionary explanation for our sexual evolution is attempted. I think not including any observations on how lgbtqia people may fit into the picture is an oversight, but overall this was an informative book."
7,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5669954-taras,2,"It seems that Jared Diamond got better and better with every book he wrote. With practice he got exceptionally good at making comparisons between species, cultures, etc. He also developed a better focus on the subject with every book.However this book was written before any of that. While it is easy to read, it contains little info and has strange examples. It also alludes too often to the author's sex life in a ""Look at me I'm a successfully married man with a sex life...horay!"" way. Diamond tries to explain various reasons for various sexual habits & cycles, goes on rants about the analogous examples in the animal world and attempts to draw occasionally weak parallels to humans. Jared also seems side with certain ""virginal nerd men"" I know in that most men are scumbags and women deserve better. I disagree because women have the option to pick whoever they deserve and I will not accept blanket insults against my sex.I still somewhat recommend this book because of the random bits of information in it. For example: polygamous Mormon men (especially priests) are the peak of male evolution in that that on average the have the most children(25). Plus it's an amusing book to read in public places.The most frustrating aspect of this book is that Diamond forgets to answer the most important question of all - the one on the cover. What the hell? Now upon finishing the book every reader has to go out, experiment and answer the question for themselves."
8,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1583398-chris,2,"Shame on Mr. Diamond for luring me in with this clever title. What this book really is is a scholarly tome for the serious anthropology student. It is interesting that, when it comes to sex, humans do a lot of things very differently than even our closest animal cousins. The book looks at why men have nipples, why humans continue to have sex even during pregnancy when there's no chance of additional procreation, and how various species evolved with obvious or hidden signs of ovulation (complete with charts going back to the missing link). The bottom line is, almost all animals have sex solely for passing on their genes. One of the most interesting story is about a species of male bird who sets up one mate in a nest and makes sure the hatchlings are on their way and then goes and sets up another nest with another mate, flying back and forth between both families. Meanwhile, other males may be lying in wait to ""spend time"" with a female while her mate is away. But other than that, the book can get pretty dry. There's a long discussion of the possible benefits of hidden ovulation. Does it keep the man around because he never knows for sure when the female is fertile? I'm not sure Diamond ever answered this question; I think I may have fallen asleep. Sex is fun; Why Is Sex Fun? is not. "
9,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42189561-abu-hayat-khan,5,"in case if you frown upon the title, I would like to highlight that the author is a biologist, he is neither a saint nor a sinner. biology as a science has a sort of philosophical completeness that the physics, the most fundamental of all science doesn’t possess. biology can answer both “how” and “why” questions. molecular biology and/or genetics do answer the question of “how”, for example, they can tell you the step by step process of “how” a living being dies, but they will definitely fail to answer “why” we die at all? the “why” questions in biology are addressed by the theory of evolution. if you stuck with any riddle in biology, just ask Mr. Darwin, he has the final say.physics has quantum mechanics, the theory of relativity and they can satisfactorily answer the question like, how does the subatomic particle interact with each other or how a galaxy is formed. but unlike biology, physics has no theory that can answer the “why” questions, why a particle interact in the way it does? or why gravity exists that for the galaxy? etc. put it in another way, there is no theory of evolution in physics. but we can imagine, once such “theory of why” emerges in physics, it will face the same resentment as the evolution did.as the first word in the title implies, this book is on “why” and not on “how”. why the human has so distinctive sexual biology than other primates or mammalian species. so far, I’ve got the opportunity to read five books by Mr. Diamond. they broadly fall under two categories: about human as a species, this book and the “The Third Chimpanzee” belongs to this group. the second category is about human society, “Guns Germs and Steel”, “Collapse” and “World Until Yesterday” goes here.some of the topic in “The Third Chimpanzee” has been discussed in great detail in this book. here two concepts those I couldn't resist sharing as I never thought them in the way they were presented:beyond any doubt, the brain and the thumb are the key adaptations those changed the fate of human species. Mr. Diamond argued that biologically female menopause is as revolutionary as the human brain and thumb. unlike males, females of human species got their reproductive system shutdown by the age of fifty, while they live several decades afterward, apparently, without any reproductive advantage. why is so?the human birth canal was not evolved to deliver an enormous human fetus or twin, as a woman grows older her mortality due to childbirth increases significantly. a human child requires a long time of nursing and caring before becoming independent, and in old days society couldn’t sue a father for refusing his childbearing responsibility. hence as more elderly women died during childbirth, their infants used to follow the same fate of their deceased mother, and genes not promoting the menopause were slowly removed from the gene pool. menopause helped the single mothers to live longer and take care of their babies in early hunter-gather and forager society. the lesson is that the world we see today wouldn't be possible without single mothers.the second interesting point was about old people:before the invention of writing, people used to memorize enormous knowledge about their environment, plants, animals, etc. as they get older, when they could no longer hunt or bring food to their tribes/family. instead of becoming obsolete, they turned into a library. old people were the living libraries in the ancient society, they were valued and honored by their people. it is the invention of writing that took away the job from old people as the librarian and turned them into a social burden.if you think carefully, biologically humans are good for nothing. not only in childbirth, the humans were not a good hunter, so they opt for foraging, they were not good at foraging either, so they adopted agriculture. as history tells us, the humans were not good even in agriculture, soon they formed civilization and raged war against each other. apparently, they were so bad in the war that they stop their conquest and focused on science & technology. and guess what, even after two hundred years of advanced science and technology humans were found to be worse enough not to figure out “why” question in physics!isn’t it weird?"
10,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1513869-emily-c,4,"This book was fascinating and so engaging and easy to read for a book based in biology. In it, Jared Diamond brings up numerous facts about human sexuality that we all take for granted. Humans have sex for fun whether or not they are fertile, at any time of the month or year. Human females experience a distinct decline and then abrupt stop in fertility around middle age. Women usually have little idea of when they might be ovulating (unless they are using some form of modern technology to tell them). These simple facts of life which most of us accept as normal, are actually very, very odd in the rest of the animal kingdom. Diamond discusses how these traits and behaviors evolved and how they make us uniquely human.I loved this book. Diamond is like a great professor of any subject--he makes you excited to go out and talk about his subject to your friends and to learn more on your own time. I never thought I would like a non-fiction book about biology so much."
11,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18426886-partha,5,"In short, I may describe this book as another diamond from Jared's bag of gems, where he told us a story of human sexuality from the evolutionary perspective. In this book, he described that the attributes of human sexuality e.g. concealed sex, monogamous society, recreational sex, non-existence of male lactation were developed because of specific evolutionary reasons. More interestingly, even the evolution of female menopause is a deceptive game of evolution to make more by making less. He also argued that the role of men and women in society was shaped by the long-term effect of evolution.The storytelling style, ample interesting facts, and wise evolutionary reasoning make this book exciting."
12,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739493-marilyn,2,"Who is the the animal with the weirdest sex life? Yup, human sex is WEIRD because we do it for fun, anytime, even when we're not ovulating or fertile, in private, and females have menopause. These points are made in the preface and the first chapter. After that, the content is strictly for anthropologists or cocktail party chat.The titillating title leads one to expect a book on humans, especially given his physiology background. But the book is written for students interested in how & why animal reproductive parts & mating behavior evolved into humans, or not. I'm more interested in attraction, hormones & the brain, rather than in the assertion that sexual behavior is still driven by the ancient male's best interest to spread his genetic material around as much as possible. We've evolved past that.That said, who knew that men lactate? Or about the Australian marsupial mouse? ""All males in the population become sterile within a short time in August and die over the next couple of weeks, leaving a population that consists solely of pregnant females."" Or try dropping this at a party: Men's penises are longer than (gorillas), more than they need to be to do the job...How did that evolve? Since such tissue comes at the expense of energy for another appendage (i.e. the cerebral cortex), ""In effect, the man is boasting, ""I'm already so smart and superior that I don't need to devote more ounces of protoplasm to my brain, but I can instead afford the handicap of packing the ounces uselessly into my penis."" If you like that, read the book. He's a decent writer, but the content was too scholarly for me."
13,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,3,"Jared Diamond does not posses Carl Sagan's gift of enriching all he writes with a grand sense of poetic wonder; he also lacks the verve and wit of a science writer like Phil Plait. Diamond's books, however, are absolutely essential for those seeking to understand our universe and ourselves because he invariably chooses such fascinating topics. From the development of civilizations in his masterpiece GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL, to their potential decline in COLLAPSE, Diamond leaves one with a deeper understanding of humanity's essential questions. In this case ""Why Is Sex Fun?""Diamond first points out, then speculates the answers to the more rare and suspicious aspects of human sexuality: our tendency towards monogamy; recreational sex in general; concealed ovulation; menopause; men's attraction to big boobs, big butts...and big penises; and the use-ful/less-ness of men in general.Oh, and male lactation. THERE IS AN ENTIRE CHAPTER ON MALE LACTATION!!!Jared Diamond won a Pulitzer Prize. He also wrote the sentence, ""Lactation is not an infrequent result of nipple self-stimulation in teenage boys."" I don't know which is the greater honor. ""Why Is Sex Fun"" lacks the scope and depth of Diamond's other works, and leaves multiple questions untouched (most notably the evolution of homosexuality); however, it is a brief(>150 pages) and fascinating exploration on the how's and why's of fornication."
14,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233507-s-ach,3,"…and why is that?I read this whole book, cover to cover, by Jared Diamond, whose previous book that I'd read features in my top 10 non-fiction books of all time, to find out the answer to ""why do we do it?"" But, alas, in vain. I learnt about the sexual practices and reproduction methods of baboon, gorilla, chimps, pigeons, frogs, elephants, ants, flies, and million other animals and birds whose name I heard for the first time, but didn't learn why is it fun for us, the humans, to have sex? Every time someone in my vicinity found me reading this book, probably looked at me with raised eye-brow and took me for a pervert. All for nothing then? Well, not exactly nothing. But… "
15,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23177977-irene,3,"3.5 starsI must admit that I would never have picked this book up if I hadn't come to know of Jared Diamond's brilliant writing in his other book: Guns, Germs and Steel. Although human sexuality is an endlessly fascinating topic, books attempting to scrutinize it are all too often filled with nothing more than bumbling rhetorical questions and weird, irrelevant anecdotes. So knowing how amazing Guns, Germs and Steel was, I was fairly confident Jared Diamond would not disappoint in Why Is Sex Fun?My final thoughts: Why Is Sex Fun? is a worthwhile read that is well-structured and answers questions methodically. Among many other things, this book informs me about many new things on human sexuality (of course) and even poses questions I admittedly never thought of asking before. But unlike in GGS, the explanations put forward in Why is Sex Fun? still overwhelmingly feel like theories. The reason why I loved GGS so much is that the explanation Diamond provided us with were so well-rounded and consistent I could easily accept it as 'truth' (albeit not perfectly complete, but then, what theory actually is). So although the theories in WISF are plausible, they fail to consider so many aspects and fail to explain so many observations that it doesn't really convince the readers.---For a quick recap, here are the questions the book addressed:1. Why don't men lactate?2. What is the purpose of recreational sex?3. Why did we evolve concealed ovulation?4. What are the roles of men?5. Why did we evolve the female menopause?6. Body signals. (why do men have large penises?)---And here are a few questions and observations that I thought need addressing:1. It is said that ""recreational sex is the glue holding a human couple together while they rear their helpless baby together"". Well, I'm sure many of you (like myself) would have raised their eyebrows at this. Is sex really the only reason a male would stay with his mate? And if he is so inclined to leave, would sex really be so important that he decides to stay after all? If deserting his mate is evolutionarily better for the male, then why didn't males evolve behavior that causes them to leave their mates despite the promise of sex?Besides, it's still evolutionary more advantageous for the male to cheat on his mate, and there's no physical inhibition stopping him from doing so. He could still be monogamous and profit from regular sex with his mate AND occasionally cheat on her but not so much that he would be jeopardizing his child's life by neglect. 2. Why do female mammals tend to be smaller in size than males? As pointed out in the book, most of the time it is the females that have to care for the young. So wouldn't it be more logical if females were bigger than males? They would be better prepared to chase away predators and protect their young, and they would also be more prepared to chase away competing mothers for the best food sources. I get it that males have to be big in order to compete with each other for females, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they have to be bigger than females. So why are females smaller?3. What exactly are the advantages of monogamy? The book often used monogamy as part of an explanation, but it never addressed the reasons why some animal species including humans are monogamous in the first place. From my point of view, monogamy isn't even strictly necessary in traditional hunter-gatherer societies. The child could be taken care of by the whole tribe, as opposed to just the father (as the book points out why monogamy is necessary). 4. Now, I'm almost certain that this particular question had been in most of your minds while reading through the book: What is the the advantage of the female orgasm? And additionally, the book didn't really answer its title question: Why exactly is sex fun? The only answers the book provided were a) Recreational sex is important to conserve monogamy b) recreational sex is a by-product of concealed ovulation which is also important to ensure monogamyWell, okay. But the book didn't go any deeper than that and ask the question why sex is fun in the first place, or why sex has to feel good.5. In the book it was mentioned that there are two types of males, the ""show off"" and the ""provider"". It was also mentioned that females are better of married to the ""provider"" but that it's better for the male to be the ""show off"" because he attracts more females. So, why are females attracted to the ""show off"" instead of being genetically programmed to be more attracted to the ""provider""?----Well, that's that. "
16,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2696766-tristyn,2,"I was enjoying it up until he started discussing human lactation which immediately revealed that he knows just about nothing about the subject. ""Human lactation is energetically very expensive,"" and nursing mothers eat like men?This is hardly the same as eating like an active man: ""Studies have shown that most healthy breastfeeding women maintain an abundant milk supply while taking in 1800-2200 (or more) calories per day."" ""Breastfeeding your baby, on average, burns 200-500 calories per day"" - kellymom.com He claims lactational amenorrhea lasts for up to several years, so mothers in hunter/gatherer societies would only have children once every few years. What? Moms practicing ecological breastfeeding - breastfeeding on demand, cosleeping and nursing throughout the night, using no artificial nipples (bottles/pacis), i.e. similar to what the hunter/gatherer society model would be - average about 14.4 months of amenorrhea. In my >10 years experience of working with nursing dyads, 18-24 is about the longest I have heard claimed with any regularity, and even those moms are outliers. He says that hunter/gatherer mothers were able to enjoy such long periods of amenorrhea because they nursed ""many times each hour,"" whereas modern mothers nurse ""only every few hours"" for convenience. I am honestly not sure if Diamond's own children were only nursed for the first few months of life, or if they followed the Ezzo plan, or what. Even today, newborns nurse all the time, and breastfeeding is not about what's convenient for the mother, but about when the baby needs to eat. Mothers who refuse to nurse more often than every 3-4 hours are likely to find that their nursing relationships don't last much beyond the switch to autocrine control, between 3-5 months. Yes, there are women who, by biological happenstance, do have higher storage capacities and can get away with less frequent emptying of the breast, but babies are babies; they have growth spurts, they teethe, they don't know how to read clocks. So anyway, all of that was from the same page, and it annoyed me enough to actually write all this, and it leaves me disinterested in the remainder of the book on the grounds that if Diamond is this poorly informed on his own species, how can I trust what he says about others?"
17,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24493865-e,2,"During the month or so this book was in my house, my husband with his unique sense of humor, kept cheekily asking me if I ""knew why it was fun yet"". And the book is now done and I still can't answer why. Pleasure, orgasm, etc. was never addressed and this book is absolutely incorrectly titled. The subtitle ""The Evolution of Human Sexuality"" is more accurate, and a better format would have been a long article or series of short essays in a larger collection of essays - some of which would actually breach the subject of why sex is FUN, rather than why is sex the way it is.ALSO, quite disturbingly to me, Diamond very quickly and with no real citation classified humans as monogamous or polygynous. And just kept moving. Which, in the light of his book The Third Chimpanzee and the other recent sexytime read Sex At Dawn, seemed a flippant and dare I say specious argument. Once one of his foundational positions was seemingly made at random, I had a hard time caring about the other arguments he layered on top.All in all this book was a huge disappointment to me, especially in light of some of Diamond's other incredible works."
18,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31980216-vanessa-princessa,2,"I read this book thanks to Blinkist.WHAT THE FUCK did I just read?!?The key message in this book:Sex isn’t just a recreational activity or a means to procreate. Rather, it’s a set of behaviors, some determined by our genes and some stemming from seemingly odd counter-evolutionary choices, that offer a profound insight into our evolution, our society and our rise to the top of the food chain. Suggested further reading: Sex at Dawn by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda JetháSex At Dawn argues that the idealization of monogamy in Western societies is essentially incompatible with human nature. The book makes a compelling case for our innately promiscuous nature by exploring the history and evolution of human sexuality, with a strong focus on our primate ancestors and the invention of agriculture. Arguing that our distorted view of sexuality ruins our health and keeps us from being happy, Sex At Dawn explains how returning to a more casual approach to sex could benefit interpersonal relationships and societies in general."

The most interesting bit for me was about why there might be selection pressure for menopause. (This may be disturbing for some to read.) Basically, for most of recent evolutionary history, as a woman gets older, childbirth is more likely to kill her. Because human children are helpless for so long, this will likely kill some of her children too, if she's given birth at all recently. In addition, children born later are less likely to be healthy. So at some point, a limitation on producing more kids actually increases the chances your kids will survive to reproduce. On top of that, old women may help her descendants and relatives in a way not true for old animals... old women are smart. Wise even. If you like evolutionary analysis like that, you might get a kick out of this book. If you don't, skip it. I got it for 3 euros. It was a fun quick read."

Diamond's meditations on how menopause may have been selected for and why men don't breastfeed their children were compelling and carefully argued. When he ventured into the territory of human social arrangements; however, Diamond hamstrung himself with his own disciplinary bias. As a sociologist, I find it extremely hard to believe that complex human social behaviors - like adornment and marital relationships - are driven by an evolutionary logic. As Diamond points out in his chapter on male breastfeeding, humans have often made ""counter-evolutionary"" choices. If our instincts drive us to behave in certain ways - why some ways but not others? I highly recommend the book, despite these problems. "

36,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1026842-kathleen-brugger,3,"I have read a number of Jared Diamond’s books and am a great fan. After reading this book I felt like the title was chosen by someone in his publisher’s marketing department. Mr. Diamond was probably chagrined by it. He’s a scientist, and he spends a lot of time discussing animal behavior and speculating about how the distinctive features of human sexuality evolved. There’s not much talk about why it’s so fun. The basic points he discusses are: 1. Males and females have different investments in reproduction and that determines their behavior—males take a few seconds to discharge semen while females have 9 months of pregnancy and years of lactation; 2. Males could breast-feed but that didn’t evolve because of that low investment, 3. Female humans conceal their ovulation for two reasons, originally to hide who the father was (new dominant males kill the offspring that aren’t theirs) then later to keep the man around to help raise children, 4. What are men good for? He struggles to find a good reason (see below), 5. Why does human menopause exist? Many other female animals are fertile in old age, and 6. Evolution of sexual body signals—breasts and big hips in women, and in men, penis size. A seventh point that he discussed in the first chapter, that humans have sex in private unlike almost all other animals, didn’t get an explanation.I thought male sexual body signals were facial hair and low voice—not penis size. Mr. Diamond suggests that the penis has evolved as a sexual signal, like the peacock’s tail, a body part that is longer than necessary to advertise genetic strength and health. “The length of the erect penis is only about 1¼ inches in gorillas and 1½ inches in orangutans but 5 inches in humans, even though males of the two apes have much bigger bodies than men.” Why? Could it be all the positions humans have sex in? “[T]he 1½ inch penis of the male orangutan permits it to perform in a variety of positions that rival ours, and to outperform us by executing all those positions while hanging from a tree. As for the possible utility of a large penis in sustaining prolonged intercourse, orangutans top us in that regard too (mean duration fifteen minutes, versus a mere four minutes for the average American man.)” Ouch. Then he describes what the penis would look like if men designed it, using the phallocarp of New Guinea men as an example—a penis sheath up to two feet long, four inches in diameter, brightly colored, and erect (google it!). They say they feel naked without it, even though, other than the sheath, they are completely naked. The discussion of the importance of men was surprising. I always assumed that the male role in hunter-gatherer societies was obvious: the men hunted. A female anthropologist, Kristen Hawkes of the University of Utah, decided to test this assumption. She had people test the caloric yields of the men’s hunting catches and the women’s foraging yield in tribes in Paraguay and Tanzania. In the Northern Ache people of Paraguay, the men hunted large animals such as peccaries and deer, and collected honey. The women pounded starch from palm trees and gathered fruits and insect larvae (in addition to caring for children). On average the man brought home nothing 25% of the time, whereas the women produced a consistent amount every day. The man’s average calorie return was 9, 634, where a woman’s was 10, 356. You may argue that the men’s protein was more valuable than the women’s starch, but in other places women gather high-protein staples: the Kalahari San women gather mongongo nuts, and in New Guinea the women fish, and catch rats, grubs, and spiders.Mr. Diamond asked, why don’t the men turn their energy to securing high-protein food that is easier to obtain and thus a more predictable source of nutrition? Turns out that women want to mate with men who are successful hunters, even if it doesn’t really mean that much for the overall nutrition of the group. Women today still want to be with the most powerful and successful man; it’s clearly a deeply-wired aspiration.The other section that was of particular interest to me, an aging woman, was the one on menopause. The current thinking in anthropology is that older women are a very important component of society, and that cessation of fertility helps increase the longevity of women. The theory goes like this: because of humans’ long childhood, and the risk of death in childbirth, a woman risking her life at 45 to have one more child wouldn’t make sense, because it would mean her existing children would lose their mother and have a lower chance of survival. Much better to stop having children and put your energy into helping your children be successful in having children. In other words, non-fertile grandmothers are a very successful survival strategy for the human race.In addition, old women are a storehouse of knowledge for the whole tribe; old people are the “tribe’s library.” I love what Mr. Diamond says about being “postreproductive”: “No human, except a hermit, is ever truly postreproductive in the sense of being unable to benefit the survival and reproduction of other people bearing one’s genes.” Today this is less true than for pre-literate peoples, and with books and the internet we don’t think of any one person being the repository of knowledge. “We find it impossible to conceive of the overwhelming importance of elderly people in preliterate societies as repositories of information and experience.”In conclusion, Mr. Diamond says, “That importance to society of the memories of old women is what I see as a major driving force behind the evolution of human female menopause.”"

(The Evolution of Human Sexuality) by Jared Diamond uses evolutionary theory to try and explain the title question and some of the many quirks of human sexuality — penis size, hidden ovulation, a proclivity for sex in private (unlike many animals), orgasms and menopause. For those who know Diamond through his seminal and best-selling Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, (or even his later tome Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed), this is a far lighter (and shorter) though no less illuminating read. The book is grounded in evolutionary biology, so — lacking any means of proving hypotheses — some may find it too speculative. But speculation from a specialist with deep knowledge and access to the latest research is certainly compelling, and Diamond builds a pretty strong case that the various mysteries of “traditional” (that is, the most widely practiced) human sexuality make perfect sense set against the unique and relentless reproductive demands of our species. From what we seek in potential mates, and how, to ensuring our long-gestated and feeble-at-birth offspring can survive, sex is fun, ultimately, to ensure the survival of the human race. Evolution provides the “fun” mechanisms to ensure sex happens often enough and in ways that require long-term coupling to maintain paternity and thus raise children until they can fend for themselves.  Despite the occasional swerve into careless misogyny (“there’s a lid for every trashcan”), Diamond does a great job characterizing the incredible reproductive demands human women bear:  “…by the end of a nine-month pregnancy a human mother’s expenditure of time and energy is colossal in comparison with her husband’s or boyfriend’s pathetically slight investment during the minutes it took him to copulate and extrude one milliliter of sperm.”  I enjoyed the take-down of the myth of men as great hunters and providers, using evidence from careful field study to show that foraging and raising crops always yield better nutritional outcomes. However, hunting — and dispensing the yield — seems to have served a larger social good, and positioned men to use their hierarchal influence to potentially expand their breeding options.  And Diamond offers some insight into the age-old discussion of penis size, basically comparing it to a peacock’s tail — an extravagant (and, from a resource perspective, costly) ornament to advertise mating desirability. “Almost anyone would assert that the functions of the penis are to eject urine, inject sperm, and stimulate women physically during intercourse. But the comparative approach teaches us that those functions are accomplished elsewhere in the animal world by a relatively much smaller structure than the one with which we encumber ourselves.” In fact, as he notes, the gorilla has a much smaller penis than humans and yet could rip us limb from limb in a bare-hands match.  Why Is Sex Fun? is a great little book that reminds readers of a simple truth — humans are merely another animal driven to pass along our genetic material. We should all be grateful, I suppose, that the forces of evolution, in trying to balance all of our many shortcomings, settled on “fun sex” as a winning strategy. "
44,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5369915-kylie-gatse,4,"The book I read was Why Is Sex Fun? The Evolution of Human Sexuality. I first chose this book because of its title. It seemed like a fun, and interesting topic for a college student to read. But as I started reading the book I realized it was nothing like what I had expected to read. Although many may also think this is going to be fun learning about sex this book goes beyond humans just having sex for pleasure and compares our sex lives and patterns to other animals and species.	The book starts off talking about other animals’ sex lives. It points out that all other animals have sex strictly for one reason: to reproduce. Most females only have sex when they are fertile simply for the reason; males just are not attracted to them when they aren’t fertile. If they are not fertile they simply have no interest on having sex together. Humans are different however. We are fertile at all times but that is not the only reason we choose to have sex. While many women do have sex to reproduce, most men and women choose to have sex more for just pleasure and for fun. It is a perfectly normal and natural part of our lives, but our need to have sex for pleasure sets us aside from most other animals.	Most animals do not stay in a family like humans do. They have their young, and in most animal species, only one of the parents will take care of the newborns. In most cases this is the mother, but in very few species such as, some birds, some fish and some amphibian species that care for the eggs while it is the female that leaves and does not choose to care for her young. This can be compared to humans because in most cases there is not just one parent caring for the children. In most families there is a mother and a father caring for the child and it goes beyond that having grandparents, siblings, and friends that help take care of the young. This book just makes you think about how could we be the only species that has multiple people taking care of our young?	And have you ever wondered what men are good for? This book goes through talking about how women just seem to always being doing more than their husbands do due to different economic roles. The author of this book takes you through the hunting and gathering societies Ache and Hanza to show how men cared more about showing off than actually making sure they were providing for their wife and all their children. There has been studies done on American couples today where both parents are working, and even so the women still tend to put in twice as much work as their husbands do on doing daily responsibilities. 	As you read this book you can also question why we are the only animals that enjoy sex, why we have so many caregivers in our lives, and really what is your man good for…you know you really deserve more credit for all your hard work!

46,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975079-daniel-hammer,3,"Jared Diamond is a favorite target of criticism from anthropologists. This is not because Diamond is an ornithologist who has chosen instead to write almost entirely about human behavior, which he does not himself research. Instead, it is mostly because Diamond loves to oversimplify complicated ideas and make grand statements on the world. The grand statement of this book is that we can learn a lot about human sex from observing how sex operates in the animal world. Compared to his overreaching in books like Guns, Germs and Steel and his recent The World Until Yesterday, the central claim of Why Sex is Fun is not intellectually offensive and provides a lot of interesting information along the way.This book has become a mainstay in courses on sex and evolution (which is how it found its way into my hands as well). Even at that, I could not justify using the entire book. About half of the chapters cover essential topics of sex and mating strategies: sexual dimorphism, male-male competition, female choice, concealed ovulation in humans, and the biology of attraction. It is easy to read and mostly good information. At the very least, it provides a simple introduction to these ideas. However, even the basic topic of the entire book--the concept of sexual selection--is better handled by other authors in a single chapter, such as Jerry Coyne in his book Why Evolution is True. As a book to be assigned for a course, I would recommend assigning additional supplementary materials.This is not Diamond's best written work. His arguments are often unclear, seemingly having become victim to a writing style focused on attracting a popular audience. However, what the book lacks the most are solid connections with Diamond's stated topic--human sexuality. You learn a great deal about the animal world, but much less about humans. In the titular chapter, Why Sex is Fun, Diamond does not even answer the question he poses. He probes the topic of concealed ovulation to answer the related question of why humans have sex so frequently, but this is not the same as why sex is pleasurable. The animal world does not provide all of the answers to human sexuality, and this is not Diamond's fault. However, it is his responsibility to ruminate on and theorize about the gaps between the sexual behaviors of humans and other animals. He rarely does this. Ultimately, this is an easy to read (if not entirely well-structured) book with interesting examples that falls somewhat short of achieving what the author intended--which is to shine a brighter light on why humans have sex the way we do. "
47,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1154545-stacey,3,"Jared Diamond logically argues and reasonably concludes that the evolution of humans has had direct implications for the development of our current culture, in terms of sex practices and sexuality. He demonstrates the interconnectedness these things with the physical traits and characteristics determined by genes, which have evolved over time. His comparisons to other species are enlightening, and his refutations of the most valid objections to his theories are logical, even though sometimes they can be discouraging. His prose is always clear, though sometimes redundant in proving a point - I haven't decided if this adds to the book's structure, or if I find it mildly irritating. His points are sometimes overly simplified, but this is to be expected in such a little book. He uses such different subjects as menopause, sexual signals, and sexual practices (i.e. harems, monogamy, and promiscuity) among primates, to prove his theory, that going in-depth on each topic would ruin the book's readability. And this is one of the advantages - it is very approachable, a quick read, while at the same time thought-provoking. At times he is also whimsical, witty, and amusing, while many of the examples are intriguing and unfamiliar (to me). What he argues occasionally seems cruel (and in some cases, he acknowledges this). Although, as he concludes from the evidence that genes and the drive for survival do not often support loyal, true monogamy (even in Pied Flycatchers, which I found incredibly disappointing), he is careful to mention that humans are messy and difficult to analyze, for many reasons. "
48,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893347-valerie,4,"I enjoyed this a lot. Jared Diamond is a rigorous scientist but has a very approachable writing style. One of the things that fascinated me about this was that the long-term, unconscious, evolutionary goals of humankind straight-up doesn't apply to me because I'm not going to be a mother. All of the behavior discussed in the book was about passing on genetic inheritance, and the benefits vs drawbacks to expending energy towards childcare, and I don't give a shit about that. It was pretty freeing. I don't feel any responsibility at all to perpetuate my species so I'm just like, Awesome, I'm gonna sit this one out and watch from the sidelines. Have fun hetero parents. He doesn't really make any arguments about gender, doesn't talk about queerness at all, just gives us the broad biological breakdown of why chromosomally typical male/female bodies have come to be the way they are, which I think has its place. He does acknowledge deviations from the norm, like intersex individuals, but he's not really involved in questions of psychology and consciousness and personhood and, thank god, morality. It's cool to think about this topic, to go from a macro view, an evolutionary to a physiological viewpoint and then beyond that into some more micro questions of gender, which is where I'm much better versed. I like to think that with such a wide knowledge base of all the variation among species and ethnologies in the world that Jared Diamond would be a pretty cool and accepting guy, very nonjudgemental, and that makes me like this book even more. "
49,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2962393-chris,3,"Spoiler: This book is not explicitly about the act of human copulation, which was actually a big relief for me (cuz you know, ewwww). I felt the topics the book did cover were far more interesting, such as why do female humans mask ovulation? Why would curtailing female reproductive capacity via menopause be an evolutionary successful strategy? Just what are men good for? I liked how Diamond presented each evolutionary question with at least two competing hypotheses and the supports and pitfalls of each. At times it felt like he quickly brushed off certain possibilities as too unlikely, but I am not that familiar with anthropology. A lot of rationalizing the evolution of human behaviors can seem hand-wavy and the ""experimental evidence"" is limited to observations of rare primitive tribes. Of course I enjoyed the many comparisons to non-human species (to the point where I was be disappointed that a fun tangent on phalarope mating systems got dragged back to relating it to humans). It gets annoying when Diamond lauds the utter uniqueness and specialness of odd human behaviors, but then immediately talks about all these other species that exhibit the same behavior. Seriously, humans aren't THAT special (hey, maybe we could go back to the phalaropes or the gibbons for a bit?). Overall it's an interesting, well-structured, quick read likely to be enjoyed by evolution nerds but perhaps less so for those who pick up the book based on the title. "
50,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1122708-megan,4,"Diamond tackles aspects of human sexuality from an almost purely evolutionary standpoint in this short volume. It's a good reminder of how humans are a part of nature as much as any other animal in creation. Humans actually have some unusual, although not utterly unique in nature, biological constructs. The purposes for which these evolved and the way they can affect our decision-making makes for fascinating reading. Diamond's scientific conjectures are clear, thought-provoking, and non-judgmental. He explores issues of human reproductive uniqueness that had never occurred to me: why can't human females tell when they are ovulating?, or why is menopause a thing? Why is a human penis bigger than a gorilla's or other apes? Etc. The elephant in the room is the complete lack of any examination of homosexuality. There also is very limited exploration of the non-reproductive value of sex in terms of other human evolutionary psychology. The book is very interesting, but barely scratches the surface of the title question. "
51,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1266826-lisa,3,"A nice little book with nice speculation. Certainly meant to be for a popular reader but won't satisfy the more scholarly or experienced evolution readers, even for popular content. First, the title is a marketing ploy. Sexual pleasure doesn't figure into the discussion, though the sub-title is an accurate reflection of the content. The focus seems to be on women, which is nice if you are a woman and used to being ignored or grouped into male discussions without a thought. From menopause to lactation to locations of fat deposits, the evolutionary logic of women's sexual structures is nicely theorized. Curious that the penis is given a page or two at the very end. Really? Not worth any more than that, Mr. Diamond? Something of a rush job, I think, as the testicles are completely ignored in the evolutionary logic. So a bland ""nice"" is my review. Doesn't come anywhere close the Diamond's greater works such as Guns, Germs, and Steel, Collapse, or The World Until Yesterday."

But fortunately there are people who still make it their lives' missions, our scientists, biologists, psychiatrists, to name a few. Jared Diamond is one such. While we sometimes choose to treat sex as a trivial, frivolous topic, the other side of this coin is reproduction and what is more important than reproduction? It's raison d'etre and has been since the beginning of time. This book explains some of the characteristics related to sexual behavior and its evolution, which in turn, explain many aspects of our social behaviour. These include menopause, female investment in child care, concealed ovulation and sex for pleasure among a few others and in turn explain the role of women Vs men in society, how monogamy developed, how women choose partners, why child care is primarily the prerogative of women, and how important is superficial beauty.I was fascinated and will remain fascinated, for some time to come."
53,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4236601-popup-ch,4,"Diamond looks at sex from the viewpoint of an evolutionary biologist, and points out how remarkable the human sexual behaviour is compared to the other mammals and other animals. (In the introduction he apologises for being zoo-centric, and not having much to say about protozoan sex.)Why do humans have sex even when there's no possibility of conception? And why do we do it in private, rather than in front of our social group? What's the point of recreational copulation? These and other questions are answered with references to other species that show some similar aspects. A keen ornithologist, Diamond's first instinct is to look at birds, and there are lots of fascinating behaviours among these latter-day dinosaurs, but it would have been interesting to see more references to our closer relatives among the mammals.It is quite a short book, compared with his other bestsellers, but the scope is also much more limited, and he manages a fairly thorough overview for the interested layman. "
54,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278789-jeremy,4,"The title is definitely a misnomer. Somebody in the publishing office clearly came up with this to try to sell books. It really should be called ""The Evolution of Human Sexuality"" because that's what it's about. Nevertheless, Diamond is so good. Along with Gladwell, he's definitely my favorite author. I love his style. As he's constructing an argument, he frequently uses technical language or refers to some scientific principle that is unknown to a layperson like myself, but immediately follows it up with multiple examples that help the reader not get lost (and feel educated).The sixth chapter of the book (on the evolution of menopause) was the chapter that I found to be the most interesting. I found it entertaining when Diamond wrote about human behavior in the midst of writing about the behavior of other animals. It made it evident that, though highly evolved animals, we are still animals nonetheless.I would love to know how this book was received in the scientific community."
55,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266448-lucas,4,"This was pretty interesting. However, I found a number of his explanations of the evolution of human behavior very unconvincing, since he seemed to play hard and loose with consistency. In some chapters early hominids were very monogamous, so promiscuity could have no effect on the evolution of anything. In others, he cites evidence that humans were not very monogamous and uses that to explain the evolution of various things. (Eg when asked about who the biological father of their children could be, the average answer among Ache Indian mothers included 2.1 possible fathers.)The most interesting parts of the book were the descriptions throughout of bizarre mating/parental care structures found in the animal kingdom, and his summary of a comparative study of dozens of primate species' sexuality. It's a pretty quick read, but I'd take almost all of his theorizing with a few grains of salt."
56,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8371136-miklos,3,"The title is a lot more fun than the book.I have read many books by Jared Diamond. All of them have kept me in wonder and educated me, except this book. I was really hoping for more. There are large tracts of the book that actually get repetitive and quite boring. If you had read a little bit about this subject, you are really not going to learn much from this book. Like we all know, women because they only has a limited amount of eggs are going to take more time and care in selecting a mate. While a man with almost unlimited amount of sperm, that he can use well into his 60s or even 70s, has less incentive to settle down for one woman. Or, that women may stray from their pair bond if they happen upon a man that would take better care of their children or them. Or, a woman will choose to settle down with a man that takes care of her but mates with a man that has better genetic material in the way of looks and body physique. That said, it is still a pretty good book. "
57,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3911377-jennifer-lavoie,5,"If you're looking to read this book thinking it's going to give you tips or something, put the book down now. Wait, don't. Keep reading anyway because you will learn something about the evolution of human biology and how and why we evolved sexually to what we are today. The book presents a fascinating look to a human's biology, and though I was skeptical at first - especially since this is required reading for a literature course - I was soon completely engrossed in the information presented. Whether or not human evolution is something that interests you, this book will. Diamond presents the many theories for how hunter-gatherer women chose mates to why men are not as active in parenting as women and so on. He makes comparisons between mammalian species of today and non-mammal species such as birds. The best part? It's written in a readable, almost conversational tone. Very well worth the read. "
58,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5542146-maureen,3,"Worth reading, though many of his conclusions seem loose, unscientific and almost common-sense in retrospect. I kept finding myself thinking, ""Well sure, that's an interesting and even believable theory, but where's the proof?"" But I guess that's the dilemma of trying to write a science-y book for entertainment audiences; you don't want to get too deep into the research and bore everyone. Interesting ideas in any case, and I'm assuming an important alternative perspective to the ""Men are from Venus"" line of books that attempt to explain why we do what we do (but I haven't read any of those so I really can't say from what perspective they approach the issue...)""There's no problem to explain, except why Jared Diamond is such an idiot. You don't understand why we have sex all the time? Because its fun, of course!""Unfortunately, that answer doesn't satisfy scientists. p.66"
59,0465031269,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811366-esmeralda-rupp-spangle,3,"I REALLY wanted to give this book 4 stars, but I couldn't quite do it. It comes so close, but there are enough problems with it that I can only give it three. Mainly- it's too vague, and short! What is there is all good- but it's conclusions are muddled. The title of this book- Why Is Sex fun? Is barely addressed- I almost felt like it was missing chapters, or sections or something. It was really good- just... incomplete? I love Jared Diamond, and I hate not being able to like this book more- but I kept feeling like he either pounded this out REALLY fast, or whole swaths of it were removed by some evil editor.Maybe my expectations for it were too high... Maybe I enjoyed it less because the last book I read was an easy 5 stars. Anyway- whatever it is, I was just left feeling like I'd read half a book- so, 3.25 stars. Sorry JD :P "
