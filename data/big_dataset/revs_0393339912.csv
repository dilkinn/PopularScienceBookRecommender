No, it is not because it made me sad, but because I was laughing so hard my eyes were gushing. Mary Roach has had that effect on me before. I have read two of her books. Stiff and Spook are greatly entertaining. She has a sense of humor that encompasses a pre-adolescent affinity for the scatological. OK, she likes fart jokes. Blast off, Mary. She has an appreciation for the absurd and an impressive capacity for finding it.This sign says REDUCED GRAVITY OFFICE. I know what is in there, but even so, I have to stand for a moment and indulge my imagination, through which coffee pots are floating and secretaries drift here and there like paper airplanes. Or better still, an organization devoted to the taking of absolutely nothing seriously. She seems to write with actual glee when reporting on the frequently vomitous results of weightlessness, and her tales of head-case astronauts playing gruesome practical jokes while in orbit had me weeping with laughter.Yet through all the laughter there is considerable payload to be had in Roach’s books. One can gain here, among other things, an appreciation for just how little was known about the effect of space flight on humans (or chimps) before we followed the Soviets into orbit. There is info on the design of spacecraft seating, and scary details about how the human body reacts to high-G acceleration, and scarier, deceleration, also why it is better to be on rather than below deck when confronting seasickness. Your eyes will widen and you will find yourself saying “really? Who knew?” Apparently Mary Roach did, or at least does now, and shares her acquired knowledge with the rest of us. If this book does not deter you from your lifelong desire to become an astronaut (an early career fantasy of mine), there is no hope for you at all, and you should seek counseling. You may not leak bodily products, tears or worse, while reading  Packing For Mars but be sure to keep a hankie or some tissues handy, just in case. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal and Twitter pagesOther Mary Roach books we have enjoyed, in case you missed the links in the review-----Grunt -----Gulp-----Spook-----StiffAugust 21, 2016 - A recommendation from the intrepid Henry B.

1,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen,4,"Space…the final frontier: 

where intrepid heroes break free from the mortal bonds of Mother Earth to experience such singular marvels as:1. Fecal popcorning (definition forthcoming);2. Condom-shaped urinal devices (with different sizes for, um, different sizes); 3. Weightless Flight Regurgitation Phenomenon (Hint: turns out gravity is a vital part of both swallowing food and keeping it locked down in the tummy); 4. The pleasures, subject to NASA regulations, of Zero-G copulation; and5. The breath-taking beauty of witnessing a “sun-illumined flurry of flash-frozen waste-water droplets” against the blackness of space.Plus, these ""right stuffers"" get to enjoy the potentially fatal dangers of vomiting during a spacewalk, and, ironically, the related joy of consuming food substances comprised primarily of “melted lard, milk protein, Knox gelatin, cornstarch, sucrose.” As she states early in this fun-packed romp through the history of space exploration, “Space doesn’t just encompass the sublime and the ridiculous. It erases the line between.” Well, this book does exactly that, and Mary Roach deserves a standing ovation for skillfully balancing well-researched, interesting facts, with hilarious “insider” anecdotes, and wrapping it up in a presentation that is entertaining from start to finish. Light-hearted yet detailed, Roach navigates her material with a high degree of deft and provides information on a range of topics in a manner that is easily digestible (unlike some of the space food discussed). Despite my lop-sided references above to the more humorous topics addressed, there's a little bit of everything in this survey of humanity’s sojourns into the void. Ms. Roach provides fascinating information on numerous topics, both scientific and practical, highlighting the challenges of space exploration. A few of the less comical, but just as interesting, chapters include discussions on:** The various psychological problems that arise as a result of extended isolation, including madness, euphoria and suicidal tendencies.** The almost unimaginable complications involved in trying to heft a Earth-made object, carrying oxygen-breathing mammals into a airless, zero gravity environment. “Apollo 8 has 5,600,000 parts…Even if all functioned with 99.9 percent reliability, we could expect 5,600 defects.” Since any one of those defects could lead to disaster, the amount of testing and preparation involved is similarly staggering. ** The affects that extended weightlessness has on the human body, from loss of bone density and muscle tone, to the actual shifting of organs in side the body. ** The dramatic change in the optimum qualities making up the “right stuff” in today’s space program, versus those required in the early days of space flight. However, I admit that it was when Mary delved into those “little discussed” areas where natural human functions intersected with the challenges of space that I had the most fun. In particular, the struggle with ingesting and evacuating foodstuffs (and I use that word loosely) while in the cramped, awkward, shared confinement of a space module was a veritable golden shower of poop jokes and naughty bit references, sure to please the inner, developmentally-arrested child in you*. Therefore, as promised above, here is fecal popcorning, as described by Ms. Roach:
 Because everything else is frozen, the material that’s going in, depending on how hard the stool is, has a tendency to bounce off the walls. You’ve seen the old air-pop popcorn machines? There’s an air flow in there and it’s kind of circulating. That material’s just floating around in the air stream, and it tends to come back up the tube. Howdy doody.
 What really makes the above quote work is Roach’s perfect delivery of the last two words, and that kind of well-timed, clever humor peppers the narrative. By the way, fecal popcorning is not even close to the most uncomfortable feature of space-based defection, but I will leave the other nuggets for you to discover on your own. As funny as this can be, in the end, what really sets this apart from simple comedy shtick, which would get old very fast, is how much information Mary effortlessly imparts and her obvious admiration for the men and women involved. From lectures on g-forces assailing the body, to the unnatural effect of zero-G, to the myriad of other extreme mental and physical stresses to which the body is subjected, Mary will leave you with a heightened appreciation for the courage of these unique people. Also, underlying all of the light-heartedness and the humorous anecdotes is the message of the wonders of space exploration, the awe-inspiring dedication of the people that carry it out, and the importance to the human spirit that such endeavors continue. Even the funny bits, in addition to serving up yucks, serve to increase the positive perception of these mythic figures known as astronauts by creating a more human connection with the rest of us. I want to end with what I found to be the most moving passage in the entire book. In it, Mary Roach sums up her attitude towards space exploration, while responding to those that argue that the money spent on such luxuries a manned excursion to Mars would be better spent on the ground.
The nobility of the human spirit grows harder for me to believe in. War, zealotry, greed, malls, narcissism. I see a backhanded nobility in excessive, impractical outlays of cash prompted by nothing loftier than a species joining hands and saying “I bet we can do this.” Yes, the money could be better spent on Earth. But would it? Since when has money saved by government red-lining been spent on education and cancer research? It is always squandered. Let’s squander some on Mars. Let’s go out and play. 
 

Well said, Ms. Roach, well said. 4.0 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* I admit that two full chapters on bowel movements began to wear a little thin at the end, but that's just me."
2,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"I’m a big space geek and have spent countless hours reading or watching documentaries about manned space flight. I’ve seen a space shuttle launch and been through the Kennedy Space Center a couple of times. I went and saw the traveling exhibit of Gus Grissom’s capsule that was retrieved from the ocean floor and refurbished. So I thought I knew something about NASA and astronauts.However, I’d never heard the phrase 'fecal popcorning' before.These are the kind of tidbits you get in Packing for Mars. Mary Roach takes a light hearted but fascinating look at all the research and projects that go into putting and keeping people in space. This isn’t about the rockets or the life support systems, it’s about the seemingly more mundane stuff like hygiene, the effects of isolation, long-term health risks, time management, safety devices, nutrition and human waste disposal. (Actually, way more about the waste disposal than I really wanted to know. Which is where the fecal popcorning came into it. Thanks for that, NASA!)This stuff may seem trivial, but as Roach illustrates when it comes to living in a sealed zero-gravity environment nothing is easy. Something as simple as trying to get some exercise to prevent the deterioration of bone mass involves countless hours of study on earth, including a research center where subjects are paid thousands of dollars to spend a month in bed. (Read the fine print before you rush to sign up. It's not quite as good as it sounds.)Roach strikes the perfect tone of treating the various subjects seriously while still injecting a lot of humor when it’s called for. She’s also willing to do far more than I would for a book including drinking her own recycled urine and using the space toilet trainer that has a camera in it so that astronauts can see parts of themselves that no person was meant to see as they orient themselves to do a *ahem* docking maneuver. (Seriously, there’s a lot of poop in this book.)While reading it, I kept thinking of the argument that’s been made that putting people into space is dangerous and wasteful. So much of what’s done becomes just about keeping the astronauts alive that the science tends to get lost. Especially considering what’s been accomplished with far less money on projects like the Hubble telescope and the Mars rovers. However, Roach has a short but passionate argument at the end where she outlines why she thinks all of this is so cool and necessary, and why people should go to Mars. And you know what? She sold me.Entertaining, informative and filled with funny stories and bits of trivia, I enjoyed this one a lot. But it’s got more poop than a Jonathan Franzen novel so beware if you’re squeamish."
3,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,3,"Roach is well known for her earlier books, Stiff (about human cadavers), Bonk (science and sex) and Spook (the afterlife). In Packing, she takes on the US space program, and how it’s dealt with many of the everyday biological issues we take for granted– such as washing, eating, and urinating. However, willingness to take on the scatological is just part of her hook; she integrates information about the program in general as well as Earth-based research supporting it.I learned a lot more of the early space program than I expected, usually palatable due to Roach’s inclusion of either direct interview or historical quotes from astronauts and scientists. Initial sleepiness from the material was chased away once I reached the chapter “The Cadaver in the Space Capsule” onward. The section on food and nutrition was horrifying, as well as the section on defecating. I have to confess, I’ve never been much of a space junkie, but I love science fiction and biology and this was a fascinating read once I was past the beginning hurdles. Roach’s humorous asides added a dash levity to a potentially dry subject. I had never really thought about the extent to which astronauts sacrifice their personal privacy; she has a hysterical transcript from Mission Control where controllers are asking about astronaut flatulence. Roach even explores some of the ongoing studies impacting space travel. One covered in some detail is an Earth-based study examining the impact of 3 months of bed rest on bone structure, and the poor people who volunteered for it. A note for those who like accuracy in titles: much in the book does not specifically has to do with Mars missions, just issues regarding living in space.The book had an extra impact of nostalgia back when I read this–it was close to the last shuttle launch. Sad now to see so much of the program being planned for obsolescence when it was an international preoccupation for decades. Thank you, astronauts for your sacrifices.Laugh out loud lines:“Is he leaking badly from anything major?”“The whole procedure will unfold exactly as it would with a live patient, right down to a forty-five-minute wait and a problem with the billing.”“The staff played hot potato with my call until someone could locate the Person in Charge of Lying to the Press.”Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0..."
4,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,4,"Note: the dolphin-sex thing appears to be a hoax. Shame that. I like the idea of space sex having to be a threesome.Why the Space Program Costs so Much. Because its run by a load of backward-thinking dickheads, contrary to what you might think.Mary Roach seems to have an obsession with poo. I did actually want to know about toilet facilities in space, but not two-chapters worth of knowledge. Similarly a chapter about sex, although no-one apart from one Russian wanker (literally) actually admits to having it at all. The author does make the point though that weightlessness might make union difficult unless one employed a third person to push the two together, much like dolphins apparently do in the equally weightless medium of water.I wanted to know much more about questions the author chose not to address to do with food, leisure time Do they watch movies, read books or just go for a stroll? How did they do their hair, did it grow faster or slower on the space station? Did they grow food of any kind? What about insects - did any of those find themselves on a trip to space and what happened to them if they did? Loads of things...What I did learn was that anything built for space is subject to one restriction - it must be as small and light as possible as each extra pound costs thousands of dollars in the extra thrust needed to send it into space. However, there are certain taboos that cannot be overcome and the governments of both the USA and Russia are willing to spend out all the extra money in the world to make sure that men, as ever, not matter how fake it is, reign supreme.Women are smaller, lighter and consequently generally eat less food, drink less water and breathe less air so naturally they should be the astronauts. NASA could raise only one objection to women in space which obviously must have been solved by now, as there are female astronauts, that urine droplets do not separate from the genitals and pubic hair 'cleanly' as they do in men. I'm not joking. Have they never heard of http://www.thisnext.com/topic-female-... or couldn't they invent one? So essentially the whole space program would be much more cost-effective if women were astronauts and men, unless they were quite little, stayed home and looked after the babies. But we couldn't have that, could we? American values count for more!"
5,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,3,"3.5 I recently read Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man's First Journey to the Moon, and so some of the things in this book were also in the former. In this one, Mary Roach is much more descriptive in exactly what this astronauts go through before and during a flight. The problems that had to be solved even before space travel was considered. Effects of gravity on breathing, on bones and other bodily functions. Experiments undertaken, results, adjustments.So, let's just say after reading this unless space travel is like that on the Star Trek Enterprise, I'm not going. Nausea, motion sickness, vomitingg that floats through the air, socks and underwear that disintegrate, claustrophobia, massive body odor, are some of the undesirable elements with which they are faced. Not to matter bathing and other bathroom functions. These are dedicated men and women, and yes I'm a bit of a priss, but I admire their dedication."

This was a fascinating trip. Really. I learned a lot about seals, black bears, dolphins, rats, dogs and chimps. En route I also learned something about astronauts and their way of life in space. And this kind of life is not at all what I had imagined even in my wildest dreams. Let me warn you, if you've ever fantasized about taking a vacation in space, you should read this book first. The comfort in a space hotel is basic, even if you paid billions of dollars for a 5-twinkling-star hotel. If you consider yourself a hygienic person, you don't want to book a space hotel. There are no showers! And not being able to chance your socks for several days, can be a real downer for your co-travelers. If you love a well-prepared meal, you don't want to visit space either. Space hotels hire veterinarians to cook your meals. Also, a comfortable toilet is out of the question. Holding the astro-newspaper while hovering above the toilet is no mean feat to do. If you don't mind to face all these uncomfortable conditions, just to enjoy a nice, dreamlike stroll in space, be prepared to do some bungee-jumping during your spacewalk. Scuba-divers however, will feel comfortable in space much more likely than the average hiker. Don't expect that you will meet many people during your stay in space. This is a solitary trip. Before you depart for the stars, you should ask your therapist if you are up to it. If you love to socialize during your travels, you better visit Spain. Couples that want to make love in space, should consider bringing a third person to help out. I really don't advice this trip to newly-weds. Even if a honeymoon on the moon sounds really romantic, it could be devastating for a young couple's future sex-life. Also, delivering a baby in space is not something you want to do, however awesome it sounds. The baby could be traumatized for the rest of its earthly life. The flight to your space hotel can be really nasty too. Ever been sick in a car or on a ship? You've seen (felt) nothing yet. Being deaf-mute is an advantage though. And landing back on earth after an adventurous travel, can be really bumpy. Don't even think about making this trip if you have osteoporoses. Score: 7/10"
7,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus,4,"Rating: 4.5* of fiveThe Publisher Says: Space is a world devoid of the things we need to live and thrive: air, gravity, hot showers, fresh produce, privacy, beer. Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA’s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth.My Review: I deeply envy those not claustrophobic or clumsy or tall...they can aspire to astronautcy, where I for reasons here presented, cannot. Fatness, it seems, was once mooted by a NASA consultant, as a desideratum...20 kilos of fat = 184,000 calories! Why send food up? Fat folks can do a little slimming and science at the same time!Leaving aside the Donner-Party-in-Space horrors of the clueless and thin, Mary Roach's delight of a book is packed with interesting and surprising research, her own and others's. I can't imagine *how* anyone came up with zero-gravity toilet research subjects. Filming you at this well, ummm, intimate moment of activity? Discovering thereby that uhhhh curls form in zero G? *shudder*And Roach, as readers of previous books (Bonk, Spook) know, is irreverent to the point of being a female frat boy about every-damn-thing, and completely unafraid to deploy wit and sarcasm at the drop of a...cheese curl. She's funny, she's curious, she's smart, and damn it all, she's married.So she marshals a raft of facts in her quest to know, and impart to us, necessary background information and bizarre little side-trails of information about the quest of the US and (now) Russian governments to put and keep humans in space. Each chapter tackles different specialties in the space race: food, water, safe arrival and departure, etc. etc. Her completely unserious side is always on display, and makes what would otherwise be a government briefing document (anyone who has ever read a government briefing document will attest that there is no reading matter more effective in inducing short-term coma) into a sparkling, sprightly tour of a quixotic, hugely expensive boondoggle.At the end of this particular garden path that Mary's leading us down is a manned mission to Mars. She asks baldly, ""Is Mars worth it?"" All the money...half a trillion bucks!...all the risk, all the inevitable bureaucratic wrangling.Benjamin Franklin said it best: Asked what use the first manned balloon flights were, Franklin replied, ""What use is a new-born baby?""Exactly.

Fun facts about space travel, things that happen(ed) on earth and up there, with footnotes here and there. There is a timeline (1949-2003) and a bibliography at the end.Things included include who gets in, on isolation and confinement, keeping your sanity, lack of gravity, throwing up, crash tests, animals used (Albert, Ham, Enos and others not named), plans of travel to Mars, on washing yourself and toilet time, sleeping, sex, getting down from there, food, and future hopes. (Felix Baumgartner appear here, not yet having jumped out of that Red Bull thing, which happened in 2012, a bit over a year after the book came out.)Actions: getting the US flag right for the first moon landing, making origami cranes, the lubed-butt slide test, missing the nature while up there, trying to save Jimi Hendrix, defrosting a cadaver, faking a seatbelt malfunction, taking ""little bunny sniffs"", black bears' winter hibernation, spying on seals' mating rituals, the ""corned beef sandwich incident"" of 1965, muslim prayer options in spaceObjects: NASA tv channel, helmet vomit, turkey vulture vomit (a delicacy for coyotes), Tomb of the Unknown Dog (in Russia), stinky pressure suits, cheese bacteria, decomposing clothes, a snorkel, hip-squeezing machine, dolphin genitals, the finger insert in the pooping bag, frozen poop storage space, fecal dust, little Communion packages, farts, the Phoenix lander (working 2008-2010).Why: hot tubs are not so good an idea, if in a car it's better being hit from the front is better than from the sides - for the human body, astronauts are on their backs, jumping from a plane (the big usual type) is a bad idea.I'm pretty sure leaving food chapter until last chapters was a good idea. I did feel pity for the animals, but it's good they were mentioned. But anyway, this was a fun, sometimes gross, a read and really informative. Like climbing the Everest, for me it's interesting to read about it, and also a relief not to have to experience some downsides of it (or whatever direction things here are currently pointing towards *lol*)."
9,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"Mary Roach is a funny woman. I guess that's what you get when no subject is taboo and she has the charm to pull it all off. :)What does she pull off? A full, scientifically accurate look at the little stuff in life. Astronauts living in space was rather more the focus. That's okay. We're not quite ready to go to Mars. But at least we're ready to drink our pee! Yay!Seriously though, beyond the last quarter of the book being devoted to floating poo in a very fun and educational way, the whole book is a serious work of scholarship, investigation, and interview. We can throw out a lot of the myths and add a whole lot of true facts to our bags thanks to this non-fiction.I honestly had a great time reading it. And since this is my second Mary Roach, I think I may be plunging ahead to read more. :) Yay!"
10,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,5,"I did not expect to be so captivated by this book. After all, I barely paid attention when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969. I was a very mature seven year old, and I had seen better space ""movies"" at the local theater. My interest in the space program remained low while I was growing up. Of course, I watched and cried over the Challenger and Columbia disasters. But otherwise, I was mostly oblivious.I suppose it was not until Nasa announced that the shuttle flights were coming to an end, that I began to get truly interested in our trips to space. I now make frequent vists to http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/... to find out when the space station can be spotted flying overhead. I tramp outside at all hours, in freezing weather, cursing heavy cloud cover, just hoping to catch a glimpse of a fast moving light in the sky.I am a huge fan of Roach's writing style and her need to always look at the strange side of life. She asks the questions I would, if I had the chance and were bold, and unembarrassed enough, to ask. She covers all manner of topics - helmet design, crash safety, long term effects of weightlessness, food, how to keep clean in space, and the bane of most of my life - motion sickness. And yes, there is an entire chapter devoted to how to poop in space.Mary Roach has certainly captured the magic and wonder in this book. In a voice as excited as a child on Christmas Eve, she paints a loving tribute to astronauts, both human and animal, who dedicated, and sometimes, gave their lives to exploration."
11,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,4,"Fascinating and well considered. Lots of gross facts about conditions in outer space.

12,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282938-cassy,5,"There was a rule in my house growing up: no talking about “bodily functions”. When my older sister would start going on about how she clogged the toilet or an episode of smelly burps, my very Southern mother would intervene. “Jill, there will no discussion of bodily functions at this dinner table. Would anyone like more peach cobbler?” Mary Roach would make an interesting dinner guest at my parents’ house. Her book is overflowing with bodily functions: vomit, body odor, pooping/peeing, and sex in space. Not a little mention here or there. We are talking an entire chapter per topic! Mary knows people are secretly curious. During the event, she even described the poop chapter as the “gateway drug”. In the interest of full disclosure, the book ventures beyond the bathroom and bedroom to discuss other topics such as the psychological impact of isolation. There is also a chapter about space food – which (logically) ends on a discussion of flatulence. I guess that won’t qualify for table talk either. Oh, and there is a chapter about sending animals up in space – which investigates the rumor that one chimp had a masturbation problem. Huh, Mary better stick to complimenting my mother on the pot roast. Mary shares a knack with A.J. Jacobs for taking a potentially dry topic, finding the quirky tidbits, and exploiting them to their full comedic potential. And she will go out of her way for a joke. A really long way. There are numerous footnotes for whenever something became irrelevant to the topic at hand, but it was so funny she just couldn’t let it go (and bless her for that). Putting aside the hilarity, Mary is a strong writer who clearly did her research. She managed to impart a great deal of useful information. (Although “useful” may not be best word since I am likely stuck on Earth my whole life.)You could say Mary deglamorizes astronauts. I am a nuts-and-bolts kind of girl – so is Mary. It just so happens that an astronaut’s career is full of tedious planning and even more tedious living arrangements once they’re in space. Yet Mary retains a sense of wonder at how fundamentally awesome it would be to go up there. Sure, dinner may come out of a tube, but at least you can gawk out the window at Earth while you eat it.As I alluded above, I attended an event with Mary hosted by the Space Center Lecture Series.* This being Houston, the crowd was full of NASA employees and aerospace contractors. While I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I could not judge how accurately it portrayed the overall issues and technical aspects of spaceflight. The people sitting around me could. I feel pretty confident stating that the experts approve of her book. They were all happy to be there on a Friday night. And during the Q&A, no one lobbed harsh critiques or questions. (Or maybe the detractors didn’t hate it enough to come out.)And guess who else was in the audience? Mary gave a shout out to Renee for telling her about the bed rest facility where people are paid to laze around all day. This eventually turned into chapter 11. More importantly, it was where she found the inspiration to pursue an entire book about spaceflight. As further evidence of the crowd’s amicability, everyone clapped for Renee.As I was reading, I pictured Mary as enthusiastic, charming, and persistent. How else could she have gotten into all those cool places? Meeting her confirmed my impression. She is the type of person who you can ask a simple question and they’ll give you a five-minute (and worthwhile) response. And her curiosity is so great that she started interviewing her interviewer – who was John Charles, a NASA employee and a source featured in the book. At one point, Mary described herself as having the mind of a twelve year old boy – which helps explain why she focuses on such oddball topics. She confessed to not watching the moon landing as a child and how her sources had to hold her hand through the technicalities.I have an exclusive for you! The subject matter for Mary’s next book is top secret, but she reluctantly revealed the title. Gulp! No, really. That is it. Gulp. Guess away! My bet is on sea creatures. Leo put forth water shortage crises. Whatever it is, I’m game.*The organizer said he would post a video of the lecture here."
13,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I’ve read two other Roach books and have really loved them. They tick all of the boxes – they are witty, wise, fascinatingly interesting and written by someone with an eye that unfailingly spots human foibles. The beauty of her writing is that rather than pointing and laughing, she embrace our foibles and makes us fell all the more human because of them. Do you know that feeling you get when you read someone and think, ‘God, I would really love to meet you, just to listen to you talk?’ Well, Ms Roach is one of those authors for me. This one starts slow – she should have cut maybe the first chapter or so. In fact, it starts so slowly that I was afraid I was witnessing the loss of one of my favourite writers. But then she gets into her stride when she starts talking about the sorts of things you’ve always wondered about space flight but were too afraid to ask. At least, this fear is something finding out about the inconveniences of space flight is something I’ve only just discovered. I was excitedly telling my mother about this book the other day when she said something that really surprised me. I was telling her about the difficulties of defecating in space and she said, “Why would anyone want to know about that?” Her saying this stopped me in my tracks. It had never occurred to me that someone might not want to know about that. Just as the difficulties of sex in space (given Newton’s third law of motion – equal and opposite motion and all that) mean that thrusting can have the undesired effect of pushing the object of your lust off away from you – you can calculate how fast they will move away by using F=ma. It is all a matter of coming and going, I guess.How could you not be interested in the problems zero gravity present to your bladder? Or that the bag you defecate into also needs antibacterial cream mashed through it before it can be disposed of thoughtfully. A friend of mine once called the bags used for picking up dog droppings ‘little hand warmers’ – this is even more true in space.This is a look at the all-too-human sides of space exploration and some of the proposals to deal with issues space exploration presents – Muslim prayer times, for example. These are exactly the sorts of things I would never think to think about. I love how obvious some of the solutions to these seemingly intractable problems have turned out to be. Who would think of putting a camera in a toilet bowl to help train for the best sitting position? And who wouldn’t expect the film thus made not to be viewed inappropriately?The book looks at some of the crazier myths that have surrounded NASA, like the masturbating chimp story that seems to have been completely fabricated. Although, while we’re on the topic of masturbation, I have to admit that I was surprised that people have actually asked cosmonauts if they masturbated in space. I really enjoyed this book and am prepared to admit that perhaps that makes me strange. I’ve never been all that interested in space travel, at least, not since I was a kid – in fact, I can probably say I’ve been even less interested in space travel in my adult life than I have been in that other standard childhood fascination, dinosaurs. However, this isn’t really about space travel, it is about putting people in remarkably inconvenient situations and then watching to see how they cope. A lot of the coping they need to do involves abandoning social taboos we take utterly for granted. Defecating while sitting beside a work colleague, for example, would surely prove a challenge for most of us. It is remarkable how well people do cope with these challenges and wonderful to hear about the ingenuity that is applied to solving these issues.Don’t let the start of this one put you off, this really is the right stuff."

""It's up to yourself how you will deal with it. But everybody is doing it, everybody understands. It's nothing. My friends ask me, 'How are you making sex in space?' I say, 'By hand!"" As for the logistics,"" there are possibilities. And sometimes it happens automatically while you sleep. It's natural."" John Charles told me he'd heard about the link between prostate health and ""self-stim""- at NASA, there's an abbreviation for everything - but never heard any formal discussion , pro or con, on orbital masturbation."" (227-228)""The Johnson Space Center ""potty cam,"" as it is more casually known, is an astronaut training aid. It provides a vivid, arresting perspective on something you've had intimate contract with all your life but never really seen. Perhaps not unlike viewing one's own home planet from space for the first time. Positioning is critical because the opening to a Space Shuttle toilet is 4 inches across as opposed to the 18-inch maw we are accustomed to on Earth. Jim Broyan, a waste-water engineer who designs toilets and other amenities for NASA astronauts, is showing me around...He possesses a stealthy deadpan wit and is, I imagine, tremendous fun to work with."" (267-268)If there was ever a person to explore the eccentricities of space travel with such a comedic wit, it's Mary Roach. Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void is tremendous fun to read, full of laugh-out-loud moments such as the two quotations above. Roach covers little know facts and facets about the rather...let's call them interesting...aspects of space life and difficulty for an astronaut, from lack of gravity when pooping, to the frequent nauseating effects of space travel, to the gross food designed by nutritionists, to the animal volunteers sent up by the American and Russian space agencies. There are transcripts where astronauts are laughing at turds flying by them, a reference to the ""Three-Dolphin Club"" (look it up), and experiments concerning test subjects staying in bed for months at a time. While reading this book you can laugh out loud whilst accidentally dropping the book and while recovering try to find the page you were on. Roach is a great writer in that anyone without an understanding of the scientific information given won't become that lost whilst reading it. Mars itself isn't really discussed until the last chapter, showcasing just how much humanity currently isn't suited to the notion of traveling, let alone inhabiting it, as possible as that might seem in the coming decades with proper planning. Learning is best when humour is infused, making this an excellent choice for anyone interested in space travel and the training done by astronauts.Rating: 4.5/5"
15,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"There's a bit of space science in this book, but it's mostly a humorous, immensely scatalogical romp through the space program. By reading this book, you will gain a treasure trove of trivia, ranging from astronaut food, defecation, odors, nausea, to the earliest, non-human astronauts who were shot up into space on rockets. You will learn the real reason why women were not enlisted as astronauts in the early days of NASA, which turns out to be the exact same reason why Russians did include women astronauts! No subject is considered taboo in this book. The book describes the ""potty-cam"" at Johnson Space Center. It sits inside a toilet, looking upward, to help train astronauts how to sit on a specially-designed toilet in space. Viewing the real-time video feed, Mary Roach writes that the view is a bit like looking at your home planet for the first time from space.Mary Roach tries a little too hard to be super-cutesy, resulting in narration that reads more like flirtatious conversation. If you can get beyond the stylistic banalities, you will be well entertained."

It's not that I didn't take notes, because I did, lots and lots of notes. This... thing... sitting next to me resembles a pile of unicorn vomit, rather than a book, with the amount of post-its stuck to it (its very colourful and pretty). I was going to take a picture, but I'm not sure I want this floating around on the internet for all eternity....Because my notes, you see, are filled with dick and fart jokes. I just pulled one post-it off at random, and, I'm not joking, it says ""Prostatic Vibrating Machine - you dirty, dirty boys you!"" another ones says ""Self adhesive shit bags and unintentional butt crack waxing"" and yet another one says simply ""BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!"" So instead of writing a ""proper"" review (Ha!) I thought I would just pull post-it notes out at random and write what they say. Here goes;- Enos the Penis - The Tale of the Self Flagellating Monkey- Society Against Gravity - ""SAG""?... REALLY?! - The Uranus Experiment - A Zero G Porno- The extraterrestrial cod piece- Zero G Sexy Time- There shall be no damp or soggy areas! - commandment number 1- Farts in a bottle - no really, somebody actually measured this (***VERIFY IMMEDIATELY!)- Did you bring a condom? No darling, but I did bring the duct tape! (sex aids for astronauts)- Heheh! Buttocks spreader! But-tocks... spreaaader (Spreader being the new moist - who can I gross out?)- Side effect; Anal Leakage - not desirable... (See edible clothing)- Fine dining on used clothing- Poop Bag w/ Finger pouch- Zero G Ranching - LET THEM EAT MICE!  Those are just a few, I left out my *ahem* ""notes"" that are purely a written form of me pissing myself laughing. I have 10 or so that are literally just filled with ""HAHAHAHAHAHAH!"" over and over again. There's a few that say ""Scientist are batshit crazy!"" and another one that says ""Yeah, I totally shouldn't have looked that up, next time take the authors advice.""This thing was so entertaining, and also proved to me just how immature I am... not that this really needed ""proving"", my inner 10 year old isn't exactly on a tight leash.It was also incredibly informative, and delivered in such an easy to read manner. There was no head scratching or frantic googling trying to work out rocket science. There was some frantic googling to look up gross stuff though. I heart gross stuff.While it's somewhat on the irreverent side, it also touched very respectfully, on the Columbia tragedy, and how NASA strives to ensure the safety of its people. It also drove home the point of just how hostile space is, and the risks astronauts take each and every time they journey into the void. The amount and range of research involved is absolutely staggering. Scientists had to pull apart and examine the human body in the the most minute detail before sending a man into space. These are some seriously brave and clever men and women and I tip my hat to them (while on the inside I seethe with jealousy).I thoroughly recommend this. Especially if you're like me and are curious about the less glamorous aspects of space travel. And also if you like to shock people with random information that they probably didn't want to know... like how your shit doesn't ""break off"" in zero G and often needs ""a helping hand to achieve maximum separation"" (this is related to the aforementioned ""Poop bag with Finger Pouch""). *giggles* That's so gross. Gloriously, GLORIOUSLY, gross!So, if you're not squeamish, do pick this up. Just be prepared for lots of gooey, gooey detail.Also - don't eat, prepare dinner or snack whilst reading this... because of the gooey detail... yeah, just... don't do that....5 Stars!"

I remember this well, we had to learn all about rockets and space travel. When we were to reach the end of all the information, we were going to have a test on what we learned. Nothing new there right? Oh but there was…… The person who had the highest grade on the test was to be the one to “launch” a rocket, you know, the model rockets made from cardboard with a built in parachute for its descent…the ones that you would sometimes put a toad inside as a passenger (I never did that, but I heard he traveled well…not me I swear!) Those rockets seemed incredibly dangerous. I wonder if they’re still around?Anyway, I decided that person was going to be me because, at the time, I thought I really wanted to go to space. I studied my sixth grade butt off, and much to the dismay of all the geeky boys in my class I aced that test. That test was mine, and I got to launch the rocket. They all glared at me through they’re sullen eyes during the countdown. Sorry boys.My grandma declared that I was going to be the first women in space. She was positive I was going to be an astronaut.  I am sooo glad she was wrong, because according to this book there is nothing more unpleasant in every conceivable way than space travel. With the problems of the food going in and then the inevitable coming out the other end, I think maybe they should have just taped a diaper on and been done with it. All the cramped quarters, no way, I get claustrophobic in crowds. And then there is the high likely hood of death…and things like that.Until the posh Star trek like space ships with gravity are invented I’ll pass on the trip to Mars. And there is the end for my grandma’s dream."

19,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64621419-dennis,4,"“Is he leaking badly from anything major?“In this book Mary Roach tells us about the challenges of space travel and the extensive research that is done before humans are sent into space.And she caused sustained eyeleak (of the good kind) for this reader, because she’s going places other writers seldom dare to go. Telling the stories other writers would likely gloss over and NASA would certainly prefer to stay a private matter.Life in the void provides many unique challenges. But there are a few we might not think of, initially. What does it mean if you spend weeks with someone else in a cramped space, where you can barely move and can’t take a shower? How do you use a toilet in zero gravity? What happens to your bones after you spent a prolonged time in zero gravity and then you are exposed to one minute of sustained 4Gs during reentry? Or 10Gs during a crash landing? Will you be able to walk without breaking your bones when you are back on Earth? What happens if you bale out from an aircraft at Mach 3.5? Or a space craft at Mach 17? What happens if you barf into your helmet during an EVA? Can you have sex in zero gravity? Is masturbation permitted?Mary Roach asked these questions and many more and somehow was mostly able to get answers. And if she didn’t, she asked someone else.The book is at its best when the author‘s dry wit and/or playful manner collides with NASA’s strictly scientific and unhumorous approach to anything that concerns space flight (and use of language).NASA’s employees though are not devoid of humor and Roach found the right people to talk to.To fully enjoy this book though you should not be easily grossed out by bodily fluids, organs traveling to places where they shouldn’t be, or crash tests with human cadavers. Don’t worry, there are no pictures of horrific injuries. But some do get mentioned.This book might not be the best book ever about space travel. But it is certainly the most unusual and funniest book I’ve ever read about that topic.As always when it comes to humor, it won’t be for everyone. But there are certainly not many places where you will read an actual mission transcript like this from the Apollo 10 mission (starring Mission Commander Thomas Stafford, Lunar Module Pilot Gene Cernan, and Command Module Pilot John Young, orbiting the moon 200,000-plus miles from the nearest bathroom):CERNAN:…You know once you get out of lunar orbit, you can do a lot of things. You can power down…And what’s happening is—STAFFORD: Oh—who did it?YOUNG: Who did what?CERNAN: What?STAFFORD: Who did it? [laughter]CERNAN: Where did that come from?STAFFORD: Give me a napkin quick. There’s a turd floating through the air.YOUNG: I didn’t do it. It ain’t one of mine.CERNAN: I don’t think it’s one of mine.STAFFORD: Mine was a little more sticky than that. Throw that away.YOUNG: God almighty.[And again eight minutes later, while discussing the timing of a waste-water dump.]YOUNG: Did they say we could do it anytime?CERNAN: They said on 135. They told us that—Here’s another goddam turd. What’s the matter with you guys? Here, give me a—YOUNG/STAFFORD: [laughter]…STAFFORD: It was just floating around?CERNAN: Yes.STAFFORD: [laughter] Mine was stickier than that.YOUNG: Mine was too. It hit that bag—CERNAN: [laughter] I don’t know whose that is. I can neither claim it nor disclaim it. [laughter]YOUNG: What the hell is going on here?Yep. Space is a shitty place to be, if privacy and dignity are amongst your major concerns."
20,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"This is my second book by this author and once again she has proven that she has a great sense of humour. The other book I've read was about human cadavers and it was funny to see a short chapter dedicated to cadavers needed here, too.The book, as the title suggests, is about space exploration - the history including Moon landings, the science behind anything from heat shielding to toilets, the process with which astronauts are tested and chosen, atronauts' training. There are even some comments about funding and, therefore, changing politics.Why Mars, specifically, in the title then? Because it has its very own challenges due to being farther away. There is a significant psychological difference between going to the ISS or the Moon and the much longer journey to Mars. In her signature humorous way, she respects the topic and seems fascinated by the topic herself, but also knows that many things related to space travel are quite ridiculous and thus presents them in a corresponding funny way. From dolphin genitalia capable of grabbing even humans and puke-loving coyotes to hilarious actual communiquès about turds floating in zero-g and aspiring astronauts having to fold 1000 Origami cranes, the reader is taken on a very entertaining tour full of scientific facts that are therefore never boring and easy to follow.Personally, apart from me wanting humanity to colonize the stars (yes, I know we'll take our problems with us but it's still cool - and necessary!), I'm also very interested in the engineering feats and all the things we take for granted here on Earth that simply don't work/exist in space so astronauts have to re-learn everything and engineers and technicians need to be aware of the respective problem even before being able to come up with a work-around or solution!Did you know, for example (not a fact drawn from this book but it's true and has fascinated me for decades) that when you cut open one of those musical greeting cards the chip you're holding has the exact same amount of computing power that was needed / used to get man to the Moon?! Isn't that equally exciting and unbelievable?!Or the fact that NASA not only had to take an American flag up to the Moon (romantic little me thinks nationalities shouldn't matter up there) but then also had to remember that the flag wouldn't fly as they usually do down here (depending on the weather) and subsequently also had to come up with a solution for the problem (which sparked so many conspiracy theories that we never actually have been to the Moon)! Not to mention that every gram of weight on a rocket is a problem.Apart from the heroism we associate with astronauts and the feats achieved with space shuttles and space stations, Mary Roach doesn't hold back when showing us what space research and space flight is really like (at least sometimes). The advancements as well as the problems (technological and due to us humans), going TO space and coming BACK (re-entry), what we do in the void. She covers almost all and gives us details I'm not sure too many others dare cover.I wasn't and still am not too much a fan of the animals that had to suffer in the name of science (dogs, chimps, rats, ...) but the crash tests and the interconnectedness of sooo many scientific fields (even dermatology) always sparks my interest.Sure, there have to be better solutions for drive systems that we'll hopefully develop in the future, but what we've already achieved in the past (even though it was mostly only thanks to competition between warring nations) is amazing and I hope we won't stop but keep pushing forward!A seriously cool book narrated by a great woman who had no problem with appropriately bring certain scenes to life - adding to the laughter and enjoyment."

22,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,3,"Bullet Review:Huh. Not quite what I was expecting - more a ""look at all these weird things in space"" than anything close to a checklist of things necessary for a Mars mission. And those weird things seem to focus A LOT on bodily functions.I wish we spent more time on how bad the food was, how hard it would be to store enough food and oxygen and more about the psychology of long duration flights. And less time on space poos.Full Review:I will try to do a full review, though I don't really know if that's gonna work.I fell in love with all things space at the ripe old age of 11. I found a science textbook talking about space and started planning out my future like teenaged girls stereotypically plan out weddings. I would go to college and get my master's in aerospace engineering (learning Russian alongside it) then work at NASA where they would assign me as a mission specialist on a mission to Mars. I even had my little script of what I would say on Mars planned out. (In addition, I would fall in love with this equally smart guy who supported me and went along with me on the mission to keep me company.) I predicted all this would happen - well, now.Obviously, life does NOT go like you plan at 11. I'm not stepping on Mars reciting my fabulously eloquent lines about how awesome it is to step on Mars, I don't work for NASA, and I didn't learn Russian (I know, I'm sad about that one too).But I still have a soft spot for Mars. I still desperately want humans to reach out and go to Mars - even if it makes more economic and scientific sense to send robots. There is just something awesome about a group of people banding together for a peaceful goal that I love. It's what I pretend was going on during the American Lunar missions; I like to think something like this could still happen today, amidst the stupid Real Housewives reality shows and Adam Sandler's latest insult to humanity.Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" hinted that it might look at all the details needed to go to Mars. Well, the title anyway - the cover blurb makes it a bit more clear it's just about all the weird things in space that we take for granted on Earth.And that's primarily what ""Packing for Mars"" is - a book about the strange way we work in space. Psychologically, biologically, and...biologically. Don't get me wrong, there was some fascinating stuff in here, about how people react in closed quarters to another person for extended time, about not bathing, about sexual relations in space, about eating squares of condensed food and what that does to your bowels, about urinating, about pooing...Okay, okay, there is a LOT about body functions here. A LOT. Did you wonder how astronauts poo? It's here. Did you want to see the evolution of the space toilet? It's here. Did you want to get into the analysis of a stream of urine? Yup, here also. How about dead skin and the stench after not bathing for 2 weeks and wearing a suit? Yuppers.And yet, I'm surprised we didn't discuss more about the massive engineering feat it would be to store enough food and water and oxygen for a THREE YEAR voyage to Mars.I feel that Mary Roach spent SO MUCH time on all the ""gross parts"" of space flight, she really didn't touch enough on the parts I wanted - what is growing food in space like? Is it viable? How about storing food? Storing ""souvenirs"" from Mars? What does radiation do? I don't even know, it's just I felt the overwhelming take-away, at the end of the book is just going to the bathroom is gross and dehumanizing and I want to take a 4 hour shower.Roach has a humorous, yet educated tone, which I appreciated. It also was a breeze to read this. But I am knocking down from my initial 4 stars rating because I realized that I have been thinking of this book as ""It's okay"" not ""really liked it"".It's a decent book with some interesting information, don't get me wrong. It's just not really what I expected/wanted to read about - a disappointment, because I've been pretty much ecstatic about reading this from the moment I saw it debut in hard cover. To wait so long until I am on vacation reading only books I WANT to read just to find it was ""Okay""? Disappointing just doesn't cut it."
23,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"I took my time going through Mary Roach's rap on what it means to be out beyond the Earth's surface. NASA and the Russians have been spending loads of time and money since the 1950's to prepare and put humans in orbit and beyond. I started reading partially because I wanted a different perspective than the recent bestseller and movie, The Martian, would provide. Roach writes that she was inspired to ""think about a trip to Mars and what it would be like to spend two years trapped inside sterile, man-made structures with no way to escape one's work and colleagues and no flowers or trees or sex and nothing to look at outside the window but empty space or, at best, reddish dirt. The astronaut's job is stressful for all the same reasons yours or mine is --- overwork, lack of sleep, anxiety, other people-but two things compound the usual stresses: the deprivations of the environment and one's inability to escape it. Isolation and confinement are issues of no small concerns to space agencies.""With persistence and humor, Roach takes us through the testing of man, equipment, food, etc. She casts a dubious but discerning eye on what the agencies say and what they do, quoting a NASA physician: ""The agencies try to keep the best image up, otherwise they don't get funded anymore.""There are wonderful and provocative details about the Japanese, Russian and American experiences. Do you believe, did you know that certain Russian astronauts were given suicide pills? ""Given that death from cyanide, the poison most commonly associated with suicide pills, is slower and more ghastly than death from having one's oxygen supply cut off, there would have been little call for the pill.""Roach covers everything, and I mean EVERYTHING! From the dangers of vomiting in a space suit to the fact that you have to take a dump into a baggie while sitting next to your fellow astronauts. Psychological stress of every kind are explored, as are physical issues such as loss of bone mass and flatulence. There is a section devoted to just the physical challenges of sex in zero gravity. And a longer section on the choices of foods, the rationale behind them, and their successes and failures.I learned a lot. I laughed a lot. And, I am no longer interested in taking a long space journey. ""Beam me up, Scotty."""
24,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5944522-sanaa,4,"[4 Stars] This book was incredibly fascinating although a bit disturbing from time to time. You get to know some of the details about all of the strange things that accompany thoughts of space travel: how to you poop in space, what is the screening process like for astronauts, food in space, what kind of strange experiments and tests must be employed to test things for space travel, chimps in space, and so much more. I thoroughly enjoyed it even though I thought it was a bit slow. I wish the book had covered more about actual missions and what not in the past and a little more about the history of such, but overall the information presented was really interesting. If you want to read a non-fiction book about the oddities of space travel, this is one to consider."

""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" --Neil Armstrong
 Well...that was...interesting. This book is so thoroughly researched. The amount of painstaking detail used to describe the epic sublime of space right down to the microscopic level of doing your ""business"" in zero gravity is impressive to say the least. As a side-effect though, I did find myself getting ""fecal fatigued"" and ""vomit weary"" more than once. 

 Don't get me wrong -- I applaud Mary Roach in her unapologetic approach to getting the details right, because this is a side of space exploration and the life of an astronaut we've never seen before (at least not in such unexpurgated glory and triumph). In other words, this is everything you ever thought you might like to know about traveling into the final frontier (and some things you could have happily gone your whole life without ever knowing, trust me on that) but were afraid to ask.This book is chock full of interesting tidbits as well as several mind-blowing facts, all marinated in Roach's signature wry humor and breezy writing style. It really is a delightful romp (and you'll learn stuff too!) I already feel smarter. I also appreciated that Roach extended her scrutiny beyond NASA and dug up some colorful detail about the space programs of other countries, including my own. It was Stephen's awesome review that brought this book to my attention, and despite a few cringe-worthy, grimacing moments of ""ugh!"", I'm really glad I read it, and I highly recommend that you do too!

With Packing for Mars, Mary Roach takes the reader on a journey through the bizarre history of space travel and the toll it takes on the human body and psyche. It turns out that my passing interest in space travel was just that - a passing interest. I found myself constantly drifting off during chapters and having to rewind over and over again which slowly became an exercise in frustration. That being said, there were some things that I found interesting. Scientists theorizing what would happen to the human body when subjected to zero gravity was mind-blowing. The knowledge that we have today about space travel is something we can certainly take for granted when looking back at how little we knew to start.Apparently, my love/hate relationship with audio books is far from resolved. When you plug in those headphones and commit to listening to someone read you a book, you better hope that the reader does a good job and has a pretty tolerable voice. Unfortunately, I feel like Sandra Burr just didn't do it for me. I’m not sure why - maybe it had something to do with the dry way she approached the material. There’s a lot of humor in here and I feel like Burr just couldn't portray the subject matter in a right way.It really hurts to hit Mary Roach with such heavy criticism because I can tell she was passionate about the subject material. However, as a casual consumer of space travel history, this book couldn't grab me and keep my attention for longer than the odd chapter. I definitely intend to check out something else Roach has written and take the traditional reading route."

That was the highlight of this book for me, though there were many other fascinating things I learned, as well. But what could possibly beat space poop?Roach tackles the worklife of an astronaut as well as the former US/USSR Space Race with her signature depth of research (she watched Russian space porn, people. For SCIENCE!) and humor. Unfortunately, this is just not a topic I care about. I love the night skies, I used to be delighted with astronomy but more the stories about stars and less the science behind them. I like the romance of the moon, not so much the actual orbiting body.Also, I've been hearing first-hand accounts of the whole Planning A Mars Trip for years; one of my dad people works for NASA and his project is Mars. I'm sure he's told me a bunch of really cool stuff but I never remember any of it because I am just not interested.

This book was interesting and eye-opening about a lot of the mundane minutiae of going into space, made (slightly) less mundane by Mary Roach's writing about it, but what really interested me was all of the ways that gravity allows us to live - and what happens to us when gravity is taken out of the equation. This book covers pretty much everything from physiological results of high G pressures and impacts, to floating poops to bone density changes. I'm sure she would have included a kitchen sink... except that in space, the water would just coalesce into a bubble and mess up the equipment. I didn't find this book quite as funny as I've found Roach in the past, but could just be personal preference. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for space farts. I'll show myself out."
31,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I have an awkward relationship with Mary Roach. I find her humor forced, blatant, and poorly timed and so it always falls flat to me. I realize that a lot of people really appreciate her humor, but it just doesn’t click for me. Actually, I bet I think she was really funny if I heard her talk, because potty humor IS my type of humor, but it just doesn’t seem to translate for me in her books.That said, she researches these absolutely fascinating topics from angles that no one else would, and I totally appreciate that. I mean, really, she is willing to throw her energy and time into researching the history of pooping in space. INQUIRING MINDS REALLY DO WANT TO KNOW. If I had to tell anyone to listen to one chapter from this book it would totally be Chapter 14- the poop chapter. It is hilarious in its own right, poop literally floating around during Apollo missions, and she shies away from nothing. How could you not want to know?If there is anything I learned in this book (and actually I learned A LOT so props to the author) its that astronauts have spent a lot of time living like filthy animals for science, and we are ALL better for it.If you are looking for something a little strange, informative, and easily translatable to fodder for all sorts of awkward holiday-party small-talk then I really suggest this book."
32,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,4,"This was my first time (finally) reading Mary Roach, and gosh but this was a great place to start, with a topic right up my alley. I love the everyday details and considerations of space travel and the unique weirdnesses of zero-gravity life!!! In that way, Packing for Mars pairs really well with Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. This reading was also well-timed: I visited Houston's NASA Space Center while reading it, and some of the videos on-display there exhibit the sheer giddy silly joy of astronauts hopping around on the moon -- not exactly the dignified, no-nonsense image that we tend to have of astronauts and which tends to go out in the PR materials.Similarly, Roach is a PR department's nightmare as she doggedly delves into the day-to-day considerations of space, no matter how unsavoury or inglorious: food and defecation and loss of bone density, the effects of extended solitude, the bizarre scientific experiments done in an attempt to prepare for the almost-inconceivable. It's occasionally laugh-out-loud funny; nonfiction written in a really light, engaging, accessible tone that I don't think sacrifices its scientific merit at all.It also manages to capture how touching and strange and awe-inspiring it all is, the lengths and sacrifices that we've made to go to space, the thrill and the importance of mankind's curiosity and problem-solving. Really looking forward to reading more from her.To the rocket scientist, you are a problem. You are the most irritating piece of machinery he or she will ever have to deal with. You and your fluctuating metabolism, your puny memory, your frame that comes in a million different configurations. You are unpredictable. You're inconstant. You take weeks to fix. The engineer must worry about the water and oxygen and food you'll need in space, about how much extra fuel it will take to launch your shrimp cocktail and irradiated beef tacos. A solar cell or a thruster nozzle is stable and undemanding. It does not excrete or panic or fall in love with the mission commander. It has no ego. Its structural elements don't start to break down without gravity, and it works just fine without sleep.To me, you are the best thing to happen to rocket science. The human being is the machine that makes the whole endeavor so endlessly intriguing."
33,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46311769-katie-long,5,"Roach brings her inimitable informative irreverence into outer space this time. More specifically to the details, and often indignities, of humans in space. Ever wondered if astronauts get motion sick, have sex in space, or are ever jealous of monkeys? Mary Roach did, and found some very serious people to answer her questions. Her questions are often hilarious, but they are never irrelevant."
34,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Wow! An excellent piece of very readable research of our journey into space & all the considerations for a trip to Mars in, hopefully, 2030. As usual, Roach captured the human side & presented it with plenty of humor.The research had to be difficult for her in many cases. NASA needs publicity to stay funded, but any negative publicity can hurt them immensely, especially since Congress & the VP oversee them. (LBJ basically squashed any females in space for years with a pen stroke.) Considering how divisive our attitudes are on so many subjects, especially taboo ones, it's no wonder that NASA regulates what information goes out with an iron hand. For instance, they once spent a lot of time & money in an effort to give the astronauts a night cap - just a bit of sherry to finish off the day. It all went to waste because news leaked out & a letter writing campaign by a bunch of teetotalers caused too much negative publicity. There are many taboo subjects that come up in relation to space flight & living in zero gee. Two biggies are sex & elimination. As Roach showed so well in her previous book, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, amazingly little is known about sex. NASA, the organization that can write entire books about the seemingly simplest things, ignores the subject. Unfortunately, it's a negative sum game for them. Any research they do into it will cause waves they can't afford. Still, she managed to pry a bit of info out of some, but not much.Elimination took up several chapters & it's not because she's hung up on it, but because it is such a necessary, time consuming & messy business. It's also tied closely to what is eaten & what can be eaten on a long trip when every ounce has to be closely watched & personal odors have a huge impact on morale. It's an amazingly complex feat to deal with a simple stool. At one time, they actually used cameras to record the process & then destroyed the films to avoid bad publicity. Now researchers could really use that data again.How strange & complex the simplest thing becomes when under intense public scrutiny & done without gravity! A lot of what we think we know turns out to be wrong. Even the urge to pee isn't present in zero gee until the bursting point - literally a point at which the urethra could be constricted by the bladder, so urination has to be scheduled to avoid problems.There are more exhaustive books on the subject & many of them are in her bibliography, but I doubt there is a more readable introduction to the complexity of what faces NASA as they prepare for the Mars mission, a culmination of every space effort to date. She did a great job & I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. "
35,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"Mary Roach has made quite a career writing quirky, irreverent books on some of the weirder corners of science. She's covered corpses, the afterlife, sex, and now space. So all the cool subjects. As it turns out, space exploration is a rich and varied subject. Every aspect of life in space has to be carefully, exhaustively researched beforehand, after all. Right down to, ahem, elimination procedures. In the hands of another writer, all of this detail might become overwhelming, or boring, maybe kind of gross, depending on the chapter. But as with her other books, Roach writes with such an infectious delight at what she's learned that I was completely riveted. Sure, I have more than a passing interest in the space program, and that probably helped. One of my friends is even more interested than I am, and this just might end up under her Christmas tree this year."
36,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"Very interesting book about space. Going to the bathroom in space, eating in space, bone deteriorating in space. As always, Roach is funny and informative."
37,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"This book is funny, gross, and fascinating, and I am SO not suited to be an astronaut! If YOU want to be an astronaut, you’d better have a strong stomach and a big tolerance for grossness in general. I had NO IDEA a book about travel in space would read like a scene from a Judd Apatow movie, but it turns out human waste of many varieties is a big issue for NASA. Mary Roach tells us about how space agencies try to prepare astronauts for space travel, and study how the trainees react, and she goes into the details of the history of space travel so far, in the detail that rarely gets reported in regular history books. And she wangles her way onto the Vomit Comet, for research purposes, of course!What I learned is that space travel is tricky for living organisms, like people. We’re adapted for conditions on a planet, where there’s gravity, and opportunities to eat delicious, crumby meals, bathe regularly and take care of elimination in privacy and comfort. Here’s a couple of quotes that illustrate the issue:Gravity facilitates what is known in aerospace waste collection circles as “separation.” Fecal popcorning is the reason Space Shuttle toilets are equipped with rearview mirrors.Women would be more efficient astronauts, but they weren’t included in the early programs because NASA didn’t want to figure out the logistics of female urination. In space. I’m not kidding! Humans take a LOT of maintenance. We’re constantly sweating, shedding hair and skin, sneezing, and doing that whole processing food thing. Our bones need gravity to know to stay strong. Doing all that up in space is much, much trickier, and messier than on Earth. Also, people can get weird in the close confines of a noisy, hot little metal container floating in space. We can get surly and difficult, or some of us may experience the rapture of space and want to float off into the cosmos, or something. Maybe. Maybe it’s just the oxygen mix in those suits.Mary Roach also researches the careers of animals in space (I’ll never forgive Russia for what they did to Laika. Never.), crash impacts on bodies (which reminded me of her first book, Stiff), and sex in space, which isn’t as sexy as it sounds. The focus has been on the impact of no gravity on reproduction, not on, um, logistics. And according to NASA, no one has yet to join the Zero-G club. Not officially, anyways. Well, okay, there were some rats, but that was an experiment. Recommended to everyone who wants to know what the “right stuff” really is. "
38,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"India’s first Mars mission, scheduled for Nov 2014 will cost LESS than the budget of the space film Gravity.After having finished this book I had to read that above statement a few times for it to really sink in. Either space travel has gotten vastly cheaper or Hollywood has finally gone nuts.This book covers everything a layperson would ever want to know about space travel and a host of things you would have preferred not to know. No longer does bravery and a guts n glory attitude maketh an astronaut. Now the ability to follow orders, emotional neutrality and a range of other (very boring) personality traits now make for excellent astronauts.The first part of the book focused on how candidates get tested and selected based on their psychological and physiological responses to a wide range of very absurd tests. If any child with the dream of becoming an astronaut read this book we will have a complete shortage of willing candidates very soon.From the impact of gravity on our internal organs, motion sickness, technical malfunctions, early animal experiments and even the impact of space travel on bone density, all showed just how fragile us humans really are.I have always loved this author’s books as she mixes humor and facts in such a way that entertain and informs the reader at the same time. However in this book it sometimes felt that she was trying a tad too hard with the funny quips (that quickly became not so funny). My solution was to read this over an extended period of time and not all in one go and this worked well to lessen my irritation with the feeling of forced humor.Like her other books the overly ""sciency"" stuff becomes understandable and is absolutely crammed with facts that you would not necessarily find in official NASA reports. Things like the development of self-cleaning underwear to negate needing a bath in space, how space food and space toilets evolved (not nearly enough is the answer).This book was not in the same league as my beloved Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers however it did satisfy my almost insatiable need for trivia facts.Mary Roach is basically the female equivalent of A J Jacobs and if you enjoy his books you will surely love hers."

It's just a matter of adapting to a space suit and a weightless environment. While we have people like Elon Musk enthusiastic about space travel, my biggest personal antagonism about the idea has always related to elimination during space travel, and the fact that any vehicle must end up smelling like a sewer.Gotta be very careful about disposing of human waste in space - Newton's third law applies...This is where Star Trek's transporter technology could be quite useful.

I didn't like some of the comments it suppose to be funny but somehow I found it more of heavy. (it can be audio book's narration style)and another thing is that she is going out of topic some times, and some parts were really boring to me.O right it is a bit old as well, I read it part of a book club."
41,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904933-chris,2,"A decent book with interesting details about space sciences and the biology of human spaceflight. However, the author felt compelled to display her snarky, adolescent humor and go off on tangents on subjects that she must have felt were funny, but which is merely unnecessary gossip and/or gross little anecdotes. It seemed obvious that she was probably jealous of the scientists and astronauts whom she interviewed, failed to understand the pragmatic and hard-headed approach that engineers and scientists must take to accomplish goals, and had to include embarrassing little tidbits about the space sciences and the people who work in that industry. A bit pathetic, and the end of the book did not close the gap between the sour effect of the first 95% of the book, and the barely aspirational closer. Unsure who the intended reader of this book is, besides sniggering adolescents."
42,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter,4,"I generally quite enjoy Mary Roach's books, even though sometimes they are too much information to be read while eating. (Stiff) So when I saw this one, about one of my favourite things in the world, space travel, I was excited. Even more so since I'm running a roleplaying game set on Mars right now, although much further along than the first tentative preparations Roach is talking about here.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

43,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5583595-anna-bananas,3,"Sooo, it only took me a few years to finish this. I tend to stall out on her books and then get back to them. A book about space and everything associated with it was a fascinating idea and for the most part she does a good job of opening up that world for you. Her humor, which I enjoyed very much in Stiff, is sometimes a bit much now. There are a lot of asides and footnotes that don’t necessarily add to the story and just show that she had fun doing the research. I find it more distracting than amusing at this point, after reading four of her books. And yet, I will read more. I love how thoroughly she tackles her topics, exploring all the aspects and angles. I learned about parabolic flight and its uses, how we’re preparing for possible manned Mars missions, the ingredients of space food, how we...poop in space, how our organs and bodies react to gravity - and to the lack of it, the psychology of living in space isolated with other humans, the history of space travel. There’s a lot here and most of it fascinating. My level of enthusiasm waxed and waned, hence the lower rating, but I would still recommend this. It’s an experience and I always value that.Pre-read ranting: My head is stuck in space right now, between reading Dark Space and watching Elysium today and then mulling over my favorite claustrophobic space movies - Event Horizon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien movies, Sunshine (my favorite). Can optimism and joy not survive the vacuum of space or something? They just disappear with the screams?Moving on, Mary Roach makes science both fascinating and hilarious. I'm so excited to read this! I don't know if anything can beat Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers but I'll keep an open mind. Theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7wtsJ...This reminds me of the astronaut story from The Illustrated Man and how the father of the family was more in love with space than with his family."
44,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael,4,"Science fiction movies and novels dealing with long exploration missions to deep space rarely deal with the complexities of our bodies surviving during the long journey through space.Or as the old question asks, ""Where does Captain Kirk go to the bathroom?""Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" not only looks at where Kirk would go, but how such a thing would be possible. It also looks at a lot of other questions that scientists and NASA have to and have addressed during humanity's quest to explore space. From the earliest days of space travel when we wondered if gravity would be required for our internal organs and systems to continue working properly to the affects of long-term weightlessness on our muscle systems, Roach delves into the question of just how will our bodies survive or work during a long voyage to Mars. (Roach even deals with the question of whether its possible or reasonable to have sex in zero g, even watching an adult film that was allegedly shot in zero g). All in all, the book is a fascinating one. Roach maintains a fine line between presenting the facts and having a sense of humor about things. She deals with a lot of bodily functions, but all of these are necessary to consider in whether or not its possible to send humans to Mars or on a long trip into outer space. While we've all thought about how humans would eat in space and use the bathroom, we've probably thought less about how hygiene can and would work in outer space. Will the space ships end up smelling like a locker room or worse? Also delved into are the on-going studies into motion sickness and the inherent dangers faced if you lose your cookies in a space suit. Roach's approach is a solid one with each aspect presented in an understandable, entertaining fashion. What could easily have been a dry subject is instead presented in a fascinating, readable way that will give you a new respect for the men and women who've gone into outer space in the past and those who will head out into the solar system and beyond in our future (hopefully). "
45,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869511-adam,2,"The title of this book is misleading. It doesn't really delve into the plans or obstacles for a manned mission to Mars, but is more of an overview of the history of the world's space programs (mostly U.S.) to date and some background on the human issues that don't readily come to mind when thinking of the challenges of space for humans(food, hygiene, waste management, psychology, physiological effects of zero gravity on humans, etc.)The book rambled a bit from topic to topic (a few pure tangents as well) without much cohesion tying them back to Mars. This is the first Mary Roach book I have read and while the subject matter of her other books seems interesting, I'm not sure I will read another. You know when someone tries to be funny and there's that awkward silence when they fail? Mary Roach writes that way. A lot. It seems like every paragraph there's at least two attempts at humor and I'd guestimate the overall success rate of eliciting a smile or chuckle at about 10% - it got to be too much for me by the halfway point of the book. The funniest moments are actually quotes by other people.Overall most of the topics covered in the book were interesting, the presentation just didn't do it for me."
46,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20773991-holly,4,"This was honestly really interesting, and probably as good (if not better) than Roach's other book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, which I read probably a year back.Roach combines factual information and fun story telling in a great way, that makes these books immensely readable and fun. I've avoided science non-fiction for a long time, mainly because I didn't think I was smart enough per say, but Mary Roach has really introduced me to the realms of popular science and the world of scientific non-fiction.I have Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War on my to read list, and I will undoubtedly read it at some point. But I'll definitely keep my eye out for more popular science books that pique my interest"
47,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,4,"This engagingly readable book tackles the subject of man's exploration of near-space--specifically, the difficult and sometimes messy task of protecting humans as they explore the void of space. At times a history text, at times cutting-edge, it covers a lot of topics in a fun and interesting way. Roach's voice is clear and witty, sometimes biting, other times self-mocking, but always kept my interest. Unfortunately, the book isn't so much about the title as it is about the subtitle, and I would have liked more about the current state of space exploration as it applies to Mars missions. (""Current"" being 2010, when the book was published; I don't ding it for not being written in 2017.) But I enjoyed it immensely, and appreciated the extensive end notes/bibliography, which gave me some ideas for further reading. I will definitely pick up more of Roach's work."

50,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Mary Roach now has a lock on a certain kind of book. Science is her beat, and her shtick is to make it funny — often hilariously funny. But be forewarned: her take on “funny” means she is going to violate any taboo that gets in the way of making you cringe and groan at the same time you laugh.In her first book, 
Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife
, she did the topic as funny-but-creepy, and hadn’t yet glommed on to her now-predictable gross-out brand of humor. That came in brilliantly with her second book, 
Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers
. Now you could get science done as hilarious and creepy and gross!She dropped the creepy and replaced it with mildly titillating in her third (and still my favorite), 
Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex
. But definitely still hilarious and gross.In 
Packing for Mars
, she’s tightened her focus. No more creepy, no more titillating, just funny in that juvenile way of hers. She asks the questions that any “mature” adults would never dare ask, and then begs for the juicy details. I’m sure many of the people she interviews are non-plussed at how to respond; those that don't know her previous work probably think she’s a kook. She appears to be okay with that.As usual, much of her funniest asides come in the form of footnotes. Here’s one, from the chapter on NASA’s research on how to best, er, replicate what toilets do in the absence of gravity. It turns out that NASA has saved the “output” of astronauts for years...Astronaut specimens from the Skylab and Apollo eras are still around, in freezers on the top floor of a windowless high-security building at Houston's Johnson Space Center—the one that houses NASA's collection of (non-biological) moon rocks. “I’m not sure what our inventory of excreta from Apollo is right now,” John Charles told me. “Forty years of freezing, with occasional thaws due to power outages during hurricanes, may have reduced them to mere vestiges of their former glory.” They were there as of 1996, because planetary biologist Ralph Harvey stumbled onto them when he got lost taking a group of VIPs on a tour. “Back then all the doors opened to the same code,” he recalls. “I opened this one door and it was almost like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There were these rows of long, low freezers. They all had a little light on them that’s blinking, and a temperature readout, and a piece of tape with the astronaut’s name. I’m like, Shit, they stored the astronauts in there! and I quickly got the people out. I found out later that was where they stored the astronaut feces and urine.” Harvey can’t recall the room number. “You have to stumble onto it, that’s the only way you can find it. It’s like Narnia.”                 •       •       •See the review at the New York Times: Astral Bodies (August 6, 2010).

51,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Packing for Mars is like Bonk, Stiff and Spook (her three previous books) but in space. Awesome! Everything is better in space. And hilariously entertaining.I have a huge author crush on Mary Roach. She isn't embarrassed by any subject. (I know this for a fact, I got to ask her at her book reading.) She won't pass up a Howdy Doody joke when discussing the difficulties in pooing in zero-G. She also scammed a free copy of zero-G porn movie series and watching it to 'research' zero-G sex. She asks all the probing, detail oriented questions that 99% of us would never even think of. And yet, once we know the questions, we are fascinated by the answers. She uncovers the slightly embarrassing marginalia of the space race.Mary Roach does it so we don't have to!Now for just a few interesting and funny bits I learned while reading Packing for Mars.I had no clue that defecating in zero-G presents with a whole host of complications, many of which only become apparent while in space. NASA and other space agencies have spent a lot of time and money researching ways to not just make a space toilet comfortable and private, but just to merely work.
""A successful zero-gravity toilet is a subtle finessing of engineering, materials science, physiology, psychology, and etiquette. ...If just one element is missing, things don't come out right.""
If I ever hear about the cost of developing a space toilet, I will not flinch an inch. This is important work.Here's another fun random space-based factoid for you: ""The contract for the Apollo lunar landing suits went to International Latex, which later became Playtex."" As in bras. Roach mentions earlier that when NASA needed to develop a space suit, they had no experience in rubberized materials, so they went to a huge bra & underwear manufacturer who sold through the Sears catalogue.This fact is a little more serious (by that I mean less squicky) than the poo/bra stuff above. Did you know that moon dust is incredibly abrasive? Since there's no wind, there's no erosion smoothing the rough corners. Moon dust quickly scratches lenses and helmet visors. To make matters worse, the dust is bombarded with cosmic particles which being impart a charge to the dust. Not only is it sharp, it also sticks to absolutely everything. Get this: there are companies that exist just to produce faux moon dust for NASA.Finally, one last poo joke, because I can't resist. Did you know the opposite of ingest is egest? As in: to reduce the amount of egesta, you must ingest low-residue foods. Here's Roach's goofy footnote to this: 
""Egesta is my new favorite euphemism for 'feces,' and an even better toilet brand name than Ejecto. Certainly better than Toto. Who names a toilet after a lapdog? Unless it's Shit-Tzu. I'd buy a Shit-Tsu toilet.""
 Me too, Mary. Perhaps a footnote generated after sharing too much vodka with the cosmonauts?This book is extremely amusing and wicked entertaining. And I love Mary Roach. I hope she keeps digging up the marginalia of the world.____________PS: Make sure you watch the book trailer - I think it's linked at right on this page. Normally I hate those things, but this one is genuinely funny.PPS: Mary signed my book ""Spacily yours, Mary Roach"" *swoon*"

Mary Roach takes an irreverent look at space travel, and answers all your questions about sex and pooping in space. Actually, she only speculates about the sex -- NASA and the astronauts remain mum on the subject. But while Roach has an informal, sometimes juvenile style (this book is meant to be entertaining, and isn't exactly science journalism), she does research a lot of subjects in exhaustive detail that you've probably always wondered about but didn't think it was appropriate to ask. Problems like elimination in space and hygiene and what to do when you're space-sick may seem funny here on Earth, but they're dead serious concerns that NASA has spent millions of dollars researching (in sometimes bizarre ways). Packing for Mars is full of a million interesting, bizarre, and sometimes disgusting factoids about life in a space capsule. It may make you yearn for a manned Mars mission, but it won't make you envy the astronauts who actually fly it."

This book was published ten years ago and it has aged a bit due to the advancements in space exploration. I have read newer books about space travel that I felt were more interesting with more in-depth information on the space training process. This was more was more anecdoctal than informative with sections on sex, pooping and animal astraunauts. Yet, this was still an enjoyable book to read, especially for someone like myself that doesn’t read a lot of non fiction. Roach has a wonderfully, humorous narrative style that makes the information very digestible to read."

Should be five stars but I rarely give 5 stars so it is kind of 4.48 stars.Mary kept us well-engaged in this space travel journey and while she may not packed us suitably for Mars, she did an excellent job to stimulate our interests further into everything related to Space Travel, whether the basic things that we take for granted (the way we eat, the things we eat, the logistics of walking, dressing, showering, peeing, or from all things, defecating!) or the more challenging parts of it, psychically, socially and, of course, psychologically (think of being alone somewhere in the moon, some 400,000 km away from earth looking at it with a bulky spacesuit and wondering whether you will return back home to have the much-awaited dinner (fish & chips?) with family and kids). Well done, Mary. I mean, seriously, even my 7-year kid liked the incidents that happened and written about in the book. Well, how about sleeping in space? In what activities time is spent for astronauts? Are they just sitting idle in their spacecraft (just sleeping & eating, like we do over the skies in a plane), awaiting to reach their destination? How about women? Are they better fit for the role? Why were they not considered in the earlier space journeys? Patriarchism the culpable as usual?Let's not forget the animals (monkeys and dogs) who ventured into the space and making some history in their way.Wait. How does it smell inside a space capsule? Must be nice I guess or at least something decent to let you endure all the time outside the world. But, wait. It seems it doesn't. Oh no. Please no."
57,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"I’ve been fascinated with space since I was a kid. Space travel has always been a fantasy of mine even though I knew it’s not something I’d ever do even when I was a kid. When I picked up this book, I expected to learn about space travel and some of the expectations, plans, and problems with a potential future mission to Mars. What I got was so much more. Mary Roach had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Her book not only covers the history of space travel and the logistics, but all the hilarious things that is rarely talked about, like pooping at zero gravity.I learned so much from Roach. Everything from space flight testing to zero gravity training is there, but also the psychological worries, experiments, taboos, and the testing that goes on in and out of space. There’s so much history here that was never even hinted at when the first Moon landing was covered in high school history.This book is a treasure. It’s honestly one of the most fascinating books that I’ve ever read. There are seemingly obvious topics thoroughly covered, like the difficultly behind showering at zero gravity and how something as simple as a fuse doesn’t work the same in space thanks to, you guessed it: gravity. Mary also has a wonderful writing style and I like her personality. She took what could’ve been some very dry topics and made them interesting to read about. I highly recommend this book and I’ll be checking out her other works."
58,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"In Mary Roach’s usual style, she takes a humourous look at NASA and space travel in this one, looking at some of the things that most of us just don’t think about when it comes to travelling in zero-gravity. She looks at using the “toilet”, eating, sex, throwing up, hygiene, and more. This did, of course, include some history of space travel, as well. I hadn’t even realized when I started reading it a few days ago that the 50th anniversary of the walk on the moon was yesterday, while I was in the middle reading this – good timing for me! In the first chapter, it was interesting to read about how they made the flag “fly” (with no gravity!) on the moon, and also how to even pack it to bring with them, with the limited space available. There was one real transcript of three astronauts having a discussion when one of them noticed a “turd” flying in the air – omg, I couldn’t stop laughing and crying reading that transcript! Kept me from continuing to read for at least 5 minutes, if not more!! This, and “Stiff” are my favourites of the ones I’ve read by her so far."
59,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Mary Roach is the sort of person who actually ought to be writing science textbooks for junior high. If she had:1) there would have been a lot more careful reading of the science textbooks in my class, and most others2) there would have been a lot more juvenile humor3) most people would have learned a lot more science, and4) the textbooks would no doubt have been banned within a yearSo, unfortunately, we do not have science textbooks written by Mary Roach, for junior high or any other grade. However, we do have books written by Mary Roach, and maybe I should say this one is more about the technology and history of space travel than really the science, but in any case it is awesome. Oddly, both my wife and I liked it, and we don't share a lot in common in our bookish tastes. I think she may be more partial to scatological content than I am. If you're into scatological content, by the way, this is your book (unless, you know, you want _that_ kind of scatological content, in which case no, this is mostly about space travel).We have been sending people into space for over half a century now, and perhaps more importantly for this book, thinking about and preparing to send people into space. It turns out, this is a big deal, and not just the part about making rockets.It turns out, for example, that gravity is extraordinarily useful. Without it, stuff gets lost a lot, and when it does, you have no idea where to look, because it could be anywhere. Crunchy food is unacceptable, because crumbs don't fall, so they get everywhere. Taking a shower is difficult, because water droplets don't fall. Also, a lot of things about how the body eliminates waste, depend upon gravity to work properly.In fact, a recurring theme of this book, is that space travel is really a lot less exciting and a lot more gross than either Russia or the U.S. wants to talk about very much. Roach goes to Russia to speak with a number of cosmonauts about bathrooms, bickering, alcohol, sex, and all the other things that NASA had to think about, in order to see what is inevitable and what could be dealt with differently depending on the culture. It turns out that being a cosmonaut, astronaut, or any other kind of space traveler is in large part about discovering that a lot of simple matters on earth become complicated. It is no exaggeration to say that bathroom design was as much of an obstacle to women in space in the early days, as sexism (although both certainly played a part). It is also no exaggeration to say that bathroom design for the men was way more complex than on earth.I read this book a chapter or two at a time, in the morning at the coffeeshop. My daughter would hear me laughing, and look over at me expectantly. 2 times out of 3, it would be something I couldn't tell her about, because she was eating.But, it's not all scatological. There's also sex, and the closely related topic of arguments. People in very enclosed spaces, for long periods of time, interact in a lot of ways. It's not necessarily always discussed with the general public.Or with NASA (or the Russian equivalent). A repeating theme throughout the book is that, whether it's depression or space sickness (equivalent of seasickness, but from zero gravity) or arguments or anything else that makes you less than perfect, the people who go up into space were normally unwilling to admit to any of it to their bosses down on Earth, for fear that it would prevent them from being picked for the next mission. It was part of Mary Roach's job, helped no doubt by the passage of time, to get people to discuss more openly a lot of what did NOT get discussed previously.And, also, a lot of gross stuff. Seriously, there is a lot of discussion of vomit. But, it is Mary Roach's rare talent to be able to write about topics which we would normally (most of us, anyway) shy away from, and make it funny and informative at the same time. This book is no exception."
60,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"When you think about space travel and exploration, nobody ever thinks about the poop bags. This book was interesting and eye-opening about a lot of the mundane minutiae of going into space, made (slightly) less mundane by Mary Roach's writing about it, but what really interested me was all of the ways that gravity allows us to live - and what happens to us when gravity is taken out of the equation. This book covers pretty much everything from physiological results of high G pressures and impacts, to floating poops to bone density changes. I'm sure she would have included a kitchen sink... except that in space, the water would just coalesce into a bubble and mess up the equipment. I didn't find this book quite as funny as I've found Roach in the past, but could just be personal preference. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for space farts. I'll show myself out."
61,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I have an awkward relationship with Mary Roach. I find her humor forced, blatant, and poorly timed and so it always falls flat to me. I realize that a lot of people really appreciate her humor, but it just doesn’t click for me. Actually, I bet I think she was really funny if I heard her talk, because potty humor IS my type of humor, but it just doesn’t seem to translate for me in her books.That said, she researches these absolutely fascinating topics from angles that no one else would, and I totally appreciate that. I mean, really, she is willing to throw her energy and time into researching the history of pooping in space. INQUIRING MINDS REALLY DO WANT TO KNOW. If I had to tell anyone to listen to one chapter from this book it would totally be Chapter 14- the poop chapter. It is hilarious in its own right, poop literally floating around during Apollo missions, and she shies away from nothing. How could you not want to know?If there is anything I learned in this book (and actually I learned A LOT so props to the author) its that astronauts have spent a lot of time living like filthy animals for science, and we are ALL better for it.If you are looking for something a little strange, informative, and easily translatable to fodder for all sorts of awkward holiday-party small-talk then I really suggest this book."
62,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,4,"This was my first time (finally) reading Mary Roach, and gosh but this was a great place to start, with a topic right up my alley. I love the everyday details and considerations of space travel and the unique weirdnesses of zero-gravity life!!! In that way, Packing for Mars pairs really well with Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. This reading was also well-timed: I visited Houston's NASA Space Center while reading it, and some of the videos on-display there exhibit the sheer giddy silly joy of astronauts hopping around on the moon -- not exactly the dignified, no-nonsense image that we tend to have of astronauts and which tends to go out in the PR materials.Similarly, Roach is a PR department's nightmare as she doggedly delves into the day-to-day considerations of space, no matter how unsavoury or inglorious: food and defecation and loss of bone density, the effects of extended solitude, the bizarre scientific experiments done in an attempt to prepare for the almost-inconceivable. It's occasionally laugh-out-loud funny; nonfiction written in a really light, engaging, accessible tone that I don't think sacrifices its scientific merit at all.It also manages to capture how touching and strange and awe-inspiring it all is, the lengths and sacrifices that we've made to go to space, the thrill and the importance of mankind's curiosity and problem-solving. Really looking forward to reading more from her.To the rocket scientist, you are a problem. You are the most irritating piece of machinery he or she will ever have to deal with. You and your fluctuating metabolism, your puny memory, your frame that comes in a million different configurations. You are unpredictable. You're inconstant. You take weeks to fix. The engineer must worry about the water and oxygen and food you'll need in space, about how much extra fuel it will take to launch your shrimp cocktail and irradiated beef tacos. A solar cell or a thruster nozzle is stable and undemanding. It does not excrete or panic or fall in love with the mission commander. It has no ego. Its structural elements don't start to break down without gravity, and it works just fine without sleep.To me, you are the best thing to happen to rocket science. The human being is the machine that makes the whole endeavor so endlessly intriguing."
63,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46311769-katie-long,5,"Roach brings her inimitable informative irreverence into outer space this time. More specifically to the details, and often indignities, of humans in space. Ever wondered if astronauts get motion sick, have sex in space, or are ever jealous of monkeys? Mary Roach did, and found some very serious people to answer her questions. Her questions are often hilarious, but they are never irrelevant."
64,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Wow! An excellent piece of very readable research of our journey into space & all the considerations for a trip to Mars in, hopefully, 2030. As usual, Roach captured the human side & presented it with plenty of humor.The research had to be difficult for her in many cases. NASA needs publicity to stay funded, but any negative publicity can hurt them immensely, especially since Congress & the VP oversee them. (LBJ basically squashed any females in space for years with a pen stroke.) Considering how divisive our attitudes are on so many subjects, especially taboo ones, it's no wonder that NASA regulates what information goes out with an iron hand. For instance, they once spent a lot of time & money in an effort to give the astronauts a night cap - just a bit of sherry to finish off the day. It all went to waste because news leaked out & a letter writing campaign by a bunch of teetotalers caused too much negative publicity. There are many taboo subjects that come up in relation to space flight & living in zero gee. Two biggies are sex & elimination. As Roach showed so well in her previous book, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, amazingly little is known about sex. NASA, the organization that can write entire books about the seemingly simplest things, ignores the subject. Unfortunately, it's a negative sum game for them. Any research they do into it will cause waves they can't afford. Still, she managed to pry a bit of info out of some, but not much.Elimination took up several chapters & it's not because she's hung up on it, but because it is such a necessary, time consuming & messy business. It's also tied closely to what is eaten & what can be eaten on a long trip when every ounce has to be closely watched & personal odors have a huge impact on morale. It's an amazingly complex feat to deal with a simple stool. At one time, they actually used cameras to record the process & then destroyed the films to avoid bad publicity. Now researchers could really use that data again.How strange & complex the simplest thing becomes when under intense public scrutiny & done without gravity! A lot of what we think we know turns out to be wrong. Even the urge to pee isn't present in zero gee until the bursting point - literally a point at which the urethra could be constricted by the bladder, so urination has to be scheduled to avoid problems.There are more exhaustive books on the subject & many of them are in her bibliography, but I doubt there is a more readable introduction to the complexity of what faces NASA as they prepare for the Mars mission, a culmination of every space effort to date. She did a great job & I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. "
65,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"Mary Roach has made quite a career writing quirky, irreverent books on some of the weirder corners of science. She's covered corpses, the afterlife, sex, and now space. So all the cool subjects. As it turns out, space exploration is a rich and varied subject. Every aspect of life in space has to be carefully, exhaustively researched beforehand, after all. Right down to, ahem, elimination procedures. In the hands of another writer, all of this detail might become overwhelming, or boring, maybe kind of gross, depending on the chapter. But as with her other books, Roach writes with such an infectious delight at what she's learned that I was completely riveted. Sure, I have more than a passing interest in the space program, and that probably helped. One of my friends is even more interested than I am, and this just might end up under her Christmas tree this year."
66,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"Very interesting book about space. Going to the bathroom in space, eating in space, bone deteriorating in space. As always, Roach is funny and informative."
67,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"This book is funny, gross, and fascinating, and I am SO not suited to be an astronaut! If YOU want to be an astronaut, you’d better have a strong stomach and a big tolerance for grossness in general. I had NO IDEA a book about travel in space would read like a scene from a Judd Apatow movie, but it turns out human waste of many varieties is a big issue for NASA. Mary Roach tells us about how space agencies try to prepare astronauts for space travel, and study how the trainees react, and she goes into the details of the history of space travel so far, in the detail that rarely gets reported in regular history books. And she wangles her way onto the Vomit Comet, for research purposes, of course!What I learned is that space travel is tricky for living organisms, like people. We’re adapted for conditions on a planet, where there’s gravity, and opportunities to eat delicious, crumby meals, bathe regularly and take care of elimination in privacy and comfort. Here’s a couple of quotes that illustrate the issue:Gravity facilitates what is known in aerospace waste collection circles as “separation.” Fecal popcorning is the reason Space Shuttle toilets are equipped with rearview mirrors.Women would be more efficient astronauts, but they weren’t included in the early programs because NASA didn’t want to figure out the logistics of female urination. In space. I’m not kidding! Humans take a LOT of maintenance. We’re constantly sweating, shedding hair and skin, sneezing, and doing that whole processing food thing. Our bones need gravity to know to stay strong. Doing all that up in space is much, much trickier, and messier than on Earth. Also, people can get weird in the close confines of a noisy, hot little metal container floating in space. We can get surly and difficult, or some of us may experience the rapture of space and want to float off into the cosmos, or something. Maybe. Maybe it’s just the oxygen mix in those suits.Mary Roach also researches the careers of animals in space (I’ll never forgive Russia for what they did to Laika. Never.), crash impacts on bodies (which reminded me of her first book, Stiff), and sex in space, which isn’t as sexy as it sounds. The focus has been on the impact of no gravity on reproduction, not on, um, logistics. And according to NASA, no one has yet to join the Zero-G club. Not officially, anyways. Well, okay, there were some rats, but that was an experiment. Recommended to everyone who wants to know what the “right stuff” really is. "
68,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"India’s first Mars mission, scheduled for Nov 2014 will cost LESS than the budget of the space film Gravity.After having finished this book I had to read that above statement a few times for it to really sink in. Either space travel has gotten vastly cheaper or Hollywood has finally gone nuts.This book covers everything a layperson would ever want to know about space travel and a host of things you would have preferred not to know. No longer does bravery and a guts n glory attitude maketh an astronaut. Now the ability to follow orders, emotional neutrality and a range of other (very boring) personality traits now make for excellent astronauts.The first part of the book focused on how candidates get tested and selected based on their psychological and physiological responses to a wide range of very absurd tests. If any child with the dream of becoming an astronaut read this book we will have a complete shortage of willing candidates very soon.From the impact of gravity on our internal organs, motion sickness, technical malfunctions, early animal experiments and even the impact of space travel on bone density, all showed just how fragile us humans really are.I have always loved this author’s books as she mixes humor and facts in such a way that entertain and informs the reader at the same time. However in this book it sometimes felt that she was trying a tad too hard with the funny quips (that quickly became not so funny). My solution was to read this over an extended period of time and not all in one go and this worked well to lessen my irritation with the feeling of forced humor.Like her other books the overly ""sciency"" stuff becomes understandable and is absolutely crammed with facts that you would not necessarily find in official NASA reports. Things like the development of self-cleaning underwear to negate needing a bath in space, how space food and space toilets evolved (not nearly enough is the answer).This book was not in the same league as my beloved Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers however it did satisfy my almost insatiable need for trivia facts.Mary Roach is basically the female equivalent of A J Jacobs and if you enjoy his books you will surely love hers."

It's just a matter of adapting to a space suit and a weightless environment. While we have people like Elon Musk enthusiastic about space travel, my biggest personal antagonism about the idea has always related to elimination during space travel, and the fact that any vehicle must end up smelling like a sewer.Gotta be very careful about disposing of human waste in space - Newton's third law applies...This is where Star Trek's transporter technology could be quite useful.

I didn't like some of the comments it suppose to be funny but somehow I found it more of heavy. (it can be audio book's narration style)and another thing is that she is going out of topic some times, and some parts were really boring to me.O right it is a bit old as well, I read it part of a book club."
71,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904933-chris,2,"A decent book with interesting details about space sciences and the biology of human spaceflight. However, the author felt compelled to display her snarky, adolescent humor and go off on tangents on subjects that she must have felt were funny, but which is merely unnecessary gossip and/or gross little anecdotes. It seemed obvious that she was probably jealous of the scientists and astronauts whom she interviewed, failed to understand the pragmatic and hard-headed approach that engineers and scientists must take to accomplish goals, and had to include embarrassing little tidbits about the space sciences and the people who work in that industry. A bit pathetic, and the end of the book did not close the gap between the sour effect of the first 95% of the book, and the barely aspirational closer. Unsure who the intended reader of this book is, besides sniggering adolescents."

(Stiff) So when I saw this one, about one of my favourite things in the world, space travel, I was excited. Even more so since I'm running a roleplaying game set on Mars right now, although much further along than the first tentative preparations Roach is talking about here.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

73,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5583595-anna-bananas,3,"Sooo, it only took me a few years to finish this. I tend to stall out on her books and then get back to them. A book about space and everything associated with it was a fascinating idea and for the most part she does a good job of opening up that world for you. Her humor, which I enjoyed very much in Stiff, is sometimes a bit much now. There are a lot of asides and footnotes that don’t necessarily add to the story and just show that she had fun doing the research. I find it more distracting than amusing at this point, after reading four of her books. And yet, I will read more. I love how thoroughly she tackles her topics, exploring all the aspects and angles. I learned about parabolic flight and its uses, how we’re preparing for possible manned Mars missions, the ingredients of space food, how we...poop in space, how our organs and bodies react to gravity - and to the lack of it, the psychology of living in space isolated with other humans, the history of space travel. There’s a lot here and most of it fascinating. My level of enthusiasm waxed and waned, hence the lower rating, but I would still recommend this. It’s an experience and I always value that.Pre-read ranting: My head is stuck in space right now, between reading Dark Space and watching Elysium today and then mulling over my favorite claustrophobic space movies - Event Horizon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien movies, Sunshine (my favorite). Can optimism and joy not survive the vacuum of space or something? They just disappear with the screams?Moving on, Mary Roach makes science both fascinating and hilarious. I'm so excited to read this! I don't know if anything can beat Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers but I'll keep an open mind. Theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7wtsJ...This reminds me of the astronaut story from The Illustrated Man and how the father of the family was more in love with space than with his family."
74,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael,4,"Science fiction movies and novels dealing with long exploration missions to deep space rarely deal with the complexities of our bodies surviving during the long journey through space.Or as the old question asks, ""Where does Captain Kirk go to the bathroom?""Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" not only looks at where Kirk would go, but how such a thing would be possible. It also looks at a lot of other questions that scientists and NASA have to and have addressed during humanity's quest to explore space. From the earliest days of space travel when we wondered if gravity would be required for our internal organs and systems to continue working properly to the affects of long-term weightlessness on our muscle systems, Roach delves into the question of just how will our bodies survive or work during a long voyage to Mars. (Roach even deals with the question of whether its possible or reasonable to have sex in zero g, even watching an adult film that was allegedly shot in zero g). All in all, the book is a fascinating one. Roach maintains a fine line between presenting the facts and having a sense of humor about things. She deals with a lot of bodily functions, but all of these are necessary to consider in whether or not its possible to send humans to Mars or on a long trip into outer space. While we've all thought about how humans would eat in space and use the bathroom, we've probably thought less about how hygiene can and would work in outer space. Will the space ships end up smelling like a locker room or worse? Also delved into are the on-going studies into motion sickness and the inherent dangers faced if you lose your cookies in a space suit. Roach's approach is a solid one with each aspect presented in an understandable, entertaining fashion. What could easily have been a dry subject is instead presented in a fascinating, readable way that will give you a new respect for the men and women who've gone into outer space in the past and those who will head out into the solar system and beyond in our future (hopefully). "
75,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869511-adam,2,"The title of this book is misleading. It doesn't really delve into the plans or obstacles for a manned mission to Mars, but is more of an overview of the history of the world's space programs (mostly U.S.) to date and some background on the human issues that don't readily come to mind when thinking of the challenges of space for humans(food, hygiene, waste management, psychology, physiological effects of zero gravity on humans, etc.)The book rambled a bit from topic to topic (a few pure tangents as well) without much cohesion tying them back to Mars. This is the first Mary Roach book I have read and while the subject matter of her other books seems interesting, I'm not sure I will read another. You know when someone tries to be funny and there's that awkward silence when they fail? Mary Roach writes that way. A lot. It seems like every paragraph there's at least two attempts at humor and I'd guestimate the overall success rate of eliciting a smile or chuckle at about 10% - it got to be too much for me by the halfway point of the book. The funniest moments are actually quotes by other people.Overall most of the topics covered in the book were interesting, the presentation just didn't do it for me."
76,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20773991-holly,4,"This was honestly really interesting, and probably as good (if not better) than Roach's other book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, which I read probably a year back.Roach combines factual information and fun story telling in a great way, that makes these books immensely readable and fun. I've avoided science non-fiction for a long time, mainly because I didn't think I was smart enough per say, but Mary Roach has really introduced me to the realms of popular science and the world of scientific non-fiction.I have Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War on my to read list, and I will undoubtedly read it at some point. But I'll definitely keep my eye out for more popular science books that pique my interest"
77,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,4,"This engagingly readable book tackles the subject of man's exploration of near-space--specifically, the difficult and sometimes messy task of protecting humans as they explore the void of space. At times a history text, at times cutting-edge, it covers a lot of topics in a fun and interesting way. Roach's voice is clear and witty, sometimes biting, other times self-mocking, but always kept my interest. Unfortunately, the book isn't so much about the title as it is about the subtitle, and I would have liked more about the current state of space exploration as it applies to Mars missions. (""Current"" being 2010, when the book was published; I don't ding it for not being written in 2017.) But I enjoyed it immensely, and appreciated the extensive end notes/bibliography, which gave me some ideas for further reading. I will definitely pick up more of Roach's work."

80,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Mary Roach now has a lock on a certain kind of book. Science is her beat, and her shtick is to make it funny — often hilariously funny. But be forewarned: her take on “funny” means she is going to violate any taboo that gets in the way of making you cringe and groan at the same time you laugh.In her first book, 
Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife
, she did the topic as funny-but-creepy, and hadn’t yet glommed on to her now-predictable gross-out brand of humor. That came in brilliantly with her second book, 
Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers
. Now you could get science done as hilarious and creepy and gross!She dropped the creepy and replaced it with mildly titillating in her third (and still my favorite), 
Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex
. But definitely still hilarious and gross.In 
Packing for Mars
, she’s tightened her focus. No more creepy, no more titillating, just funny in that juvenile way of hers. She asks the questions that any “mature” adults would never dare ask, and then begs for the juicy details. I’m sure many of the people she interviews are non-plussed at how to respond; those that don't know her previous work probably think she’s a kook. She appears to be okay with that.As usual, much of her funniest asides come in the form of footnotes. Here’s one, from the chapter on NASA’s research on how to best, er, replicate what toilets do in the absence of gravity. It turns out that NASA has saved the “output” of astronauts for years...Astronaut specimens from the Skylab and Apollo eras are still around, in freezers on the top floor of a windowless high-security building at Houston's Johnson Space Center—the one that houses NASA's collection of (non-biological) moon rocks. “I’m not sure what our inventory of excreta from Apollo is right now,” John Charles told me. “Forty years of freezing, with occasional thaws due to power outages during hurricanes, may have reduced them to mere vestiges of their former glory.” They were there as of 1996, because planetary biologist Ralph Harvey stumbled onto them when he got lost taking a group of VIPs on a tour. “Back then all the doors opened to the same code,” he recalls. “I opened this one door and it was almost like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There were these rows of long, low freezers. They all had a little light on them that’s blinking, and a temperature readout, and a piece of tape with the astronaut’s name. I’m like, Shit, they stored the astronauts in there! and I quickly got the people out. I found out later that was where they stored the astronaut feces and urine.” Harvey can’t recall the room number. “You have to stumble onto it, that’s the only way you can find it. It’s like Narnia.”                 •       •       •See the review at the New York Times: Astral Bodies (August 6, 2010).

81,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Packing for Mars is like Bonk, Stiff and Spook (her three previous books) but in space. Awesome! Everything is better in space. And hilariously entertaining.I have a huge author crush on Mary Roach. She isn't embarrassed by any subject. (I know this for a fact, I got to ask her at her book reading.) She won't pass up a Howdy Doody joke when discussing the difficulties in pooing in zero-G. She also scammed a free copy of zero-G porn movie series and watching it to 'research' zero-G sex. She asks all the probing, detail oriented questions that 99% of us would never even think of. And yet, once we know the questions, we are fascinated by the answers. She uncovers the slightly embarrassing marginalia of the space race.Mary Roach does it so we don't have to!Now for just a few interesting and funny bits I learned while reading Packing for Mars.I had no clue that defecating in zero-G presents with a whole host of complications, many of which only become apparent while in space. NASA and other space agencies have spent a lot of time and money researching ways to not just make a space toilet comfortable and private, but just to merely work.
""A successful zero-gravity toilet is a subtle finessing of engineering, materials science, physiology, psychology, and etiquette. ...If just one element is missing, things don't come out right.""
If I ever hear about the cost of developing a space toilet, I will not flinch an inch. This is important work.Here's another fun random space-based factoid for you: ""The contract for the Apollo lunar landing suits went to International Latex, which later became Playtex."" As in bras. Roach mentions earlier that when NASA needed to develop a space suit, they had no experience in rubberized materials, so they went to a huge bra & underwear manufacturer who sold through the Sears catalogue.This fact is a little more serious (by that I mean less squicky) than the poo/bra stuff above. Did you know that moon dust is incredibly abrasive? Since there's no wind, there's no erosion smoothing the rough corners. Moon dust quickly scratches lenses and helmet visors. To make matters worse, the dust is bombarded with cosmic particles which being impart a charge to the dust. Not only is it sharp, it also sticks to absolutely everything. Get this: there are companies that exist just to produce faux moon dust for NASA.Finally, one last poo joke, because I can't resist. Did you know the opposite of ingest is egest? As in: to reduce the amount of egesta, you must ingest low-residue foods. Here's Roach's goofy footnote to this: 
""Egesta is my new favorite euphemism for 'feces,' and an even better toilet brand name than Ejecto. Certainly better than Toto. Who names a toilet after a lapdog? Unless it's Shit-Tzu. I'd buy a Shit-Tsu toilet.""
 Me too, Mary. Perhaps a footnote generated after sharing too much vodka with the cosmonauts?This book is extremely amusing and wicked entertaining. And I love Mary Roach. I hope she keeps digging up the marginalia of the world.____________PS: Make sure you watch the book trailer - I think it's linked at right on this page. Normally I hate those things, but this one is genuinely funny.PPS: Mary signed my book ""Spacily yours, Mary Roach"" *swoon*"

Mary Roach takes an irreverent look at space travel, and answers all your questions about sex and pooping in space. Actually, she only speculates about the sex -- NASA and the astronauts remain mum on the subject. But while Roach has an informal, sometimes juvenile style (this book is meant to be entertaining, and isn't exactly science journalism), she does research a lot of subjects in exhaustive detail that you've probably always wondered about but didn't think it was appropriate to ask. Problems like elimination in space and hygiene and what to do when you're space-sick may seem funny here on Earth, but they're dead serious concerns that NASA has spent millions of dollars researching (in sometimes bizarre ways). Packing for Mars is full of a million interesting, bizarre, and sometimes disgusting factoids about life in a space capsule. It may make you yearn for a manned Mars mission, but it won't make you envy the astronauts who actually fly it."

This book was published ten years ago and it has aged a bit due to the advancements in space exploration. I have read newer books about space travel that I felt were more interesting with more in-depth information on the space training process. This was more was more anecdoctal than informative with sections on sex, pooping and animal astraunauts. Yet, this was still an enjoyable book to read, especially for someone like myself that doesn’t read a lot of non fiction. Roach has a wonderfully, humorous narrative style that makes the information very digestible to read."

Should be five stars but I rarely give 5 stars so it is kind of 4.48 stars.Mary kept us well-engaged in this space travel journey and while she may not packed us suitably for Mars, she did an excellent job to stimulate our interests further into everything related to Space Travel, whether the basic things that we take for granted (the way we eat, the things we eat, the logistics of walking, dressing, showering, peeing, or from all things, defecating!) or the more challenging parts of it, psychically, socially and, of course, psychologically (think of being alone somewhere in the moon, some 400,000 km away from earth looking at it with a bulky spacesuit and wondering whether you will return back home to have the much-awaited dinner (fish & chips?) with family and kids). Well done, Mary. I mean, seriously, even my 7-year kid liked the incidents that happened and written about in the book. Well, how about sleeping in space? In what activities time is spent for astronauts? Are they just sitting idle in their spacecraft (just sleeping & eating, like we do over the skies in a plane), awaiting to reach their destination? How about women? Are they better fit for the role? Why were they not considered in the earlier space journeys? Patriarchism the culpable as usual?Let's not forget the animals (monkeys and dogs) who ventured into the space and making some history in their way.Wait. How does it smell inside a space capsule? Must be nice I guess or at least something decent to let you endure all the time outside the world. But, wait. It seems it doesn't. Oh no. Please no."
87,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"I’ve been fascinated with space since I was a kid. Space travel has always been a fantasy of mine even though I knew it’s not something I’d ever do even when I was a kid. When I picked up this book, I expected to learn about space travel and some of the expectations, plans, and problems with a potential future mission to Mars. What I got was so much more. Mary Roach had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Her book not only covers the history of space travel and the logistics, but all the hilarious things that is rarely talked about, like pooping at zero gravity.I learned so much from Roach. Everything from space flight testing to zero gravity training is there, but also the psychological worries, experiments, taboos, and the testing that goes on in and out of space. There’s so much history here that was never even hinted at when the first Moon landing was covered in high school history.This book is a treasure. It’s honestly one of the most fascinating books that I’ve ever read. There are seemingly obvious topics thoroughly covered, like the difficultly behind showering at zero gravity and how something as simple as a fuse doesn’t work the same in space thanks to, you guessed it: gravity. Mary also has a wonderful writing style and I like her personality. She took what could’ve been some very dry topics and made them interesting to read about. I highly recommend this book and I’ll be checking out her other works."
88,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"In Mary Roach’s usual style, she takes a humourous look at NASA and space travel in this one, looking at some of the things that most of us just don’t think about when it comes to travelling in zero-gravity. She looks at using the “toilet”, eating, sex, throwing up, hygiene, and more. This did, of course, include some history of space travel, as well. I hadn’t even realized when I started reading it a few days ago that the 50th anniversary of the walk on the moon was yesterday, while I was in the middle reading this – good timing for me! In the first chapter, it was interesting to read about how they made the flag “fly” (with no gravity!) on the moon, and also how to even pack it to bring with them, with the limited space available. There was one real transcript of three astronauts having a discussion when one of them noticed a “turd” flying in the air – omg, I couldn’t stop laughing and crying reading that transcript! Kept me from continuing to read for at least 5 minutes, if not more!! This, and “Stiff” are my favourites of the ones I’ve read by her so far."
89,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Mary Roach is the sort of person who actually ought to be writing science textbooks for junior high. If she had:1) there would have been a lot more careful reading of the science textbooks in my class, and most others2) there would have been a lot more juvenile humor3) most people would have learned a lot more science, and4) the textbooks would no doubt have been banned within a yearSo, unfortunately, we do not have science textbooks written by Mary Roach, for junior high or any other grade. However, we do have books written by Mary Roach, and maybe I should say this one is more about the technology and history of space travel than really the science, but in any case it is awesome. Oddly, both my wife and I liked it, and we don't share a lot in common in our bookish tastes. I think she may be more partial to scatological content than I am. If you're into scatological content, by the way, this is your book (unless, you know, you want _that_ kind of scatological content, in which case no, this is mostly about space travel).We have been sending people into space for over half a century now, and perhaps more importantly for this book, thinking about and preparing to send people into space. It turns out, this is a big deal, and not just the part about making rockets.It turns out, for example, that gravity is extraordinarily useful. Without it, stuff gets lost a lot, and when it does, you have no idea where to look, because it could be anywhere. Crunchy food is unacceptable, because crumbs don't fall, so they get everywhere. Taking a shower is difficult, because water droplets don't fall. Also, a lot of things about how the body eliminates waste, depend upon gravity to work properly.In fact, a recurring theme of this book, is that space travel is really a lot less exciting and a lot more gross than either Russia or the U.S. wants to talk about very much. Roach goes to Russia to speak with a number of cosmonauts about bathrooms, bickering, alcohol, sex, and all the other things that NASA had to think about, in order to see what is inevitable and what could be dealt with differently depending on the culture. It turns out that being a cosmonaut, astronaut, or any other kind of space traveler is in large part about discovering that a lot of simple matters on earth become complicated. It is no exaggeration to say that bathroom design was as much of an obstacle to women in space in the early days, as sexism (although both certainly played a part). It is also no exaggeration to say that bathroom design for the men was way more complex than on earth.I read this book a chapter or two at a time, in the morning at the coffeeshop. My daughter would hear me laughing, and look over at me expectantly. 2 times out of 3, it would be something I couldn't tell her about, because she was eating.But, it's not all scatological. There's also sex, and the closely related topic of arguments. People in very enclosed spaces, for long periods of time, interact in a lot of ways. It's not necessarily always discussed with the general public.Or with NASA (or the Russian equivalent). A repeating theme throughout the book is that, whether it's depression or space sickness (equivalent of seasickness, but from zero gravity) or arguments or anything else that makes you less than perfect, the people who go up into space were normally unwilling to admit to any of it to their bosses down on Earth, for fear that it would prevent them from being picked for the next mission. It was part of Mary Roach's job, helped no doubt by the passage of time, to get people to discuss more openly a lot of what did NOT get discussed previously.And, also, a lot of gross stuff. Seriously, there is a lot of discussion of vomit. But, it is Mary Roach's rare talent to be able to write about topics which we would normally (most of us, anyway) shy away from, and make it funny and informative at the same time. This book is no exception."
90,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"When you think about space travel and exploration, nobody ever thinks about the poop bags. This book was interesting and eye-opening about a lot of the mundane minutiae of going into space, made (slightly) less mundane by Mary Roach's writing about it, but what really interested me was all of the ways that gravity allows us to live - and what happens to us when gravity is taken out of the equation. This book covers pretty much everything from physiological results of high G pressures and impacts, to floating poops to bone density changes. I'm sure she would have included a kitchen sink... except that in space, the water would just coalesce into a bubble and mess up the equipment. I didn't find this book quite as funny as I've found Roach in the past, but could just be personal preference. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for space farts. I'll show myself out."
91,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I have an awkward relationship with Mary Roach. I find her humor forced, blatant, and poorly timed and so it always falls flat to me. I realize that a lot of people really appreciate her humor, but it just doesn’t click for me. Actually, I bet I think she was really funny if I heard her talk, because potty humor IS my type of humor, but it just doesn’t seem to translate for me in her books.That said, she researches these absolutely fascinating topics from angles that no one else would, and I totally appreciate that. I mean, really, she is willing to throw her energy and time into researching the history of pooping in space. INQUIRING MINDS REALLY DO WANT TO KNOW. If I had to tell anyone to listen to one chapter from this book it would totally be Chapter 14- the poop chapter. It is hilarious in its own right, poop literally floating around during Apollo missions, and she shies away from nothing. How could you not want to know?If there is anything I learned in this book (and actually I learned A LOT so props to the author) its that astronauts have spent a lot of time living like filthy animals for science, and we are ALL better for it.If you are looking for something a little strange, informative, and easily translatable to fodder for all sorts of awkward holiday-party small-talk then I really suggest this book."
92,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,4,"This was my first time (finally) reading Mary Roach, and gosh but this was a great place to start, with a topic right up my alley. I love the everyday details and considerations of space travel and the unique weirdnesses of zero-gravity life!!! In that way, Packing for Mars pairs really well with Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. This reading was also well-timed: I visited Houston's NASA Space Center while reading it, and some of the videos on-display there exhibit the sheer giddy silly joy of astronauts hopping around on the moon -- not exactly the dignified, no-nonsense image that we tend to have of astronauts and which tends to go out in the PR materials.Similarly, Roach is a PR department's nightmare as she doggedly delves into the day-to-day considerations of space, no matter how unsavoury or inglorious: food and defecation and loss of bone density, the effects of extended solitude, the bizarre scientific experiments done in an attempt to prepare for the almost-inconceivable. It's occasionally laugh-out-loud funny; nonfiction written in a really light, engaging, accessible tone that I don't think sacrifices its scientific merit at all.It also manages to capture how touching and strange and awe-inspiring it all is, the lengths and sacrifices that we've made to go to space, the thrill and the importance of mankind's curiosity and problem-solving. Really looking forward to reading more from her.To the rocket scientist, you are a problem. You are the most irritating piece of machinery he or she will ever have to deal with. You and your fluctuating metabolism, your puny memory, your frame that comes in a million different configurations. You are unpredictable. You're inconstant. You take weeks to fix. The engineer must worry about the water and oxygen and food you'll need in space, about how much extra fuel it will take to launch your shrimp cocktail and irradiated beef tacos. A solar cell or a thruster nozzle is stable and undemanding. It does not excrete or panic or fall in love with the mission commander. It has no ego. Its structural elements don't start to break down without gravity, and it works just fine without sleep.To me, you are the best thing to happen to rocket science. The human being is the machine that makes the whole endeavor so endlessly intriguing."
93,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46311769-katie-long,5,"Roach brings her inimitable informative irreverence into outer space this time. More specifically to the details, and often indignities, of humans in space. Ever wondered if astronauts get motion sick, have sex in space, or are ever jealous of monkeys? Mary Roach did, and found some very serious people to answer her questions. Her questions are often hilarious, but they are never irrelevant."
94,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Wow! An excellent piece of very readable research of our journey into space & all the considerations for a trip to Mars in, hopefully, 2030. As usual, Roach captured the human side & presented it with plenty of humor.The research had to be difficult for her in many cases. NASA needs publicity to stay funded, but any negative publicity can hurt them immensely, especially since Congress & the VP oversee them. (LBJ basically squashed any females in space for years with a pen stroke.) Considering how divisive our attitudes are on so many subjects, especially taboo ones, it's no wonder that NASA regulates what information goes out with an iron hand. For instance, they once spent a lot of time & money in an effort to give the astronauts a night cap - just a bit of sherry to finish off the day. It all went to waste because news leaked out & a letter writing campaign by a bunch of teetotalers caused too much negative publicity. There are many taboo subjects that come up in relation to space flight & living in zero gee. Two biggies are sex & elimination. As Roach showed so well in her previous book, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, amazingly little is known about sex. NASA, the organization that can write entire books about the seemingly simplest things, ignores the subject. Unfortunately, it's a negative sum game for them. Any research they do into it will cause waves they can't afford. Still, she managed to pry a bit of info out of some, but not much.Elimination took up several chapters & it's not because she's hung up on it, but because it is such a necessary, time consuming & messy business. It's also tied closely to what is eaten & what can be eaten on a long trip when every ounce has to be closely watched & personal odors have a huge impact on morale. It's an amazingly complex feat to deal with a simple stool. At one time, they actually used cameras to record the process & then destroyed the films to avoid bad publicity. Now researchers could really use that data again.How strange & complex the simplest thing becomes when under intense public scrutiny & done without gravity! A lot of what we think we know turns out to be wrong. Even the urge to pee isn't present in zero gee until the bursting point - literally a point at which the urethra could be constricted by the bladder, so urination has to be scheduled to avoid problems.There are more exhaustive books on the subject & many of them are in her bibliography, but I doubt there is a more readable introduction to the complexity of what faces NASA as they prepare for the Mars mission, a culmination of every space effort to date. She did a great job & I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. "
95,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"Mary Roach has made quite a career writing quirky, irreverent books on some of the weirder corners of science. She's covered corpses, the afterlife, sex, and now space. So all the cool subjects. As it turns out, space exploration is a rich and varied subject. Every aspect of life in space has to be carefully, exhaustively researched beforehand, after all. Right down to, ahem, elimination procedures. In the hands of another writer, all of this detail might become overwhelming, or boring, maybe kind of gross, depending on the chapter. But as with her other books, Roach writes with such an infectious delight at what she's learned that I was completely riveted. Sure, I have more than a passing interest in the space program, and that probably helped. One of my friends is even more interested than I am, and this just might end up under her Christmas tree this year."
96,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"Very interesting book about space. Going to the bathroom in space, eating in space, bone deteriorating in space. As always, Roach is funny and informative."
97,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"This book is funny, gross, and fascinating, and I am SO not suited to be an astronaut! If YOU want to be an astronaut, you’d better have a strong stomach and a big tolerance for grossness in general. I had NO IDEA a book about travel in space would read like a scene from a Judd Apatow movie, but it turns out human waste of many varieties is a big issue for NASA. Mary Roach tells us about how space agencies try to prepare astronauts for space travel, and study how the trainees react, and she goes into the details of the history of space travel so far, in the detail that rarely gets reported in regular history books. And she wangles her way onto the Vomit Comet, for research purposes, of course!What I learned is that space travel is tricky for living organisms, like people. We’re adapted for conditions on a planet, where there’s gravity, and opportunities to eat delicious, crumby meals, bathe regularly and take care of elimination in privacy and comfort. Here’s a couple of quotes that illustrate the issue:Gravity facilitates what is known in aerospace waste collection circles as “separation.” Fecal popcorning is the reason Space Shuttle toilets are equipped with rearview mirrors.Women would be more efficient astronauts, but they weren’t included in the early programs because NASA didn’t want to figure out the logistics of female urination. In space. I’m not kidding! Humans take a LOT of maintenance. We’re constantly sweating, shedding hair and skin, sneezing, and doing that whole processing food thing. Our bones need gravity to know to stay strong. Doing all that up in space is much, much trickier, and messier than on Earth. Also, people can get weird in the close confines of a noisy, hot little metal container floating in space. We can get surly and difficult, or some of us may experience the rapture of space and want to float off into the cosmos, or something. Maybe. Maybe it’s just the oxygen mix in those suits.Mary Roach also researches the careers of animals in space (I’ll never forgive Russia for what they did to Laika. Never.), crash impacts on bodies (which reminded me of her first book, Stiff), and sex in space, which isn’t as sexy as it sounds. The focus has been on the impact of no gravity on reproduction, not on, um, logistics. And according to NASA, no one has yet to join the Zero-G club. Not officially, anyways. Well, okay, there were some rats, but that was an experiment. Recommended to everyone who wants to know what the “right stuff” really is. "

Either space travel has gotten vastly cheaper or Hollywood has finally gone nuts.This book covers everything a layperson would ever want to know about space travel and a host of things you would have preferred not to know. No longer does bravery and a guts n glory attitude maketh an astronaut. Now the ability to follow orders, emotional neutrality and a range of other (very boring) personality traits now make for excellent astronauts.The first part of the book focused on how candidates get tested and selected based on their psychological and physiological responses to a wide range of very absurd tests. If any child with the dream of becoming an astronaut read this book we will have a complete shortage of willing candidates very soon.From the impact of gravity on our internal organs, motion sickness, technical malfunctions, early animal experiments and even the impact of space travel on bone density, all showed just how fragile us humans really are.I have always loved this author’s books as she mixes humor and facts in such a way that entertain and informs the reader at the same time. However in this book it sometimes felt that she was trying a tad too hard with the funny quips (that quickly became not so funny). My solution was to read this over an extended period of time and not all in one go and this worked well to lessen my irritation with the feeling of forced humor.Like her other books the overly ""sciency"" stuff becomes understandable and is absolutely crammed with facts that you would not necessarily find in official NASA reports. Things like the development of self-cleaning underwear to negate needing a bath in space, how space food and space toilets evolved (not nearly enough is the answer).This book was not in the same league as my beloved Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers however it did satisfy my almost insatiable need for trivia facts.Mary Roach is basically the female equivalent of A J Jacobs and if you enjoy his books you will surely love hers."

(it can be audio book's narration style)and another thing is that she is going out of topic some times, and some parts were really boring to me.O right it is a bit old as well, I read it part of a book club."
101,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904933-chris,2,"A decent book with interesting details about space sciences and the biology of human spaceflight. However, the author felt compelled to display her snarky, adolescent humor and go off on tangents on subjects that she must have felt were funny, but which is merely unnecessary gossip and/or gross little anecdotes. It seemed obvious that she was probably jealous of the scientists and astronauts whom she interviewed, failed to understand the pragmatic and hard-headed approach that engineers and scientists must take to accomplish goals, and had to include embarrassing little tidbits about the space sciences and the people who work in that industry. A bit pathetic, and the end of the book did not close the gap between the sour effect of the first 95% of the book, and the barely aspirational closer. Unsure who the intended reader of this book is, besides sniggering adolescents."

(Stiff) So when I saw this one, about one of my favourite things in the world, space travel, I was excited. Even more so since I'm running a roleplaying game set on Mars right now, although much further along than the first tentative preparations Roach is talking about here.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

103,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5583595-anna-bananas,3,"Sooo, it only took me a few years to finish this. I tend to stall out on her books and then get back to them. A book about space and everything associated with it was a fascinating idea and for the most part she does a good job of opening up that world for you. Her humor, which I enjoyed very much in Stiff, is sometimes a bit much now. There are a lot of asides and footnotes that don’t necessarily add to the story and just show that she had fun doing the research. I find it more distracting than amusing at this point, after reading four of her books. And yet, I will read more. I love how thoroughly she tackles her topics, exploring all the aspects and angles. I learned about parabolic flight and its uses, how we’re preparing for possible manned Mars missions, the ingredients of space food, how we...poop in space, how our organs and bodies react to gravity - and to the lack of it, the psychology of living in space isolated with other humans, the history of space travel. There’s a lot here and most of it fascinating. My level of enthusiasm waxed and waned, hence the lower rating, but I would still recommend this. It’s an experience and I always value that.Pre-read ranting: My head is stuck in space right now, between reading Dark Space and watching Elysium today and then mulling over my favorite claustrophobic space movies - Event Horizon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien movies, Sunshine (my favorite). Can optimism and joy not survive the vacuum of space or something? They just disappear with the screams?Moving on, Mary Roach makes science both fascinating and hilarious. I'm so excited to read this! I don't know if anything can beat Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers but I'll keep an open mind. Theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7wtsJ...This reminds me of the astronaut story from The Illustrated Man and how the father of the family was more in love with space than with his family."
104,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael,4,"Science fiction movies and novels dealing with long exploration missions to deep space rarely deal with the complexities of our bodies surviving during the long journey through space.Or as the old question asks, ""Where does Captain Kirk go to the bathroom?""Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" not only looks at where Kirk would go, but how such a thing would be possible. It also looks at a lot of other questions that scientists and NASA have to and have addressed during humanity's quest to explore space. From the earliest days of space travel when we wondered if gravity would be required for our internal organs and systems to continue working properly to the affects of long-term weightlessness on our muscle systems, Roach delves into the question of just how will our bodies survive or work during a long voyage to Mars. (Roach even deals with the question of whether its possible or reasonable to have sex in zero g, even watching an adult film that was allegedly shot in zero g). All in all, the book is a fascinating one. Roach maintains a fine line between presenting the facts and having a sense of humor about things. She deals with a lot of bodily functions, but all of these are necessary to consider in whether or not its possible to send humans to Mars or on a long trip into outer space. While we've all thought about how humans would eat in space and use the bathroom, we've probably thought less about how hygiene can and would work in outer space. Will the space ships end up smelling like a locker room or worse? Also delved into are the on-going studies into motion sickness and the inherent dangers faced if you lose your cookies in a space suit. Roach's approach is a solid one with each aspect presented in an understandable, entertaining fashion. What could easily have been a dry subject is instead presented in a fascinating, readable way that will give you a new respect for the men and women who've gone into outer space in the past and those who will head out into the solar system and beyond in our future (hopefully). "
105,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869511-adam,2,"The title of this book is misleading. It doesn't really delve into the plans or obstacles for a manned mission to Mars, but is more of an overview of the history of the world's space programs (mostly U.S.) to date and some background on the human issues that don't readily come to mind when thinking of the challenges of space for humans(food, hygiene, waste management, psychology, physiological effects of zero gravity on humans, etc.)The book rambled a bit from topic to topic (a few pure tangents as well) without much cohesion tying them back to Mars. This is the first Mary Roach book I have read and while the subject matter of her other books seems interesting, I'm not sure I will read another. You know when someone tries to be funny and there's that awkward silence when they fail? Mary Roach writes that way. A lot. It seems like every paragraph there's at least two attempts at humor and I'd guestimate the overall success rate of eliciting a smile or chuckle at about 10% - it got to be too much for me by the halfway point of the book. The funniest moments are actually quotes by other people.Overall most of the topics covered in the book were interesting, the presentation just didn't do it for me."
106,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20773991-holly,4,"This was honestly really interesting, and probably as good (if not better) than Roach's other book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, which I read probably a year back.Roach combines factual information and fun story telling in a great way, that makes these books immensely readable and fun. I've avoided science non-fiction for a long time, mainly because I didn't think I was smart enough per say, but Mary Roach has really introduced me to the realms of popular science and the world of scientific non-fiction.I have Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War on my to read list, and I will undoubtedly read it at some point. But I'll definitely keep my eye out for more popular science books that pique my interest"
107,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,4,"This engagingly readable book tackles the subject of man's exploration of near-space--specifically, the difficult and sometimes messy task of protecting humans as they explore the void of space. At times a history text, at times cutting-edge, it covers a lot of topics in a fun and interesting way. Roach's voice is clear and witty, sometimes biting, other times self-mocking, but always kept my interest. Unfortunately, the book isn't so much about the title as it is about the subtitle, and I would have liked more about the current state of space exploration as it applies to Mars missions. (""Current"" being 2010, when the book was published; I don't ding it for not being written in 2017.) But I enjoyed it immensely, and appreciated the extensive end notes/bibliography, which gave me some ideas for further reading. I will definitely pick up more of Roach's work."

I was most interested to hear what Muslims do for prayer time when they are orbiting Earth. Figure the timing according to where you were last on Earth and follow that 5 times per day. Face toward Earth etc. Eating, drinking, sleeping, bathroom stuff-- all covered in this interesting book. She uses a lot of websites for references, but many interviews and research of the scientific literature."

Mary Roach has a highly irreverent approach to science that I really enjoy. 
110,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Mary Roach now has a lock on a certain kind of book. Science is her beat, and her shtick is to make it funny — often hilariously funny. But be forewarned: her take on “funny” means she is going to violate any taboo that gets in the way of making you cringe and groan at the same time you laugh.In her first book, 
Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife
, she did the topic as funny-but-creepy, and hadn’t yet glommed on to her now-predictable gross-out brand of humor. That came in brilliantly with her second book, 
Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers
. Now you could get science done as hilarious and creepy and gross!She dropped the creepy and replaced it with mildly titillating in her third (and still my favorite), 
Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex
. But definitely still hilarious and gross.In 
Packing for Mars
, she’s tightened her focus. No more creepy, no more titillating, just funny in that juvenile way of hers. She asks the questions that any “mature” adults would never dare ask, and then begs for the juicy details. I’m sure many of the people she interviews are non-plussed at how to respond; those that don't know her previous work probably think she’s a kook. She appears to be okay with that.As usual, much of her funniest asides come in the form of footnotes. Here’s one, from the chapter on NASA’s research on how to best, er, replicate what toilets do in the absence of gravity. It turns out that NASA has saved the “output” of astronauts for years...Astronaut specimens from the Skylab and Apollo eras are still around, in freezers on the top floor of a windowless high-security building at Houston's Johnson Space Center—the one that houses NASA's collection of (non-biological) moon rocks. “I’m not sure what our inventory of excreta from Apollo is right now,” John Charles told me. “Forty years of freezing, with occasional thaws due to power outages during hurricanes, may have reduced them to mere vestiges of their former glory.” They were there as of 1996, because planetary biologist Ralph Harvey stumbled onto them when he got lost taking a group of VIPs on a tour. “Back then all the doors opened to the same code,” he recalls. “I opened this one door and it was almost like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There were these rows of long, low freezers. They all had a little light on them that’s blinking, and a temperature readout, and a piece of tape with the astronaut’s name. I’m like, Shit, they stored the astronauts in there! and I quickly got the people out. I found out later that was where they stored the astronaut feces and urine.” Harvey can’t recall the room number. “You have to stumble onto it, that’s the only way you can find it. It’s like Narnia.”                 •       •       •See the review at the New York Times: Astral Bodies (August 6, 2010).

111,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Packing for Mars is like Bonk, Stiff and Spook (her three previous books) but in space. Awesome! Everything is better in space. And hilariously entertaining.I have a huge author crush on Mary Roach. She isn't embarrassed by any subject. (I know this for a fact, I got to ask her at her book reading.) She won't pass up a Howdy Doody joke when discussing the difficulties in pooing in zero-G. She also scammed a free copy of zero-G porn movie series and watching it to 'research' zero-G sex. She asks all the probing, detail oriented questions that 99% of us would never even think of. And yet, once we know the questions, we are fascinated by the answers. She uncovers the slightly embarrassing marginalia of the space race.Mary Roach does it so we don't have to!Now for just a few interesting and funny bits I learned while reading Packing for Mars.I had no clue that defecating in zero-G presents with a whole host of complications, many of which only become apparent while in space. NASA and other space agencies have spent a lot of time and money researching ways to not just make a space toilet comfortable and private, but just to merely work.
""A successful zero-gravity toilet is a subtle finessing of engineering, materials science, physiology, psychology, and etiquette. ...If just one element is missing, things don't come out right.""
If I ever hear about the cost of developing a space toilet, I will not flinch an inch. This is important work.Here's another fun random space-based factoid for you: ""The contract for the Apollo lunar landing suits went to International Latex, which later became Playtex."" As in bras. Roach mentions earlier that when NASA needed to develop a space suit, they had no experience in rubberized materials, so they went to a huge bra & underwear manufacturer who sold through the Sears catalogue.This fact is a little more serious (by that I mean less squicky) than the poo/bra stuff above. Did you know that moon dust is incredibly abrasive? Since there's no wind, there's no erosion smoothing the rough corners. Moon dust quickly scratches lenses and helmet visors. To make matters worse, the dust is bombarded with cosmic particles which being impart a charge to the dust. Not only is it sharp, it also sticks to absolutely everything. Get this: there are companies that exist just to produce faux moon dust for NASA.Finally, one last poo joke, because I can't resist. Did you know the opposite of ingest is egest? As in: to reduce the amount of egesta, you must ingest low-residue foods. Here's Roach's goofy footnote to this: 
""Egesta is my new favorite euphemism for 'feces,' and an even better toilet brand name than Ejecto. Certainly better than Toto. Who names a toilet after a lapdog? Unless it's Shit-Tzu. I'd buy a Shit-Tsu toilet.""
 Me too, Mary. Perhaps a footnote generated after sharing too much vodka with the cosmonauts?This book is extremely amusing and wicked entertaining. And I love Mary Roach. I hope she keeps digging up the marginalia of the world.____________PS: Make sure you watch the book trailer - I think it's linked at right on this page. Normally I hate those things, but this one is genuinely funny.PPS: Mary signed my book ""Spacily yours, Mary Roach"" *swoon*"

Mary Roach takes an irreverent look at space travel, and answers all your questions about sex and pooping in space. Actually, she only speculates about the sex -- NASA and the astronauts remain mum on the subject. But while Roach has an informal, sometimes juvenile style (this book is meant to be entertaining, and isn't exactly science journalism), she does research a lot of subjects in exhaustive detail that you've probably always wondered about but didn't think it was appropriate to ask. Problems like elimination in space and hygiene and what to do when you're space-sick may seem funny here on Earth, but they're dead serious concerns that NASA has spent millions of dollars researching (in sometimes bizarre ways). Packing for Mars is full of a million interesting, bizarre, and sometimes disgusting factoids about life in a space capsule. It may make you yearn for a manned Mars mission, but it won't make you envy the astronauts who actually fly it."
114,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7487619-rachel-theshadesoforange,3,"3.5 StarsThis was an interesting piece of non-fiction that focused on the physical challenges that humans face when going into space. This book was published ten years ago and it has aged a bit due to the advancements in space exploration. I have read newer books about space travel that I felt were more interesting with more in-depth information on the space training process. This was more was more anecdoctal than informative with sections on sex, pooping and animal astraunauts. Yet, this was still an enjoyable book to read, especially for someone like myself that doesn’t read a lot of non fiction. Roach has a wonderfully, humorous narrative style that makes the information very digestible to read."

Should be five stars but I rarely give 5 stars so it is kind of 4.48 stars.Mary kept us well-engaged in this space travel journey and while she may not packed us suitably for Mars, she did an excellent job to stimulate our interests further into everything related to Space Travel, whether the basic things that we take for granted (the way we eat, the things we eat, the logistics of walking, dressing, showering, peeing, or from all things, defecating!) or the more challenging parts of it, psychically, socially and, of course, psychologically (think of being alone somewhere in the moon, some 400,000 km away from earth looking at it with a bulky spacesuit and wondering whether you will return back home to have the much-awaited dinner (fish & chips?) with family and kids). Well done, Mary. I mean, seriously, even my 7-year kid liked the incidents that happened and written about in the book. Well, how about sleeping in space? In what activities time is spent for astronauts? Are they just sitting idle in their spacecraft (just sleeping & eating, like we do over the skies in a plane), awaiting to reach their destination? How about women? Are they better fit for the role? Why were they not considered in the earlier space journeys? Patriarchism the culpable as usual?Let's not forget the animals (monkeys and dogs) who ventured into the space and making some history in their way.Wait. How does it smell inside a space capsule? Must be nice I guess or at least something decent to let you endure all the time outside the world. But, wait. It seems it doesn't. Oh no. Please no."
117,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"I’ve been fascinated with space since I was a kid. Space travel has always been a fantasy of mine even though I knew it’s not something I’d ever do even when I was a kid. When I picked up this book, I expected to learn about space travel and some of the expectations, plans, and problems with a potential future mission to Mars. What I got was so much more. Mary Roach had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Her book not only covers the history of space travel and the logistics, but all the hilarious things that is rarely talked about, like pooping at zero gravity.I learned so much from Roach. Everything from space flight testing to zero gravity training is there, but also the psychological worries, experiments, taboos, and the testing that goes on in and out of space. There’s so much history here that was never even hinted at when the first Moon landing was covered in high school history.This book is a treasure. It’s honestly one of the most fascinating books that I’ve ever read. There are seemingly obvious topics thoroughly covered, like the difficultly behind showering at zero gravity and how something as simple as a fuse doesn’t work the same in space thanks to, you guessed it: gravity. Mary also has a wonderful writing style and I like her personality. She took what could’ve been some very dry topics and made them interesting to read about. I highly recommend this book and I’ll be checking out her other works."
118,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"In Mary Roach’s usual style, she takes a humourous look at NASA and space travel in this one, looking at some of the things that most of us just don’t think about when it comes to travelling in zero-gravity. She looks at using the “toilet”, eating, sex, throwing up, hygiene, and more. This did, of course, include some history of space travel, as well. I hadn’t even realized when I started reading it a few days ago that the 50th anniversary of the walk on the moon was yesterday, while I was in the middle reading this – good timing for me! In the first chapter, it was interesting to read about how they made the flag “fly” (with no gravity!) on the moon, and also how to even pack it to bring with them, with the limited space available. There was one real transcript of three astronauts having a discussion when one of them noticed a “turd” flying in the air – omg, I couldn’t stop laughing and crying reading that transcript! Kept me from continuing to read for at least 5 minutes, if not more!! This, and “Stiff” are my favourites of the ones I’ve read by her so far."
119,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Mary Roach is the sort of person who actually ought to be writing science textbooks for junior high. If she had:1) there would have been a lot more careful reading of the science textbooks in my class, and most others2) there would have been a lot more juvenile humor3) most people would have learned a lot more science, and4) the textbooks would no doubt have been banned within a yearSo, unfortunately, we do not have science textbooks written by Mary Roach, for junior high or any other grade. However, we do have books written by Mary Roach, and maybe I should say this one is more about the technology and history of space travel than really the science, but in any case it is awesome. Oddly, both my wife and I liked it, and we don't share a lot in common in our bookish tastes. I think she may be more partial to scatological content than I am. If you're into scatological content, by the way, this is your book (unless, you know, you want _that_ kind of scatological content, in which case no, this is mostly about space travel).We have been sending people into space for over half a century now, and perhaps more importantly for this book, thinking about and preparing to send people into space. It turns out, this is a big deal, and not just the part about making rockets.It turns out, for example, that gravity is extraordinarily useful. Without it, stuff gets lost a lot, and when it does, you have no idea where to look, because it could be anywhere. Crunchy food is unacceptable, because crumbs don't fall, so they get everywhere. Taking a shower is difficult, because water droplets don't fall. Also, a lot of things about how the body eliminates waste, depend upon gravity to work properly.In fact, a recurring theme of this book, is that space travel is really a lot less exciting and a lot more gross than either Russia or the U.S. wants to talk about very much. Roach goes to Russia to speak with a number of cosmonauts about bathrooms, bickering, alcohol, sex, and all the other things that NASA had to think about, in order to see what is inevitable and what could be dealt with differently depending on the culture. It turns out that being a cosmonaut, astronaut, or any other kind of space traveler is in large part about discovering that a lot of simple matters on earth become complicated. It is no exaggeration to say that bathroom design was as much of an obstacle to women in space in the early days, as sexism (although both certainly played a part). It is also no exaggeration to say that bathroom design for the men was way more complex than on earth.I read this book a chapter or two at a time, in the morning at the coffeeshop. My daughter would hear me laughing, and look over at me expectantly. 2 times out of 3, it would be something I couldn't tell her about, because she was eating.But, it's not all scatological. There's also sex, and the closely related topic of arguments. People in very enclosed spaces, for long periods of time, interact in a lot of ways. It's not necessarily always discussed with the general public.Or with NASA (or the Russian equivalent). A repeating theme throughout the book is that, whether it's depression or space sickness (equivalent of seasickness, but from zero gravity) or arguments or anything else that makes you less than perfect, the people who go up into space were normally unwilling to admit to any of it to their bosses down on Earth, for fear that it would prevent them from being picked for the next mission. It was part of Mary Roach's job, helped no doubt by the passage of time, to get people to discuss more openly a lot of what did NOT get discussed previously.And, also, a lot of gross stuff. Seriously, there is a lot of discussion of vomit. But, it is Mary Roach's rare talent to be able to write about topics which we would normally (most of us, anyway) shy away from, and make it funny and informative at the same time. This book is no exception."
120,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"When you think about space travel and exploration, nobody ever thinks about the poop bags. This book was interesting and eye-opening about a lot of the mundane minutiae of going into space, made (slightly) less mundane by Mary Roach's writing about it, but what really interested me was all of the ways that gravity allows us to live - and what happens to us when gravity is taken out of the equation. This book covers pretty much everything from physiological results of high G pressures and impacts, to floating poops to bone density changes. I'm sure she would have included a kitchen sink... except that in space, the water would just coalesce into a bubble and mess up the equipment. I didn't find this book quite as funny as I've found Roach in the past, but could just be personal preference. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for space farts. I'll show myself out."
121,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I have an awkward relationship with Mary Roach. I find her humor forced, blatant, and poorly timed and so it always falls flat to me. I realize that a lot of people really appreciate her humor, but it just doesn’t click for me. Actually, I bet I think she was really funny if I heard her talk, because potty humor IS my type of humor, but it just doesn’t seem to translate for me in her books.That said, she researches these absolutely fascinating topics from angles that no one else would, and I totally appreciate that. I mean, really, she is willing to throw her energy and time into researching the history of pooping in space. INQUIRING MINDS REALLY DO WANT TO KNOW. If I had to tell anyone to listen to one chapter from this book it would totally be Chapter 14- the poop chapter. It is hilarious in its own right, poop literally floating around during Apollo missions, and she shies away from nothing. How could you not want to know?If there is anything I learned in this book (and actually I learned A LOT so props to the author) its that astronauts have spent a lot of time living like filthy animals for science, and we are ALL better for it.If you are looking for something a little strange, informative, and easily translatable to fodder for all sorts of awkward holiday-party small-talk then I really suggest this book."
122,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,4,"This was my first time (finally) reading Mary Roach, and gosh but this was a great place to start, with a topic right up my alley. I love the everyday details and considerations of space travel and the unique weirdnesses of zero-gravity life!!! In that way, Packing for Mars pairs really well with Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. This reading was also well-timed: I visited Houston's NASA Space Center while reading it, and some of the videos on-display there exhibit the sheer giddy silly joy of astronauts hopping around on the moon -- not exactly the dignified, no-nonsense image that we tend to have of astronauts and which tends to go out in the PR materials.Similarly, Roach is a PR department's nightmare as she doggedly delves into the day-to-day considerations of space, no matter how unsavoury or inglorious: food and defecation and loss of bone density, the effects of extended solitude, the bizarre scientific experiments done in an attempt to prepare for the almost-inconceivable. It's occasionally laugh-out-loud funny; nonfiction written in a really light, engaging, accessible tone that I don't think sacrifices its scientific merit at all.It also manages to capture how touching and strange and awe-inspiring it all is, the lengths and sacrifices that we've made to go to space, the thrill and the importance of mankind's curiosity and problem-solving. Really looking forward to reading more from her.To the rocket scientist, you are a problem. You are the most irritating piece of machinery he or she will ever have to deal with. You and your fluctuating metabolism, your puny memory, your frame that comes in a million different configurations. You are unpredictable. You're inconstant. You take weeks to fix. The engineer must worry about the water and oxygen and food you'll need in space, about how much extra fuel it will take to launch your shrimp cocktail and irradiated beef tacos. A solar cell or a thruster nozzle is stable and undemanding. It does not excrete or panic or fall in love with the mission commander. It has no ego. Its structural elements don't start to break down without gravity, and it works just fine without sleep.To me, you are the best thing to happen to rocket science. The human being is the machine that makes the whole endeavor so endlessly intriguing."
123,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46311769-katie-long,5,"Roach brings her inimitable informative irreverence into outer space this time. More specifically to the details, and often indignities, of humans in space. Ever wondered if astronauts get motion sick, have sex in space, or are ever jealous of monkeys? Mary Roach did, and found some very serious people to answer her questions. Her questions are often hilarious, but they are never irrelevant."
124,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Wow! An excellent piece of very readable research of our journey into space & all the considerations for a trip to Mars in, hopefully, 2030. As usual, Roach captured the human side & presented it with plenty of humor.The research had to be difficult for her in many cases. NASA needs publicity to stay funded, but any negative publicity can hurt them immensely, especially since Congress & the VP oversee them. (LBJ basically squashed any females in space for years with a pen stroke.) Considering how divisive our attitudes are on so many subjects, especially taboo ones, it's no wonder that NASA regulates what information goes out with an iron hand. For instance, they once spent a lot of time & money in an effort to give the astronauts a night cap - just a bit of sherry to finish off the day. It all went to waste because news leaked out & a letter writing campaign by a bunch of teetotalers caused too much negative publicity. There are many taboo subjects that come up in relation to space flight & living in zero gee. Two biggies are sex & elimination. As Roach showed so well in her previous book, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, amazingly little is known about sex. NASA, the organization that can write entire books about the seemingly simplest things, ignores the subject. Unfortunately, it's a negative sum game for them. Any research they do into it will cause waves they can't afford. Still, she managed to pry a bit of info out of some, but not much.Elimination took up several chapters & it's not because she's hung up on it, but because it is such a necessary, time consuming & messy business. It's also tied closely to what is eaten & what can be eaten on a long trip when every ounce has to be closely watched & personal odors have a huge impact on morale. It's an amazingly complex feat to deal with a simple stool. At one time, they actually used cameras to record the process & then destroyed the films to avoid bad publicity. Now researchers could really use that data again.How strange & complex the simplest thing becomes when under intense public scrutiny & done without gravity! A lot of what we think we know turns out to be wrong. Even the urge to pee isn't present in zero gee until the bursting point - literally a point at which the urethra could be constricted by the bladder, so urination has to be scheduled to avoid problems.There are more exhaustive books on the subject & many of them are in her bibliography, but I doubt there is a more readable introduction to the complexity of what faces NASA as they prepare for the Mars mission, a culmination of every space effort to date. She did a great job & I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. "
125,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"Mary Roach has made quite a career writing quirky, irreverent books on some of the weirder corners of science. She's covered corpses, the afterlife, sex, and now space. So all the cool subjects. As it turns out, space exploration is a rich and varied subject. Every aspect of life in space has to be carefully, exhaustively researched beforehand, after all. Right down to, ahem, elimination procedures. In the hands of another writer, all of this detail might become overwhelming, or boring, maybe kind of gross, depending on the chapter. But as with her other books, Roach writes with such an infectious delight at what she's learned that I was completely riveted. Sure, I have more than a passing interest in the space program, and that probably helped. One of my friends is even more interested than I am, and this just might end up under her Christmas tree this year."

127,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"This book is funny, gross, and fascinating, and I am SO not suited to be an astronaut! If YOU want to be an astronaut, you’d better have a strong stomach and a big tolerance for grossness in general. I had NO IDEA a book about travel in space would read like a scene from a Judd Apatow movie, but it turns out human waste of many varieties is a big issue for NASA. Mary Roach tells us about how space agencies try to prepare astronauts for space travel, and study how the trainees react, and she goes into the details of the history of space travel so far, in the detail that rarely gets reported in regular history books. And she wangles her way onto the Vomit Comet, for research purposes, of course!What I learned is that space travel is tricky for living organisms, like people. We’re adapted for conditions on a planet, where there’s gravity, and opportunities to eat delicious, crumby meals, bathe regularly and take care of elimination in privacy and comfort. Here’s a couple of quotes that illustrate the issue:Gravity facilitates what is known in aerospace waste collection circles as “separation.” Fecal popcorning is the reason Space Shuttle toilets are equipped with rearview mirrors.Women would be more efficient astronauts, but they weren’t included in the early programs because NASA didn’t want to figure out the logistics of female urination. In space. I’m not kidding! Humans take a LOT of maintenance. We’re constantly sweating, shedding hair and skin, sneezing, and doing that whole processing food thing. Our bones need gravity to know to stay strong. Doing all that up in space is much, much trickier, and messier than on Earth. Also, people can get weird in the close confines of a noisy, hot little metal container floating in space. We can get surly and difficult, or some of us may experience the rapture of space and want to float off into the cosmos, or something. Maybe. Maybe it’s just the oxygen mix in those suits.Mary Roach also researches the careers of animals in space (I’ll never forgive Russia for what they did to Laika. Never.), crash impacts on bodies (which reminded me of her first book, Stiff), and sex in space, which isn’t as sexy as it sounds. The focus has been on the impact of no gravity on reproduction, not on, um, logistics. And according to NASA, no one has yet to join the Zero-G club. Not officially, anyways. Well, okay, there were some rats, but that was an experiment. Recommended to everyone who wants to know what the “right stuff” really is. "

Either space travel has gotten vastly cheaper or Hollywood has finally gone nuts.This book covers everything a layperson would ever want to know about space travel and a host of things you would have preferred not to know. No longer does bravery and a guts n glory attitude maketh an astronaut. Now the ability to follow orders, emotional neutrality and a range of other (very boring) personality traits now make for excellent astronauts.The first part of the book focused on how candidates get tested and selected based on their psychological and physiological responses to a wide range of very absurd tests. If any child with the dream of becoming an astronaut read this book we will have a complete shortage of willing candidates very soon.From the impact of gravity on our internal organs, motion sickness, technical malfunctions, early animal experiments and even the impact of space travel on bone density, all showed just how fragile us humans really are.I have always loved this author’s books as she mixes humor and facts in such a way that entertain and informs the reader at the same time. However in this book it sometimes felt that she was trying a tad too hard with the funny quips (that quickly became not so funny). My solution was to read this over an extended period of time and not all in one go and this worked well to lessen my irritation with the feeling of forced humor.Like her other books the overly ""sciency"" stuff becomes understandable and is absolutely crammed with facts that you would not necessarily find in official NASA reports. Things like the development of self-cleaning underwear to negate needing a bath in space, how space food and space toilets evolved (not nearly enough is the answer).This book was not in the same league as my beloved Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers however it did satisfy my almost insatiable need for trivia facts.Mary Roach is basically the female equivalent of A J Jacobs and if you enjoy his books you will surely love hers."

It's just a matter of adapting to a space suit and a weightless environment. While we have people like Elon Musk enthusiastic about space travel, my biggest personal antagonism about the idea has always related to elimination during space travel, and the fact that any vehicle must end up smelling like a sewer.Gotta be very careful about disposing of human waste in space - Newton's third law applies...This is where Star Trek's transporter technology could be quite useful. A mini-transporter in the groin area of the suit would do the job painlessly and efficiently."

I didn't like some of the comments it suppose to be funny but somehow I found it more of heavy. (it can be audio book's narration style)and another thing is that she is going out of topic some times, and some parts were really boring to me.O right it is a bit old as well, I read it part of a book club."
131,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904933-chris,2,"A decent book with interesting details about space sciences and the biology of human spaceflight. However, the author felt compelled to display her snarky, adolescent humor and go off on tangents on subjects that she must have felt were funny, but which is merely unnecessary gossip and/or gross little anecdotes. It seemed obvious that she was probably jealous of the scientists and astronauts whom she interviewed, failed to understand the pragmatic and hard-headed approach that engineers and scientists must take to accomplish goals, and had to include embarrassing little tidbits about the space sciences and the people who work in that industry. A bit pathetic, and the end of the book did not close the gap between the sour effect of the first 95% of the book, and the barely aspirational closer. Unsure who the intended reader of this book is, besides sniggering adolescents."

(Stiff) So when I saw this one, about one of my favourite things in the world, space travel, I was excited. Even more so since I'm running a roleplaying game set on Mars right now, although much further along than the first tentative preparations Roach is talking about here.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

133,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5583595-anna-bananas,3,"Sooo, it only took me a few years to finish this. I tend to stall out on her books and then get back to them. A book about space and everything associated with it was a fascinating idea and for the most part she does a good job of opening up that world for you. Her humor, which I enjoyed very much in Stiff, is sometimes a bit much now. There are a lot of asides and footnotes that don’t necessarily add to the story and just show that she had fun doing the research. I find it more distracting than amusing at this point, after reading four of her books. And yet, I will read more. I love how thoroughly she tackles her topics, exploring all the aspects and angles. I learned about parabolic flight and its uses, how we’re preparing for possible manned Mars missions, the ingredients of space food, how we...poop in space, how our organs and bodies react to gravity - and to the lack of it, the psychology of living in space isolated with other humans, the history of space travel. There’s a lot here and most of it fascinating. My level of enthusiasm waxed and waned, hence the lower rating, but I would still recommend this. It’s an experience and I always value that.Pre-read ranting: My head is stuck in space right now, between reading Dark Space and watching Elysium today and then mulling over my favorite claustrophobic space movies - Event Horizon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien movies, Sunshine (my favorite). Can optimism and joy not survive the vacuum of space or something? They just disappear with the screams?Moving on, Mary Roach makes science both fascinating and hilarious. I'm so excited to read this! I don't know if anything can beat Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers but I'll keep an open mind. Theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7wtsJ...This reminds me of the astronaut story from The Illustrated Man and how the father of the family was more in love with space than with his family."
134,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael,4,"Science fiction movies and novels dealing with long exploration missions to deep space rarely deal with the complexities of our bodies surviving during the long journey through space.Or as the old question asks, ""Where does Captain Kirk go to the bathroom?""Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" not only looks at where Kirk would go, but how such a thing would be possible. It also looks at a lot of other questions that scientists and NASA have to and have addressed during humanity's quest to explore space. From the earliest days of space travel when we wondered if gravity would be required for our internal organs and systems to continue working properly to the affects of long-term weightlessness on our muscle systems, Roach delves into the question of just how will our bodies survive or work during a long voyage to Mars. (Roach even deals with the question of whether its possible or reasonable to have sex in zero g, even watching an adult film that was allegedly shot in zero g). All in all, the book is a fascinating one. Roach maintains a fine line between presenting the facts and having a sense of humor about things. She deals with a lot of bodily functions, but all of these are necessary to consider in whether or not its possible to send humans to Mars or on a long trip into outer space. While we've all thought about how humans would eat in space and use the bathroom, we've probably thought less about how hygiene can and would work in outer space. Will the space ships end up smelling like a locker room or worse? Also delved into are the on-going studies into motion sickness and the inherent dangers faced if you lose your cookies in a space suit. Roach's approach is a solid one with each aspect presented in an understandable, entertaining fashion. What could easily have been a dry subject is instead presented in a fascinating, readable way that will give you a new respect for the men and women who've gone into outer space in the past and those who will head out into the solar system and beyond in our future (hopefully). "
135,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869511-adam,2,"The title of this book is misleading. It doesn't really delve into the plans or obstacles for a manned mission to Mars, but is more of an overview of the history of the world's space programs (mostly U.S.) to date and some background on the human issues that don't readily come to mind when thinking of the challenges of space for humans(food, hygiene, waste management, psychology, physiological effects of zero gravity on humans, etc.)The book rambled a bit from topic to topic (a few pure tangents as well) without much cohesion tying them back to Mars. This is the first Mary Roach book I have read and while the subject matter of her other books seems interesting, I'm not sure I will read another. You know when someone tries to be funny and there's that awkward silence when they fail? Mary Roach writes that way. A lot. It seems like every paragraph there's at least two attempts at humor and I'd guestimate the overall success rate of eliciting a smile or chuckle at about 10% - it got to be too much for me by the halfway point of the book. The funniest moments are actually quotes by other people.Overall most of the topics covered in the book were interesting, the presentation just didn't do it for me."
136,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20773991-holly,4,"This was honestly really interesting, and probably as good (if not better) than Roach's other book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, which I read probably a year back.Roach combines factual information and fun story telling in a great way, that makes these books immensely readable and fun. I've avoided science non-fiction for a long time, mainly because I didn't think I was smart enough per say, but Mary Roach has really introduced me to the realms of popular science and the world of scientific non-fiction.I have Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War on my to read list, and I will undoubtedly read it at some point. But I'll definitely keep my eye out for more popular science books that pique my interest"
137,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,4,"This engagingly readable book tackles the subject of man's exploration of near-space--specifically, the difficult and sometimes messy task of protecting humans as they explore the void of space. At times a history text, at times cutting-edge, it covers a lot of topics in a fun and interesting way. Roach's voice is clear and witty, sometimes biting, other times self-mocking, but always kept my interest. Unfortunately, the book isn't so much about the title as it is about the subtitle, and I would have liked more about the current state of space exploration as it applies to Mars missions. (""Current"" being 2010, when the book was published; I don't ding it for not being written in 2017.) But I enjoyed it immensely, and appreciated the extensive end notes/bibliography, which gave me some ideas for further reading. I will definitely pick up more of Roach's work."

140,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Mary Roach now has a lock on a certain kind of book. Science is her beat, and her shtick is to make it funny — often hilariously funny. But be forewarned: her take on “funny” means she is going to violate any taboo that gets in the way of making you cringe and groan at the same time you laugh.In her first book, 
Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife
, she did the topic as funny-but-creepy, and hadn’t yet glommed on to her now-predictable gross-out brand of humor. That came in brilliantly with her second book, 
Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers
. Now you could get science done as hilarious and creepy and gross!She dropped the creepy and replaced it with mildly titillating in her third (and still my favorite), 
Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex
. But definitely still hilarious and gross.In 
Packing for Mars
, she’s tightened her focus. No more creepy, no more titillating, just funny in that juvenile way of hers. She asks the questions that any “mature” adults would never dare ask, and then begs for the juicy details. I’m sure many of the people she interviews are non-plussed at how to respond; those that don't know her previous work probably think she’s a kook. She appears to be okay with that.As usual, much of her funniest asides come in the form of footnotes. Here’s one, from the chapter on NASA’s research on how to best, er, replicate what toilets do in the absence of gravity. It turns out that NASA has saved the “output” of astronauts for years...Astronaut specimens from the Skylab and Apollo eras are still around, in freezers on the top floor of a windowless high-security building at Houston's Johnson Space Center—the one that houses NASA's collection of (non-biological) moon rocks. “I’m not sure what our inventory of excreta from Apollo is right now,” John Charles told me. “Forty years of freezing, with occasional thaws due to power outages during hurricanes, may have reduced them to mere vestiges of their former glory.” They were there as of 1996, because planetary biologist Ralph Harvey stumbled onto them when he got lost taking a group of VIPs on a tour. “Back then all the doors opened to the same code,” he recalls. “I opened this one door and it was almost like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There were these rows of long, low freezers. They all had a little light on them that’s blinking, and a temperature readout, and a piece of tape with the astronaut’s name. I’m like, Shit, they stored the astronauts in there! and I quickly got the people out. I found out later that was where they stored the astronaut feces and urine.” Harvey can’t recall the room number. “You have to stumble onto it, that’s the only way you can find it. It’s like Narnia.”                 •       •       •See the review at the New York Times: Astral Bodies (August 6, 2010).

141,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Packing for Mars is like Bonk, Stiff and Spook (her three previous books) but in space. Awesome! Everything is better in space. And hilariously entertaining.I have a huge author crush on Mary Roach. She isn't embarrassed by any subject. (I know this for a fact, I got to ask her at her book reading.) She won't pass up a Howdy Doody joke when discussing the difficulties in pooing in zero-G. She also scammed a free copy of zero-G porn movie series and watching it to 'research' zero-G sex. She asks all the probing, detail oriented questions that 99% of us would never even think of. And yet, once we know the questions, we are fascinated by the answers. She uncovers the slightly embarrassing marginalia of the space race.Mary Roach does it so we don't have to!Now for just a few interesting and funny bits I learned while reading Packing for Mars.I had no clue that defecating in zero-G presents with a whole host of complications, many of which only become apparent while in space. NASA and other space agencies have spent a lot of time and money researching ways to not just make a space toilet comfortable and private, but just to merely work.
""A successful zero-gravity toilet is a subtle finessing of engineering, materials science, physiology, psychology, and etiquette. ...If just one element is missing, things don't come out right.""
If I ever hear about the cost of developing a space toilet, I will not flinch an inch. This is important work.Here's another fun random space-based factoid for you: ""The contract for the Apollo lunar landing suits went to International Latex, which later became Playtex."" As in bras. Roach mentions earlier that when NASA needed to develop a space suit, they had no experience in rubberized materials, so they went to a huge bra & underwear manufacturer who sold through the Sears catalogue.This fact is a little more serious (by that I mean less squicky) than the poo/bra stuff above. Did you know that moon dust is incredibly abrasive? Since there's no wind, there's no erosion smoothing the rough corners. Moon dust quickly scratches lenses and helmet visors. To make matters worse, the dust is bombarded with cosmic particles which being impart a charge to the dust. Not only is it sharp, it also sticks to absolutely everything. Get this: there are companies that exist just to produce faux moon dust for NASA.Finally, one last poo joke, because I can't resist. Did you know the opposite of ingest is egest? As in: to reduce the amount of egesta, you must ingest low-residue foods. Here's Roach's goofy footnote to this: 
""Egesta is my new favorite euphemism for 'feces,' and an even better toilet brand name than Ejecto. Certainly better than Toto. Who names a toilet after a lapdog? Unless it's Shit-Tzu. I'd buy a Shit-Tsu toilet.""
 Me too, Mary. Perhaps a footnote generated after sharing too much vodka with the cosmonauts?This book is extremely amusing and wicked entertaining. And I love Mary Roach. I hope she keeps digging up the marginalia of the world.____________PS: Make sure you watch the book trailer - I think it's linked at right on this page. Normally I hate those things, but this one is genuinely funny.PPS: Mary signed my book ""Spacily yours, Mary Roach"" *swoon*"

Mary Roach takes an irreverent look at space travel, and answers all your questions about sex and pooping in space. Actually, she only speculates about the sex -- NASA and the astronauts remain mum on the subject. But while Roach has an informal, sometimes juvenile style (this book is meant to be entertaining, and isn't exactly science journalism), she does research a lot of subjects in exhaustive detail that you've probably always wondered about but didn't think it was appropriate to ask. Problems like elimination in space and hygiene and what to do when you're space-sick may seem funny here on Earth, but they're dead serious concerns that NASA has spent millions of dollars researching (in sometimes bizarre ways). Packing for Mars is full of a million interesting, bizarre, and sometimes disgusting factoids about life in a space capsule. It may make you yearn for a manned Mars mission, but it won't make you envy the astronauts who actually fly it."

This book was published ten years ago and it has aged a bit due to the advancements in space exploration. I have read newer books about space travel that I felt were more interesting with more in-depth information on the space training process. This was more was more anecdoctal than informative with sections on sex, pooping and animal astraunauts. Yet, this was still an enjoyable book to read, especially for someone like myself that doesn’t read a lot of non fiction.

Should be five stars but I rarely give 5 stars so it is kind of 4.48 stars.Mary kept us well-engaged in this space travel journey and while she may not packed us suitably for Mars, she did an excellent job to stimulate our interests further into everything related to Space Travel, whether the basic things that we take for granted (the way we eat, the things we eat, the logistics of walking, dressing, showering, peeing, or from all things, defecating!) or the more challenging parts of it, psychically, socially and, of course, psychologically (think of being alone somewhere in the moon, some 400,000 km away from earth looking at it with a bulky spacesuit and wondering whether you will return back home to have the much-awaited dinner (fish & chips?) with family and kids). Well done, Mary. I mean, seriously, even my 7-year kid liked the incidents that happened and written about in the book. Well, how about sleeping in space? In what activities time is spent for astronauts? Are they just sitting idle in their spacecraft (just sleeping & eating, like we do over the skies in a plane), awaiting to reach their destination? How about women? Are they better fit for the role? Why were they not considered in the earlier space journeys? Patriarchism the culpable as usual?Let's not forget the animals (monkeys and dogs) who ventured into the space and making some history in their way.Wait. How does it smell inside a space capsule? Must be nice I guess or at least something decent to let you endure all the time outside the world. But, wait. It seems it doesn't. Oh no. Please no."

Space travel has always been a fantasy of mine even though I knew it’s not something I’d ever do even when I was a kid. When I picked up this book, I expected to learn about space travel and some of the expectations, plans, and problems with a potential future mission to Mars. What I got was so much more. Mary Roach had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Her book not only covers the history of space travel and the logistics, but all the hilarious things that is rarely talked about, like pooping at zero gravity.I learned so much from Roach. Everything from space flight testing to zero gravity training is there, but also the psychological worries, experiments, taboos, and the testing that goes on in and out of space. There’s so much history here that was never even hinted at when the first Moon landing was covered in high school history.This book is a treasure. It’s honestly one of the most fascinating books that I’ve ever read. There are seemingly obvious topics thoroughly covered, like the difficultly behind showering at zero gravity and how something as simple as a fuse doesn’t work the same in space thanks to, you guessed it: gravity. Mary also has a wonderful writing style and I like her personality. She took what could’ve been some very dry topics and made them interesting to read about. I highly recommend this book and I’ll be checking out her other works."
148,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"In Mary Roach’s usual style, she takes a humourous look at NASA and space travel in this one, looking at some of the things that most of us just don’t think about when it comes to travelling in zero-gravity. She looks at using the “toilet”, eating, sex, throwing up, hygiene, and more. This did, of course, include some history of space travel, as well. I hadn’t even realized when I started reading it a few days ago that the 50th anniversary of the walk on the moon was yesterday, while I was in the middle reading this – good timing for me! In the first chapter, it was interesting to read about how they made the flag “fly” (with no gravity!) on the moon, and also how to even pack it to bring with them, with the limited space available. There was one real transcript of three astronauts having a discussion when one of them noticed a “turd” flying in the air – omg, I couldn’t stop laughing and crying reading that transcript! Kept me from continuing to read for at least 5 minutes, if not more!! This, and “Stiff” are my favourites of the ones I’ve read by her so far."

If she had:1) there would have been a lot more careful reading of the science textbooks in my class, and most others2) there would have been a lot more juvenile humor3) most people would have learned a lot more science, and4) the textbooks would no doubt have been banned within a yearSo, unfortunately, we do not have science textbooks written by Mary Roach, for junior high or any other grade. However, we do have books written by Mary Roach, and maybe I should say this one is more about the technology and history of space travel than really the science, but in any case it is awesome. Oddly, both my wife and I liked it, and we don't share a lot in common in our bookish tastes. I think she may be more partial to scatological content than I am. If you're into scatological content, by the way, this is your book (unless, you know, you want _that_ kind of scatological content, in which case no, this is mostly about space travel).We have been sending people into space for over half a century now, and perhaps more importantly for this book, thinking about and preparing to send people into space. It turns out, this is a big deal, and not just the part about making rockets.It turns out, for example, that gravity is extraordinarily useful. Without it, stuff gets lost a lot, and when it does, you have no idea where to look, because it could be anywhere. Crunchy food is unacceptable, because crumbs don't fall, so they get everywhere. Taking a shower is difficult, because water droplets don't fall. Also, a lot of things about how the body eliminates waste, depend upon gravity to work properly.In fact, a recurring theme of this book, is that space travel is really a lot less exciting and a lot more gross than either Russia or the U.S. wants to talk about very much. Roach goes to Russia to speak with a number of cosmonauts about bathrooms, bickering, alcohol, sex, and all the other things that NASA had to think about, in order to see what is inevitable and what could be dealt with differently depending on the culture. It turns out that being a cosmonaut, astronaut, or any other kind of space traveler is in large part about discovering that a lot of simple matters on earth become complicated. It is no exaggeration to say that bathroom design was as much of an obstacle to women in space in the early days, as sexism (although both certainly played a part). It is also no exaggeration to say that bathroom design for the men was way more complex than on earth.I read this book a chapter or two at a time, in the morning at the coffeeshop. My daughter would hear me laughing, and look over at me expectantly. 2 times out of 3, it would be something I couldn't tell her about, because she was eating.But, it's not all scatological. There's also sex, and the closely related topic of arguments. People in very enclosed spaces, for long periods of time, interact in a lot of ways. It's not necessarily always discussed with the general public.Or with NASA (or the Russian equivalent). A repeating theme throughout the book is that, whether it's depression or space sickness (equivalent of seasickness, but from zero gravity) or arguments or anything else that makes you less than perfect, the people who go up into space were normally unwilling to admit to any of it to their bosses down on Earth, for fear that it would prevent them from being picked for the next mission. It was part of Mary Roach's job, helped no doubt by the passage of time, to get people to discuss more openly a lot of what did NOT get discussed previously.And, also, a lot of gross stuff. Seriously, there is a lot of discussion of vomit. But, it is Mary Roach's rare talent to be able to write about topics which we would normally (most of us, anyway) shy away from, and make it funny and informative at the same time. This book is no exception."
150,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"When you think about space travel and exploration, nobody ever thinks about the poop bags. This book was interesting and eye-opening about a lot of the mundane minutiae of going into space, made (slightly) less mundane by Mary Roach's writing about it, but what really interested me was all of the ways that gravity allows us to live - and what happens to us when gravity is taken out of the equation. This book covers pretty much everything from physiological results of high G pressures and impacts, to floating poops to bone density changes. I'm sure she would have included a kitchen sink... except that in space, the water would just coalesce into a bubble and mess up the equipment. I didn't find this book quite as funny as I've found Roach in the past, but could just be personal preference. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for space farts. I'll show myself out."
151,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I have an awkward relationship with Mary Roach. I find her humor forced, blatant, and poorly timed and so it always falls flat to me. I realize that a lot of people really appreciate her humor, but it just doesn’t click for me. Actually, I bet I think she was really funny if I heard her talk, because potty humor IS my type of humor, but it just doesn’t seem to translate for me in her books.That said, she researches these absolutely fascinating topics from angles that no one else would, and I totally appreciate that. I mean, really, she is willing to throw her energy and time into researching the history of pooping in space. INQUIRING MINDS REALLY DO WANT TO KNOW. If I had to tell anyone to listen to one chapter from this book it would totally be Chapter 14- the poop chapter. It is hilarious in its own right, poop literally floating around during Apollo missions, and she shies away from nothing. How could you not want to know?If there is anything I learned in this book (and actually I learned A LOT so props to the author) its that astronauts have spent a lot of time living like filthy animals for science, and we are ALL better for it.If you are looking for something a little strange, informative, and easily translatable to fodder for all sorts of awkward holiday-party small-talk then I really suggest this book."
152,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,4,"This was my first time (finally) reading Mary Roach, and gosh but this was a great place to start, with a topic right up my alley. I love the everyday details and considerations of space travel and the unique weirdnesses of zero-gravity life!!! In that way, Packing for Mars pairs really well with Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. This reading was also well-timed: I visited Houston's NASA Space Center while reading it, and some of the videos on-display there exhibit the sheer giddy silly joy of astronauts hopping around on the moon -- not exactly the dignified, no-nonsense image that we tend to have of astronauts and which tends to go out in the PR materials.Similarly, Roach is a PR department's nightmare as she doggedly delves into the day-to-day considerations of space, no matter how unsavoury or inglorious: food and defecation and loss of bone density, the effects of extended solitude, the bizarre scientific experiments done in an attempt to prepare for the almost-inconceivable. It's occasionally laugh-out-loud funny; nonfiction written in a really light, engaging, accessible tone that I don't think sacrifices its scientific merit at all.It also manages to capture how touching and strange and awe-inspiring it all is, the lengths and sacrifices that we've made to go to space, the thrill and the importance of mankind's curiosity and problem-solving. Really looking forward to reading more from her.To the rocket scientist, you are a problem. You are the most irritating piece of machinery he or she will ever have to deal with. You and your fluctuating metabolism, your puny memory, your frame that comes in a million different configurations. You are unpredictable. You're inconstant. You take weeks to fix. The engineer must worry about the water and oxygen and food you'll need in space, about how much extra fuel it will take to launch your shrimp cocktail and irradiated beef tacos. A solar cell or a thruster nozzle is stable and undemanding. It does not excrete or panic or fall in love with the mission commander. It has no ego. Its structural elements don't start to break down without gravity, and it works just fine without sleep.To me, you are the best thing to happen to rocket science. The human being is the machine that makes the whole endeavor so endlessly intriguing."
153,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46311769-katie-long,5,"Roach brings her inimitable informative irreverence into outer space this time. More specifically to the details, and often indignities, of humans in space. Ever wondered if astronauts get motion sick, have sex in space, or are ever jealous of monkeys? Mary Roach did, and found some very serious people to answer her questions. Her questions are often hilarious, but they are never irrelevant."
154,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Wow! An excellent piece of very readable research of our journey into space & all the considerations for a trip to Mars in, hopefully, 2030. As usual, Roach captured the human side & presented it with plenty of humor.The research had to be difficult for her in many cases. NASA needs publicity to stay funded, but any negative publicity can hurt them immensely, especially since Congress & the VP oversee them. (LBJ basically squashed any females in space for years with a pen stroke.) Considering how divisive our attitudes are on so many subjects, especially taboo ones, it's no wonder that NASA regulates what information goes out with an iron hand. For instance, they once spent a lot of time & money in an effort to give the astronauts a night cap - just a bit of sherry to finish off the day. It all went to waste because news leaked out & a letter writing campaign by a bunch of teetotalers caused too much negative publicity. There are many taboo subjects that come up in relation to space flight & living in zero gee. Two biggies are sex & elimination. As Roach showed so well in her previous book, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, amazingly little is known about sex. NASA, the organization that can write entire books about the seemingly simplest things, ignores the subject. Unfortunately, it's a negative sum game for them. Any research they do into it will cause waves they can't afford. Still, she managed to pry a bit of info out of some, but not much.Elimination took up several chapters & it's not because she's hung up on it, but because it is such a necessary, time consuming & messy business. It's also tied closely to what is eaten & what can be eaten on a long trip when every ounce has to be closely watched & personal odors have a huge impact on morale. It's an amazingly complex feat to deal with a simple stool. At one time, they actually used cameras to record the process & then destroyed the films to avoid bad publicity. Now researchers could really use that data again.How strange & complex the simplest thing becomes when under intense public scrutiny & done without gravity! A lot of what we think we know turns out to be wrong. Even the urge to pee isn't present in zero gee until the bursting point - literally a point at which the urethra could be constricted by the bladder, so urination has to be scheduled to avoid problems.There are more exhaustive books on the subject & many of them are in her bibliography, but I doubt there is a more readable introduction to the complexity of what faces NASA as they prepare for the Mars mission, a culmination of every space effort to date. She did a great job & I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. "
155,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"Mary Roach has made quite a career writing quirky, irreverent books on some of the weirder corners of science. She's covered corpses, the afterlife, sex, and now space. So all the cool subjects. As it turns out, space exploration is a rich and varied subject. Every aspect of life in space has to be carefully, exhaustively researched beforehand, after all. Right down to, ahem, elimination procedures. In the hands of another writer, all of this detail might become overwhelming, or boring, maybe kind of gross, depending on the chapter. But as with her other books, Roach writes with such an infectious delight at what she's learned that I was completely riveted. Sure, I have more than a passing interest in the space program, and that probably helped. One of my friends is even more interested than I am, and this just might end up under her Christmas tree this year."
156,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"Very interesting book about space. Going to the bathroom in space, eating in space, bone deteriorating in space. As always, Roach is funny and informative."
157,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"This book is funny, gross, and fascinating, and I am SO not suited to be an astronaut! If YOU want to be an astronaut, you’d better have a strong stomach and a big tolerance for grossness in general. I had NO IDEA a book about travel in space would read like a scene from a Judd Apatow movie, but it turns out human waste of many varieties is a big issue for NASA. Mary Roach tells us about how space agencies try to prepare astronauts for space travel, and study how the trainees react, and she goes into the details of the history of space travel so far, in the detail that rarely gets reported in regular history books. And she wangles her way onto the Vomit Comet, for research purposes, of course!What I learned is that space travel is tricky for living organisms, like people. We’re adapted for conditions on a planet, where there’s gravity, and opportunities to eat delicious, crumby meals, bathe regularly and take care of elimination in privacy and comfort. Here’s a couple of quotes that illustrate the issue:Gravity facilitates what is known in aerospace waste collection circles as “separation.” Fecal popcorning is the reason Space Shuttle toilets are equipped with rearview mirrors.Women would be more efficient astronauts, but they weren’t included in the early programs because NASA didn’t want to figure out the logistics of female urination. In space. I’m not kidding! Humans take a LOT of maintenance. We’re constantly sweating, shedding hair and skin, sneezing, and doing that whole processing food thing. Our bones need gravity to know to stay strong. Doing all that up in space is much, much trickier, and messier than on Earth. Also, people can get weird in the close confines of a noisy, hot little metal container floating in space. We can get surly and difficult, or some of us may experience the rapture of space and want to float off into the cosmos, or something. Maybe. Maybe it’s just the oxygen mix in those suits.Mary Roach also researches the careers of animals in space (I’ll never forgive Russia for what they did to Laika. Never.), crash impacts on bodies (which reminded me of her first book, Stiff), and sex in space, which isn’t as sexy as it sounds. The focus has been on the impact of no gravity on reproduction, not on, um, logistics. And according to NASA, no one has yet to join the Zero-G club. Not officially, anyways. Well, okay, there were some rats, but that was an experiment. Recommended to everyone who wants to know what the “right stuff” really is. "
158,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"India’s first Mars mission, scheduled for Nov 2014 will cost LESS than the budget of the space film Gravity.After having finished this book I had to read that above statement a few times for it to really sink in. Either space travel has gotten vastly cheaper or Hollywood has finally gone nuts.This book covers everything a layperson would ever want to know about space travel and a host of things you would have preferred not to know. No longer does bravery and a guts n glory attitude maketh an astronaut. Now the ability to follow orders, emotional neutrality and a range of other (very boring) personality traits now make for excellent astronauts.The first part of the book focused on how candidates get tested and selected based on their psychological and physiological responses to a wide range of very absurd tests. If any child with the dream of becoming an astronaut read this book we will have a complete shortage of willing candidates very soon.From the impact of gravity on our internal organs, motion sickness, technical malfunctions, early animal experiments and even the impact of space travel on bone density, all showed just how fragile us humans really are.I have always loved this author’s books as she mixes humor and facts in such a way that entertain and informs the reader at the same time. However in this book it sometimes felt that she was trying a tad too hard with the funny quips (that quickly became not so funny). My solution was to read this over an extended period of time and not all in one go and this worked well to lessen my irritation with the feeling of forced humor.Like her other books the overly ""sciency"" stuff becomes understandable and is absolutely crammed with facts that you would not necessarily find in official NASA reports. Things like the development of self-cleaning underwear to negate needing a bath in space, how space food and space toilets evolved (not nearly enough is the answer).This book was not in the same league as my beloved Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers however it did satisfy my almost insatiable need for trivia facts.Mary Roach is basically the female equivalent of A J Jacobs and if you enjoy his books you will surely love hers."

It's just a matter of adapting to a space suit and a weightless environment. While we have people like Elon Musk enthusiastic about space travel, my biggest personal antagonism about the idea has always related to elimination during space travel, and the fact that any vehicle must end up smelling like a sewer.Gotta be very careful about disposing of human waste in space - Newton's third law applies...This is where Star Trek's transporter technology could be quite useful. A mini-transporter in the groin area of the suit would do the job painlessly and efficiently."

I didn't like some of the comments it suppose to be funny but somehow I found it more of heavy. (it can be audio book's narration style)and another thing is that she is going out of topic some times, and some parts were really boring to me.O right it is a bit old as well, I read it part of a book club."
161,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904933-chris,2,"A decent book with interesting details about space sciences and the biology of human spaceflight. However, the author felt compelled to display her snarky, adolescent humor and go off on tangents on subjects that she must have felt were funny, but which is merely unnecessary gossip and/or gross little anecdotes. It seemed obvious that she was probably jealous of the scientists and astronauts whom she interviewed, failed to understand the pragmatic and hard-headed approach that engineers and scientists must take to accomplish goals, and had to include embarrassing little tidbits about the space sciences and the people who work in that industry. A bit pathetic, and the end of the book did not close the gap between the sour effect of the first 95% of the book, and the barely aspirational closer. Unsure who the intended reader of this book is, besides sniggering adolescents."
162,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter,4,"I generally quite enjoy Mary Roach's books, even though sometimes they are too much information to be read while eating. (Stiff) So when I saw this one, about one of my favourite things in the world, space travel, I was excited. Even more so since I'm running a roleplaying game set on Mars right now, although much further along than the first tentative preparations Roach is talking about here.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

163,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5583595-anna-bananas,3,"Sooo, it only took me a few years to finish this. I tend to stall out on her books and then get back to them. A book about space and everything associated with it was a fascinating idea and for the most part she does a good job of opening up that world for you. Her humor, which I enjoyed very much in Stiff, is sometimes a bit much now. There are a lot of asides and footnotes that don’t necessarily add to the story and just show that she had fun doing the research. I find it more distracting than amusing at this point, after reading four of her books. And yet, I will read more. I love how thoroughly she tackles her topics, exploring all the aspects and angles. I learned about parabolic flight and its uses, how we’re preparing for possible manned Mars missions, the ingredients of space food, how we...poop in space, how our organs and bodies react to gravity - and to the lack of it, the psychology of living in space isolated with other humans, the history of space travel. There’s a lot here and most of it fascinating. My level of enthusiasm waxed and waned, hence the lower rating, but I would still recommend this. It’s an experience and I always value that.Pre-read ranting: My head is stuck in space right now, between reading Dark Space and watching Elysium today and then mulling over my favorite claustrophobic space movies - Event Horizon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien movies, Sunshine (my favorite). Can optimism and joy not survive the vacuum of space or something? They just disappear with the screams?Moving on, Mary Roach makes science both fascinating and hilarious. I'm so excited to read this! I don't know if anything can beat Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers but I'll keep an open mind. Theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7wtsJ...This reminds me of the astronaut story from The Illustrated Man and how the father of the family was more in love with space than with his family."
164,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael,4,"Science fiction movies and novels dealing with long exploration missions to deep space rarely deal with the complexities of our bodies surviving during the long journey through space.Or as the old question asks, ""Where does Captain Kirk go to the bathroom?""Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" not only looks at where Kirk would go, but how such a thing would be possible. It also looks at a lot of other questions that scientists and NASA have to and have addressed during humanity's quest to explore space. From the earliest days of space travel when we wondered if gravity would be required for our internal organs and systems to continue working properly to the affects of long-term weightlessness on our muscle systems, Roach delves into the question of just how will our bodies survive or work during a long voyage to Mars. (Roach even deals with the question of whether its possible or reasonable to have sex in zero g, even watching an adult film that was allegedly shot in zero g). All in all, the book is a fascinating one. Roach maintains a fine line between presenting the facts and having a sense of humor about things. She deals with a lot of bodily functions, but all of these are necessary to consider in whether or not its possible to send humans to Mars or on a long trip into outer space. While we've all thought about how humans would eat in space and use the bathroom, we've probably thought less about how hygiene can and would work in outer space. Will the space ships end up smelling like a locker room or worse? Also delved into are the on-going studies into motion sickness and the inherent dangers faced if you lose your cookies in a space suit. Roach's approach is a solid one with each aspect presented in an understandable, entertaining fashion. What could easily have been a dry subject is instead presented in a fascinating, readable way that will give you a new respect for the men and women who've gone into outer space in the past and those who will head out into the solar system and beyond in our future (hopefully). "
165,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869511-adam,2,"The title of this book is misleading. It doesn't really delve into the plans or obstacles for a manned mission to Mars, but is more of an overview of the history of the world's space programs (mostly U.S.) to date and some background on the human issues that don't readily come to mind when thinking of the challenges of space for humans(food, hygiene, waste management, psychology, physiological effects of zero gravity on humans, etc.)The book rambled a bit from topic to topic (a few pure tangents as well) without much cohesion tying them back to Mars. This is the first Mary Roach book I have read and while the subject matter of her other books seems interesting, I'm not sure I will read another. You know when someone tries to be funny and there's that awkward silence when they fail? Mary Roach writes that way. A lot. It seems like every paragraph there's at least two attempts at humor and I'd guestimate the overall success rate of eliciting a smile or chuckle at about 10% - it got to be too much for me by the halfway point of the book. The funniest moments are actually quotes by other people.Overall most of the topics covered in the book were interesting, the presentation just didn't do it for me."
166,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20773991-holly,4,"This was honestly really interesting, and probably as good (if not better) than Roach's other book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, which I read probably a year back.Roach combines factual information and fun story telling in a great way, that makes these books immensely readable and fun. I've avoided science non-fiction for a long time, mainly because I didn't think I was smart enough per say, but Mary Roach has really introduced me to the realms of popular science and the world of scientific non-fiction.I have Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War on my to read list, and I will undoubtedly read it at some point. But I'll definitely keep my eye out for more popular science books that pique my interest"
167,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,4,"This engagingly readable book tackles the subject of man's exploration of near-space--specifically, the difficult and sometimes messy task of protecting humans as they explore the void of space. At times a history text, at times cutting-edge, it covers a lot of topics in a fun and interesting way. Roach's voice is clear and witty, sometimes biting, other times self-mocking, but always kept my interest. Unfortunately, the book isn't so much about the title as it is about the subtitle, and I would have liked more about the current state of space exploration as it applies to Mars missions. (""Current"" being 2010, when the book was published; I don't ding it for not being written in 2017.) But I enjoyed it immensely, and appreciated the extensive end notes/bibliography, which gave me some ideas for further reading. I will definitely pick up more of Roach's work."

I was most interested to hear what Muslims do for prayer time when they are orbiting Earth. Figure the timing according to where you were last on Earth and follow that 5 times per day.

She uses a lot of websites for references, but many interviews and research of the scientific literature."

Mary Roach has a highly irreverent approach to science that I really enjoy. 
170,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Mary Roach now has a lock on a certain kind of book. Science is her beat, and her shtick is to make it funny — often hilariously funny. But be forewarned: her take on “funny” means she is going to violate any taboo that gets in the way of making you cringe and groan at the same time you laugh.In her first book, 
Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife
, she did the topic as funny-but-creepy, and hadn’t yet glommed on to her now-predictable gross-out brand of humor. That came in brilliantly with her second book, 
Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers
. Now you could get science done as hilarious and creepy and gross!She dropped the creepy and replaced it with mildly titillating in her third (and still my favorite), 
Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex
. But definitely still hilarious and gross.In 
Packing for Mars
, she’s tightened her focus. No more creepy, no more titillating, just funny in that juvenile way of hers. She asks the questions that any “mature” adults would never dare ask, and then begs for the juicy details. I’m sure many of the people she interviews are non-plussed at how to respond; those that don't know her previous work probably think she’s a kook. She appears to be okay with that.As usual, much of her funniest asides come in the form of footnotes. Here’s one, from the chapter on NASA’s research on how to best, er, replicate what toilets do in the absence of gravity. It turns out that NASA has saved the “output” of astronauts for years...Astronaut specimens from the Skylab and Apollo eras are still around, in freezers on the top floor of a windowless high-security building at Houston's Johnson Space Center—the one that houses NASA's collection of (non-biological) moon rocks. “I’m not sure what our inventory of excreta from Apollo is right now,” John Charles told me. “Forty years of freezing, with occasional thaws due to power outages during hurricanes, may have reduced them to mere vestiges of their former glory.” They were there as of 1996, because planetary biologist Ralph Harvey stumbled onto them when he got lost taking a group of VIPs on a tour. “Back then all the doors opened to the same code,” he recalls. “I opened this one door and it was almost like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There were these rows of long, low freezers. They all had a little light on them that’s blinking, and a temperature readout, and a piece of tape with the astronaut’s name. I’m like, Shit, they stored the astronauts in there! and I quickly got the people out. I found out later that was where they stored the astronaut feces and urine.” Harvey can’t recall the room number. “You have to stumble onto it, that’s the only way you can find it. It’s like Narnia.”                 •       •       •See the review at the New York Times: Astral Bodies (August 6, 2010).

171,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Packing for Mars is like Bonk, Stiff and Spook (her three previous books) but in space. Awesome! Everything is better in space. And hilariously entertaining.I have a huge author crush on Mary Roach. She isn't embarrassed by any subject. (I know this for a fact, I got to ask her at her book reading.) She won't pass up a Howdy Doody joke when discussing the difficulties in pooing in zero-G. She also scammed a free copy of zero-G porn movie series and watching it to 'research' zero-G sex. She asks all the probing, detail oriented questions that 99% of us would never even think of. And yet, once we know the questions, we are fascinated by the answers. She uncovers the slightly embarrassing marginalia of the space race.Mary Roach does it so we don't have to!Now for just a few interesting and funny bits I learned while reading Packing for Mars.I had no clue that defecating in zero-G presents with a whole host of complications, many of which only become apparent while in space. NASA and other space agencies have spent a lot of time and money researching ways to not just make a space toilet comfortable and private, but just to merely work.
""A successful zero-gravity toilet is a subtle finessing of engineering, materials science, physiology, psychology, and etiquette. ...If just one element is missing, things don't come out right.""
If I ever hear about the cost of developing a space toilet, I will not flinch an inch. This is important work.Here's another fun random space-based factoid for you: ""The contract for the Apollo lunar landing suits went to International Latex, which later became Playtex."" As in bras. Roach mentions earlier that when NASA needed to develop a space suit, they had no experience in rubberized materials, so they went to a huge bra & underwear manufacturer who sold through the Sears catalogue.This fact is a little more serious (by that I mean less squicky) than the poo/bra stuff above. Did you know that moon dust is incredibly abrasive? Since there's no wind, there's no erosion smoothing the rough corners. Moon dust quickly scratches lenses and helmet visors. To make matters worse, the dust is bombarded with cosmic particles which being impart a charge to the dust. Not only is it sharp, it also sticks to absolutely everything. Get this: there are companies that exist just to produce faux moon dust for NASA.Finally, one last poo joke, because I can't resist. Did you know the opposite of ingest is egest? As in: to reduce the amount of egesta, you must ingest low-residue foods. Here's Roach's goofy footnote to this: 
""Egesta is my new favorite euphemism for 'feces,' and an even better toilet brand name than Ejecto. Certainly better than Toto. Who names a toilet after a lapdog? Unless it's Shit-Tzu. I'd buy a Shit-Tsu toilet.""
 Me too, Mary. Perhaps a footnote generated after sharing too much vodka with the cosmonauts?This book is extremely amusing and wicked entertaining. And I love Mary Roach. I hope she keeps digging up the marginalia of the world.____________PS: Make sure you watch the book trailer - I think it's linked at right on this page. Normally I hate those things, but this one is genuinely funny.PPS: Mary signed my book ""Spacily yours, Mary Roach"" *swoon*"

Mary Roach takes an irreverent look at space travel, and answers all your questions about sex and pooping in space. Actually, she only speculates about the sex -- NASA and the astronauts remain mum on the subject. But while Roach has an informal, sometimes juvenile style (this book is meant to be entertaining, and isn't exactly science journalism), she does research a lot of subjects in exhaustive detail that you've probably always wondered about but didn't think it was appropriate to ask. Problems like elimination in space and hygiene and what to do when you're space-sick may seem funny here on Earth, but they're dead serious concerns that NASA has spent millions of dollars researching (in sometimes bizarre ways). Packing for Mars is full of a million interesting, bizarre, and sometimes disgusting factoids about life in a space capsule. It may make you yearn for a manned Mars mission, but it won't make you envy the astronauts who actually fly it."

This book was published ten years ago and it has aged a bit due to the advancements in space exploration. I have read newer books about space travel that I felt were more interesting with more in-depth information on the space training process. This was more was more anecdoctal than informative with sections on sex, pooping and animal astraunauts. Yet, this was still an enjoyable book to read, especially for someone like myself that doesn’t read a lot of non fiction. Roach has a wonderfully, humorous narrative style that makes the information very digestible to read."

Should be five stars but I rarely give 5 stars so it is kind of 4.48 stars.Mary kept us well-engaged in this space travel journey and while she may not packed us suitably for Mars, she did an excellent job to stimulate our interests further into everything related to Space Travel, whether the basic things that we take for granted (the way we eat, the things we eat, the logistics of walking, dressing, showering, peeing, or from all things, defecating!) or the more challenging parts of it, psychically, socially and, of course, psychologically (think of being alone somewhere in the moon, some 400,000 km away from earth looking at it with a bulky spacesuit and wondering whether you will return back home to have the much-awaited dinner (fish & chips?) with family and kids). Well done, Mary. I mean, seriously, even my 7-year kid liked the incidents that happened and written about in the book. Well, how about sleeping in space? In what activities time is spent for astronauts? Are they just sitting idle in their spacecraft (just sleeping & eating, like we do over the skies in a plane), awaiting to reach their destination? How about women? Are they better fit for the role? Why were they not considered in the earlier space journeys? Patriarchism the culpable as usual?Let's not forget the animals (monkeys and dogs) who ventured into the space and making some history in their way.Wait. How does it smell inside a space capsule? Must be nice I guess or at least something decent to let you endure all the time outside the world. But, wait. It seems it doesn't. Oh no. Please no."
177,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"I’ve been fascinated with space since I was a kid. Space travel has always been a fantasy of mine even though I knew it’s not something I’d ever do even when I was a kid. When I picked up this book, I expected to learn about space travel and some of the expectations, plans, and problems with a potential future mission to Mars. What I got was so much more. Mary Roach had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Her book not only covers the history of space travel and the logistics, but all the hilarious things that is rarely talked about, like pooping at zero gravity.I learned so much from Roach. Everything from space flight testing to zero gravity training is there, but also the psychological worries, experiments, taboos, and the testing that goes on in and out of space. There’s so much history here that was never even hinted at when the first Moon landing was covered in high school history.This book is a treasure. It’s honestly one of the most fascinating books that I’ve ever read. There are seemingly obvious topics thoroughly covered, like the difficultly behind showering at zero gravity and how something as simple as a fuse doesn’t work the same in space thanks to, you guessed it: gravity. Mary also has a wonderful writing style and I like her personality. She took what could’ve been some very dry topics and made them interesting to read about. I highly recommend this book and I’ll be checking out her other works."
178,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"In Mary Roach’s usual style, she takes a humourous look at NASA and space travel in this one, looking at some of the things that most of us just don’t think about when it comes to travelling in zero-gravity. She looks at using the “toilet”, eating, sex, throwing up, hygiene, and more. This did, of course, include some history of space travel, as well. I hadn’t even realized when I started reading it a few days ago that the 50th anniversary of the walk on the moon was yesterday, while I was in the middle reading this – good timing for me! In the first chapter, it was interesting to read about how they made the flag “fly” (with no gravity!) on the moon, and also how to even pack it to bring with them, with the limited space available. There was one real transcript of three astronauts having a discussion when one of them noticed a “turd” flying in the air – omg, I couldn’t stop laughing and crying reading that transcript! Kept me from continuing to read for at least 5 minutes, if not more!! This, and “Stiff” are my favourites of the ones I’ve read by her so far."
179,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Mary Roach is the sort of person who actually ought to be writing science textbooks for junior high. If she had:1) there would have been a lot more careful reading of the science textbooks in my class, and most others2) there would have been a lot more juvenile humor3) most people would have learned a lot more science, and4) the textbooks would no doubt have been banned within a yearSo, unfortunately, we do not have science textbooks written by Mary Roach, for junior high or any other grade. However, we do have books written by Mary Roach, and maybe I should say this one is more about the technology and history of space travel than really the science, but in any case it is awesome. Oddly, both my wife and I liked it, and we don't share a lot in common in our bookish tastes. I think she may be more partial to scatological content than I am. If you're into scatological content, by the way, this is your book (unless, you know, you want _that_ kind of scatological content, in which case no, this is mostly about space travel).We have been sending people into space for over half a century now, and perhaps more importantly for this book, thinking about and preparing to send people into space. It turns out, this is a big deal, and not just the part about making rockets.It turns out, for example, that gravity is extraordinarily useful. Without it, stuff gets lost a lot, and when it does, you have no idea where to look, because it could be anywhere. Crunchy food is unacceptable, because crumbs don't fall, so they get everywhere. Taking a shower is difficult, because water droplets don't fall. Also, a lot of things about how the body eliminates waste, depend upon gravity to work properly.In fact, a recurring theme of this book, is that space travel is really a lot less exciting and a lot more gross than either Russia or the U.S. wants to talk about very much. Roach goes to Russia to speak with a number of cosmonauts about bathrooms, bickering, alcohol, sex, and all the other things that NASA had to think about, in order to see what is inevitable and what could be dealt with differently depending on the culture. It turns out that being a cosmonaut, astronaut, or any other kind of space traveler is in large part about discovering that a lot of simple matters on earth become complicated. It is no exaggeration to say that bathroom design was as much of an obstacle to women in space in the early days, as sexism (although both certainly played a part). It is also no exaggeration to say that bathroom design for the men was way more complex than on earth.I read this book a chapter or two at a time, in the morning at the coffeeshop. My daughter would hear me laughing, and look over at me expectantly. 2 times out of 3, it would be something I couldn't tell her about, because she was eating.But, it's not all scatological. There's also sex, and the closely related topic of arguments. People in very enclosed spaces, for long periods of time, interact in a lot of ways. It's not necessarily always discussed with the general public.Or with NASA (or the Russian equivalent). A repeating theme throughout the book is that, whether it's depression or space sickness (equivalent of seasickness, but from zero gravity) or arguments or anything else that makes you less than perfect, the people who go up into space were normally unwilling to admit to any of it to their bosses down on Earth, for fear that it would prevent them from being picked for the next mission. It was part of Mary Roach's job, helped no doubt by the passage of time, to get people to discuss more openly a lot of what did NOT get discussed previously.And, also, a lot of gross stuff. Seriously, there is a lot of discussion of vomit. But, it is Mary Roach's rare talent to be able to write about topics which we would normally (most of us, anyway) shy away from, and make it funny and informative at the same time. This book is no exception."
180,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"When you think about space travel and exploration, nobody ever thinks about the poop bags. This book was interesting and eye-opening about a lot of the mundane minutiae of going into space, made (slightly) less mundane by Mary Roach's writing about it, but what really interested me was all of the ways that gravity allows us to live - and what happens to us when gravity is taken out of the equation. This book covers pretty much everything from physiological results of high G pressures and impacts, to floating poops to bone density changes. I'm sure she would have included a kitchen sink... except that in space, the water would just coalesce into a bubble and mess up the equipment. I didn't find this book quite as funny as I've found Roach in the past, but could just be personal preference. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for space farts. I'll show myself out."
181,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I have an awkward relationship with Mary Roach. I find her humor forced, blatant, and poorly timed and so it always falls flat to me. I realize that a lot of people really appreciate her humor, but it just doesn’t click for me. Actually, I bet I think she was really funny if I heard her talk, because potty humor IS my type of humor, but it just doesn’t seem to translate for me in her books.That said, she researches these absolutely fascinating topics from angles that no one else would, and I totally appreciate that. I mean, really, she is willing to throw her energy and time into researching the history of pooping in space. INQUIRING MINDS REALLY DO WANT TO KNOW. If I had to tell anyone to listen to one chapter from this book it would totally be Chapter 14- the poop chapter. It is hilarious in its own right, poop literally floating around during Apollo missions, and she shies away from nothing. How could you not want to know?If there is anything I learned in this book (and actually I learned A LOT so props to the author) its that astronauts have spent a lot of time living like filthy animals for science, and we are ALL better for it.If you are looking for something a little strange, informative, and easily translatable to fodder for all sorts of awkward holiday-party small-talk then I really suggest this book."
182,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,4,"This was my first time (finally) reading Mary Roach, and gosh but this was a great place to start, with a topic right up my alley. I love the everyday details and considerations of space travel and the unique weirdnesses of zero-gravity life!!! In that way, Packing for Mars pairs really well with Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. This reading was also well-timed: I visited Houston's NASA Space Center while reading it, and some of the videos on-display there exhibit the sheer giddy silly joy of astronauts hopping around on the moon -- not exactly the dignified, no-nonsense image that we tend to have of astronauts and which tends to go out in the PR materials.Similarly, Roach is a PR department's nightmare as she doggedly delves into the day-to-day considerations of space, no matter how unsavoury or inglorious: food and defecation and loss of bone density, the effects of extended solitude, the bizarre scientific experiments done in an attempt to prepare for the almost-inconceivable. It's occasionally laugh-out-loud funny; nonfiction written in a really light, engaging, accessible tone that I don't think sacrifices its scientific merit at all.It also manages to capture how touching and strange and awe-inspiring it all is, the lengths and sacrifices that we've made to go to space, the thrill and the importance of mankind's curiosity and problem-solving. Really looking forward to reading more from her.To the rocket scientist, you are a problem. You are the most irritating piece of machinery he or she will ever have to deal with. You and your fluctuating metabolism, your puny memory, your frame that comes in a million different configurations. You are unpredictable. You're inconstant. You take weeks to fix. The engineer must worry about the water and oxygen and food you'll need in space, about how much extra fuel it will take to launch your shrimp cocktail and irradiated beef tacos. A solar cell or a thruster nozzle is stable and undemanding. It does not excrete or panic or fall in love with the mission commander. It has no ego. Its structural elements don't start to break down without gravity, and it works just fine without sleep.To me, you are the best thing to happen to rocket science. The human being is the machine that makes the whole endeavor so endlessly intriguing."
183,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46311769-katie-long,5,"Roach brings her inimitable informative irreverence into outer space this time. More specifically to the details, and often indignities, of humans in space. Ever wondered if astronauts get motion sick, have sex in space, or are ever jealous of monkeys? Mary Roach did, and found some very serious people to answer her questions. Her questions are often hilarious, but they are never irrelevant."
184,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Wow! An excellent piece of very readable research of our journey into space & all the considerations for a trip to Mars in, hopefully, 2030. As usual, Roach captured the human side & presented it with plenty of humor.The research had to be difficult for her in many cases. NASA needs publicity to stay funded, but any negative publicity can hurt them immensely, especially since Congress & the VP oversee them. (LBJ basically squashed any females in space for years with a pen stroke.) Considering how divisive our attitudes are on so many subjects, especially taboo ones, it's no wonder that NASA regulates what information goes out with an iron hand. For instance, they once spent a lot of time & money in an effort to give the astronauts a night cap - just a bit of sherry to finish off the day. It all went to waste because news leaked out & a letter writing campaign by a bunch of teetotalers caused too much negative publicity. There are many taboo subjects that come up in relation to space flight & living in zero gee. Two biggies are sex & elimination. As Roach showed so well in her previous book, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, amazingly little is known about sex. NASA, the organization that can write entire books about the seemingly simplest things, ignores the subject. Unfortunately, it's a negative sum game for them. Any research they do into it will cause waves they can't afford. Still, she managed to pry a bit of info out of some, but not much.Elimination took up several chapters & it's not because she's hung up on it, but because it is such a necessary, time consuming & messy business. It's also tied closely to what is eaten & what can be eaten on a long trip when every ounce has to be closely watched & personal odors have a huge impact on morale. It's an amazingly complex feat to deal with a simple stool. At one time, they actually used cameras to record the process & then destroyed the films to avoid bad publicity. Now researchers could really use that data again.How strange & complex the simplest thing becomes when under intense public scrutiny & done without gravity! A lot of what we think we know turns out to be wrong. Even the urge to pee isn't present in zero gee until the bursting point - literally a point at which the urethra could be constricted by the bladder, so urination has to be scheduled to avoid problems.There are more exhaustive books on the subject & many of them are in her bibliography, but I doubt there is a more readable introduction to the complexity of what faces NASA as they prepare for the Mars mission, a culmination of every space effort to date. She did a great job & I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. "
185,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"Mary Roach has made quite a career writing quirky, irreverent books on some of the weirder corners of science. She's covered corpses, the afterlife, sex, and now space. So all the cool subjects. As it turns out, space exploration is a rich and varied subject. Every aspect of life in space has to be carefully, exhaustively researched beforehand, after all. Right down to, ahem, elimination procedures. In the hands of another writer, all of this detail might become overwhelming, or boring, maybe kind of gross, depending on the chapter. But as with her other books, Roach writes with such an infectious delight at what she's learned that I was completely riveted. Sure, I have more than a passing interest in the space program, and that probably helped. One of my friends is even more interested than I am, and this just might end up under her Christmas tree this year."

187,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"This book is funny, gross, and fascinating, and I am SO not suited to be an astronaut! If YOU want to be an astronaut, you’d better have a strong stomach and a big tolerance for grossness in general. I had NO IDEA a book about travel in space would read like a scene from a Judd Apatow movie, but it turns out human waste of many varieties is a big issue for NASA. Mary Roach tells us about how space agencies try to prepare astronauts for space travel, and study how the trainees react, and she goes into the details of the history of space travel so far, in the detail that rarely gets reported in regular history books. And she wangles her way onto the Vomit Comet, for research purposes, of course!What I learned is that space travel is tricky for living organisms, like people. We’re adapted for conditions on a planet, where there’s gravity, and opportunities to eat delicious, crumby meals, bathe regularly and take care of elimination in privacy and comfort. Here’s a couple of quotes that illustrate the issue:Gravity facilitates what is known in aerospace waste collection circles as “separation.” Fecal popcorning is the reason Space Shuttle toilets are equipped with rearview mirrors.Women would be more efficient astronauts, but they weren’t included in the early programs because NASA didn’t want to figure out the logistics of female urination. In space. I’m not kidding! Humans take a LOT of maintenance. We’re constantly sweating, shedding hair and skin, sneezing, and doing that whole processing food thing. Our bones need gravity to know to stay strong. Doing all that up in space is much, much trickier, and messier than on Earth. Also, people can get weird in the close confines of a noisy, hot little metal container floating in space. We can get surly and difficult, or some of us may experience the rapture of space and want to float off into the cosmos, or something. Maybe. Maybe it’s just the oxygen mix in those suits.Mary Roach also researches the careers of animals in space (I’ll never forgive Russia for what they did to Laika. Never.), crash impacts on bodies (which reminded me of her first book, Stiff), and sex in space, which isn’t as sexy as it sounds. The focus has been on the impact of no gravity on reproduction, not on, um, logistics. And according to NASA, no one has yet to join the Zero-G club. Not officially, anyways. Well, okay, there were some rats, but that was an experiment. Recommended to everyone who wants to know what the “right stuff” really is. "

Either space travel has gotten vastly cheaper or Hollywood has finally gone nuts.This book covers everything a layperson would ever want to know about space travel and a host of things you would have preferred not to know. No longer does bravery and a guts n glory attitude maketh an astronaut. Now the ability to follow orders, emotional neutrality and a range of other (very boring) personality traits now make for excellent astronauts.The first part of the book focused on how candidates get tested and selected based on their psychological and physiological responses to a wide range of very absurd tests. If any child with the dream of becoming an astronaut read this book we will have a complete shortage of willing candidates very soon.From the impact of gravity on our internal organs, motion sickness, technical malfunctions, early animal experiments and even the impact of space travel on bone density, all showed just how fragile us humans really are.I have always loved this author’s books as she mixes humor and facts in such a way that entertain and informs the reader at the same time. However in this book it sometimes felt that she was trying a tad too hard with the funny quips (that quickly became not so funny). My solution was to read this over an extended period of time and not all in one go and this worked well to lessen my irritation with the feeling of forced humor.Like her other books the overly ""sciency"" stuff becomes understandable and is absolutely crammed with facts that you would not necessarily find in official NASA reports. Things like the development of self-cleaning underwear to negate needing a bath in space, how space food and space toilets evolved (not nearly enough is the answer).This book was not in the same league as my beloved Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers however it did satisfy my almost insatiable need for trivia facts.Mary Roach is basically the female equivalent of A J Jacobs and if you enjoy his books you will surely love hers."

It's just a matter of adapting to a space suit and a weightless environment. While we have people like Elon Musk enthusiastic about space travel, my biggest personal antagonism about the idea has always related to elimination during space travel, and the fact that any vehicle must end up smelling like a sewer.Gotta be very careful about disposing of human waste in space - Newton's third law applies...This is where Star Trek's transporter technology could be quite useful. A mini-transporter in the groin area of the suit would do the job painlessly and efficiently."

I didn't like some of the comments it suppose to be funny but somehow I found it more of heavy.

191,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904933-chris,2,"A decent book with interesting details about space sciences and the biology of human spaceflight. However, the author felt compelled to display her snarky, adolescent humor and go off on tangents on subjects that she must have felt were funny, but which is merely unnecessary gossip and/or gross little anecdotes. It seemed obvious that she was probably jealous of the scientists and astronauts whom she interviewed, failed to understand the pragmatic and hard-headed approach that engineers and scientists must take to accomplish goals, and had to include embarrassing little tidbits about the space sciences and the people who work in that industry. A bit pathetic, and the end of the book did not close the gap between the sour effect of the first 95% of the book, and the barely aspirational closer. Unsure who the intended reader of this book is, besides sniggering adolescents."

Even more so since I'm running a roleplaying game set on Mars right now, although much further along than the first tentative preparations Roach is talking about here.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

A book about space and everything associated with it was a fascinating idea and for the most part she does a good job of opening up that world for you. Her humor, which I enjoyed very much in Stiff, is sometimes a bit much now. There are a lot of asides and footnotes that don’t necessarily add to the story and just show that she had fun doing the research. I find it more distracting than amusing at this point, after reading four of her books. And yet, I will read more. I love how thoroughly she tackles her topics, exploring all the aspects and angles. I learned about parabolic flight and its uses, how we’re preparing for possible manned Mars missions, the ingredients of space food, how we...poop in space, how our organs and bodies react to gravity - and to the lack of it, the psychology of living in space isolated with other humans, the history of space travel. There’s a lot here and most of it fascinating. My level of enthusiasm waxed and waned, hence the lower rating, but I would still recommend this. It’s an experience and I always value that.Pre-read ranting: My head is stuck in space right now, between reading Dark Space and watching Elysium today and then mulling over my favorite claustrophobic space movies - Event Horizon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien movies, Sunshine (my favorite). Can optimism and joy not survive the vacuum of space or something? They just disappear with the screams?Moving on, Mary Roach makes science both fascinating and hilarious. I'm so excited to read this! I don't know if anything can beat Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers but I'll keep an open mind. Theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7wtsJ...This reminds me of the astronaut story from The Illustrated Man and how the father of the family was more in love with space than with his family."
194,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael,4,"Science fiction movies and novels dealing with long exploration missions to deep space rarely deal with the complexities of our bodies surviving during the long journey through space.Or as the old question asks, ""Where does Captain Kirk go to the bathroom?""Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" not only looks at where Kirk would go, but how such a thing would be possible. It also looks at a lot of other questions that scientists and NASA have to and have addressed during humanity's quest to explore space. From the earliest days of space travel when we wondered if gravity would be required for our internal organs and systems to continue working properly to the affects of long-term weightlessness on our muscle systems, Roach delves into the question of just how will our bodies survive or work during a long voyage to Mars. (Roach even deals with the question of whether its possible or reasonable to have sex in zero g, even watching an adult film that was allegedly shot in zero g). All in all, the book is a fascinating one. Roach maintains a fine line between presenting the facts and having a sense of humor about things. She deals with a lot of bodily functions, but all of these are necessary to consider in whether or not its possible to send humans to Mars or on a long trip into outer space. While we've all thought about how humans would eat in space and use the bathroom, we've probably thought less about how hygiene can and would work in outer space. Will the space ships end up smelling like a locker room or worse? Also delved into are the on-going studies into motion sickness and the inherent dangers faced if you lose your cookies in a space suit. Roach's approach is a solid one with each aspect presented in an understandable, entertaining fashion. What could easily have been a dry subject is instead presented in a fascinating, readable way that will give you a new respect for the men and women who've gone into outer space in the past and those who will head out into the solar system and beyond in our future (hopefully).

195,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869511-adam,2,"The title of this book is misleading. It doesn't really delve into the plans or obstacles for a manned mission to Mars, but is more of an overview of the history of the world's space programs (mostly U.S.) to date and some background on the human issues that don't readily come to mind when thinking of the challenges of space for humans(food, hygiene, waste management, psychology, physiological effects of zero gravity on humans, etc.)The book rambled a bit from topic to topic (a few pure tangents as well) without much cohesion tying them back to Mars. This is the first Mary Roach book I have read and while the subject matter of her other books seems interesting, I'm not sure I will read another. You know when someone tries to be funny and there's that awkward silence when they fail? Mary Roach writes that way. A lot. It seems like every paragraph there's at least two attempts at humor and I'd guestimate the overall success rate of eliciting a smile or chuckle at about 10% - it got to be too much for me by the halfway point of the book. The funniest moments are actually quotes by other people.Overall most of the topics covered in the book were interesting, the presentation just didn't do it for me."
196,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20773991-holly,4,"This was honestly really interesting, and probably as good (if not better) than Roach's other book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, which I read probably a year back.Roach combines factual information and fun story telling in a great way, that makes these books immensely readable and fun. I've avoided science non-fiction for a long time, mainly because I didn't think I was smart enough per say, but Mary Roach has really introduced me to the realms of popular science and the world of scientific non-fiction.I have Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War on my to read list, and I will undoubtedly read it at some point. But I'll definitely keep my eye out for more popular science books that pique my interest"
197,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,4,"This engagingly readable book tackles the subject of man's exploration of near-space--specifically, the difficult and sometimes messy task of protecting humans as they explore the void of space. At times a history text, at times cutting-edge, it covers a lot of topics in a fun and interesting way. Roach's voice is clear and witty, sometimes biting, other times self-mocking, but always kept my interest. Unfortunately, the book isn't so much about the title as it is about the subtitle, and I would have liked more about the current state of space exploration as it applies to Mars missions. (""Current"" being 2010, when the book was published; I don't ding it for not being written in 2017.) But I enjoyed it immensely, and appreciated the extensive end notes/bibliography, which gave me some ideas for further reading. I will definitely pick up more of Roach's work."

I was most interested to hear what Muslims do for prayer time when they are orbiting Earth. Figure the timing according to where you were last on Earth and follow that 5 times per day.

She uses a lot of websites for references, but many interviews and research of the scientific literature."

200,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Mary Roach now has a lock on a certain kind of book. Science is her beat, and her shtick is to make it funny — often hilariously funny. But be forewarned: her take on “funny” means she is going to violate any taboo that gets in the way of making you cringe and groan at the same time you laugh.In her first book, 
Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife
, she did the topic as funny-but-creepy, and hadn’t yet glommed on to her now-predictable gross-out brand of humor. That came in brilliantly with her second book, 
Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers
. Now you could get science done as hilarious and creepy and gross!She dropped the creepy and replaced it with mildly titillating in her third (and still my favorite), 
Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex
. But definitely still hilarious and gross.In 
Packing for Mars
, she’s tightened her focus. No more creepy, no more titillating, just funny in that juvenile way of hers. She asks the questions that any “mature” adults would never dare ask, and then begs for the juicy details. I’m sure many of the people she interviews are non-plussed at how to respond; those that don't know her previous work probably think she’s a kook. She appears to be okay with that.As usual, much of her funniest asides come in the form of footnotes. Here’s one, from the chapter on NASA’s research on how to best, er, replicate what toilets do in the absence of gravity. It turns out that NASA has saved the “output” of astronauts for years...Astronaut specimens from the Skylab and Apollo eras are still around, in freezers on the top floor of a windowless high-security building at Houston's Johnson Space Center—the one that houses NASA's collection of (non-biological) moon rocks. “I’m not sure what our inventory of excreta from Apollo is right now,” John Charles told me. “Forty years of freezing, with occasional thaws due to power outages during hurricanes, may have reduced them to mere vestiges of their former glory.” They were there as of 1996, because planetary biologist Ralph Harvey stumbled onto them when he got lost taking a group of VIPs on a tour. “Back then all the doors opened to the same code,” he recalls. “I opened this one door and it was almost like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There were these rows of long, low freezers. They all had a little light on them that’s blinking, and a temperature readout, and a piece of tape with the astronaut’s name. I’m like, Shit, they stored the astronauts in there! and I quickly got the people out. I found out later that was where they stored the astronaut feces and urine.” Harvey can’t recall the room number. “You have to stumble onto it, that’s the only way you can find it. It’s like Narnia.”                 •       •       •See the review at the New York Times: Astral Bodies (August 6, 2010).

201,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Packing for Mars is like Bonk, Stiff and Spook (her three previous books) but in space. Awesome! Everything is better in space. And hilariously entertaining.I have a huge author crush on Mary Roach. She isn't embarrassed by any subject. (I know this for a fact, I got to ask her at her book reading.) She won't pass up a Howdy Doody joke when discussing the difficulties in pooing in zero-G. She also scammed a free copy of zero-G porn movie series and watching it to 'research' zero-G sex. She asks all the probing, detail oriented questions that 99% of us would never even think of. And yet, once we know the questions, we are fascinated by the answers. She uncovers the slightly embarrassing marginalia of the space race.Mary Roach does it so we don't have to!Now for just a few interesting and funny bits I learned while reading Packing for Mars.I had no clue that defecating in zero-G presents with a whole host of complications, many of which only become apparent while in space. NASA and other space agencies have spent a lot of time and money researching ways to not just make a space toilet comfortable and private, but just to merely work.
""A successful zero-gravity toilet is a subtle finessing of engineering, materials science, physiology, psychology, and etiquette. ...If just one element is missing, things don't come out right.""
If I ever hear about the cost of developing a space toilet, I will not flinch an inch. This is important work.Here's another fun random space-based factoid for you: ""The contract for the Apollo lunar landing suits went to International Latex, which later became Playtex."" As in bras. Roach mentions earlier that when NASA needed to develop a space suit, they had no experience in rubberized materials, so they went to a huge bra & underwear manufacturer who sold through the Sears catalogue.This fact is a little more serious (by that I mean less squicky) than the poo/bra stuff above. Did you know that moon dust is incredibly abrasive? Since there's no wind, there's no erosion smoothing the rough corners. Moon dust quickly scratches lenses and helmet visors. To make matters worse, the dust is bombarded with cosmic particles which being impart a charge to the dust. Not only is it sharp, it also sticks to absolutely everything. Get this: there are companies that exist just to produce faux moon dust for NASA.Finally, one last poo joke, because I can't resist. Did you know the opposite of ingest is egest? As in: to reduce the amount of egesta, you must ingest low-residue foods. Here's Roach's goofy footnote to this: 
""Egesta is my new favorite euphemism for 'feces,' and an even better toilet brand name than Ejecto. Certainly better than Toto. Who names a toilet after a lapdog? Unless it's Shit-Tzu. I'd buy a Shit-Tsu toilet.""
 Me too, Mary. Perhaps a footnote generated after sharing too much vodka with the cosmonauts?This book is extremely amusing and wicked entertaining. And I love Mary Roach. I hope she keeps digging up the marginalia of the world.____________PS: Make sure you watch the book trailer - I think it's linked at right on this page. Normally I hate those things, but this one is genuinely funny.PPS: Mary signed my book ""Spacily yours, Mary Roach"" *swoon*"

Mary Roach takes an irreverent look at space travel, and answers all your questions about sex and pooping in space. Actually, she only speculates about the sex -- NASA and the astronauts remain mum on the subject. But while Roach has an informal, sometimes juvenile style (this book is meant to be entertaining, and isn't exactly science journalism), she does research a lot of subjects in exhaustive detail that you've probably always wondered about but didn't think it was appropriate to ask. Problems like elimination in space and hygiene and what to do when you're space-sick may seem funny here on Earth, but they're dead serious concerns that NASA has spent millions of dollars researching (in sometimes bizarre ways). Packing for Mars is full of a million interesting, bizarre, and sometimes disgusting factoids about life in a space capsule. It may make you yearn for a manned Mars mission, but it won't make you envy the astronauts who actually fly it."

This book was published ten years ago and it has aged a bit due to the advancements in space exploration. I have read newer books about space travel that I felt were more interesting with more in-depth information on the space training process. This was more was more anecdoctal than informative with sections on sex, pooping and animal astraunauts. Yet, this was still an enjoyable book to read, especially for someone like myself that doesn’t read a lot of non fiction. Roach has a wonderfully, humorous narrative style that makes the information very digestible to read."

Should be five stars but I rarely give 5 stars so it is kind of 4.48 stars.Mary kept us well-engaged in this space travel journey and while she may not packed us suitably for Mars, she did an excellent job to stimulate our interests further into everything related to Space Travel, whether the basic things that we take for granted (the way we eat, the things we eat, the logistics of walking, dressing, showering, peeing, or from all things, defecating!) or the more challenging parts of it, psychically, socially and, of course, psychologically (think of being alone somewhere in the moon, some 400,000 km away from earth looking at it with a bulky spacesuit and wondering whether you will return back home to have the much-awaited dinner (fish & chips?) with family and kids). Well done, Mary. I mean, seriously, even my 7-year kid liked the incidents that happened and written about in the book. Well, how about sleeping in space? In what activities time is spent for astronauts? Are they just sitting idle in their spacecraft (just sleeping & eating, like we do over the skies in a plane), awaiting to reach their destination? How about women? Are they better fit for the role? Why were they not considered in the earlier space journeys? Patriarchism the culpable as usual?Let's not forget the animals (monkeys and dogs) who ventured into the space and making some history in their way.Wait. How does it smell inside a space capsule? Must be nice I guess or at least something decent to let you endure all the time outside the world. But, wait. It seems it doesn't. Oh no. Please no."
207,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"I’ve been fascinated with space since I was a kid. Space travel has always been a fantasy of mine even though I knew it’s not something I’d ever do even when I was a kid. When I picked up this book, I expected to learn about space travel and some of the expectations, plans, and problems with a potential future mission to Mars. What I got was so much more. Mary Roach had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Her book not only covers the history of space travel and the logistics, but all the hilarious things that is rarely talked about, like pooping at zero gravity.I learned so much from Roach. Everything from space flight testing to zero gravity training is there, but also the psychological worries, experiments, taboos, and the testing that goes on in and out of space. There’s so much history here that was never even hinted at when the first Moon landing was covered in high school history.This book is a treasure. It’s honestly one of the most fascinating books that I’ve ever read. There are seemingly obvious topics thoroughly covered, like the difficultly behind showering at zero gravity and how something as simple as a fuse doesn’t work the same in space thanks to, you guessed it: gravity. Mary also has a wonderful writing style and I like her personality. She took what could’ve been some very dry topics and made them interesting to read about. I highly recommend this book and I’ll be checking out her other works."
208,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"In Mary Roach’s usual style, she takes a humourous look at NASA and space travel in this one, looking at some of the things that most of us just don’t think about when it comes to travelling in zero-gravity. She looks at using the “toilet”, eating, sex, throwing up, hygiene, and more. This did, of course, include some history of space travel, as well. I hadn’t even realized when I started reading it a few days ago that the 50th anniversary of the walk on the moon was yesterday, while I was in the middle reading this – good timing for me! In the first chapter, it was interesting to read about how they made the flag “fly” (with no gravity!) on the moon, and also how to even pack it to bring with them, with the limited space available. There was one real transcript of three astronauts having a discussion when one of them noticed a “turd” flying in the air – omg, I couldn’t stop laughing and crying reading that transcript! Kept me from continuing to read for at least 5 minutes, if not more!! This, and “Stiff” are my favourites of the ones I’ve read by her so far."
209,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Mary Roach is the sort of person who actually ought to be writing science textbooks for junior high. If she had:1) there would have been a lot more careful reading of the science textbooks in my class, and most others2) there would have been a lot more juvenile humor3) most people would have learned a lot more science, and4) the textbooks would no doubt have been banned within a yearSo, unfortunately, we do not have science textbooks written by Mary Roach, for junior high or any other grade. However, we do have books written by Mary Roach, and maybe I should say this one is more about the technology and history of space travel than really the science, but in any case it is awesome. Oddly, both my wife and I liked it, and we don't share a lot in common in our bookish tastes. I think she may be more partial to scatological content than I am. If you're into scatological content, by the way, this is your book (unless, you know, you want _that_ kind of scatological content, in which case no, this is mostly about space travel).We have been sending people into space for over half a century now, and perhaps more importantly for this book, thinking about and preparing to send people into space. It turns out, this is a big deal, and not just the part about making rockets.It turns out, for example, that gravity is extraordinarily useful. Without it, stuff gets lost a lot, and when it does, you have no idea where to look, because it could be anywhere. Crunchy food is unacceptable, because crumbs don't fall, so they get everywhere. Taking a shower is difficult, because water droplets don't fall. Also, a lot of things about how the body eliminates waste, depend upon gravity to work properly.In fact, a recurring theme of this book, is that space travel is really a lot less exciting and a lot more gross than either Russia or the U.S. wants to talk about very much. Roach goes to Russia to speak with a number of cosmonauts about bathrooms, bickering, alcohol, sex, and all the other things that NASA had to think about, in order to see what is inevitable and what could be dealt with differently depending on the culture. It turns out that being a cosmonaut, astronaut, or any other kind of space traveler is in large part about discovering that a lot of simple matters on earth become complicated. It is no exaggeration to say that bathroom design was as much of an obstacle to women in space in the early days, as sexism (although both certainly played a part). It is also no exaggeration to say that bathroom design for the men was way more complex than on earth.I read this book a chapter or two at a time, in the morning at the coffeeshop. My daughter would hear me laughing, and look over at me expectantly. 2 times out of 3, it would be something I couldn't tell her about, because she was eating.But, it's not all scatological. There's also sex, and the closely related topic of arguments. People in very enclosed spaces, for long periods of time, interact in a lot of ways. It's not necessarily always discussed with the general public.Or with NASA (or the Russian equivalent). A repeating theme throughout the book is that, whether it's depression or space sickness (equivalent of seasickness, but from zero gravity) or arguments or anything else that makes you less than perfect, the people who go up into space were normally unwilling to admit to any of it to their bosses down on Earth, for fear that it would prevent them from being picked for the next mission. It was part of Mary Roach's job, helped no doubt by the passage of time, to get people to discuss more openly a lot of what did NOT get discussed previously.And, also, a lot of gross stuff. Seriously, there is a lot of discussion of vomit. But, it is Mary Roach's rare talent to be able to write about topics which we would normally (most of us, anyway) shy away from, and make it funny and informative at the same time. This book is no exception."
210,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"When you think about space travel and exploration, nobody ever thinks about the poop bags. This book was interesting and eye-opening about a lot of the mundane minutiae of going into space, made (slightly) less mundane by Mary Roach's writing about it, but what really interested me was all of the ways that gravity allows us to live - and what happens to us when gravity is taken out of the equation. This book covers pretty much everything from physiological results of high G pressures and impacts, to floating poops to bone density changes. I'm sure she would have included a kitchen sink... except that in space, the water would just coalesce into a bubble and mess up the equipment. I didn't find this book quite as funny as I've found Roach in the past, but could just be personal preference. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for space farts. I'll show myself out."
211,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I have an awkward relationship with Mary Roach. I find her humor forced, blatant, and poorly timed and so it always falls flat to me. I realize that a lot of people really appreciate her humor, but it just doesn’t click for me. Actually, I bet I think she was really funny if I heard her talk, because potty humor IS my type of humor, but it just doesn’t seem to translate for me in her books.That said, she researches these absolutely fascinating topics from angles that no one else would, and I totally appreciate that. I mean, really, she is willing to throw her energy and time into researching the history of pooping in space. INQUIRING MINDS REALLY DO WANT TO KNOW. If I had to tell anyone to listen to one chapter from this book it would totally be Chapter 14- the poop chapter. It is hilarious in its own right, poop literally floating around during Apollo missions, and she shies away from nothing. How could you not want to know?If there is anything I learned in this book (and actually I learned A LOT so props to the author) its that astronauts have spent a lot of time living like filthy animals for science, and we are ALL better for it.If you are looking for something a little strange, informative, and easily translatable to fodder for all sorts of awkward holiday-party small-talk then I really suggest this book."
212,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,4,"This was my first time (finally) reading Mary Roach, and gosh but this was a great place to start, with a topic right up my alley. I love the everyday details and considerations of space travel and the unique weirdnesses of zero-gravity life!!! In that way, Packing for Mars pairs really well with Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. This reading was also well-timed: I visited Houston's NASA Space Center while reading it, and some of the videos on-display there exhibit the sheer giddy silly joy of astronauts hopping around on the moon -- not exactly the dignified, no-nonsense image that we tend to have of astronauts and which tends to go out in the PR materials.Similarly, Roach is a PR department's nightmare as she doggedly delves into the day-to-day considerations of space, no matter how unsavoury or inglorious: food and defecation and loss of bone density, the effects of extended solitude, the bizarre scientific experiments done in an attempt to prepare for the almost-inconceivable. It's occasionally laugh-out-loud funny; nonfiction written in a really light, engaging, accessible tone that I don't think sacrifices its scientific merit at all.It also manages to capture how touching and strange and awe-inspiring it all is, the lengths and sacrifices that we've made to go to space, the thrill and the importance of mankind's curiosity and problem-solving. Really looking forward to reading more from her.To the rocket scientist, you are a problem. You are the most irritating piece of machinery he or she will ever have to deal with. You and your fluctuating metabolism, your puny memory, your frame that comes in a million different configurations. You are unpredictable. You're inconstant. You take weeks to fix. The engineer must worry about the water and oxygen and food you'll need in space, about how much extra fuel it will take to launch your shrimp cocktail and irradiated beef tacos. A solar cell or a thruster nozzle is stable and undemanding. It does not excrete or panic or fall in love with the mission commander. It has no ego. Its structural elements don't start to break down without gravity, and it works just fine without sleep.To me, you are the best thing to happen to rocket science. The human being is the machine that makes the whole endeavor so endlessly intriguing."
213,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46311769-katie-long,5,"Roach brings her inimitable informative irreverence into outer space this time. More specifically to the details, and often indignities, of humans in space. Ever wondered if astronauts get motion sick, have sex in space, or are ever jealous of monkeys? Mary Roach did, and found some very serious people to answer her questions. Her questions are often hilarious, but they are never irrelevant."
214,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Wow! An excellent piece of very readable research of our journey into space & all the considerations for a trip to Mars in, hopefully, 2030. As usual, Roach captured the human side & presented it with plenty of humor.The research had to be difficult for her in many cases. NASA needs publicity to stay funded, but any negative publicity can hurt them immensely, especially since Congress & the VP oversee them. (LBJ basically squashed any females in space for years with a pen stroke.) Considering how divisive our attitudes are on so many subjects, especially taboo ones, it's no wonder that NASA regulates what information goes out with an iron hand. For instance, they once spent a lot of time & money in an effort to give the astronauts a night cap - just a bit of sherry to finish off the day. It all went to waste because news leaked out & a letter writing campaign by a bunch of teetotalers caused too much negative publicity. There are many taboo subjects that come up in relation to space flight & living in zero gee. Two biggies are sex & elimination. As Roach showed so well in her previous book, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, amazingly little is known about sex. NASA, the organization that can write entire books about the seemingly simplest things, ignores the subject. Unfortunately, it's a negative sum game for them. Any research they do into it will cause waves they can't afford. Still, she managed to pry a bit of info out of some, but not much.Elimination took up several chapters & it's not because she's hung up on it, but because it is such a necessary, time consuming & messy business. It's also tied closely to what is eaten & what can be eaten on a long trip when every ounce has to be closely watched & personal odors have a huge impact on morale. It's an amazingly complex feat to deal with a simple stool. At one time, they actually used cameras to record the process & then destroyed the films to avoid bad publicity. Now researchers could really use that data again.How strange & complex the simplest thing becomes when under intense public scrutiny & done without gravity! A lot of what we think we know turns out to be wrong. Even the urge to pee isn't present in zero gee until the bursting point - literally a point at which the urethra could be constricted by the bladder, so urination has to be scheduled to avoid problems.There are more exhaustive books on the subject & many of them are in her bibliography, but I doubt there is a more readable introduction to the complexity of what faces NASA as they prepare for the Mars mission, a culmination of every space effort to date. She did a great job & I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. "
215,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"Mary Roach has made quite a career writing quirky, irreverent books on some of the weirder corners of science. She's covered corpses, the afterlife, sex, and now space. So all the cool subjects. As it turns out, space exploration is a rich and varied subject. Every aspect of life in space has to be carefully, exhaustively researched beforehand, after all. Right down to, ahem, elimination procedures. In the hands of another writer, all of this detail might become overwhelming, or boring, maybe kind of gross, depending on the chapter. But as with her other books, Roach writes with such an infectious delight at what she's learned that I was completely riveted. Sure, I have more than a passing interest in the space program, and that probably helped. One of my friends is even more interested than I am, and this just might end up under her Christmas tree this year."
216,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"Very interesting book about space. Going to the bathroom in space, eating in space, bone deteriorating in space. As always, Roach is funny and informative."
217,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"This book is funny, gross, and fascinating, and I am SO not suited to be an astronaut! If YOU want to be an astronaut, you’d better have a strong stomach and a big tolerance for grossness in general. I had NO IDEA a book about travel in space would read like a scene from a Judd Apatow movie, but it turns out human waste of many varieties is a big issue for NASA. Mary Roach tells us about how space agencies try to prepare astronauts for space travel, and study how the trainees react, and she goes into the details of the history of space travel so far, in the detail that rarely gets reported in regular history books. And she wangles her way onto the Vomit Comet, for research purposes, of course!What I learned is that space travel is tricky for living organisms, like people. We’re adapted for conditions on a planet, where there’s gravity, and opportunities to eat delicious, crumby meals, bathe regularly and take care of elimination in privacy and comfort. Here’s a couple of quotes that illustrate the issue:Gravity facilitates what is known in aerospace waste collection circles as “separation.” Fecal popcorning is the reason Space Shuttle toilets are equipped with rearview mirrors.Women would be more efficient astronauts, but they weren’t included in the early programs because NASA didn’t want to figure out the logistics of female urination. In space. I’m not kidding! Humans take a LOT of maintenance. We’re constantly sweating, shedding hair and skin, sneezing, and doing that whole processing food thing. Our bones need gravity to know to stay strong. Doing all that up in space is much, much trickier, and messier than on Earth. Also, people can get weird in the close confines of a noisy, hot little metal container floating in space. We can get surly and difficult, or some of us may experience the rapture of space and want to float off into the cosmos, or something. Maybe. Maybe it’s just the oxygen mix in those suits.Mary Roach also researches the careers of animals in space (I’ll never forgive Russia for what they did to Laika. Never.), crash impacts on bodies (which reminded me of her first book, Stiff), and sex in space, which isn’t as sexy as it sounds. The focus has been on the impact of no gravity on reproduction, not on, um, logistics. And according to NASA, no one has yet to join the Zero-G club. Not officially, anyways. Well, okay, there were some rats, but that was an experiment. Recommended to everyone who wants to know what the “right stuff” really is. "

Either space travel has gotten vastly cheaper or Hollywood has finally gone nuts.This book covers everything a layperson would ever want to know about space travel and a host of things you would have preferred not to know. No longer does bravery and a guts n glory attitude maketh an astronaut. Now the ability to follow orders, emotional neutrality and a range of other (very boring) personality traits now make for excellent astronauts.The first part of the book focused on how candidates get tested and selected based on their psychological and physiological responses to a wide range of very absurd tests. If any child with the dream of becoming an astronaut read this book we will have a complete shortage of willing candidates very soon.From the impact of gravity on our internal organs, motion sickness, technical malfunctions, early animal experiments and even the impact of space travel on bone density, all showed just how fragile us humans really are.I have always loved this author’s books as she mixes humor and facts in such a way that entertain and informs the reader at the same time. However in this book it sometimes felt that she was trying a tad too hard with the funny quips (that quickly became not so funny). My solution was to read this over an extended period of time and not all in one go and this worked well to lessen my irritation with the feeling of forced humor.Like her other books the overly ""sciency"" stuff becomes understandable and is absolutely crammed with facts that you would not necessarily find in official NASA reports. Things like the development of self-cleaning underwear to negate needing a bath in space, how space food and space toilets evolved (not nearly enough is the answer).This book was not in the same league as my beloved Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers however it did satisfy my almost insatiable need for trivia facts.Mary Roach is basically the female equivalent of A J Jacobs and if you enjoy his books you will surely love hers."

It's just a matter of adapting to a space suit and a weightless environment. While we have people like Elon Musk enthusiastic about space travel, my biggest personal antagonism about the idea has always related to elimination during space travel, and the fact that any vehicle must end up smelling like a sewer.Gotta be very careful about disposing of human waste in space - Newton's third law applies...This is where Star Trek's transporter technology could be quite useful.

I didn't like some of the comments it suppose to be funny but somehow I found it more of heavy.

221,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904933-chris,2,"A decent book with interesting details about space sciences and the biology of human spaceflight. However, the author felt compelled to display her snarky, adolescent humor and go off on tangents on subjects that she must have felt were funny, but which is merely unnecessary gossip and/or gross little anecdotes. It seemed obvious that she was probably jealous of the scientists and astronauts whom she interviewed, failed to understand the pragmatic and hard-headed approach that engineers and scientists must take to accomplish goals, and had to include embarrassing little tidbits about the space sciences and the people who work in that industry. A bit pathetic, and the end of the book did not close the gap between the sour effect of the first 95% of the book, and the barely aspirational closer. Unsure who the intended reader of this book is, besides sniggering adolescents."

(Stiff) So when I saw this one, about one of my favourite things in the world, space travel, I was excited. Even more so since I'm running a roleplaying game set on Mars right now, although much further along than the first tentative preparations Roach is talking about here.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

223,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5583595-anna-bananas,3,"Sooo, it only took me a few years to finish this. I tend to stall out on her books and then get back to them. A book about space and everything associated with it was a fascinating idea and for the most part she does a good job of opening up that world for you. Her humor, which I enjoyed very much in Stiff, is sometimes a bit much now. There are a lot of asides and footnotes that don’t necessarily add to the story and just show that she had fun doing the research. I find it more distracting than amusing at this point, after reading four of her books. And yet, I will read more. I love how thoroughly she tackles her topics, exploring all the aspects and angles. I learned about parabolic flight and its uses, how we’re preparing for possible manned Mars missions, the ingredients of space food, how we...poop in space, how our organs and bodies react to gravity - and to the lack of it, the psychology of living in space isolated with other humans, the history of space travel. There’s a lot here and most of it fascinating. My level of enthusiasm waxed and waned, hence the lower rating, but I would still recommend this. It’s an experience and I always value that.Pre-read ranting: My head is stuck in space right now, between reading Dark Space and watching Elysium today and then mulling over my favorite claustrophobic space movies - Event Horizon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien movies, Sunshine (my favorite). Can optimism and joy not survive the vacuum of space or something? They just disappear with the screams?Moving on, Mary Roach makes science both fascinating and hilarious. I'm so excited to read this! I don't know if anything can beat Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers but I'll keep an open mind. Theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7wtsJ...This reminds me of the astronaut story from The Illustrated Man and how the father of the family was more in love with space than with his family."
224,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael,4,"Science fiction movies and novels dealing with long exploration missions to deep space rarely deal with the complexities of our bodies surviving during the long journey through space.Or as the old question asks, ""Where does Captain Kirk go to the bathroom?""Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" not only looks at where Kirk would go, but how such a thing would be possible. It also looks at a lot of other questions that scientists and NASA have to and have addressed during humanity's quest to explore space. From the earliest days of space travel when we wondered if gravity would be required for our internal organs and systems to continue working properly to the affects of long-term weightlessness on our muscle systems, Roach delves into the question of just how will our bodies survive or work during a long voyage to Mars. (Roach even deals with the question of whether its possible or reasonable to have sex in zero g, even watching an adult film that was allegedly shot in zero g). All in all, the book is a fascinating one. Roach maintains a fine line between presenting the facts and having a sense of humor about things. She deals with a lot of bodily functions, but all of these are necessary to consider in whether or not its possible to send humans to Mars or on a long trip into outer space. While we've all thought about how humans would eat in space and use the bathroom, we've probably thought less about how hygiene can and would work in outer space. Will the space ships end up smelling like a locker room or worse? Also delved into are the on-going studies into motion sickness and the inherent dangers faced if you lose your cookies in a space suit. Roach's approach is a solid one with each aspect presented in an understandable, entertaining fashion. What could easily have been a dry subject is instead presented in a fascinating, readable way that will give you a new respect for the men and women who've gone into outer space in the past and those who will head out into the solar system and beyond in our future (hopefully). "
225,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869511-adam,2,"The title of this book is misleading. It doesn't really delve into the plans or obstacles for a manned mission to Mars, but is more of an overview of the history of the world's space programs (mostly U.S.) to date and some background on the human issues that don't readily come to mind when thinking of the challenges of space for humans(food, hygiene, waste management, psychology, physiological effects of zero gravity on humans, etc.)The book rambled a bit from topic to topic (a few pure tangents as well) without much cohesion tying them back to Mars. This is the first Mary Roach book I have read and while the subject matter of her other books seems interesting, I'm not sure I will read another. You know when someone tries to be funny and there's that awkward silence when they fail? Mary Roach writes that way. A lot. It seems like every paragraph there's at least two attempts at humor and I'd guestimate the overall success rate of eliciting a smile or chuckle at about 10% - it got to be too much for me by the halfway point of the book. The funniest moments are actually quotes by other people.Overall most of the topics covered in the book were interesting, the presentation just didn't do it for me."
226,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20773991-holly,4,"This was honestly really interesting, and probably as good (if not better) than Roach's other book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, which I read probably a year back.Roach combines factual information and fun story telling in a great way, that makes these books immensely readable and fun. I've avoided science non-fiction for a long time, mainly because I didn't think I was smart enough per say, but Mary Roach has really introduced me to the realms of popular science and the world of scientific non-fiction.I have Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War on my to read list, and I will undoubtedly read it at some point. But I'll definitely keep my eye out for more popular science books that pique my interest"
227,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,4,"This engagingly readable book tackles the subject of man's exploration of near-space--specifically, the difficult and sometimes messy task of protecting humans as they explore the void of space. At times a history text, at times cutting-edge, it covers a lot of topics in a fun and interesting way. Roach's voice is clear and witty, sometimes biting, other times self-mocking, but always kept my interest. Unfortunately, the book isn't so much about the title as it is about the subtitle, and I would have liked more about the current state of space exploration as it applies to Mars missions. (""Current"" being 2010, when the book was published; I don't ding it for not being written in 2017.) But I enjoyed it immensely, and appreciated the extensive end notes/bibliography, which gave me some ideas for further reading. I will definitely pick up more of Roach's work."

230,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Mary Roach now has a lock on a certain kind of book. Science is her beat, and her shtick is to make it funny — often hilariously funny. But be forewarned: her take on “funny” means she is going to violate any taboo that gets in the way of making you cringe and groan at the same time you laugh.In her first book, 
Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife
, she did the topic as funny-but-creepy, and hadn’t yet glommed on to her now-predictable gross-out brand of humor. That came in brilliantly with her second book, 
Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers
. Now you could get science done as hilarious and creepy and gross!She dropped the creepy and replaced it with mildly titillating in her third (and still my favorite), 
Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex
. But definitely still hilarious and gross.In 
Packing for Mars
, she’s tightened her focus. No more creepy, no more titillating, just funny in that juvenile way of hers. She asks the questions that any “mature” adults would never dare ask, and then begs for the juicy details. I’m sure many of the people she interviews are non-plussed at how to respond; those that don't know her previous work probably think she’s a kook. She appears to be okay with that.As usual, much of her funniest asides come in the form of footnotes. Here’s one, from the chapter on NASA’s research on how to best, er, replicate what toilets do in the absence of gravity. It turns out that NASA has saved the “output” of astronauts for years...Astronaut specimens from the Skylab and Apollo eras are still around, in freezers on the top floor of a windowless high-security building at Houston's Johnson Space Center—the one that houses NASA's collection of (non-biological) moon rocks. “I’m not sure what our inventory of excreta from Apollo is right now,” John Charles told me. “Forty years of freezing, with occasional thaws due to power outages during hurricanes, may have reduced them to mere vestiges of their former glory.” They were there as of 1996, because planetary biologist Ralph Harvey stumbled onto them when he got lost taking a group of VIPs on a tour. “Back then all the doors opened to the same code,” he recalls. “I opened this one door and it was almost like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There were these rows of long, low freezers. They all had a little light on them that’s blinking, and a temperature readout, and a piece of tape with the astronaut’s name. I’m like, Shit, they stored the astronauts in there! and I quickly got the people out. I found out later that was where they stored the astronaut feces and urine.” Harvey can’t recall the room number. “You have to stumble onto it, that’s the only way you can find it. It’s like Narnia.”                 •       •       •See the review at the New York Times: Astral Bodies (August 6, 2010).

231,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Packing for Mars is like Bonk, Stiff and Spook (her three previous books) but in space. Awesome! Everything is better in space. And hilariously entertaining.I have a huge author crush on Mary Roach. She isn't embarrassed by any subject. (I know this for a fact, I got to ask her at her book reading.) She won't pass up a Howdy Doody joke when discussing the difficulties in pooing in zero-G. She also scammed a free copy of zero-G porn movie series and watching it to 'research' zero-G sex. She asks all the probing, detail oriented questions that 99% of us would never even think of. And yet, once we know the questions, we are fascinated by the answers. She uncovers the slightly embarrassing marginalia of the space race.Mary Roach does it so we don't have to!Now for just a few interesting and funny bits I learned while reading Packing for Mars.I had no clue that defecating in zero-G presents with a whole host of complications, many of which only become apparent while in space. NASA and other space agencies have spent a lot of time and money researching ways to not just make a space toilet comfortable and private, but just to merely work.
""A successful zero-gravity toilet is a subtle finessing of engineering, materials science, physiology, psychology, and etiquette. ...If just one element is missing, things don't come out right.""
If I ever hear about the cost of developing a space toilet, I will not flinch an inch. This is important work.Here's another fun random space-based factoid for you: ""The contract for the Apollo lunar landing suits went to International Latex, which later became Playtex."" As in bras. Roach mentions earlier that when NASA needed to develop a space suit, they had no experience in rubberized materials, so they went to a huge bra & underwear manufacturer who sold through the Sears catalogue.This fact is a little more serious (by that I mean less squicky) than the poo/bra stuff above. Did you know that moon dust is incredibly abrasive? Since there's no wind, there's no erosion smoothing the rough corners. Moon dust quickly scratches lenses and helmet visors. To make matters worse, the dust is bombarded with cosmic particles which being impart a charge to the dust. Not only is it sharp, it also sticks to absolutely everything. Get this: there are companies that exist just to produce faux moon dust for NASA.Finally, one last poo joke, because I can't resist. Did you know the opposite of ingest is egest? As in: to reduce the amount of egesta, you must ingest low-residue foods. Here's Roach's goofy footnote to this: 
""Egesta is my new favorite euphemism for 'feces,' and an even better toilet brand name than Ejecto. Certainly better than Toto. Who names a toilet after a lapdog? Unless it's Shit-Tzu. I'd buy a Shit-Tsu toilet.""
 Me too, Mary. Perhaps a footnote generated after sharing too much vodka with the cosmonauts?This book is extremely amusing and wicked entertaining. And I love Mary Roach. I hope she keeps digging up the marginalia of the world.____________PS: Make sure you watch the book trailer - I think it's linked at right on this page. Normally I hate those things, but this one is genuinely funny.PPS: Mary signed my book ""Spacily yours, Mary Roach"" *swoon*"

Mary Roach takes an irreverent look at space travel, and answers all your questions about sex and pooping in space. Actually, she only speculates about the sex -- NASA and the astronauts remain mum on the subject. But while Roach has an informal, sometimes juvenile style (this book is meant to be entertaining, and isn't exactly science journalism), she does research a lot of subjects in exhaustive detail that you've probably always wondered about but didn't think it was appropriate to ask. Problems like elimination in space and hygiene and what to do when you're space-sick may seem funny here on Earth, but they're dead serious concerns that NASA has spent millions of dollars researching (in sometimes bizarre ways). Packing for Mars is full of a million interesting, bizarre, and sometimes disgusting factoids about life in a space capsule. It may make you yearn for a manned Mars mission, but it won't make you envy the astronauts who actually fly it."

This book was published ten years ago and it has aged a bit due to the advancements in space exploration. I have read newer books about space travel that I felt were more interesting with more in-depth information on the space training process. This was more was more anecdoctal than informative with sections on sex, pooping and animal astraunauts. Yet, this was still an enjoyable book to read, especially for someone like myself that doesn’t read a lot of non fiction.

Should be five stars but I rarely give 5 stars so it is kind of 4.48 stars.Mary kept us well-engaged in this space travel journey and while she may not packed us suitably for Mars, she did an excellent job to stimulate our interests further into everything related to Space Travel, whether the basic things that we take for granted (the way we eat, the things we eat, the logistics of walking, dressing, showering, peeing, or from all things, defecating!) or the more challenging parts of it, psychically, socially and, of course, psychologically (think of being alone somewhere in the moon, some 400,000 km away from earth looking at it with a bulky spacesuit and wondering whether you will return back home to have the much-awaited dinner (fish & chips?) with family and kids). Well done, Mary. I mean, seriously, even my 7-year kid liked the incidents that happened and written about in the book. Well, how about sleeping in space? In what activities time is spent for astronauts? Are they just sitting idle in their spacecraft (just sleeping & eating, like we do over the skies in a plane), awaiting to reach their destination? How about women? Are they better fit for the role? Why were they not considered in the earlier space journeys? Patriarchism the culpable as usual?Let's not forget the animals (monkeys and dogs) who ventured into the space and making some history in their way.Wait. How does it smell inside a space capsule? Must be nice I guess or at least something decent to let you endure all the time outside the world. But, wait. It seems it doesn't. Oh no. Please no."

Space travel has always been a fantasy of mine even though I knew it’s not something I’d ever do even when I was a kid. When I picked up this book, I expected to learn about space travel and some of the expectations, plans, and problems with a potential future mission to Mars. What I got was so much more. Mary Roach had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Her book not only covers the history of space travel and the logistics, but all the hilarious things that is rarely talked about, like pooping at zero gravity.I learned so much from Roach. Everything from space flight testing to zero gravity training is there, but also the psychological worries, experiments, taboos, and the testing that goes on in and out of space. There’s so much history here that was never even hinted at when the first Moon landing was covered in high school history.This book is a treasure. It’s honestly one of the most fascinating books that I’ve ever read. There are seemingly obvious topics thoroughly covered, like the difficultly behind showering at zero gravity and how something as simple as a fuse doesn’t work the same in space thanks to, you guessed it: gravity. Mary also has a wonderful writing style and I like her personality. She took what could’ve been some very dry topics and made them interesting to read about. I highly recommend this book and I’ll be checking out her other works."
238,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"In Mary Roach’s usual style, she takes a humourous look at NASA and space travel in this one, looking at some of the things that most of us just don’t think about when it comes to travelling in zero-gravity. She looks at using the “toilet”, eating, sex, throwing up, hygiene, and more. This did, of course, include some history of space travel, as well. I hadn’t even realized when I started reading it a few days ago that the 50th anniversary of the walk on the moon was yesterday, while I was in the middle reading this – good timing for me! In the first chapter, it was interesting to read about how they made the flag “fly” (with no gravity!) on the moon, and also how to even pack it to bring with them, with the limited space available. There was one real transcript of three astronauts having a discussion when one of them noticed a “turd” flying in the air – omg, I couldn’t stop laughing and crying reading that transcript! Kept me from continuing to read for at least 5 minutes, if not more!! This, and “Stiff” are my favourites of the ones I’ve read by her so far."
239,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Mary Roach is the sort of person who actually ought to be writing science textbooks for junior high. If she had:1) there would have been a lot more careful reading of the science textbooks in my class, and most others2) there would have been a lot more juvenile humor3) most people would have learned a lot more science, and4) the textbooks would no doubt have been banned within a yearSo, unfortunately, we do not have science textbooks written by Mary Roach, for junior high or any other grade. However, we do have books written by Mary Roach, and maybe I should say this one is more about the technology and history of space travel than really the science, but in any case it is awesome. Oddly, both my wife and I liked it, and we don't share a lot in common in our bookish tastes. I think she may be more partial to scatological content than I am. If you're into scatological content, by the way, this is your book (unless, you know, you want _that_ kind of scatological content, in which case no, this is mostly about space travel).We have been sending people into space for over half a century now, and perhaps more importantly for this book, thinking about and preparing to send people into space. It turns out, this is a big deal, and not just the part about making rockets.It turns out, for example, that gravity is extraordinarily useful. Without it, stuff gets lost a lot, and when it does, you have no idea where to look, because it could be anywhere. Crunchy food is unacceptable, because crumbs don't fall, so they get everywhere. Taking a shower is difficult, because water droplets don't fall. Also, a lot of things about how the body eliminates waste, depend upon gravity to work properly.In fact, a recurring theme of this book, is that space travel is really a lot less exciting and a lot more gross than either Russia or the U.S. wants to talk about very much. Roach goes to Russia to speak with a number of cosmonauts about bathrooms, bickering, alcohol, sex, and all the other things that NASA had to think about, in order to see what is inevitable and what could be dealt with differently depending on the culture. It turns out that being a cosmonaut, astronaut, or any other kind of space traveler is in large part about discovering that a lot of simple matters on earth become complicated. It is no exaggeration to say that bathroom design was as much of an obstacle to women in space in the early days, as sexism (although both certainly played a part). It is also no exaggeration to say that bathroom design for the men was way more complex than on earth.I read this book a chapter or two at a time, in the morning at the coffeeshop. My daughter would hear me laughing, and look over at me expectantly. 2 times out of 3, it would be something I couldn't tell her about, because she was eating.But, it's not all scatological. There's also sex, and the closely related topic of arguments. People in very enclosed spaces, for long periods of time, interact in a lot of ways. It's not necessarily always discussed with the general public.Or with NASA (or the Russian equivalent). A repeating theme throughout the book is that, whether it's depression or space sickness (equivalent of seasickness, but from zero gravity) or arguments or anything else that makes you less than perfect, the people who go up into space were normally unwilling to admit to any of it to their bosses down on Earth, for fear that it would prevent them from being picked for the next mission. It was part of Mary Roach's job, helped no doubt by the passage of time, to get people to discuss more openly a lot of what did NOT get discussed previously.And, also, a lot of gross stuff. Seriously, there is a lot of discussion of vomit. But, it is Mary Roach's rare talent to be able to write about topics which we would normally (most of us, anyway) shy away from, and make it funny and informative at the same time. This book is no exception."
240,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"When you think about space travel and exploration, nobody ever thinks about the poop bags. This book was interesting and eye-opening about a lot of the mundane minutiae of going into space, made (slightly) less mundane by Mary Roach's writing about it, but what really interested me was all of the ways that gravity allows us to live - and what happens to us when gravity is taken out of the equation. This book covers pretty much everything from physiological results of high G pressures and impacts, to floating poops to bone density changes. I'm sure she would have included a kitchen sink... except that in space, the water would just coalesce into a bubble and mess up the equipment. I didn't find this book quite as funny as I've found Roach in the past, but could just be personal preference. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for space farts. I'll show myself out."
241,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I have an awkward relationship with Mary Roach. I find her humor forced, blatant, and poorly timed and so it always falls flat to me. I realize that a lot of people really appreciate her humor, but it just doesn’t click for me. Actually, I bet I think she was really funny if I heard her talk, because potty humor IS my type of humor, but it just doesn’t seem to translate for me in her books.That said, she researches these absolutely fascinating topics from angles that no one else would, and I totally appreciate that. I mean, really, she is willing to throw her energy and time into researching the history of pooping in space. INQUIRING MINDS REALLY DO WANT TO KNOW. If I had to tell anyone to listen to one chapter from this book it would totally be Chapter 14- the poop chapter. It is hilarious in its own right, poop literally floating around during Apollo missions, and she shies away from nothing. How could you not want to know?If there is anything I learned in this book (and actually I learned A LOT so props to the author) its that astronauts have spent a lot of time living like filthy animals for science, and we are ALL better for it.If you are looking for something a little strange, informative, and easily translatable to fodder for all sorts of awkward holiday-party small-talk then I really suggest this book."
242,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,4,"This was my first time (finally) reading Mary Roach, and gosh but this was a great place to start, with a topic right up my alley. I love the everyday details and considerations of space travel and the unique weirdnesses of zero-gravity life!!! In that way, Packing for Mars pairs really well with Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. This reading was also well-timed: I visited Houston's NASA Space Center while reading it, and some of the videos on-display there exhibit the sheer giddy silly joy of astronauts hopping around on the moon -- not exactly the dignified, no-nonsense image that we tend to have of astronauts and which tends to go out in the PR materials.Similarly, Roach is a PR department's nightmare as she doggedly delves into the day-to-day considerations of space, no matter how unsavoury or inglorious: food and defecation and loss of bone density, the effects of extended solitude, the bizarre scientific experiments done in an attempt to prepare for the almost-inconceivable. It's occasionally laugh-out-loud funny; nonfiction written in a really light, engaging, accessible tone that I don't think sacrifices its scientific merit at all.It also manages to capture how touching and strange and awe-inspiring it all is, the lengths and sacrifices that we've made to go to space, the thrill and the importance of mankind's curiosity and problem-solving. Really looking forward to reading more from her.To the rocket scientist, you are a problem. You are the most irritating piece of machinery he or she will ever have to deal with. You and your fluctuating metabolism, your puny memory, your frame that comes in a million different configurations. You are unpredictable. You're inconstant. You take weeks to fix. The engineer must worry about the water and oxygen and food you'll need in space, about how much extra fuel it will take to launch your shrimp cocktail and irradiated beef tacos. A solar cell or a thruster nozzle is stable and undemanding. It does not excrete or panic or fall in love with the mission commander. It has no ego. Its structural elements don't start to break down without gravity, and it works just fine without sleep.To me, you are the best thing to happen to rocket science. The human being is the machine that makes the whole endeavor so endlessly intriguing."
243,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46311769-katie-long,5,"Roach brings her inimitable informative irreverence into outer space this time. More specifically to the details, and often indignities, of humans in space. Ever wondered if astronauts get motion sick, have sex in space, or are ever jealous of monkeys? Mary Roach did, and found some very serious people to answer her questions. Her questions are often hilarious, but they are never irrelevant."
244,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Wow! An excellent piece of very readable research of our journey into space & all the considerations for a trip to Mars in, hopefully, 2030. As usual, Roach captured the human side & presented it with plenty of humor.The research had to be difficult for her in many cases. NASA needs publicity to stay funded, but any negative publicity can hurt them immensely, especially since Congress & the VP oversee them. (LBJ basically squashed any females in space for years with a pen stroke.) Considering how divisive our attitudes are on so many subjects, especially taboo ones, it's no wonder that NASA regulates what information goes out with an iron hand. For instance, they once spent a lot of time & money in an effort to give the astronauts a night cap - just a bit of sherry to finish off the day. It all went to waste because news leaked out & a letter writing campaign by a bunch of teetotalers caused too much negative publicity. There are many taboo subjects that come up in relation to space flight & living in zero gee. Two biggies are sex & elimination. As Roach showed so well in her previous book, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, amazingly little is known about sex. NASA, the organization that can write entire books about the seemingly simplest things, ignores the subject. Unfortunately, it's a negative sum game for them. Any research they do into it will cause waves they can't afford. Still, she managed to pry a bit of info out of some, but not much.Elimination took up several chapters & it's not because she's hung up on it, but because it is such a necessary, time consuming & messy business. It's also tied closely to what is eaten & what can be eaten on a long trip when every ounce has to be closely watched & personal odors have a huge impact on morale. It's an amazingly complex feat to deal with a simple stool. At one time, they actually used cameras to record the process & then destroyed the films to avoid bad publicity. Now researchers could really use that data again.How strange & complex the simplest thing becomes when under intense public scrutiny & done without gravity! A lot of what we think we know turns out to be wrong. Even the urge to pee isn't present in zero gee until the bursting point - literally a point at which the urethra could be constricted by the bladder, so urination has to be scheduled to avoid problems.There are more exhaustive books on the subject & many of them are in her bibliography, but I doubt there is a more readable introduction to the complexity of what faces NASA as they prepare for the Mars mission, a culmination of every space effort to date. She did a great job & I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. "
245,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"Mary Roach has made quite a career writing quirky, irreverent books on some of the weirder corners of science. She's covered corpses, the afterlife, sex, and now space. So all the cool subjects. As it turns out, space exploration is a rich and varied subject. Every aspect of life in space has to be carefully, exhaustively researched beforehand, after all. Right down to, ahem, elimination procedures. In the hands of another writer, all of this detail might become overwhelming, or boring, maybe kind of gross, depending on the chapter. But as with her other books, Roach writes with such an infectious delight at what she's learned that I was completely riveted. Sure, I have more than a passing interest in the space program, and that probably helped. One of my friends is even more interested than I am, and this just might end up under her Christmas tree this year."
246,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"Very interesting book about space. Going to the bathroom in space, eating in space, bone deteriorating in space. As always, Roach is funny and informative."
247,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"This book is funny, gross, and fascinating, and I am SO not suited to be an astronaut! If YOU want to be an astronaut, you’d better have a strong stomach and a big tolerance for grossness in general. I had NO IDEA a book about travel in space would read like a scene from a Judd Apatow movie, but it turns out human waste of many varieties is a big issue for NASA. Mary Roach tells us about how space agencies try to prepare astronauts for space travel, and study how the trainees react, and she goes into the details of the history of space travel so far, in the detail that rarely gets reported in regular history books. And she wangles her way onto the Vomit Comet, for research purposes, of course!What I learned is that space travel is tricky for living organisms, like people. We’re adapted for conditions on a planet, where there’s gravity, and opportunities to eat delicious, crumby meals, bathe regularly and take care of elimination in privacy and comfort. Here’s a couple of quotes that illustrate the issue:Gravity facilitates what is known in aerospace waste collection circles as “separation.” Fecal popcorning is the reason Space Shuttle toilets are equipped with rearview mirrors.Women would be more efficient astronauts, but they weren’t included in the early programs because NASA didn’t want to figure out the logistics of female urination. In space. I’m not kidding! Humans take a LOT of maintenance. We’re constantly sweating, shedding hair and skin, sneezing, and doing that whole processing food thing. Our bones need gravity to know to stay strong. Doing all that up in space is much, much trickier, and messier than on Earth. Also, people can get weird in the close confines of a noisy, hot little metal container floating in space. We can get surly and difficult, or some of us may experience the rapture of space and want to float off into the cosmos, or something. Maybe. Maybe it’s just the oxygen mix in those suits.Mary Roach also researches the careers of animals in space (I’ll never forgive Russia for what they did to Laika. Never.), crash impacts on bodies (which reminded me of her first book, Stiff), and sex in space, which isn’t as sexy as it sounds. The focus has been on the impact of no gravity on reproduction, not on, um, logistics. And according to NASA, no one has yet to join the Zero-G club. Not officially, anyways. Well, okay, there were some rats, but that was an experiment. Recommended to everyone who wants to know what the “right stuff” really is. "
248,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"India’s first Mars mission, scheduled for Nov 2014 will cost LESS than the budget of the space film Gravity.After having finished this book I had to read that above statement a few times for it to really sink in. Either space travel has gotten vastly cheaper or Hollywood has finally gone nuts.This book covers everything a layperson would ever want to know about space travel and a host of things you would have preferred not to know. No longer does bravery and a guts n glory attitude maketh an astronaut. Now the ability to follow orders, emotional neutrality and a range of other (very boring) personality traits now make for excellent astronauts.The first part of the book focused on how candidates get tested and selected based on their psychological and physiological responses to a wide range of very absurd tests. If any child with the dream of becoming an astronaut read this book we will have a complete shortage of willing candidates very soon.From the impact of gravity on our internal organs, motion sickness, technical malfunctions, early animal experiments and even the impact of space travel on bone density, all showed just how fragile us humans really are.I have always loved this author’s books as she mixes humor and facts in such a way that entertain and informs the reader at the same time. However in this book it sometimes felt that she was trying a tad too hard with the funny quips (that quickly became not so funny). My solution was to read this over an extended period of time and not all in one go and this worked well to lessen my irritation with the feeling of forced humor.Like her other books the overly ""sciency"" stuff becomes understandable and is absolutely crammed with facts that you would not necessarily find in official NASA reports. Things like the development of self-cleaning underwear to negate needing a bath in space, how space food and space toilets evolved (not nearly enough is the answer).This book was not in the same league as my beloved Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers however it did satisfy my almost insatiable need for trivia facts.Mary Roach is basically the female equivalent of A J Jacobs and if you enjoy his books you will surely love hers."

It's just a matter of adapting to a space suit and a weightless environment. While we have people like Elon Musk enthusiastic about space travel, my biggest personal antagonism about the idea has always related to elimination during space travel, and the fact that any vehicle must end up smelling like a sewer.Gotta be very careful about disposing of human waste in space - Newton's third law applies...This is where Star Trek's transporter technology could be quite useful. A mini-transporter in the groin area of the suit would do the job painlessly and efficiently."

I didn't like some of the comments it suppose to be funny but somehow I found it more of heavy. (it can be audio book's narration style)and another thing is that she is going out of topic some times, and some parts were really boring to me.O right it is a bit old as well, I read it part of a book club."
251,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904933-chris,2,"A decent book with interesting details about space sciences and the biology of human spaceflight. However, the author felt compelled to display her snarky, adolescent humor and go off on tangents on subjects that she must have felt were funny, but which is merely unnecessary gossip and/or gross little anecdotes. It seemed obvious that she was probably jealous of the scientists and astronauts whom she interviewed, failed to understand the pragmatic and hard-headed approach that engineers and scientists must take to accomplish goals, and had to include embarrassing little tidbits about the space sciences and the people who work in that industry. A bit pathetic, and the end of the book did not close the gap between the sour effect of the first 95% of the book, and the barely aspirational closer. Unsure who the intended reader of this book is, besides sniggering adolescents."
252,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter,4,"I generally quite enjoy Mary Roach's books, even though sometimes they are too much information to be read while eating. (Stiff) So when I saw this one, about one of my favourite things in the world, space travel, I was excited. Even more so since I'm running a roleplaying game set on Mars right now, although much further along than the first tentative preparations Roach is talking about here.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

253,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5583595-anna-bananas,3,"Sooo, it only took me a few years to finish this. I tend to stall out on her books and then get back to them. A book about space and everything associated with it was a fascinating idea and for the most part she does a good job of opening up that world for you. Her humor, which I enjoyed very much in Stiff, is sometimes a bit much now. There are a lot of asides and footnotes that don’t necessarily add to the story and just show that she had fun doing the research. I find it more distracting than amusing at this point, after reading four of her books. And yet, I will read more. I love how thoroughly she tackles her topics, exploring all the aspects and angles. I learned about parabolic flight and its uses, how we’re preparing for possible manned Mars missions, the ingredients of space food, how we...poop in space, how our organs and bodies react to gravity - and to the lack of it, the psychology of living in space isolated with other humans, the history of space travel. There’s a lot here and most of it fascinating. My level of enthusiasm waxed and waned, hence the lower rating, but I would still recommend this. It’s an experience and I always value that.Pre-read ranting: My head is stuck in space right now, between reading Dark Space and watching Elysium today and then mulling over my favorite claustrophobic space movies - Event Horizon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien movies, Sunshine (my favorite). Can optimism and joy not survive the vacuum of space or something? They just disappear with the screams?Moving on, Mary Roach makes science both fascinating and hilarious. I'm so excited to read this! I don't know if anything can beat Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers but I'll keep an open mind. Theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7wtsJ...This reminds me of the astronaut story from The Illustrated Man and how the father of the family was more in love with space than with his family."
254,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael,4,"Science fiction movies and novels dealing with long exploration missions to deep space rarely deal with the complexities of our bodies surviving during the long journey through space.Or as the old question asks, ""Where does Captain Kirk go to the bathroom?""Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" not only looks at where Kirk would go, but how such a thing would be possible. It also looks at a lot of other questions that scientists and NASA have to and have addressed during humanity's quest to explore space. From the earliest days of space travel when we wondered if gravity would be required for our internal organs and systems to continue working properly to the affects of long-term weightlessness on our muscle systems, Roach delves into the question of just how will our bodies survive or work during a long voyage to Mars. (Roach even deals with the question of whether its possible or reasonable to have sex in zero g, even watching an adult film that was allegedly shot in zero g). All in all, the book is a fascinating one. Roach maintains a fine line between presenting the facts and having a sense of humor about things. She deals with a lot of bodily functions, but all of these are necessary to consider in whether or not its possible to send humans to Mars or on a long trip into outer space. While we've all thought about how humans would eat in space and use the bathroom, we've probably thought less about how hygiene can and would work in outer space. Will the space ships end up smelling like a locker room or worse? Also delved into are the on-going studies into motion sickness and the inherent dangers faced if you lose your cookies in a space suit. Roach's approach is a solid one with each aspect presented in an understandable, entertaining fashion. What could easily have been a dry subject is instead presented in a fascinating, readable way that will give you a new respect for the men and women who've gone into outer space in the past and those who will head out into the solar system and beyond in our future (hopefully). "
255,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869511-adam,2,"The title of this book is misleading. It doesn't really delve into the plans or obstacles for a manned mission to Mars, but is more of an overview of the history of the world's space programs (mostly U.S.) to date and some background on the human issues that don't readily come to mind when thinking of the challenges of space for humans(food, hygiene, waste management, psychology, physiological effects of zero gravity on humans, etc.)The book rambled a bit from topic to topic (a few pure tangents as well) without much cohesion tying them back to Mars. This is the first Mary Roach book I have read and while the subject matter of her other books seems interesting, I'm not sure I will read another. You know when someone tries to be funny and there's that awkward silence when they fail? Mary Roach writes that way. A lot. It seems like every paragraph there's at least two attempts at humor and I'd guestimate the overall success rate of eliciting a smile or chuckle at about 10% - it got to be too much for me by the halfway point of the book. The funniest moments are actually quotes by other people.Overall most of the topics covered in the book were interesting, the presentation just didn't do it for me."
256,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20773991-holly,4,"This was honestly really interesting, and probably as good (if not better) than Roach's other book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, which I read probably a year back.Roach combines factual information and fun story telling in a great way, that makes these books immensely readable and fun. I've avoided science non-fiction for a long time, mainly because I didn't think I was smart enough per say, but Mary Roach has really introduced me to the realms of popular science and the world of scientific non-fiction.I have Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War on my to read list, and I will undoubtedly read it at some point. But I'll definitely keep my eye out for more popular science books that pique my interest"
257,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,4,"This engagingly readable book tackles the subject of man's exploration of near-space--specifically, the difficult and sometimes messy task of protecting humans as they explore the void of space. At times a history text, at times cutting-edge, it covers a lot of topics in a fun and interesting way. Roach's voice is clear and witty, sometimes biting, other times self-mocking, but always kept my interest. Unfortunately, the book isn't so much about the title as it is about the subtitle, and I would have liked more about the current state of space exploration as it applies to Mars missions. (""Current"" being 2010, when the book was published; I don't ding it for not being written in 2017.) But I enjoyed it immensely, and appreciated the extensive end notes/bibliography, which gave me some ideas for further reading. I will definitely pick up more of Roach's work."

260,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Mary Roach now has a lock on a certain kind of book. Science is her beat, and her shtick is to make it funny — often hilariously funny. But be forewarned: her take on “funny” means she is going to violate any taboo that gets in the way of making you cringe and groan at the same time you laugh.In her first book, 
Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife
, she did the topic as funny-but-creepy, and hadn’t yet glommed on to her now-predictable gross-out brand of humor. That came in brilliantly with her second book, 
Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers
. Now you could get science done as hilarious and creepy and gross!She dropped the creepy and replaced it with mildly titillating in her third (and still my favorite), 
Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex
. But definitely still hilarious and gross.In 
Packing for Mars
, she’s tightened her focus. No more creepy, no more titillating, just funny in that juvenile way of hers. She asks the questions that any “mature” adults would never dare ask, and then begs for the juicy details. I’m sure many of the people she interviews are non-plussed at how to respond; those that don't know her previous work probably think she’s a kook. She appears to be okay with that.As usual, much of her funniest asides come in the form of footnotes. Here’s one, from the chapter on NASA’s research on how to best, er, replicate what toilets do in the absence of gravity. It turns out that NASA has saved the “output” of astronauts for years...Astronaut specimens from the Skylab and Apollo eras are still around, in freezers on the top floor of a windowless high-security building at Houston's Johnson Space Center—the one that houses NASA's collection of (non-biological) moon rocks. “I’m not sure what our inventory of excreta from Apollo is right now,” John Charles told me. “Forty years of freezing, with occasional thaws due to power outages during hurricanes, may have reduced them to mere vestiges of their former glory.” They were there as of 1996, because planetary biologist Ralph Harvey stumbled onto them when he got lost taking a group of VIPs on a tour. “Back then all the doors opened to the same code,” he recalls. “I opened this one door and it was almost like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There were these rows of long, low freezers. They all had a little light on them that’s blinking, and a temperature readout, and a piece of tape with the astronaut’s name. I’m like, Shit, they stored the astronauts in there! and I quickly got the people out. I found out later that was where they stored the astronaut feces and urine.” Harvey can’t recall the room number. “You have to stumble onto it, that’s the only way you can find it. It’s like Narnia.”                 •       •       •See the review at the New York Times: Astral Bodies (August 6, 2010).

261,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Packing for Mars is like Bonk, Stiff and Spook (her three previous books) but in space. Awesome! Everything is better in space. And hilariously entertaining.I have a huge author crush on Mary Roach. She isn't embarrassed by any subject. (I know this for a fact, I got to ask her at her book reading.) She won't pass up a Howdy Doody joke when discussing the difficulties in pooing in zero-G. She also scammed a free copy of zero-G porn movie series and watching it to 'research' zero-G sex. She asks all the probing, detail oriented questions that 99% of us would never even think of. And yet, once we know the questions, we are fascinated by the answers. She uncovers the slightly embarrassing marginalia of the space race.Mary Roach does it so we don't have to!Now for just a few interesting and funny bits I learned while reading Packing for Mars.I had no clue that defecating in zero-G presents with a whole host of complications, many of which only become apparent while in space. NASA and other space agencies have spent a lot of time and money researching ways to not just make a space toilet comfortable and private, but just to merely work.
""A successful zero-gravity toilet is a subtle finessing of engineering, materials science, physiology, psychology, and etiquette. ...If just one element is missing, things don't come out right.""
If I ever hear about the cost of developing a space toilet, I will not flinch an inch. This is important work.Here's another fun random space-based factoid for you: ""The contract for the Apollo lunar landing suits went to International Latex, which later became Playtex."" As in bras. Roach mentions earlier that when NASA needed to develop a space suit, they had no experience in rubberized materials, so they went to a huge bra & underwear manufacturer who sold through the Sears catalogue.This fact is a little more serious (by that I mean less squicky) than the poo/bra stuff above. Did you know that moon dust is incredibly abrasive? Since there's no wind, there's no erosion smoothing the rough corners. Moon dust quickly scratches lenses and helmet visors. To make matters worse, the dust is bombarded with cosmic particles which being impart a charge to the dust. Not only is it sharp, it also sticks to absolutely everything. Get this: there are companies that exist just to produce faux moon dust for NASA.Finally, one last poo joke, because I can't resist. Did you know the opposite of ingest is egest? As in: to reduce the amount of egesta, you must ingest low-residue foods. Here's Roach's goofy footnote to this: 
""Egesta is my new favorite euphemism for 'feces,' and an even better toilet brand name than Ejecto. Certainly better than Toto. Who names a toilet after a lapdog? Unless it's Shit-Tzu. I'd buy a Shit-Tsu toilet.""
 Me too, Mary. Perhaps a footnote generated after sharing too much vodka with the cosmonauts?This book is extremely amusing and wicked entertaining. And I love Mary Roach. I hope she keeps digging up the marginalia of the world.____________PS: Make sure you watch the book trailer - I think it's linked at right on this page. Normally I hate those things, but this one is genuinely funny.PPS: Mary signed my book ""Spacily yours, Mary Roach"" *swoon*"

Mary Roach takes an irreverent look at space travel, and answers all your questions about sex and pooping in space. Actually, she only speculates about the sex -- NASA and the astronauts remain mum on the subject. But while Roach has an informal, sometimes juvenile style (this book is meant to be entertaining, and isn't exactly science journalism), she does research a lot of subjects in exhaustive detail that you've probably always wondered about but didn't think it was appropriate to ask. Problems like elimination in space and hygiene and what to do when you're space-sick may seem funny here on Earth, but they're dead serious concerns that NASA has spent millions of dollars researching (in sometimes bizarre ways). Packing for Mars is full of a million interesting, bizarre, and sometimes disgusting factoids about life in a space capsule. It may make you yearn for a manned Mars mission, but it won't make you envy the astronauts who actually fly it."

This book was published ten years ago and it has aged a bit due to the advancements in space exploration. I have read newer books about space travel that I felt were more interesting with more in-depth information on the space training process. This was more was more anecdoctal than informative with sections on sex, pooping and animal astraunauts. Yet, this was still an enjoyable book to read, especially for someone like myself that doesn’t read a lot of non fiction.

Should be five stars but I rarely give 5 stars so it is kind of 4.48 stars.Mary kept us well-engaged in this space travel journey and while she may not packed us suitably for Mars, she did an excellent job to stimulate our interests further into everything related to Space Travel, whether the basic things that we take for granted (the way we eat, the things we eat, the logistics of walking, dressing, showering, peeing, or from all things, defecating!) or the more challenging parts of it, psychically, socially and, of course, psychologically (think of being alone somewhere in the moon, some 400,000 km away from earth looking at it with a bulky spacesuit and wondering whether you will return back home to have the much-awaited dinner (fish & chips?) with family and kids). Well done, Mary. I mean, seriously, even my 7-year kid liked the incidents that happened and written about in the book. Well, how about sleeping in space? In what activities time is spent for astronauts? Are they just sitting idle in their spacecraft (just sleeping & eating, like we do over the skies in a plane), awaiting to reach their destination? How about women? Are they better fit for the role? Why were they not considered in the earlier space journeys? Patriarchism the culpable as usual?Let's not forget the animals (monkeys and dogs) who ventured into the space and making some history in their way.Wait. How does it smell inside a space capsule? Must be nice I guess or at least something decent to let you endure all the time outside the world. But, wait. It seems it doesn't. Oh no. Please no."
267,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"I’ve been fascinated with space since I was a kid. Space travel has always been a fantasy of mine even though I knew it’s not something I’d ever do even when I was a kid. When I picked up this book, I expected to learn about space travel and some of the expectations, plans, and problems with a potential future mission to Mars. What I got was so much more. Mary Roach had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Her book not only covers the history of space travel and the logistics, but all the hilarious things that is rarely talked about, like pooping at zero gravity.I learned so much from Roach. Everything from space flight testing to zero gravity training is there, but also the psychological worries, experiments, taboos, and the testing that goes on in and out of space. There’s so much history here that was never even hinted at when the first Moon landing was covered in high school history.This book is a treasure. It’s honestly one of the most fascinating books that I’ve ever read. There are seemingly obvious topics thoroughly covered, like the difficultly behind showering at zero gravity and how something as simple as a fuse doesn’t work the same in space thanks to, you guessed it: gravity. Mary also has a wonderful writing style and I like her personality. She took what could’ve been some very dry topics and made them interesting to read about. I highly recommend this book and I’ll be checking out her other works."
268,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"In Mary Roach’s usual style, she takes a humourous look at NASA and space travel in this one, looking at some of the things that most of us just don’t think about when it comes to travelling in zero-gravity. She looks at using the “toilet”, eating, sex, throwing up, hygiene, and more. This did, of course, include some history of space travel, as well. I hadn’t even realized when I started reading it a few days ago that the 50th anniversary of the walk on the moon was yesterday, while I was in the middle reading this – good timing for me! In the first chapter, it was interesting to read about how they made the flag “fly” (with no gravity!) on the moon, and also how to even pack it to bring with them, with the limited space available. There was one real transcript of three astronauts having a discussion when one of them noticed a “turd” flying in the air – omg, I couldn’t stop laughing and crying reading that transcript! Kept me from continuing to read for at least 5 minutes, if not more!! This, and “Stiff” are my favourites of the ones I’ve read by her so far."
269,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Mary Roach is the sort of person who actually ought to be writing science textbooks for junior high. If she had:1) there would have been a lot more careful reading of the science textbooks in my class, and most others2) there would have been a lot more juvenile humor3) most people would have learned a lot more science, and4) the textbooks would no doubt have been banned within a yearSo, unfortunately, we do not have science textbooks written by Mary Roach, for junior high or any other grade. However, we do have books written by Mary Roach, and maybe I should say this one is more about the technology and history of space travel than really the science, but in any case it is awesome. Oddly, both my wife and I liked it, and we don't share a lot in common in our bookish tastes. I think she may be more partial to scatological content than I am. If you're into scatological content, by the way, this is your book (unless, you know, you want _that_ kind of scatological content, in which case no, this is mostly about space travel).We have been sending people into space for over half a century now, and perhaps more importantly for this book, thinking about and preparing to send people into space. It turns out, this is a big deal, and not just the part about making rockets.It turns out, for example, that gravity is extraordinarily useful. Without it, stuff gets lost a lot, and when it does, you have no idea where to look, because it could be anywhere. Crunchy food is unacceptable, because crumbs don't fall, so they get everywhere. Taking a shower is difficult, because water droplets don't fall. Also, a lot of things about how the body eliminates waste, depend upon gravity to work properly.In fact, a recurring theme of this book, is that space travel is really a lot less exciting and a lot more gross than either Russia or the U.S. wants to talk about very much. Roach goes to Russia to speak with a number of cosmonauts about bathrooms, bickering, alcohol, sex, and all the other things that NASA had to think about, in order to see what is inevitable and what could be dealt with differently depending on the culture. It turns out that being a cosmonaut, astronaut, or any other kind of space traveler is in large part about discovering that a lot of simple matters on earth become complicated. It is no exaggeration to say that bathroom design was as much of an obstacle to women in space in the early days, as sexism (although both certainly played a part). It is also no exaggeration to say that bathroom design for the men was way more complex than on earth.I read this book a chapter or two at a time, in the morning at the coffeeshop. My daughter would hear me laughing, and look over at me expectantly. 2 times out of 3, it would be something I couldn't tell her about, because she was eating.But, it's not all scatological. There's also sex, and the closely related topic of arguments. People in very enclosed spaces, for long periods of time, interact in a lot of ways. It's not necessarily always discussed with the general public.Or with NASA (or the Russian equivalent). A repeating theme throughout the book is that, whether it's depression or space sickness (equivalent of seasickness, but from zero gravity) or arguments or anything else that makes you less than perfect, the people who go up into space were normally unwilling to admit to any of it to their bosses down on Earth, for fear that it would prevent them from being picked for the next mission. It was part of Mary Roach's job, helped no doubt by the passage of time, to get people to discuss more openly a lot of what did NOT get discussed previously.And, also, a lot of gross stuff. Seriously, there is a lot of discussion of vomit. But, it is Mary Roach's rare talent to be able to write about topics which we would normally (most of us, anyway) shy away from, and make it funny and informative at the same time. This book is no exception."
270,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"When you think about space travel and exploration, nobody ever thinks about the poop bags. This book was interesting and eye-opening about a lot of the mundane minutiae of going into space, made (slightly) less mundane by Mary Roach's writing about it, but what really interested me was all of the ways that gravity allows us to live - and what happens to us when gravity is taken out of the equation. This book covers pretty much everything from physiological results of high G pressures and impacts, to floating poops to bone density changes. I'm sure she would have included a kitchen sink... except that in space, the water would just coalesce into a bubble and mess up the equipment. I didn't find this book quite as funny as I've found Roach in the past, but could just be personal preference. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for space farts. I'll show myself out."
271,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,4,"I have an awkward relationship with Mary Roach. I find her humor forced, blatant, and poorly timed and so it always falls flat to me. I realize that a lot of people really appreciate her humor, but it just doesn’t click for me. Actually, I bet I think she was really funny if I heard her talk, because potty humor IS my type of humor, but it just doesn’t seem to translate for me in her books.That said, she researches these absolutely fascinating topics from angles that no one else would, and I totally appreciate that. I mean, really, she is willing to throw her energy and time into researching the history of pooping in space. INQUIRING MINDS REALLY DO WANT TO KNOW. If I had to tell anyone to listen to one chapter from this book it would totally be Chapter 14- the poop chapter. It is hilarious in its own right, poop literally floating around during Apollo missions, and she shies away from nothing. How could you not want to know?If there is anything I learned in this book (and actually I learned A LOT so props to the author) its that astronauts have spent a lot of time living like filthy animals for science, and we are ALL better for it.If you are looking for something a little strange, informative, and easily translatable to fodder for all sorts of awkward holiday-party small-talk then I really suggest this book."
272,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,4,"This was my first time (finally) reading Mary Roach, and gosh but this was a great place to start, with a topic right up my alley. I love the everyday details and considerations of space travel and the unique weirdnesses of zero-gravity life!!! In that way, Packing for Mars pairs really well with Chris Hadfield's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. This reading was also well-timed: I visited Houston's NASA Space Center while reading it, and some of the videos on-display there exhibit the sheer giddy silly joy of astronauts hopping around on the moon -- not exactly the dignified, no-nonsense image that we tend to have of astronauts and which tends to go out in the PR materials.Similarly, Roach is a PR department's nightmare as she doggedly delves into the day-to-day considerations of space, no matter how unsavoury or inglorious: food and defecation and loss of bone density, the effects of extended solitude, the bizarre scientific experiments done in an attempt to prepare for the almost-inconceivable. It's occasionally laugh-out-loud funny; nonfiction written in a really light, engaging, accessible tone that I don't think sacrifices its scientific merit at all.It also manages to capture how touching and strange and awe-inspiring it all is, the lengths and sacrifices that we've made to go to space, the thrill and the importance of mankind's curiosity and problem-solving. Really looking forward to reading more from her.To the rocket scientist, you are a problem. You are the most irritating piece of machinery he or she will ever have to deal with. You and your fluctuating metabolism, your puny memory, your frame that comes in a million different configurations. You are unpredictable. You're inconstant. You take weeks to fix. The engineer must worry about the water and oxygen and food you'll need in space, about how much extra fuel it will take to launch your shrimp cocktail and irradiated beef tacos. A solar cell or a thruster nozzle is stable and undemanding. It does not excrete or panic or fall in love with the mission commander. It has no ego. Its structural elements don't start to break down without gravity, and it works just fine without sleep.To me, you are the best thing to happen to rocket science. The human being is the machine that makes the whole endeavor so endlessly intriguing."
273,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46311769-katie-long,5,"Roach brings her inimitable informative irreverence into outer space this time. More specifically to the details, and often indignities, of humans in space. Ever wondered if astronauts get motion sick, have sex in space, or are ever jealous of monkeys? Mary Roach did, and found some very serious people to answer her questions. Her questions are often hilarious, but they are never irrelevant."
274,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Wow! An excellent piece of very readable research of our journey into space & all the considerations for a trip to Mars in, hopefully, 2030. As usual, Roach captured the human side & presented it with plenty of humor.The research had to be difficult for her in many cases. NASA needs publicity to stay funded, but any negative publicity can hurt them immensely, especially since Congress & the VP oversee them. (LBJ basically squashed any females in space for years with a pen stroke.) Considering how divisive our attitudes are on so many subjects, especially taboo ones, it's no wonder that NASA regulates what information goes out with an iron hand. For instance, they once spent a lot of time & money in an effort to give the astronauts a night cap - just a bit of sherry to finish off the day. It all went to waste because news leaked out & a letter writing campaign by a bunch of teetotalers caused too much negative publicity. There are many taboo subjects that come up in relation to space flight & living in zero gee. Two biggies are sex & elimination. As Roach showed so well in her previous book, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, amazingly little is known about sex. NASA, the organization that can write entire books about the seemingly simplest things, ignores the subject. Unfortunately, it's a negative sum game for them. Any research they do into it will cause waves they can't afford. Still, she managed to pry a bit of info out of some, but not much.Elimination took up several chapters & it's not because she's hung up on it, but because it is such a necessary, time consuming & messy business. It's also tied closely to what is eaten & what can be eaten on a long trip when every ounce has to be closely watched & personal odors have a huge impact on morale. It's an amazingly complex feat to deal with a simple stool. At one time, they actually used cameras to record the process & then destroyed the films to avoid bad publicity. Now researchers could really use that data again.How strange & complex the simplest thing becomes when under intense public scrutiny & done without gravity! A lot of what we think we know turns out to be wrong. Even the urge to pee isn't present in zero gee until the bursting point - literally a point at which the urethra could be constricted by the bladder, so urination has to be scheduled to avoid problems.There are more exhaustive books on the subject & many of them are in her bibliography, but I doubt there is a more readable introduction to the complexity of what faces NASA as they prepare for the Mars mission, a culmination of every space effort to date. She did a great job & I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. "
275,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"Mary Roach has made quite a career writing quirky, irreverent books on some of the weirder corners of science. She's covered corpses, the afterlife, sex, and now space. So all the cool subjects. As it turns out, space exploration is a rich and varied subject. Every aspect of life in space has to be carefully, exhaustively researched beforehand, after all. Right down to, ahem, elimination procedures. In the hands of another writer, all of this detail might become overwhelming, or boring, maybe kind of gross, depending on the chapter. But as with her other books, Roach writes with such an infectious delight at what she's learned that I was completely riveted. Sure, I have more than a passing interest in the space program, and that probably helped. One of my friends is even more interested than I am, and this just might end up under her Christmas tree this year."
276,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"Very interesting book about space. Going to the bathroom in space, eating in space, bone deteriorating in space. As always, Roach is funny and informative."
277,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,4,"This book is funny, gross, and fascinating, and I am SO not suited to be an astronaut! If YOU want to be an astronaut, you’d better have a strong stomach and a big tolerance for grossness in general. I had NO IDEA a book about travel in space would read like a scene from a Judd Apatow movie, but it turns out human waste of many varieties is a big issue for NASA. Mary Roach tells us about how space agencies try to prepare astronauts for space travel, and study how the trainees react, and she goes into the details of the history of space travel so far, in the detail that rarely gets reported in regular history books. And she wangles her way onto the Vomit Comet, for research purposes, of course!What I learned is that space travel is tricky for living organisms, like people. We’re adapted for conditions on a planet, where there’s gravity, and opportunities to eat delicious, crumby meals, bathe regularly and take care of elimination in privacy and comfort. Here’s a couple of quotes that illustrate the issue:Gravity facilitates what is known in aerospace waste collection circles as “separation.” Fecal popcorning is the reason Space Shuttle toilets are equipped with rearview mirrors.Women would be more efficient astronauts, but they weren’t included in the early programs because NASA didn’t want to figure out the logistics of female urination. In space. I’m not kidding! Humans take a LOT of maintenance. We’re constantly sweating, shedding hair and skin, sneezing, and doing that whole processing food thing. Our bones need gravity to know to stay strong. Doing all that up in space is much, much trickier, and messier than on Earth. Also, people can get weird in the close confines of a noisy, hot little metal container floating in space. We can get surly and difficult, or some of us may experience the rapture of space and want to float off into the cosmos, or something. Maybe. Maybe it’s just the oxygen mix in those suits.Mary Roach also researches the careers of animals in space (I’ll never forgive Russia for what they did to Laika. Never.), crash impacts on bodies (which reminded me of her first book, Stiff), and sex in space, which isn’t as sexy as it sounds. The focus has been on the impact of no gravity on reproduction, not on, um, logistics. And according to NASA, no one has yet to join the Zero-G club. Not officially, anyways. Well, okay, there were some rats, but that was an experiment. Recommended to everyone who wants to know what the “right stuff” really is. "
278,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"India’s first Mars mission, scheduled for Nov 2014 will cost LESS than the budget of the space film Gravity.After having finished this book I had to read that above statement a few times for it to really sink in. Either space travel has gotten vastly cheaper or Hollywood has finally gone nuts.This book covers everything a layperson would ever want to know about space travel and a host of things you would have preferred not to know. No longer does bravery and a guts n glory attitude maketh an astronaut. Now the ability to follow orders, emotional neutrality and a range of other (very boring) personality traits now make for excellent astronauts.The first part of the book focused on how candidates get tested and selected based on their psychological and physiological responses to a wide range of very absurd tests. If any child with the dream of becoming an astronaut read this book we will have a complete shortage of willing candidates very soon.From the impact of gravity on our internal organs, motion sickness, technical malfunctions, early animal experiments and even the impact of space travel on bone density, all showed just how fragile us humans really are.I have always loved this author’s books as she mixes humor and facts in such a way that entertain and informs the reader at the same time. However in this book it sometimes felt that she was trying a tad too hard with the funny quips (that quickly became not so funny). My solution was to read this over an extended period of time and not all in one go and this worked well to lessen my irritation with the feeling of forced humor.Like her other books the overly ""sciency"" stuff becomes understandable and is absolutely crammed with facts that you would not necessarily find in official NASA reports. Things like the development of self-cleaning underwear to negate needing a bath in space, how space food and space toilets evolved (not nearly enough is the answer).This book was not in the same league as my beloved Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers however it did satisfy my almost insatiable need for trivia facts.Mary Roach is basically the female equivalent of A J Jacobs and if you enjoy his books you will surely love hers."

It's just a matter of adapting to a space suit and a weightless environment. While we have people like Elon Musk enthusiastic about space travel, my biggest personal antagonism about the idea has always related to elimination during space travel, and the fact that any vehicle must end up smelling like a sewer.Gotta be very careful about disposing of human waste in space - Newton's third law applies...This is where Star Trek's transporter technology could be quite useful. A mini-transporter in the groin area of the suit would do the job painlessly and efficiently."

I didn't like some of the comments it suppose to be funny but somehow I found it more of heavy.

281,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904933-chris,2,"A decent book with interesting details about space sciences and the biology of human spaceflight. However, the author felt compelled to display her snarky, adolescent humor and go off on tangents on subjects that she must have felt were funny, but which is merely unnecessary gossip and/or gross little anecdotes. It seemed obvious that she was probably jealous of the scientists and astronauts whom she interviewed, failed to understand the pragmatic and hard-headed approach that engineers and scientists must take to accomplish goals, and had to include embarrassing little tidbits about the space sciences and the people who work in that industry. A bit pathetic, and the end of the book did not close the gap between the sour effect of the first 95% of the book, and the barely aspirational closer. Unsure who the intended reader of this book is, besides sniggering adolescents."

(Stiff) So when I saw this one, about one of my favourite things in the world, space travel, I was excited. Even more so since I'm running a roleplaying game set on Mars right now, although much further along than the first tentative preparations Roach is talking about here.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

283,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5583595-anna-bananas,3,"Sooo, it only took me a few years to finish this. I tend to stall out on her books and then get back to them. A book about space and everything associated with it was a fascinating idea and for the most part she does a good job of opening up that world for you. Her humor, which I enjoyed very much in Stiff, is sometimes a bit much now. There are a lot of asides and footnotes that don’t necessarily add to the story and just show that she had fun doing the research. I find it more distracting than amusing at this point, after reading four of her books. And yet, I will read more. I love how thoroughly she tackles her topics, exploring all the aspects and angles. I learned about parabolic flight and its uses, how we’re preparing for possible manned Mars missions, the ingredients of space food, how we...poop in space, how our organs and bodies react to gravity - and to the lack of it, the psychology of living in space isolated with other humans, the history of space travel. There’s a lot here and most of it fascinating. My level of enthusiasm waxed and waned, hence the lower rating, but I would still recommend this. It’s an experience and I always value that.Pre-read ranting: My head is stuck in space right now, between reading Dark Space and watching Elysium today and then mulling over my favorite claustrophobic space movies - Event Horizon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien movies, Sunshine (my favorite). Can optimism and joy not survive the vacuum of space or something? They just disappear with the screams?Moving on, Mary Roach makes science both fascinating and hilarious. I'm so excited to read this! I don't know if anything can beat Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers but I'll keep an open mind. Theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7wtsJ...This reminds me of the astronaut story from The Illustrated Man and how the father of the family was more in love with space than with his family."
284,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael,4,"Science fiction movies and novels dealing with long exploration missions to deep space rarely deal with the complexities of our bodies surviving during the long journey through space.Or as the old question asks, ""Where does Captain Kirk go to the bathroom?""Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" not only looks at where Kirk would go, but how such a thing would be possible. It also looks at a lot of other questions that scientists and NASA have to and have addressed during humanity's quest to explore space. From the earliest days of space travel when we wondered if gravity would be required for our internal organs and systems to continue working properly to the affects of long-term weightlessness on our muscle systems, Roach delves into the question of just how will our bodies survive or work during a long voyage to Mars. (Roach even deals with the question of whether its possible or reasonable to have sex in zero g, even watching an adult film that was allegedly shot in zero g). All in all, the book is a fascinating one. Roach maintains a fine line between presenting the facts and having a sense of humor about things. She deals with a lot of bodily functions, but all of these are necessary to consider in whether or not its possible to send humans to Mars or on a long trip into outer space. While we've all thought about how humans would eat in space and use the bathroom, we've probably thought less about how hygiene can and would work in outer space. Will the space ships end up smelling like a locker room or worse? Also delved into are the on-going studies into motion sickness and the inherent dangers faced if you lose your cookies in a space suit. Roach's approach is a solid one with each aspect presented in an understandable, entertaining fashion. What could easily have been a dry subject is instead presented in a fascinating, readable way that will give you a new respect for the men and women who've gone into outer space in the past and those who will head out into the solar system and beyond in our future (hopefully). "
285,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869511-adam,2,"The title of this book is misleading. It doesn't really delve into the plans or obstacles for a manned mission to Mars, but is more of an overview of the history of the world's space programs (mostly U.S.) to date and some background on the human issues that don't readily come to mind when thinking of the challenges of space for humans(food, hygiene, waste management, psychology, physiological effects of zero gravity on humans, etc.)The book rambled a bit from topic to topic (a few pure tangents as well) without much cohesion tying them back to Mars. This is the first Mary Roach book I have read and while the subject matter of her other books seems interesting, I'm not sure I will read another. You know when someone tries to be funny and there's that awkward silence when they fail? Mary Roach writes that way. A lot. It seems like every paragraph there's at least two attempts at humor and I'd guestimate the overall success rate of eliciting a smile or chuckle at about 10% - it got to be too much for me by the halfway point of the book. The funniest moments are actually quotes by other people.Overall most of the topics covered in the book were interesting, the presentation just didn't do it for me."
286,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20773991-holly,4,"This was honestly really interesting, and probably as good (if not better) than Roach's other book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, which I read probably a year back.Roach combines factual information and fun story telling in a great way, that makes these books immensely readable and fun. I've avoided science non-fiction for a long time, mainly because I didn't think I was smart enough per say, but Mary Roach has really introduced me to the realms of popular science and the world of scientific non-fiction.I have Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War on my to read list, and I will undoubtedly read it at some point. But I'll definitely keep my eye out for more popular science books that pique my interest"
287,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane,4,"This engagingly readable book tackles the subject of man's exploration of near-space--specifically, the difficult and sometimes messy task of protecting humans as they explore the void of space. At times a history text, at times cutting-edge, it covers a lot of topics in a fun and interesting way. Roach's voice is clear and witty, sometimes biting, other times self-mocking, but always kept my interest. Unfortunately, the book isn't so much about the title as it is about the subtitle, and I would have liked more about the current state of space exploration as it applies to Mars missions. (""Current"" being 2010, when the book was published; I don't ding it for not being written in 2017.) But I enjoyed it immensely, and appreciated the extensive end notes/bibliography, which gave me some ideas for further reading. I will definitely pick up more of Roach's work."

I gave it three stars in general and four stars for making me laugh out loud several times while reading the chapter on Space toilets. Mary Roach has a highly irreverent approach to science that I really enjoy. 
290,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"Mary Roach now has a lock on a certain kind of book. Science is her beat, and her shtick is to make it funny — often hilariously funny. But be forewarned: her take on “funny” means she is going to violate any taboo that gets in the way of making you cringe and groan at the same time you laugh.In her first book, 
Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife
, she did the topic as funny-but-creepy, and hadn’t yet glommed on to her now-predictable gross-out brand of humor. That came in brilliantly with her second book, 
Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers
. Now you could get science done as hilarious and creepy and gross!She dropped the creepy and replaced it with mildly titillating in her third (and still my favorite), 
Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex
. But definitely still hilarious and gross.In 
Packing for Mars
, she’s tightened her focus. No more creepy, no more titillating, just funny in that juvenile way of hers. She asks the questions that any “mature” adults would never dare ask, and then begs for the juicy details. I’m sure many of the people she interviews are non-plussed at how to respond; those that don't know her previous work probably think she’s a kook. She appears to be okay with that.As usual, much of her funniest asides come in the form of footnotes. Here’s one, from the chapter on NASA’s research on how to best, er, replicate what toilets do in the absence of gravity. It turns out that NASA has saved the “output” of astronauts for years...Astronaut specimens from the Skylab and Apollo eras are still around, in freezers on the top floor of a windowless high-security building at Houston's Johnson Space Center—the one that houses NASA's collection of (non-biological) moon rocks. “I’m not sure what our inventory of excreta from Apollo is right now,” John Charles told me. “Forty years of freezing, with occasional thaws due to power outages during hurricanes, may have reduced them to mere vestiges of their former glory.” They were there as of 1996, because planetary biologist Ralph Harvey stumbled onto them when he got lost taking a group of VIPs on a tour. “Back then all the doors opened to the same code,” he recalls. “I opened this one door and it was almost like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There were these rows of long, low freezers. They all had a little light on them that’s blinking, and a temperature readout, and a piece of tape with the astronaut’s name. I’m like, Shit, they stored the astronauts in there! and I quickly got the people out. I found out later that was where they stored the astronaut feces and urine.” Harvey can’t recall the room number. “You have to stumble onto it, that’s the only way you can find it. It’s like Narnia.”                 •       •       •See the review at the New York Times: Astral Bodies (August 6, 2010).

291,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Packing for Mars is like Bonk, Stiff and Spook (her three previous books) but in space. Awesome! Everything is better in space. And hilariously entertaining.I have a huge author crush on Mary Roach. She isn't embarrassed by any subject. (I know this for a fact, I got to ask her at her book reading.) She won't pass up a Howdy Doody joke when discussing the difficulties in pooing in zero-G. She also scammed a free copy of zero-G porn movie series and watching it to 'research' zero-G sex. She asks all the probing, detail oriented questions that 99% of us would never even think of. And yet, once we know the questions, we are fascinated by the answers. She uncovers the slightly embarrassing marginalia of the space race.Mary Roach does it so we don't have to!Now for just a few interesting and funny bits I learned while reading Packing for Mars.I had no clue that defecating in zero-G presents with a whole host of complications, many of which only become apparent while in space. NASA and other space agencies have spent a lot of time and money researching ways to not just make a space toilet comfortable and private, but just to merely work.
""A successful zero-gravity toilet is a subtle finessing of engineering, materials science, physiology, psychology, and etiquette. ...If just one element is missing, things don't come out right.""
If I ever hear about the cost of developing a space toilet, I will not flinch an inch. This is important work.Here's another fun random space-based factoid for you: ""The contract for the Apollo lunar landing suits went to International Latex, which later became Playtex."" As in bras. Roach mentions earlier that when NASA needed to develop a space suit, they had no experience in rubberized materials, so they went to a huge bra & underwear manufacturer who sold through the Sears catalogue.This fact is a little more serious (by that I mean less squicky) than the poo/bra stuff above. Did you know that moon dust is incredibly abrasive? Since there's no wind, there's no erosion smoothing the rough corners. Moon dust quickly scratches lenses and helmet visors. To make matters worse, the dust is bombarded with cosmic particles which being impart a charge to the dust. Not only is it sharp, it also sticks to absolutely everything. Get this: there are companies that exist just to produce faux moon dust for NASA.Finally, one last poo joke, because I can't resist. Did you know the opposite of ingest is egest? As in: to reduce the amount of egesta, you must ingest low-residue foods. Here's Roach's goofy footnote to this: 
""Egesta is my new favorite euphemism for 'feces,' and an even better toilet brand name than Ejecto. Certainly better than Toto. Who names a toilet after a lapdog? Unless it's Shit-Tzu. I'd buy a Shit-Tsu toilet.""
 Me too, Mary. Perhaps a footnote generated after sharing too much vodka with the cosmonauts?This book is extremely amusing and wicked entertaining. And I love Mary Roach. I hope she keeps digging up the marginalia of the world.____________PS: Make sure you watch the book trailer - I think it's linked at right on this page. Normally I hate those things, but this one is genuinely funny.PPS: Mary signed my book ""Spacily yours, Mary Roach"" *swoon*"

293,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"You never knew astronauts had it so hard. Mary Roach takes an irreverent look at space travel, and answers all your questions about sex and pooping in space. Actually, she only speculates about the sex -- NASA and the astronauts remain mum on the subject. But while Roach has an informal, sometimes juvenile style (this book is meant to be entertaining, and isn't exactly science journalism), she does research a lot of subjects in exhaustive detail that you've probably always wondered about but didn't think it was appropriate to ask. Problems like elimination in space and hygiene and what to do when you're space-sick may seem funny here on Earth, but they're dead serious concerns that NASA has spent millions of dollars researching (in sometimes bizarre ways). Packing for Mars is full of a million interesting, bizarre, and sometimes disgusting factoids about life in a space capsule. It may make you yearn for a manned Mars mission, but it won't make you envy the astronauts who actually fly it."
294,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7487619-rachel-theshadesoforange,3,"3.5 StarsThis was an interesting piece of non-fiction that focused on the physical challenges that humans face when going into space. This book was published ten years ago and it has aged a bit due to the advancements in space exploration. I have read newer books about space travel that I felt were more interesting with more in-depth information on the space training process. This was more was more anecdoctal than informative with sections on sex, pooping and animal astraunauts. Yet, this was still an enjoyable book to read, especially for someone like myself that doesn’t read a lot of non fiction. Roach has a wonderfully, humorous narrative style that makes the information very digestible to read."
295,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,5,"Well this is a part of the space program that no one talked about... fascinating and some times gross, but always funny. "
296,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12086858-yousif-al-zeera,4,"Entertaining and exciting right from the beginning till the end of it. Should be five stars but I rarely give 5 stars so it is kind of 4.48 stars.Mary kept us well-engaged in this space travel journey and while she may not packed us suitably for Mars, she did an excellent job to stimulate our interests further into everything related to Space Travel, whether the basic things that we take for granted (the way we eat, the things we eat, the logistics of walking, dressing, showering, peeing, or from all things, defecating!) or the more challenging parts of it, psychically, socially and, of course, psychologically (think of being alone somewhere in the moon, some 400,000 km away from earth looking at it with a bulky spacesuit and wondering whether you will return back home to have the much-awaited dinner (fish & chips?) with family and kids). Well done, Mary. I mean, seriously, even my 7-year kid liked the incidents that happened and written about in the book. Well, how about sleeping in space? In what activities time is spent for astronauts? Are they just sitting idle in their spacecraft (just sleeping & eating, like we do over the skies in a plane), awaiting to reach their destination? How about women? Are they better fit for the role? Why were they not considered in the earlier space journeys? Patriarchism the culpable as usual?Let's not forget the animals (monkeys and dogs) who ventured into the space and making some history in their way.Wait. How does it smell inside a space capsule? Must be nice I guess or at least something decent to let you endure all the time outside the world. But, wait. It seems it doesn't. Oh no. Please no."
297,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"I’ve been fascinated with space since I was a kid. Space travel has always been a fantasy of mine even though I knew it’s not something I’d ever do even when I was a kid. When I picked up this book, I expected to learn about space travel and some of the expectations, plans, and problems with a potential future mission to Mars. What I got was so much more. Mary Roach had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Her book not only covers the history of space travel and the logistics, but all the hilarious things that is rarely talked about, like pooping at zero gravity.I learned so much from Roach. Everything from space flight testing to zero gravity training is there, but also the psychological worries, experiments, taboos, and the testing that goes on in and out of space. There’s so much history here that was never even hinted at when the first Moon landing was covered in high school history.This book is a treasure. It’s honestly one of the most fascinating books that I’ve ever read. There are seemingly obvious topics thoroughly covered, like the difficultly behind showering at zero gravity and how something as simple as a fuse doesn’t work the same in space thanks to, you guessed it: gravity. Mary also has a wonderful writing style and I like her personality. She took what could’ve been some very dry topics and made them interesting to read about. I highly recommend this book and I’ll be checking out her other works."
298,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"In Mary Roach’s usual style, she takes a humourous look at NASA and space travel in this one, looking at some of the things that most of us just don’t think about when it comes to travelling in zero-gravity. She looks at using the “toilet”, eating, sex, throwing up, hygiene, and more. This did, of course, include some history of space travel, as well. I hadn’t even realized when I started reading it a few days ago that the 50th anniversary of the walk on the moon was yesterday, while I was in the middle reading this – good timing for me! In the first chapter, it was interesting to read about how they made the flag “fly” (with no gravity!) on the moon, and also how to even pack it to bring with them, with the limited space available. There was one real transcript of three astronauts having a discussion when one of them noticed a “turd” flying in the air – omg, I couldn’t stop laughing and crying reading that transcript! Kept me from continuing to read for at least 5 minutes, if not more!! This, and “Stiff” are my favourites of the ones I’ve read by her so far."
299,0393339912,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Mary Roach is the sort of person who actually ought to be writing science textbooks for junior high. If she had:1) there would have been a lot more careful reading of the science textbooks in my class, and most others2) there would have been a lot more juvenile humor3) most people would have learned a lot more science, and4) the textbooks would no doubt have been banned within a yearSo, unfortunately, we do not have science textbooks written by Mary Roach, for junior high or any other grade. However, we do have books written by Mary Roach, and maybe I should say this one is more about the technology and history of space travel than really the science, but in any case it is awesome. Oddly, both my wife and I liked it, and we don't share a lot in common in our bookish tastes. I think she may be more partial to scatological content than I am. If you're into scatological content, by the way, this is your book (unless, you know, you want _that_ kind of scatological content, in which case no, this is mostly about space travel).We have been sending people into space for over half a century now, and perhaps more importantly for this book, thinking about and preparing to send people into space. It turns out, this is a big deal, and not just the part about making rockets.It turns out, for example, that gravity is extraordinarily useful. Without it, stuff gets lost a lot, and when it does, you have no idea where to look, because it could be anywhere. Crunchy food is unacceptable, because crumbs don't fall, so they get everywhere. Taking a shower is difficult, because water droplets don't fall. Also, a lot of things about how the body eliminates waste, depend upon gravity to work properly.In fact, a recurring theme of this book, is that space travel is really a lot less exciting and a lot more gross than either Russia or the U.S. wants to talk about very much. Roach goes to Russia to speak with a number of cosmonauts about bathrooms, bickering, alcohol, sex, and all the other things that NASA had to think about, in order to see what is inevitable and what could be dealt with differently depending on the culture. It turns out that being a cosmonaut, astronaut, or any other kind of space traveler is in large part about discovering that a lot of simple matters on earth become complicated. It is no exaggeration to say that bathroom design was as much of an obstacle to women in space in the early days, as sexism (although both certainly played a part). It is also no exaggeration to say that bathroom design for the men was way more complex than on earth.I read this book a chapter or two at a time, in the morning at the coffeeshop. My daughter would hear me laughing, and look over at me expectantly. 2 times out of 3, it would be something I couldn't tell her about, because she was eating.But, it's not all scatological. There's also sex, and the closely related topic of arguments. People in very enclosed spaces, for long periods of time, interact in a lot of ways. It's not necessarily always discussed with the general public.Or with NASA (or the Russian equivalent). A repeating theme throughout the book is that, whether it's depression or space sickness (equivalent of seasickness, but from zero gravity) or arguments or anything else that makes you less than perfect, the people who go up into space were normally unwilling to admit to any of it to their bosses down on Earth, for fear that it would prevent them from being picked for the next mission. It was part of Mary Roach's job, helped no doubt by the passage of time, to get people to discuss more openly a lot of what did NOT get discussed previously.And, also, a lot of gross stuff. Seriously, there is a lot of discussion of vomit. But, it is Mary Roach's rare talent to be able to write about topics which we would normally (most of us, anyway) shy away from, and make it funny and informative at the same time. This book is no exception."
