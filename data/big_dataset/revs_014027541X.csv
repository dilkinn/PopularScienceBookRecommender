0,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"In 1619, Johannes Kepler, a theoretical astronomer who earned the greater part of his income from casting horoscopes, published the Harmonices Mundi, the ""Harmony of the World"". It contained a statement of the Third Law, relating the period of a planet's rotation around the sun to the radius of its orbit; this was the fruit of years of diligent work, and a first-order scientific breakthrough. The book also contained hundreds of pages of the most ridiculous pseudo-scientific nonsense, where Kepler used the shapes of the regular geometric solids to explain the distances of the various planets from the Sun. He later considered the notes of the musical scale and inferred the heavenly harmonies produced by the celestial choir. The serious-minded Laplace, writing his brief history of astronomy a couple of centuries later, is shocked. How could someone as smart as Kepler do this? What was he thinking?If things work out well for David Deutsch, it's possible that an as yet unborn historian will write similar things about him in the twenty-third century. Some parts of his modestly-titled The Fabric of Reality are interesting and insightful. In particular, he makes a rather good case for the reality of the quantum multiverse, which already seems to have had a considerable effect: I didn't realize it at the time, but I've seen him quoted more than once. Deutsch's presentation combines themes from two of his heroes, Hugh Everett (the inventor of the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics) and Karl Popper. Deutsch starts by asking, with Popper, about the nature of the scientific process. He claims that it is primarily about using evidence-based argument to weigh the merits of rival explanations; the best scientific theory is the one that is currently winning the arguments. He persuasively suggests that, on these reasonable-sounding criteria, Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation is in fact the best way to think about quantum mechanics. In particular, it is by far the most intuitive way to think about quantum computers, a subject where Deutsch has played a pioneering role. If you are at all interested in these matters, I strongly recommend reading his clear, lucid exposition. And then... oh dear. From its logical, eminently sane beginnings, the book gradually descends into more and more bizarre territory. Deutsch introduces his eccentric personal take on the Church-Turing thesis, and uses it to derive all manner of odd consequences. He tells us that everyone who has ever worked on the philosophy of mathematics has got it wrong: mathematical proof is part of the physical world, and thus essentially bound by the laws of physics. He spends thirty pages discussing time-travel, and concludes that it is perfectly feasible in the quantum multiverse. In the last chapter, he throws aside all his inhibitions and outlines an extended fantasy, based on the work of Frank Tipler, which forecasts the future evolution of the cosmos. Intelligent life, we read, will inevitably learn to control first the Sun, then the galaxy, then the whole universe. As we head for the Big Crunch, the future civilization will take control of the gigantic gravitational energies released to create a godlike cosmic consciousness. This will exponentially slow down time, so that our distant descendents will subjectively never die, living forever in the final moments of the universal collapse. All of this, if I understood correctly, is mandated by the extended Turing Principle: the results, startling as they seem, just follow from the laws of physics. The only thing that's not quite clear is whether the godlike future being will resurrect the dead and put them in a Heaven-like environment. Tipler, a Christian, thinks it will, but Deutsch is inclined to disagree.It must have been disappointing when dark energy was discovered the year after, implying that there wouldn't be a Big Crunch after all. But Deutsch doesn't come across as the kind of guy who sits around and mopes over his setbacks. My guess is that his new theory is even better, and when he and Kepler are resurrected together some time in the infinite future I'm sure they'll have no end of fun comparing notes."

Specifically, the concept of something complicated being created as opposed to evolved. Of course, consciousness has evolved and is a characteristic of the complex arrangement of entities whose properties are understood by physics. But, going from the basic laws governing the building blocks to the complex is currently way beyond anything dreamt of in systems theory, where biological simulation is hovering around the simple swim patterns of single celled flagellum bacteria. Before attempting to build something we try and understand it. That is, what aspects of the thing to focus on. What are the essentials?"

3,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,1,"I've been blowing through books lately, and it may be because I am at present too summer-shallow and absorbed by theater books to give works like this the necessary patience. So thank all the Neil Simon currently burning up space on my night table, and take this review for what it's worth.I went into this on the strength of recommendations that had me expecting something like Michio Kaku's Physics of the Impossible, but found instead a ponderous mess that left me in full-bore skim mode after only the second chapter. Deutsch came across to me as patronizing and intolerant of those who do not share his views (which, he confesses, are most scientists and writers). He dismisses his colleagues as hopelessly reductionist (wanting to reduce all observable phenomena to the behavior of elementary particles) or positivist (wanting to bother only with theories that can be used to predict observable phenomena), complaining persuasively that such philosophies fail to explain our world in a way that can be rearticulated without access to a blackboard.So far so good. Like any philosopher worth his publishing salt, he Humpty Dumpties a lot of terminology to suit his own purpose, and so ""Theory of Everything"" changes from meaning the grand unification of relativity and quantum theory (allowing observable phenomena to be described by a single maths of electromagnetic-gravity or some such) to a one-sentence explanation that ties together quantum theory, parallel universes, epistemology, and evolution.Deutsch's explanation of interference patterns in light is done without recourse to wave theory (the word does not appear in the index and probably does not exist in the book, not even for purposes of theoretical rejection); his exegesis of quantum theory is all about individual light particles -- photons and their shadow counterparts. The latter exist only to create interference and an infinitude of parallel universes, identical in all respects to ours but for the photon that passes or fails to pass through a given experimental filter. All this is well and good, but Deutsch never bothers to explain why such a worldview -- which, having earlier decried such definitions as pseudoscience unworthy of our consideration, he allows to be unobservable and undocumentable -- is worth bothering with.Worse, having ridiculed as worthless the opinions of those who would describe planetary movement as resulting from angelic exertions (how then to describe the angels' motivations?), he goes on to glibly speculate that in other universes yet unseen other versions of him are writing the same words more elegantly, writing on another subject entirely, or perhaps not writing at all but instead getting a cup of tea. Never once does he explain how the horribly complicated chain of interfering photons and shadow photons across all of these imagined parallel universes might impact our observable world. Or how we could observe it if they did. Or why such a nonexplanation represents an improvement on the angel idea?The rest of the book is all of a piece with this. I don't mind trying to believe 6 unbelievable things before breakfast, but I do demand along the way that my mysterians demonstrate either internal consistency or a bit of humility. Deutsch offers neither."
4,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,"The beginning of this book was really fascinating and got me thinking, but then the last half was really hard to get through because he got bogged down in super scientific details that I just didn't care about. I think the book is probably outdated at this point too because though we aren't closer to a ""theory of everything,"" we have pushed forward on a lot of the theories he discusses in this book."
5,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1930204-axe,5,"This is a weird book to review. There were pages where I was vociferously arguing with a (imaginary) Mr Deutsch, and pages where I was nodding along like in a class room. So a good book in all, perhaps even a great one. Deutsch is at his best when explaining Quantum Theory, and surprisingly good when talking Epistemology. In the former he has some of the clearest expositions I have ever seen, and some very appealing explanations for old chestnuts. In the latter, although he does some convolutions I am not particularly found of, but I will be forever grateful to him for resolving my ambiguous feelings on Popper. To wit, I like most of the worldview that Popper espouses, but I disagree vehemently on certain points. Mr Deutsch has had the novel idea, that 'so what ?'. That most founders of revolutionary theories are standing sans foundations, and will of course make mistakes. I can be a Popperian, without agreeing with all that Popper says. Huzzah !On the other hand, Deutsch's insistence on explanations as a solution for the problem for induction, (and of the role of intuition and self evident truths in mathematics) is problematical. Also inconsistent with some of what Deutsch himself says - namely that he, unlike Penrose, does believe that the human brain is a classical Turing Machine. This despite him pointing out a whole host of such inconsistencies in other viewpoints. Although the author does a fascinating job demolishing inductivists, instrumentalists, and reductionists the argument seems a tad unfair considering that the opposing parties can hardly talk back. This is especially highlighted when he pushes Everett's multiverse worldview. To be fair, he has described several tests to distinguish between the Copenhagen and the MWI interpretations, just not in this book. Then there is the, ahem, pussyfooting, around the Kuhn philosophy on the 'heretic in the scientific orthodoxy'. And of course, Mr Tipler's Omega point, on which I reserve comment. It may sound as if I am complaining a lot for a book I gave five stars to. But that is not the case. A book is not a conversation. At best it is a discourse - and it should be judged as such. This one does what the best lectures do, they make the audience go back and talk about them. Or in my case, write about it."
6,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,3,"This is David Deutsch's plea to the scientific world to tear down the separation between theory and their own worldviews and truly own the picture of reality that modern physics has painted for us. He begs that we take our theories seriously as fundamental paradigms and not set them aside as interesting little quirks of Nature. In particular, he makes a solid case for embracing the ""many-worlds"" interpretation of quantum mechanics (given my greenness on this subject, I'm reserving judgment until further notice).His central idea, however, is a draft of an approach to a theory of everything that melds quantum theory, the theory of evolution, epistemology, and the theory of computation.As for quantum theory, this was book provides one of the best popular introductions to quantum theory and quantum computation that I've seen. Certain ideas (such as the concept of parallel computation in the multiverse) only clicked for me after hearing them from Deutsch.As for epistemology, Deutsch commands a knowledge of his contemporary scientific philosophy rivaling that of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein - men who were not afraid to dabble in the ""softer"" science of epistemology. He drives home the mistakes of induction-based scientific philosophies and presents the case for adopting a Popperian philosophy, emphasizing the relative problem-solving efficiency of a theory as criterion for its success. The reading can be a bit rough though if you've never been introduced to Kuhn, Popper, or other scientific philosophers before. I'd highly recommend reading some of their works before picking up Fabric of Reality (I had read some Kuhn but no Popper and wish I had).His introductions to evolution and computation are noble efforts but again, this book is much richer if you have a bit of a background in these subjects. I'd particularly recommend Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene as a prerequisite for Deutsch's discussions.I was extremely intrigued by the seeds of a multiverse theory of knowledge that Deutsch planted as well, something I intend to further explore as I gain more background in quantum theory.Given the radical and rigorous nature of this book's explorations, I found Deutsch's use of chapter summaries and glossaries extremely helpful in structuring my reading. I think this feature is an excellent take-away for any science writer.All things considered however, the fact that this book is not stand-alone and can be confusing at times without the proper background lead me to grant it only three stars."
7,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,2,"I would suggest that my other self, Gary Beauregard Bottomley, in a parallel universe should not waste his time reading this book. It is deceptively misleading. Explanation is not the foundation for reality as the author tries to show. Explanation does not make the transcendental deduction real. Samuel Johnson does not refute the Reverend Berkeley by kicking a rock even if the rock kicks back. Hume’s experiences are not a sufficient foundation in themselves. Kant wisely realizes that both (Berkeley and Hume) are wrong since they make truth dependent on an exclusive foundation of either the mind (scientific anti-realist) or experience (empirical) thus Kant merges the two and creates a transcendental deduction, but the explanation for reality is not the reality itself as the author will say; it is only made whole through the transcendental deduction that is within the faculty of understanding. The measurement problem in physics is real. Feynman said in one of the seven lectures of ‘The Characteristics of Physical Law’ that all the mysteries of physics are contained in the double slit experiment. There is a paradox at the heart of being human. The ‘Laws of Thought’ (see Schopenhauer or Bertrand Russell for further elaboration) break down. The mutually exclusive law doesn’t always work for our best explanation of the world. The author gives a fix to this vexing paradox. The author makes the ontological foundation for reality derived from these four pillars: quantum physics, epistemology, Dawkins/Darwin Evolution, and Turing universal machines. His fix requires a infinity of other universes that are process driven as opposed to event oriented. (Conversely, Bertrand Russell, who is often quoted in this book, believed that all understanding came from experiences of events and when asked about the White Cliffs of Dover replied they were just a slow acting event!). The author appeals to Descartes’ cogito. When one does that, one should remember that Descartes first assumes away an objective world and gets subjective certainty only after having done that (so, of course, if you assume the world outside of yourself away, all that remains is what is within you. Furthermore, see Avicenna’s Floating Man for why that might be a foolish starting point). The author needs subjective/objective in formulating his arguments, because he says in multiple ways that ‘there is an objective truth out there’ and he seems to think that explaining a phenomena makes it objectively real as he’ll say is true for mathematics. Einstein needed ‘hidden variables’ in order to explain quantum physics and assumed away ‘spooky action at a distance’ in order to explain and keep his scientific realism, but today we all know there are no hidden variables and entanglement is real. Hypothesizing infinite universes with processes instead of events will be able to explain entanglement, but perhaps there are other unknown possible explanations waiting to be found, or maybe we just live in simulation and can’t break out. (By no means do I reject the MWI, I just think this author’s justification is flawed overall). Hegel said certainty is within us and truth is outside of us and he will dialectically resolve the paradox allowing for Heidegger to take that by inverting Husserl’s ‘bracketing’ of the world to get his being-in-the-world through present-at-hand, ready-at-hand and being human (Dasein). I mention this because this author doesn’t follow in the method of Hegel or Heidegger; rather he often brackets the world extracting an objective reality within a subjective frame of reference for his conclusions. He’ll also often give false dichotomies such that it’s either the Copenhagen Interpretation or his Hugh Everett III MWI, or it’s either Popper or Kuhn that are our choices. Sometimes the world doesn’t need to be binary for our potential reasonable options (hence my Kant reference in the first paragraph). The author has a scientific realism with progress underlying his world view. I think it’s possible to say that science sometimes replaces what came before it in such a way that we can justifiably say that we were wrong previously (phlogiston is Kuhn’s example). For example, at one time F=ma was considered tautologically true by Mach and most others, but Einstein changes that completely (acceleration needs a relativistic correction), and the very concept of Force (or mass, or acceleration) is different after Einstein then it was before thus changing almost everything in our understanding of the physical world. Our concept of the Sun changed because we finally had a better new way (not a best way, but definitely a different way) to explain how the Sun could be older than the earth because we could say fusion kept it hot and gravitationally balanced. How we understand the Sun changed with Einstein from how we understood the Sun with Newton. We use the same word ‘Sun’, but everything we understood about it was redefined with different implications and understanding. It was no longer a fiery ball of hot gas, but it was a controlled nuclear fusion helium producing entity with a whole lot of quantum tunneling transpiring. The author will show that his explanation for the double slit experiment by invoking parallel universes explains free will within humans. That’s actually a non insignificant part of the book and it is a big part of his argument. Augustine gives the Christian West its concept of free will, and he said that it is the power within humans that was analogous to the power that God Himself had which allowed him to freely (but not necessarily since for Augustine God is all powerful and nothing can make an all powerful being do something necessarily) create the universe. My only real way I understand ‘free will’ is by hypothesizing a God who judges by sending some to hell and others to heaven and wonder how that God would make His decision. My gut tells me an all knowing, all good, all wise God would never send someone to hell because He (She, or It) would always know that but for the Grace of God there would go each individual and the free will that we possessed was just an illusion because time, chance and circumstances created the person and his actions through a long series of cause and effect steps. (BTW, Schopenhauer in Volume I and Volume II of his ‘Will and Representation’ ends each volume with saying it is through God’s Grace alone that we thrive because Schopenhauer’s deterministic philosophy doesn’t allow for people to control their own destiny and I actually tend to agree with that with or without a multi-verse to ‘explain’ free will and reality as a whole). Free will in a human relates to whether a machine can think. The author will say that in order for us to know if a machine is thinking we will have to understand (explain) how it is thinking and we will know that through using his multi-verse paradigm. I would say that even within myself let alone others who may or may not be a machine, the closest I can get at is ‘I want what I desire, but I don’t desire what I desire’ and I’m never able to see into the heart or head of anyone (even myself) and the most I ever get to see is their actions or hear their words and interpolate through a kind of transcendental deductivism. This author’s speculation on quantum computers from the 1998 perspective is fascinating. Quantum computers are real today, but they were speculative at the time of this book. When the author talked about quantum computers or Turing is when he was at his best. Otherwise, I think most of this book was not worth while today and was heavy handed in its presentation and lacked philosophical rigor. Though, I did not know anything about Frank Tipler and his Omega Point philosophy and I want to learn more. Contrary to this book, I think Reason (with a capital ‘R’) is a fictional label we use to fabricate explanations for our understanding of reality. The author makes Reason through our explaining reality integral for his ontological system. I know a lot of what I wrote above won’t be understood and I wrote things in short hand such that I’m fairly certain if Gary Beauregard Bottomley (GBB) gets to read this review in a parallel universe he’ll understand fully what the real GBB meant and probably would just skip this book and read Tipler’s book instead."
8,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"The nicest thing I can say about this book is that Deutsch offers his own ""novel"" opinions philosophy of science. Unfortunately he's reached those opinions by collecting logical fallacies like a hoarder collects old newspapers. He's basically a crank, having worked largely in isolation for decades, who thinks he's got a grand new theory that's underappreciated by academics.Straw ManHis favorite logical fallacy to employ is the Straw Man. He has Plato's Dialogues style arguments with a fictional ""Inductivist"" who does a piss-poor job at countering his poor philosophy of science.Special PleadingHis second favorite is special pleading with a side of good old fashioned denial. He simply denies the validity of other interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (QM) besides the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI). He doesn't give sufficient description of other interpretations or their strengths. For example, he's a particle chauvinist, refusing to acknowledge that quantum fields ""real"" and thereby dismissing all interpretations that require quantum fields (all of them except MWI) to be fully realist theories. He counts up evidence consistent with QM and calls it proof of MWI, all while failing to mention the obvious fact that these lines of evidence point equally to all other interpretations of QM. He does this, smugly, over and over, like a child sharing fantasy make believe, all excited because he thinks the adults in the room are actually buying it.Category ErrorAnother fallacy he falls prey to is the category error. For example, he thinks that we can infer from the Turing Principle that there will be an Omega Point at the end of time. It takes a lot to explain why this is wrong in detail, but suffice it to say he's got the arrow of inference backwards. He mistakenly promoted the Turing Principle from a descriptive idea into a prescriptive law.ContradictionHis arguments often contradict well-established science, and even one another. For example, he's got this theory of time as an order we impose on separate snapshots. The snapshots are just ""out there"" and we sort them in an order from which time and the laws of physics emerge. It's a neat idea, if you're high on drugs, but we know this is false because of General Relativity. Later in the same chapter he ""predicts"" time travel is possible but you go to the future/past, but in a parallel universe. But this contradicts his idea of snapshots wherein causality emerges from the interrelationship of snapshots. Because there's so vanishingly few snapshots that look like someone from the future in another universe popping into existence, it's as good as forbidden by his own rules! And can't be caused to happen by any ""casual"" means, because it doesn't obey the laws of QM.EquivocationHe picks a fight with Weinberg over Instrumentalism [see page 129]. Here Weinberg is saying that, given dual interpretations of the same underlying theory, we can be instrumentalist about choosing which interpretation to use. Deutsch argues that explanatory power of theories matter so we shouldn't feel so free to select any dual interpretation. He wants us to pick one with the most explanatory power, not the most instrumental potential. But here he's equivocating between how we know if a theory is true (explanatory power matters more than instrumental potential) and which interpretation of a well-supported theory to use (instrumental potential matters more than explanatory power).This last one may be subtle, but this is his main trick for shutting down ALL COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS of quantum mechanics! That's the core thesis of his book!And it's one big logical fallacy."
9,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4401053-phil-scovis,5,"Most popular books on Quantum Mechanics suffer from an apparent need to overawe the reader with the weirdness of it all, stressing the old saw that if you think you understood it then you didn't. It should come as no surprise, then, that the Q-word has become associated with whatever woo-woo philosophy anyone cares to attach to it. I can only think of two books on the subject that treat the reader with the respect due someone who can understand the basic concepts even if the mathematical details are reserved for the elite. The first is ""QED"" by Richard Feynman, in which does an astounding job of introducing the fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics without ever mentioning ""particle-wave duality"". The other is ""The Fabric of Reality"", which addresses the philosophical implications of our most advanced theories. Author David Deutsch's main villain is ""instrumentalism"": the philosophy that the purpose of science is to make predictions while remaining firmly agnostic about the nature or existence of objective reality. Instrumentalism, he believes, has infected QM right from the start, a circumstance which has greatly hampered our understanding, both at the popular and egghead levels. The alternative is to regard our scientific theories as reliable descriptions of reality. Right from the preface, Deutsch laments that it is even necessary to suggest that we consider our scientific theories might be true.Deutsch champions the so-called ""many-worlds interpretation"" of QM, in which the universe is part of a vast multiverse of slightly-interacting other universes. This seems to me to be a radical explosion of the extent of reality, compared with the almost unnoticeable phenomena that required the development of QM theory. To Deutsch, the only alternative is the one which most physicists have taken: that QM is nothing more than a method of calculating and predicting phenomena whose causes are beyond our understanding. The many-worlds interpretation, on the other hand gives us a true picture of reality (and predictive power as a bonus). Deutsch also explores virtual reality, universal computation, and evolution as fundamental to our understanding of reality, calling these and QM the ""four threads"" of our current understanding. Along the way, he takes apart widely believed orthodoxy, and puts forth some heretical theses: Space-time, as popularly imagined, is self-contradictory and false. Mathematics is not justified by logic, but is on a level with physical theories. Science is not based on induction. Fundamental theories need not be reductionistic. Time-travel is not paradoxical. Humans (or more generally, intelligent life) really are the most important thing in universe. And so on. Perhaps surprisingly, Deutsch gives thoughtful consideration to the eschatological theories of Frank Tipler, widely considered to be something of a crank. While Deutsch strongly criticizes some of Tipler's conclusions, he finds the general idea of an unbounded future not only plausible but inevitable. If I may attempt a paraphrase, this is because our theories of reality would be more profound if Tipler's Omega Point actually existed. At this point I balked, realizing that I hadn't quite swallowed Deutsch's main thesis, and I was suddenly aware that I was at heart one of his ridiculous ""crypto-inductivists"".Deutsch has been criticized by other reviewers as being ""arrogant"" in his presentation. I know that brilliance often looks like arrogance, and I am not versed enough in the subject matter to judge the author in this case. I will say this: he says what he believes to be true as if it were true, using no weasel words, and admitting no exceptions. "
10,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131951-carlos-scheidegger,3,"Thought-provoking, but confusing at parts, and over-reaches a bit. The arguments about the importance of explanations are very good, but his attempt to tie together ""the four strands"" (epistemology, evolution, quantum theory and computation) falls fairly short.- Computational complexity issues were simply brushed aside during his arguments about virtual reality - that is a real shame, since efficient simulability could be said to be *the* central issue of computational complexity, and clearly has impact in Deutsch's arguments about the universe's ability to create perfect representations of itself.- His argument about virtual reality, physically possible universes vs logically possible universes, and in particular his ""diagonalization proof"" that not all logically possible universes are physically possible, was sloppy. Diagonalization proofs are pretty delicate, and Deutsch simply failed to argue successfully that it applied in his case.- His understanding of proof theory and the critique of constructivism was bizarre. From the writing, it seems Deutsch misunderstands the role of proof theory withing mathematics. Perhaps a bit ironically, the best description of metamathematics I know of comes from Andrej Bauer, a constructivist himself. From memory, the idea is that Proof theory is simply the branch of mathematics which turns the effectiveness of formal thinking into the process of mathematics itself. Specifically, proof theory does not set out to reduce all mathematics to formal manipulation; that is a strawman interpretation of the process.T book is easily worth the read, but gets 1 point deduction from the issues above, and 1 point from being a bit meandering at parts."
11,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,0,"DID NOT FINISH. I picked this up because Neal Stephenson mentioned in a recent interview that it was the main nonfiction book to inform the details of his newest novel, the virtual-reality morality thriller Fall: Or, Dodge in Hell, and I thought it might be interesting thing to make my way through while waiting for my chance to secure a copy of Stephenson's book. And it's interesting no doubt, an attempt by this admired theoretical physicist to explain to a non-science crowd how it is that we use the theories behind quantum mechanics, computation, evolution and epistemology (i.e. the ""scientific method"") in order to create the most thorough and complex understanding of reality that we as humans can possibly make, which at our present rate is rapidly leading us to the much-ballyhooed ""universal theory of everything"" that will supposedly in the future let us explain each and every detail of the universe through one simple, interconnected concept. But whoo boy, this stuff just threatened with every sentence to go straight over my head; and when, after a week straight of reading for several hours every day, I found myself still barely 20 percent done with the manuscript, and just barely understanding what the hell Deutsch was talking about in the first place, I finally decided to throw in the towel, especially since my copy of Fall is now here. By all means, take on this fascinating but headscratching book if you can think you can handle it; if you manage to finish it, rest assured knowing that you are officially a better person than I. "
12,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71117759-murilo-queiroz,5,"What an amazing, life-changing book! I could recommend it by its very convincing defense of the Everett's Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics alone, or Karl Popper's Epistemology, but it's the synthesis of the four strands mentioned in the book (the other two are Darwin-Dawkins Evolution and Turing's Universal Computation) that makes this a must-read work about Philosophy of Science. A curious anecdote: during a very interesting discussion about the books I read in 2019, in the BBQ after an alumni meetup / research workshop in my alma mater, I mentioned that this year I loved Neal Stephenson's Anathem and Fall, or Dodge in Hell. And I also said that Robert Sapolsky's Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst is one of my favorite books, because of its posture with relation to explanations, and I asked if someone could point me to books about metamodernism. Then someone I just met told me to read The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes--and Its Implications and I confess at the beginning I didn't understand why... But after finishing the book I must agree that it has a lot to do with themes of all these books, which was an amazing surprise."
13,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22608692-adrian-s,5,"The level of semantic complexity is not uniform throughout the 14 chapters of the book, and neither is the balance between the proficiency in Quantum Physics and Computation Theory that is expected of the reader in order to internalize the contents.Having read the book as a Computer Scientist with knowledge of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, my understanding of Deutsch's work is that it is aimed at communicating a multiverse worldview (where ""worldview"" is understood here as a semantic and metaphorical framework for describing our experience of physical reality), in which questions regarding the infinite parallelism inherent in quantum computing can be explained and linguistically reasoned about more comfortably.The first chapters on virtual reality and rendering processes can be thought of as laying an axiomatic foundation which is less semiotically constrained than the empiricist conception of science. Furthermore, an integral part of this foundation is formed by attaching a value system for the phenomenon of explanation which is compatible with evolutionary theory. I was in fact surprised that Deutsch's theory of explanation does not make more references to Kolmogorov complexity.The middle chapters draw parallels between computation theory and the phenomenon of life. However, in contrast with the Darwinian single-[discrete]world interpretation of evolution, Deutsch describes life through the theory of replicators embedded in a (the?) multiverse. I thought that a particular innovation in thinking was his proposed thought-experiment criterion for differentiating between life and non-life.The final chapters explain the [non]existence of time from a multiverse conception of reality, and posit the laws of physics as the source for the deterministic topology in which the snapshots of the universe simultaneously coexist (thus making possible the perception of time and causality).In the end, Deutsch affirms his belief in the ultimate (but incremental) plausibility of unifying theories of reality (especially in the light of Physics as the unifying force), and the continual creation of knowledge as its main driving process - in simplistic and poetic terms, he believes that the universe is the computational effort of physics to understand itself, to build a fixed point of itself if you will.This process is understood and speculated to continue asymptotically towards the end of the universe, though subjected to physical laws we have no mean of imagining.I believe that no matter what your background is, this book will help scratch a few nihilistic (and perhaps spiritual) itches in your psyche. It most certainly reaffirmed some of my continuously-evolving beliefs regarding the nature of life and existence."
14,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023528-vheissu,1,"I must reluctantly conclude that this book simply is not worth the time and effort to read it.I picked it up because of the high regard that Charles Yu afforded it in his wonderful novel, How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe. I highly recommend Yu instead of Deutsch.I admit up front to being a ""positivist"" in the Karl Popper sense, but not to the ""straw man positivist"" of whom Prof. Deutsch is clearly peeved. I'm sorry that mainstream theoretical physicists have not embraced his ""explanation"" for quantum strangeness (infinite parallel universes), but whining and name-calling and misrepresentation surely aren't persuasive tactics.I'm sufficiently open minded to give his ""explanation"" a chance to prove itself, which can only be accomplished by empirical confirmation through reproducible experiments. Had Prof. Deutsch confined himself to such experiments, he might find many more besides myself who are willing to indulge his assertions."
15,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4995129-richard,3,"Ambitious even by the standards of BIG picture pop sci (Hawking, Greene), Deutsch's ""four strands"" view of reality encompasses everything from how evolution might affect the universe as a whole to time travel, the very nature of a ""theory,"" and quantum computing's effects on us. And you have to love a book that begins by describing an experiment that uses a flashlight and three pieces of cardboard to demonstrate that there must be far, far more universes than there are atoms in this one. Lots (and LOTS) to ponder - but Deutsch has a poorer feel than, say, Brian Greene, for what needs explaining more and what needs explaining less. (Examples - The part on why time doesn't flow needed to be clearer and much longer. The part on why inductivism in science is rubbish needed to be clearer and much shorter. The crucial issue of why ""space-time"" physics is not what Deutsch advocated gets totally lost in the shuffle.) As a result some chapters feel like a harangue, and you end them unsure whether to feel either guilty for having not quite followed the thread or annoyed for having not been given quite enough thread to follow. "
16,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"Last year when I compiled my all-time favorite reading list, I included David Deutsch’s The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World. This is a really transformative text I wish more people would find time to read. Deutsch, best known for pioneering the field of quantum computation, is one of those scientists who go beyond the constraints of their own field and search for overarching explanations of foundational questions. For instance, Stephen Hawking was famously looking for a theory of everything. So it happens this is what David Deutsch was after, too, in his 1997 book, The Fabric of Reality. Next is a short review thereof.Standing on the shoulders of giants, namely Karl Popper, Hugh Everett, Alan Turing and Richard Dawkins, Deutsch advocates a particular unified world-view, or a theory of everything, based on the four strands: the quantum physics of the multiverse. Deutsch claims that Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics was the most plausible description of reality. This idea, once stigmatized by the physics establishment, has grown more and more weight and has become popular among prominent physicists (not only Sheldon Cooper). In short, this view implies that there are many, maybe infinitely many, universes “parallel” to the one we see around us. Everything that could possibly have happened in our past, but did not, has occurred in the past of some other universe or universes. Just as we see with particles in quantum physics, these universes can only weakly interact with one another. But who knows, if this view turns out to be true, it gives a whole new potential for things like time travel. In fact, Deutsch dedicated a whole chapter to the topic. According to the author, future-directed time travel is by far the less problematic proposition. Even in everyday life, for example when we sleep and wake up, our subjectively experienced time can be shorter than the external elapsed time. People who recover from comas lasting several years could be said to have travelled that many years into the future, were it not for the fact that their bodies have aged according to external time rather than the time they experienced subjectively.An astronaut who went on a round-trip involving acceleration to speeds close to that of light would experience much less time than an observer who remained on Earth. This effect is known as time dilation. By accelerating enough, one can make the duration of the flight from the astronaut’s point of view as short as one likes, and the duration as measured on Earth as long as one likes. Thus one could travel as far into the future as one likes in a given, subjectively short time. But such a trip to the future is irreversible.Much more interesting is the topic of past-directed time travel. Most physicists believe that it is impossible. Not David Deutsch. He is kind of an agnostic, maybe more than that. He believes it might be possible to travel back in time but not prior to the time when a time machine was constructed. Strand no 2 is Popperian epistemology. He develops this topic further in The Beginning of Infinity, but this is a truly interesting, IMHO, much less controversial proposition. Here he goes against inductivism and positivism. And for good reason.Strand 3 is the Darwin’s theory of evolution. According to Deutsch, it was Dawkins who really put all the parts in place in his books The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker, in particular ideas of replicator and meme, which integrated nicely with Popperian problem-solving. Finally, Deutsch offers his own contribution: a strengthened version of Turing’s theory of universal computation. You will read about virtual-reality generators and the limits of computation, quantum computers and the nature of mathematics.As diverse as these propositions may seem, Deutsch is quite convincing that, if put together, they possess an awesome explanatory potential of the world. I wouldn’t go as far as Deutsch to claim that his unified view is conservative. Anyhow his theory of everything is quite plausible. The many-worlds interpretation is, frankly, the part I struggled the most. But at least we can test this idea on quantum level and maybe one day we will learn more about particle interactions on a grander scale. In fact, it is much harder to test some other hypotheses about cosmological multiverse, i.e. Level I and Level II multiverses (see Max Tegmark’s book Our Mathematical Universe for a detailed discussion of different multiverse ideas), even though they intuitively feel more believable than the strange quantum one. The presumption that the universe will end with a Big Crunch, found in this book, used to be mainstream but now seems less credible. Still the discussion of the omega-point theory and life at the end of the universe was very compelling. According to the author, for life to exist until the end of the universe, it would require the continual creation of new knowledge, which, Popperian epistemology tells us, requires the presence of rational criticism and thus of intelligent entities. David Deutsch writes:“The stabilization procedures, and the accompanying knowledge-creation processes, will all have to be increasingly rapid until, in the final frenzy, an infinite amount of both occur in a finite time. We know of no reason why the physical resources should not be available to do this, but one might wonder why the inhabitants should bother to go to so much trouble. Why should they continue so carefully to steer the gravitational oscillations during, say, the last second of the universe? If you have only one second left to live, why not just sit back and take it easy at last? But of course, that is a misrepresentation of the situation. It could hardly be a bigger misrepresentation. For these people’s minds will be running as computer programs in computers whose physical speed is increasing without limit. Their thoughts will, like ours, be virtual-reality renderings performed by these computers. It is true that at the end of that final second the whole sophisticated mechanism will be destroyed. But we know that the subjective duration of a virtual-reality experience is determined not by the elapsed time, but by the computations that are performed in that time. In an infinite number of computational steps there is time for an infinite number of thoughts — plenty of time for the thinkers to place themselves into any virtual-reality environment they like, and to experience it for however long they like. If they tire of it, they can switch to any other environment, or to any number of other environments they care to design. Subjectively, they will not be at the final stages of their lives but at the very beginning. They will be in no hurry, for subjectively they will live for ever. With one second, or one microsecond, to go, they will still have ‘all the time in the world’ to do more, experience more, create more — infinitely more — than anyone in the multiverse will ever have done before then.”On this optimistic thought, let me end this review. Happy reading!"
17,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13895962-parker,5,"Four Strands of Reality:While complexity of knowledge grows, so does the depth of our knowledge. These four fundamental strands of reality are increasingly intertwined:1. quantum physics (Everette)2. epistemology (Popper)3. universal computation (Turing)4. evolutionary life (Darwin-Dawkins)These explanations, whole each seems narrowly focused at first, when taken together are the most straight forward unified explanation of our reality that we have at this point. While each still has holes in their theory that causes them to be individually ignored and often challenged, the parallels between them are amazingly summed up and combined in the idea of a virtual reality program looping the same 5 minutes over and over, ie time travel.Each strand can be act as someone's world view (ie we're living in a simulation) or be critiqued on its own as naive (ie Hawking's critique of life being the most important strand by saying we're just a remote patch of organic scum ). But to defend them the strands must be viewed together: combined evolutionary life with computation and physics and we have the ability to change the sun (if we want survive the solar system).Notes-----------------------Complexity vs simplicity... As we learn more and more facts it can seem like there is a never ending increase of complexity. But true knowledge is increased not through induction (studying data and learning what predictions we could have made/identifying laws). Instead science is the method where we dream up better explanations that solve more problems (as long as it meets the Popperian criterion that is IS falsifiable). So we develop better explanations our knowledge becomes both broader and deeper. Broadening of facts means specialists are needed to understand any single field of study fully. But problems aren't organized in fields. Problems are explained by the depth of our knowledge. Depth is winning and we are approaching a theory that underlies everything. This means we ultimately will be able to understand reality. How can this be so?There are 4 pillars of our reality that are required to understand the nature of the world and grow knowledge:1. quantum physics (Everette)2. epistemology (Popper)3. computation (Turing)4. evolution (Dawkins)Outside Reality: there is a large class of theories that is are all a variant of solipsism and they can be identified by the way they arbitrarily draw a line ol around what is reality. Around your brain=solipsism), around the Earth=Inquisition, around 4000BC=creationists, outside the material world=heaven, outside the brain=behaviorists, outside of our direct and self evident intuition=mathematics (specifically intuitionists). All these theories say it's just a game outside their piece of reality, and while they solve a specific problem of their author, if you take them seriously they provide no explanation. So is everything reality? No, many things are false.A Criteria for Reality: if something kicks back, but one explanation says this isn't real, then they are requiring additional complexity where a more simple assumption of realism provided better explanation. Galileo's discoveries showed that scientific observations were reliable and helped solve problems, despite being open to later refutation or clarification. Evidence is everywhere and a fabric of our reality, if you lock something it kicks back, this leads to knowledge.""Thus science and other forms of knowledge are made possible by a special self similarity property of the physical world. Yet it was not physicists who first recognised and studied this property: it was mathematics and computer theorists, and they called it the universality of computation (the 3rd strand).""Universal computation is possible, which means reality is structured in such a way that a knower can comprehend the laws of physics. The laws of physics existing mandates that reality is comprehensible.Inductivism: justifying truth through logical deduction is not the same thing as making an argument for a better explanation. With an argument you don't rely on a justification or an appeal to logical proofs/senses/authority, you only need to show that it better solves a problem by its given explanation.Life/evolution: The advance of science seems to knock life off the registration if important phenomenons of nature. But we now know that genes do not experience our environment because they have no senses, but they do embody knowledge about their niche by manufacturing a kind of virtual reality where they can replicate. But not only replicate, it's the ability to create an embodiment of the physical reality that lets them replicate. Life is the physical embodiment of knowledge. Knowledge bearing matter (like genes, but not only living matter) has the ability to maintain it's structure throughout the multi-verse. The only way to identify junk genes in a genome is to figure out which could be modified in other cloned/parallel universe but the organism would remain the same. The Turing principal shows us that life and virtual reality use the same universal computation to embody reality.Time: the flow of time is an illusion, and the classical view of the universe where there's both a series of discrete moments and a changing cause-effect flow happening. But spacetime (block universe) physics wouldn't allow any change. Time is a quantum concept. the quantum concept of time is that all moments are just special cases of other universes and are only related to the current moment by the laws of physics. We discover those moments (past and future) rather than other moments in the multi-verse because the laws of physics link them to us (quantum interference). But that is a solopist error because those other multiverse moments are just as objectively happening, we just don't have access to them. Free Will: The fact that some moments exist now means that future snap shots all branch from this one. Just like true knowledge can be represented by the fact that the same truth exists in many versions of the multiverse, we can see that certain choices we make are repeated much widely in the multi verse."

Deutsch is a thinker who is arguably unmatched in his explanations of big ideas, particularly those that shape reality and ever increasing existence of knowledge itself. I've never seen a more thorough defense of the Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics, and explanation of the B-theory of time (though the term itself doesn't come up), and a refutation of Hume's major idea (followed by many) that there exists a 'problem of induction'. I can't say that I'm fully on board with every idea put forth in this work, but only for the sake that I need to better investigate the arguments, cover the further reading recommending at the end of the book, and feel I need to be able to adequately defend the ideas before I were to take them on myself.

Deutsch, whose credentials are impeccable even though his thinking is a little outside the mainstream, decides to see what is implied if we take the current best-of-breed theories seriously and toss away our blinkering discomforts. As it turns out, given that assumption, things are both not quite and exactly as they seem - in fascinating ways.There's also an excellent epitome of Popperian theory of science buried in the middle, and if you've ever struggled to wade through Popper's own writings this distillation may be worth the cover price by itself."

David Deutsch combines four strands (as he calls them), quantum physics (the many-worlds explanation of Everett), epistimology (primarily Popper), evolution (Darwin/Dawkins) and a theory of computation (Turing's strong principle) into one interconnecting world view that comes close to a theory of everything ( by which he means something other than you probably suspect). Very clear reasoning, very significant conclusions. Read this one if you are at all interested in science. It made me think and rethink some of my earlier convictions!"
24,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,3,"It's scary, what I am reading these daysThe initial chapter of this imaginative book was startling in its direct and persuasive impact, but the later chapters faltered. Deutsch buys the ""many worlds"" theory of quantum mechanics big time, and I love that interpretation; however I don't care for the way he insists that the existence of parallel universes is an established fact. He is original to say the least and definitely worth reading, although some of the chapters are a little beyond my reach (and beyond his too, I might observe).But forget about the book. What is really interesting is the reaction to the book! The Amazon.com thread of ""reviews,"" rants, hurrahs, etc. contains over 120 opinions. (This is the Amazon.com reviewer system at its best, performing a public service not possible to this extent anywhere else.) Some of the opinions, due to their authoritative expression, are obviously by actual physicists who understandably decline to identify themselves, not wanting to damage their career or reputation by becoming embroiled an argument about a ""tainted"" semi-scientific book. One of these people (""a reader"") ended his piece with the assertion that Deutsch's book was ""virtually worthless."" That can hardly be the case if the book has induced him and many others to write about it. Obviously, the people reading Deutsch are not exactly idiots and comparing his book to Worlds in Collision (as one reviewer did) was probably unfair. I also kept an informal ""score,"" counting both reviewers and helpful and unhelpful votes. Clearly those who like the book and think it is a significant contribution to scientific progress are in the minority. Deutsch's book, however, is valuable to the extent that it expands our minds and points to the majestic expanse of the universe (or multiverse, if you like). It is not enough to say that, for example, numbers are infinite. This bit of verbal knowledge does nothing to bring us any closer to the idea of infinity. But to imagine that an entire universe--consisting of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each containing billions and billions (hi, Carl Sagan) of stars, quasars and black holes out as far as we can see--comes into being with each twitch of the quantum, frees the mind magnificently and gives us just a bare hint of what terms like ""infinity"" really mean.Like Deutsch I used to prefer the many worlds interpretation of QM to the orthodox, mainly for the way it frees the mind; but also because I was not able to fully appreciate Bohr's point of view. It is only in recent years that I feel I ""understand"" the Copenhagen interpretation and now prefer it. Simply put the whereabouts of an electron or other quantum is indetermined until it is actually ""observed,"" at which time the wave function is said to collapse. I like to compare this to the action at the roulette tables. Where the bouncing ball will land (not where it is, of course) while the wheel is in spin is indetermined until the ball finally settles and the wheel stops. The ball falls (collapses) into a particular slot. This is ""only"" an analogy (clearly a false one in a deterministic universe), but aside from mathematics, there is no other way to talk about the world of the quantum, which is beyond our intuition.One of the critics of this book pointed out that no matter how many times you explain that if a woman has two children and one of them is a boy, the probability that the other is a boy is 75%, people just don't get it. This smug self-satisfaction needs a bit of adjustment, I believe. In the first place (just to be rigorously scientific) the probability that a woman with one child has a boy is actually slightly greater than fifty percent at birth since about 105 to 100 live births are males. In the womb shortly after conception the probability is even greater. Most natural miscarriages miscarry males. If the woman in question is Indian or Chinese the probability is even greater that the child is a boy. If the woman is in her eighties and the ""child"" is alive, it is probably female!Now to the pristine probability question, which could be alternately stated this way: You flipped a coin twice. One of those flips was a head. What is the probability that the other was also a head? The key (and misleading to our minds) phrase is ""one of them was."" Which one? If you identify precisely the first one, or the second one, then the seeming paradox collapses and the probability of the other one being heads becomes fifty percent. It is the indeterminate statement that paradoxically increases the probability because (although it seems otherwise) when we say ""one of them was"" what we are actually saying is:""Here are three sets of events: HH HT TT (or BB BG GG). I am referring to them in such a way as to eliminate the possibility that one of these events could be true, namely the event TT (or GG). From the events left, what is the probability that one of possible flips is a head (or a girl)?""Since three out of four of the possibilities are heads (HH HT), and each has the same likelihood of occurring, the answer is indeed 75%.Not explaining this slipperiness of language is the sort of thing that Deutsch also regrettably often fails to do, and for that reason his book reads, in part, like the enthusiastic musings of a very talented, imaginative high school physics student. On the other hand, some of those who anonymously accuse him of deliberately misleading the public may be jealous of his literary success. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

I don’t have a physics background and admittedly did not follow the logic in its entirety, but found it fascinating nevertheless. Here is my layman’s review:Early on in the book, it concludes that interference from a single electron on a double slit experiment is evidence of shadow particles from parallel universes and thereby the existence of the multiverse.It then uses this premise to drive other topics throughout the book from quantum computing to the fabric of time and possibility of time travel. Because I was not fully onboard with the proof of the multiverse (likely through my own lack of understanding), these topics seemed contrived but nevertheless fascinating.It then goes on to describe aspects like computation, knowledge and mathematics to be part of reality just as physical objects are which was an eye opener.The virtual reality section was beautiful describing how such a system could render any environment and if necessary, it could slow the human brain to render any environment of arbitrary complexity. Through the Turing Principle, the remainder of the book frequently references VR rendering when describing the physical world.It describes “cant go to” environments. In the VR example of a Wimbledon tennis match, one statement just made me burst out with laughter: “Perhaps if you had sat on the umpire’s chair and shouted ‘fault’ a nuclear submarine would have surfaced through the grass and torpedoes the scoreboard“The section on mathematics was also fascinating- it highlights that mathematical deduction has its basis in intuition and no more certain than science can be.Then there was the chapters on time and time travel - the “revolving door” time machine thought experiment had me re-reading it several times!The quantum computing section was completely lost on me... and that us despite the fact that my background is IT! :-S"

It is often poorly written and at times poorly argued. It doesn't deliver on its premise. While it offers an interesting perspective, on the whole it's a frustrating read.Toward the beginning of the book, Deutsch makes the outlandish claim that it's possible to understand the fabric of reality itself. Immediately I was skeptical, and later on he contradicts himself by acknowledging that uncertainty will always be with us. He embraces a radical interpretation of quantum interference, the Everett Many Worlds Theory, which he accepts without critically examining other valid quantum interpretations (granted, the Copenhagen Interpretation seems like a 'Cop' out). Deutsch tends to get tangled up in ""behind-the-scenes"", stream-of-consciousness reasoning that would have been better left in preparation notes than dumped into the book. With the exception of the gracious summaries at the end of each chapter--which often reveal how little was actually said--Deutsch is rarely considerate of the reader's time.His defense of many worlds (though not well reasoned) and his interpretation of life as a physical embodiment of knowledge are maybe the most interesting parts of the book.

I've always had a thing for the concept parallel universes, he explained it quite well. The chapters that I enjoyed the most were Significance of Life (Ch. 8) and Time Travel (Ch.12). He goes on to explain how the Multiverse theory is the link that binds together all four strands of reality and also reconciles all sorts of paradoxes that stem from the classical view. His optimism gives the reader a lot of hope in the pursuit of knowledge, to which which he attributes a fundamental position along with Life, Computation and Quantum Theory. While the books starts of very bright, it starts to lose sheen a little in certain chapters, which the author himself advises the general readers to skip.I wish he wrote something about singularities too."
35,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69157986-jan,3,"David Deutsch could easily have written a great and thought-provoking book about how quantum mechanics demonstrates the existence of parallel universes, and what that implies. Instead he walks into the same trap so many physicists before him bumbled into: a conviction that as a physicist he is so much smarter than all those other scientists and thinkers out there. Historians, philosophers, chemists, computer scientists, they should all just bow down to the mighty physicist in awe. His early chapter on quantum physics, despite being surprisingly short on serious reasoning, are certainly worth reading. His claim that the split screen experiment actually shows that there are parallel universes beyond our own is certainly worthy of a whole book, but Deutch just skips ahead, not bothering to deal with any counter-arguments. He presumes only he has understood logic and philosophy, mathematics and information theory, even adding a particularly silly chapter on time travel towards the end.Arrogance ruined what could have been a great book. "
36,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90056924-dan-wigglesworth,4,"This is a convincing argument in favour of embracing the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics; even if it's wrong. As Deutsch might put it: We must embrace an explanation such as this if only to disprove it. As he argues, there is currently no explanation behind quantum mechanics. I believe he characterizes the general view of QM as ""Instrumentalism"" which, he argues, is no explanation at all. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is his views on Instrumentalism versus empiricism versus the perspective advanced by Karl Popper: Empirical Falsification (science will never prove anything but only guesses at the truth and then strives to disprove it). By the way, I might be getting some of this confused with his book, ""The Beginning of Infinity"" which is a great complement to this book. "

It is often poorly written and at times poorly argued. It doesn't deliver on its premise. While it offers an interesting perspective, on the whole it's a frustrating read.Toward the beginning of the book, Deutsch makes the outlandish claim that it's possible to understand the fabric of reality itself. Immediately I was skeptical, and later on he contradicts himself by acknowledging that uncertainty will always be with us. He embraces a radical interpretation of quantum interference, the Everett Many Worlds Theory, which he accepts without critically examining other valid quantum interpretations (granted, the Copenhagen Interpretation seems like a 'Cop' out). Deutsch tends to get tangled up in ""behind-the-scenes"", stream-of-consciousness reasoning that would have been better left in preparation notes than dumped into the book. With the exception of the gracious summaries at the end of each chapter--which often reveal how little was actually said--Deutsch is rarely considerate of the reader's time.His defense of many worlds (though not well reasoned) and his interpretation of life as a physical embodiment of knowledge are maybe the most interesting parts of the book. But the four strands of thought he wants to weave (quantum theory, evolution, computation, and knowledge) never come together."

The author's fundamental point about infinite universes is really intriguing though it's only an explanation. Don't expect evidence. Don't expect to be convinced. But it's a great argument. That said, there's certain parts of the book that I would argue are totally skippable. So here's my take chapter by chapter. 1. The theory of everything: indispensable2. Shadows: yes3. Problem-solving: I guess. 4. Criteria for reality: I don't remember. 5. Virtual reality: this one is tough but you should read it but it's tough.6. Universality and the limits of computation: no idea what I read here.7. A conversation about justification: skip, skip, skip, skip, skip. Nice job taking a risk but it didn't work. 8. The significance of life: pretty exciting9. Quantum computers: mostly followable but hard10. The nature of mathematics: ooph11. Time: neat 12. Time travel: Wait, we can? Or we can't? Or we can in a computer? I... what?13. The four strands: back on track but not a crescendo14. The Ends of the Universe: mind-blowing stuff in here and the VR stuff starts to make more sense imagistically but weird to close with a long meditation on someone else's work.

As I'm OCD in terms of trying to read all our selections, I made it all the way through, even though there was one paragraph I read six or seven times before I got any semblance of a bit of understanding what David Deutsch meant. I tried hard to grasp the overall meaning, and there were a few places where I made some progress, but others were completely so wild and convoluted and most were just ""out there."" To argue that there are an infinity of connected universes with an infinity of ""me"" and ""you"" all in every possible option and part of Space-time is just above my pay-grade. I'm just one of the completely inconsequential ""humanity scum"" on the pond of the universe, I suppose. Personally, I am not religious at all, zero, but I got a kick on how Deutsch logically reasons how a ""heaven"" (small cap) could exist at the end of the top paragraph of page 358. He goes on in the summary chapter to reason equivalent reasons why morality, ethics, and even aesthetic and artistic value could somehow be a part of the ""multiverse.""

One of the most interesting aspects of the book is his views on Instrumentalism versus empiricism versus the perspective advanced by Karl Popper: Empirical Falsification (science will never prove anything but only guesses at the truth and then strives to disprove it).

That’s what my quantum physics professor said when I pushed on interpreting the results of the double slit experiment. My disappointment with that answer led me to abandon physics. Had Deutsch been my professor, I would have stayed in it. Back to the book: I found the sections on epistemology and quantum computation to be less elucidating than the stunningly simple logic that he uses to justify the many-world interpretation of quantum mechanics, but it’s all fascinating. The connections between seemingly disparate domains (QM, theory of computation, genetics, and epistemology) are novel and reminiscent of Godel, Escher, Bach. Chapter 2 is a must-read and the rest of the book is highly worthwhile for the patient reader. "

It is often poorly written and at times poorly argued. It doesn't deliver on its premise. While it offers an interesting perspective, on the whole it's a frustrating read.Toward the beginning of the book, Deutsch makes the outlandish claim that it's possible to understand the fabric of reality itself. Immediately I was skeptical, and later on he contradicts himself by acknowledging that uncertainty will always be with us. He embraces a radical interpretation of quantum interference, the Everett Many Worlds Theory, which he accepts without critically examining other valid quantum interpretations (granted, the Copenhagen Interpretation seems like a 'Cop' out). Deutsch tends to get tangled up in ""behind-the-scenes"", stream-of-consciousness reasoning that would have been better left in preparation notes than dumped into the book. With the exception of the gracious summaries at the end of each chapter--which often reveal how little was actually said--Deutsch is rarely considerate of the reader's time.His defense of many worlds (though not well reasoned) and his interpretation of life as a physical embodiment of knowledge are maybe the most interesting parts of the book.

I tried hard to grasp the overall meaning, and there were a few places where I made some progress, but others were completely so wild and convoluted and most were just ""out there."" To argue that there are an infinity of connected universes with an infinity of ""me"" and ""you"" all in every possible option and part of Space-time is just above my pay-grade.

He goes on in the summary chapter to reason equivalent reasons why morality, ethics, and even aesthetic and artistic value could somehow be a part of the ""multiverse.""

153,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17899535-prahesa,4,"Reading this book because I studied the author's proposed quantum algorithm in my fundamental of quantum information graduate class.The author clearly explained several topics that interest me, and should also interest anyone who have a background (or curiosity) in computer science/mathematics/physics. He explained clearly what Cantor's diagonal argument is, and how it is used by Turing and Godel in constructing their theory. He also extends Turing computational theory by treating computation as a physical process.David also one of the scientist who holds Everett's multiverse world-view as opposed to standard Copenhagen interpretation of mainstream physics. In essence this world-view views our universe as not the only universe that exist, we co-exist with other universes (thus the name multiverse). He also explains what free-will is and how it is compatible with multiverse world-view but not compatible in mainstream physics.Reality, and the future, is already and is always exist in the multiverse. What we do, what our free-will does, it's a mere choosing path to one of the possible universe in the multiverse."
154,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29394421-ashwin-nadar,4,"This is a wonderful book for people who are looking for a scientific holistic worldview. It begins by knocking down the inductivist and instrumentalist ideas on what scientific theories should be centred on and emphasised the role of explanations. Deutsch rides the horse saddled by the horsemen Hugh Everett, Alan Turing, Richard Dawkins/Darwin, and Karl Popper. I've always had a thing for the concept parallel universes, he explained it quite well. The chapters that I enjoyed the most were Significance of Life (Ch. 8) and Time Travel (Ch.12). He goes on to explain how the Multiverse theory is the link that binds together all four strands of reality and also reconciles all sorts of paradoxes that stem from the classical view. His optimism gives the reader a lot of hope in the pursuit of knowledge, to which which he attributes a fundamental position along with Life, Computation and Quantum Theory. While the books starts of very bright, it starts to lose sheen a little in certain chapters, which the author himself advises the general readers to skip.I wish he wrote something about singularities too."
155,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69157986-jan,3,"David Deutsch could easily have written a great and thought-provoking book about how quantum mechanics demonstrates the existence of parallel universes, and what that implies. Instead he walks into the same trap so many physicists before him bumbled into: a conviction that as a physicist he is so much smarter than all those other scientists and thinkers out there. Historians, philosophers, chemists, computer scientists, they should all just bow down to the mighty physicist in awe. His early chapter on quantum physics, despite being surprisingly short on serious reasoning, are certainly worth reading. His claim that the split screen experiment actually shows that there are parallel universes beyond our own is certainly worthy of a whole book, but Deutch just skips ahead, not bothering to deal with any counter-arguments. He presumes only he has understood logic and philosophy, mathematics and information theory, even adding a particularly silly chapter on time travel towards the end.Arrogance ruined what could have been a great book. "
156,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90056924-dan-wigglesworth,4,"This is a convincing argument in favour of embracing the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics; even if it's wrong. As Deutsch might put it: We must embrace an explanation such as this if only to disprove it. As he argues, there is currently no explanation behind quantum mechanics. I believe he characterizes the general view of QM as ""Instrumentalism"" which, he argues, is no explanation at all. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is his views on Instrumentalism versus empiricism versus the perspective advanced by Karl Popper: Empirical Falsification (science will never prove anything but only guesses at the truth and then strives to disprove it). By the way, I might be getting some of this confused with his book, ""The Beginning of Infinity"" which is a great complement to this book. "

The chapters themselves were quite dense, so if the summary intrigued me, I took the time to actually read through the contents. Overall this was a very theoretical book with examples taken from current technology that were generally relevant, though the arguments themselves could at times be fairly bizarre. Definitely not an easy read like some other popular science books for the general public, but it wasn’t impossible to follow, so kudos to that."
158,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15505156-tom-hill,2,"The best part of this book is when the author uses the example of a flashlight to justify the existence of multiple universes.

It begins by knocking down the inductivist and instrumentalist ideas on what scientific theories should be centred on and emphasised the role of explanations. Deutsch rides the horse saddled by the horsemen Hugh Everett, Alan Turing, Richard Dawkins/Darwin, and Karl Popper. I've always had a thing for the concept parallel universes, he explained it quite well. The chapters that I enjoyed the most were Significance of Life (Ch. 8) and Time Travel (Ch.12). He goes on to explain how the Multiverse theory is the link that binds together all four strands of reality and also reconciles all sorts of paradoxes that stem from the classical view. His optimism gives the reader a lot of hope in the pursuit of knowledge, to which which he attributes a fundamental position along with Life, Computation and Quantum Theory. While the books starts of very bright, it starts to lose sheen a little in certain chapters, which the author himself advises the general readers to skip.I wish he wrote something about singularities too."
185,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69157986-jan,3,"David Deutsch could easily have written a great and thought-provoking book about how quantum mechanics demonstrates the existence of parallel universes, and what that implies. Instead he walks into the same trap so many physicists before him bumbled into: a conviction that as a physicist he is so much smarter than all those other scientists and thinkers out there. Historians, philosophers, chemists, computer scientists, they should all just bow down to the mighty physicist in awe. His early chapter on quantum physics, despite being surprisingly short on serious reasoning, are certainly worth reading. His claim that the split screen experiment actually shows that there are parallel universes beyond our own is certainly worthy of a whole book, but Deutch just skips ahead, not bothering to deal with any counter-arguments. He presumes only he has understood logic and philosophy, mathematics and information theory, even adding a particularly silly chapter on time travel towards the end.Arrogance ruined what could have been a great book. "
186,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90056924-dan-wigglesworth,4,"This is a convincing argument in favour of embracing the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics; even if it's wrong. As Deutsch might put it: We must embrace an explanation such as this if only to disprove it. As he argues, there is currently no explanation behind quantum mechanics. I believe he characterizes the general view of QM as ""Instrumentalism"" which, he argues, is no explanation at all. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is his views on Instrumentalism versus empiricism versus the perspective advanced by Karl Popper: Empirical Falsification (science will never prove anything but only guesses at the truth and then strives to disprove it). By the way, I might be getting some of this confused with his book, ""The Beginning of Infinity"" which is a great complement to this book. "

It is often poorly written and at times poorly argued. It doesn't deliver on its premise. While it offers an interesting perspective, on the whole it's a frustrating read.Toward the beginning of the book, Deutsch makes the outlandish claim that it's possible to understand the fabric of reality itself. Immediately I was skeptical, and later on he contradicts himself by acknowledging that uncertainty will always be with us. He embraces a radical interpretation of quantum interference, the Everett Many Worlds Theory, which he accepts without critically examining other valid quantum interpretations (granted, the Copenhagen Interpretation seems like a 'Cop' out). Deutsch tends to get tangled up in ""behind-the-scenes"", stream-of-consciousness reasoning that would have been better left in preparation notes than dumped into the book. With the exception of the gracious summaries at the end of each chapter--which often reveal how little was actually said--Deutsch is rarely considerate of the reader's time.His defense of many worlds (though not well reasoned) and his interpretation of life as a physical embodiment of knowledge are maybe the most interesting parts of the book. But the four strands of thought he wants to weave (quantum theory, evolution, computation, and knowledge) never come together."

The author's fundamental point about infinite universes is really intriguing though it's only an explanation. Don't expect evidence. Don't expect to be convinced. But it's a great argument. That said, there's certain parts of the book that I would argue are totally skippable. So here's my take chapter by chapter. 1. The theory of everything: indispensable2. Shadows: yes3. Problem-solving: I guess. 4. Criteria for reality: I don't remember. 5. Virtual reality: this one is tough but you should read it but it's tough.6. Universality and the limits of computation: no idea what I read here.7. A conversation about justification: skip, skip, skip, skip, skip. Nice job taking a risk but it didn't work. 8. The significance of life: pretty exciting9. Quantum computers: mostly followable but hard10. The nature of mathematics: ooph11. Time: neat 12. Time travel: Wait, we can? Or we can't? Or we can in a computer? I... what?13. The four strands: back on track but not a crescendo14. The Ends of the Universe: mind-blowing stuff in here and the VR stuff starts to make more sense imagistically but weird to close with a long meditation on someone else's work.

As I'm OCD in terms of trying to read all our selections, I made it all the way through, even though there was one paragraph I read six or seven times before I got any semblance of a bit of understanding what David Deutsch meant. I tried hard to grasp the overall meaning, and there were a few places where I made some progress, but others were completely so wild and convoluted and most were just ""out there."" To argue that there are an infinity of connected universes with an infinity of ""me"" and ""you"" all in every possible option and part of Space-time is just above my pay-grade. I'm just one of the completely inconsequential ""humanity scum"" on the pond of the universe, I suppose. Personally, I am not religious at all, zero, but I got a kick on how Deutsch logically reasons how a ""heaven"" (small cap) could exist at the end of the top paragraph of page 358. He goes on in the summary chapter to reason equivalent reasons why morality, ethics, and even aesthetic and artistic value could somehow be a part of the ""multiverse.""

240,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6067468-abner-rosenweig,2,"I finish every book I start. How deeply I read depends on how much I get from the material at hand. I skimmed most of TFOR. It is often poorly written and at times poorly argued. It doesn't deliver on its premise. While it offers an interesting perspective, on the whole it's a frustrating read.Toward the beginning of the book, Deutsch makes the outlandish claim that it's possible to understand the fabric of reality itself. Immediately I was skeptical, and later on he contradicts himself by acknowledging that uncertainty will always be with us. He embraces a radical interpretation of quantum interference, the Everett Many Worlds Theory, which he accepts without critically examining other valid quantum interpretations (granted, the Copenhagen Interpretation seems like a 'Cop' out). Deutsch tends to get tangled up in ""behind-the-scenes"", stream-of-consciousness reasoning that would have been better left in preparation notes than dumped into the book. With the exception of the gracious summaries at the end of each chapter--which often reveal how little was actually said--Deutsch is rarely considerate of the reader's time.His defense of many worlds (though not well reasoned) and his interpretation of life as a physical embodiment of knowledge are maybe the most interesting parts of the book. But the four strands of thought he wants to weave (quantum theory, evolution, computation, and knowledge) never come together."

The author's fundamental point about infinite universes is really intriguing though it's only an explanation. Don't expect evidence. Don't expect to be convinced. But it's a great argument. That said, there's certain parts of the book that I would argue are totally skippable. So here's my take chapter by chapter. 1. The theory of everything: indispensable2. Shadows: yes3. Problem-solving: I guess. 4. Criteria for reality: I don't remember. 5. Virtual reality: this one is tough but you should read it but it's tough.6. Universality and the limits of computation: no idea what I read here.7. A conversation about justification: skip, skip, skip, skip, skip. Nice job taking a risk but it didn't work. 8. The significance of life: pretty exciting9. Quantum computers: mostly followable but hard10. The nature of mathematics: ooph11. Time: neat 12. Time travel: Wait, we can? Or we can't? Or we can in a computer? I... what?13. The four strands: back on track but not a crescendo14. The Ends of the Universe: mind-blowing stuff in here and the VR stuff starts to make more sense imagistically but weird to close with a long meditation on someone else's work.

As I'm OCD in terms of trying to read all our selections, I made it all the way through, even though there was one paragraph I read six or seven times before I got any semblance of a bit of understanding what David Deutsch meant. I tried hard to grasp the overall meaning, and there were a few places where I made some progress, but others were completely so wild and convoluted and most were just ""out there."" To argue that there are an infinity of connected universes with an infinity of ""me"" and ""you"" all in every possible option and part of Space-time is just above my pay-grade. I'm just one of the completely inconsequential ""humanity scum"" on the pond of the universe, I suppose.

He goes on in the summary chapter to reason equivalent reasons why morality, ethics, and even aesthetic and artistic value could somehow be a part of the ""multiverse.""

243,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17899535-prahesa,4,"Reading this book because I studied the author's proposed quantum algorithm in my fundamental of quantum information graduate class.The author clearly explained several topics that interest me, and should also interest anyone who have a background (or curiosity) in computer science/mathematics/physics. He explained clearly what Cantor's diagonal argument is, and how it is used by Turing and Godel in constructing their theory. He also extends Turing computational theory by treating computation as a physical process.David also one of the scientist who holds Everett's multiverse world-view as opposed to standard Copenhagen interpretation of mainstream physics. In essence this world-view views our universe as not the only universe that exist, we co-exist with other universes (thus the name multiverse). He also explains what free-will is and how it is compatible with multiverse world-view but not compatible in mainstream physics.Reality, and the future, is already and is always exist in the multiverse. What we do, what our free-will does, it's a mere choosing path to one of the possible universe in the multiverse."
244,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29394421-ashwin-nadar,4,"This is a wonderful book for people who are looking for a scientific holistic worldview. It begins by knocking down the inductivist and instrumentalist ideas on what scientific theories should be centred on and emphasised the role of explanations. Deutsch rides the horse saddled by the horsemen Hugh Everett, Alan Turing, Richard Dawkins/Darwin, and Karl Popper. I've always had a thing for the concept parallel universes, he explained it quite well. The chapters that I enjoyed the most were Significance of Life (Ch. 8) and Time Travel (Ch.12). He goes on to explain how the Multiverse theory is the link that binds together all four strands of reality and also reconciles all sorts of paradoxes that stem from the classical view. His optimism gives the reader a lot of hope in the pursuit of knowledge, to which which he attributes a fundamental position along with Life, Computation and Quantum Theory. While the books starts of very bright, it starts to lose sheen a little in certain chapters, which the author himself advises the general readers to skip.I wish he wrote something about singularities too."
245,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69157986-jan,3,"David Deutsch could easily have written a great and thought-provoking book about how quantum mechanics demonstrates the existence of parallel universes, and what that implies. Instead he walks into the same trap so many physicists before him bumbled into: a conviction that as a physicist he is so much smarter than all those other scientists and thinkers out there. Historians, philosophers, chemists, computer scientists, they should all just bow down to the mighty physicist in awe. His early chapter on quantum physics, despite being surprisingly short on serious reasoning, are certainly worth reading. His claim that the split screen experiment actually shows that there are parallel universes beyond our own is certainly worthy of a whole book, but Deutch just skips ahead, not bothering to deal with any counter-arguments. He presumes only he has understood logic and philosophy, mathematics and information theory, even adding a particularly silly chapter on time travel towards the end.Arrogance ruined what could have been a great book. "
246,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90056924-dan-wigglesworth,4,"This is a convincing argument in favour of embracing the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics; even if it's wrong. As Deutsch might put it: We must embrace an explanation such as this if only to disprove it. As he argues, there is currently no explanation behind quantum mechanics. I believe he characterizes the general view of QM as ""Instrumentalism"" which, he argues, is no explanation at all. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is his views on Instrumentalism versus empiricism versus the perspective advanced by Karl Popper: Empirical Falsification (science will never prove anything but only guesses at the truth and then strives to disprove it). By the way, I might be getting some of this confused with his book, ""The Beginning of Infinity"" which is a great complement to this book. "

Definitely not an easy read like some other popular science books for the general public, but it wasn’t impossible to follow, so kudos to that."

Even in the parts I do not agree, I found the depth of explanation excellent. The biggest merit is certainly to bring in concepts like computability and knowledge into the picture as key elements to define reality itself. This book it is now in my top reading list."

That’s what my quantum physics professor said when I pushed on interpreting the results of the double slit experiment. My disappointment with that answer led me to abandon physics. Had Deutsch been my professor, I would have stayed in it. Back to the book: I found the sections on epistemology and quantum computation to be less elucidating than the stunningly simple logic that he uses to justify the many-world interpretation of quantum mechanics, but it’s all fascinating. The connections between seemingly disparate domains (QM, theory of computation, genetics, and epistemology) are novel and reminiscent of Godel, Escher, Bach. Chapter 2 is a must-read and the rest of the book is highly worthwhile for the patient reader. "

It’s only when you come to try and explain the book to someone you are recommending it to that you realise that understanding was fleeting! Very much worth reading and very much worth studying!"

This is one of those life-changing, world-perspective-changing, how-I-think-about-defining-Reality books—they’re relatively rare and hard-to-come by, but when I do find a gem, like this one, few things bring me greater intellectual, philosophical joy. Thank you Neal Stephenson for talking about and recommending (I think) the book on Conversations with Tyler. "
284,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58859166-alessandro-piovaccari,5,"A fundamental pillar of knowledgeThis book is utilizes both physics and philosophy point of views to make sense of the fabric of reality, exploring many if-then scenarios, sometimes falling at the edge of sci-fi. Even in the parts I do not agree, I found the depth of explanation excellent. The biggest merit is certainly to bring in concepts like computability and knowledge into the picture as key elements to define reality itself. This book it is now in my top reading list."
285,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60001905-john,5,An amazing book - I'll never see the world quite the same again.It becomes apparent as you read this book that so much of reality is not intuitive. So much of science now sounds like science fiction but is supported often by experimental evidence and mathematics - but as Deutsch notes - even mathematic proofs are not conclusive. 
286,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21114040-ryan-vaughn,4,"Thought provokingI hadn't realized the contention between different interpretations of quantum interference until reading this, but after doing so, I, a longtime Hawking fan, have trouble believing the Copenhagen interpretation and find the multiverse interpretation much more logical. This may also be the nerdiest review I've yet written. Hooray!"
287,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15309891-omri-gazitt,4,"A physicist that explains......instead of relying on the reductionist creed “it doesn’t matter why - the predictions agree with experiment, and that should be enough”. That’s what my quantum physics professor said when I pushed on interpreting the results of the double slit experiment. My disappointment with that answer led me to abandon physics. Had Deutsch been my professor, I would have stayed in it. Back to the book: I found the sections on epistemology and quantum computation to be less elucidating than the stunningly simple logic that he uses to justify the many-world interpretation of quantum mechanics, but it’s all fascinating. The connections between seemingly disparate domains (QM, theory of computation, genetics, and epistemology) are novel and reminiscent of Godel, Escher, Bach. Chapter 2 is a must-read and the rest of the book is highly worthwhile for the patient reader. "
288,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99934335-sean-flinchpaugh,3,"Much more of a philosophy book in which one has to be fully invested in the concept of multiverses by now. Was hoping for more grounded theory and like a lot of philosophers, sometimes he has a habit of getting so wound up in his own ideology he doesn't notice logic holes forming in his thesis. Still a fun read, at least for the ideas..."
289,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6663546-ho-manh,5,"A great book on the surprising connection among the four fundamental theories of science and how they together form the fabric of reality: quantum physics, Turing principle of computation, Darwin-Dawkins theory of evolution, and Popper's epistemology. "
290,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7187178-tony-fecteau,5,This book was frustrating at time but well worth the read. I especially enjoyed the chapter on time and the chapter on humans being themselves a virtual reality machine. The quantum conversations were headache inducing but very informative. I really enjoyed the explanations for everything. 
291,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10506991-dani,4,"In search of a unified explanation of the universe you will be surprised by the approach this amazing thinkers takes. Life and humanity has cosmic importance, which was surprising for me. His arguments are extremely powerful."
292,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64158449-tyson-neidig,4,"One of the best books on quantum physics around. The information is cumulative, and really only pulls together in the Time Travel chapter. So if you feel a bit lost in the early parts of the book, don't worry it all pays off at the end. "
293,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70163959-lalu-zam,4,Very unique point of view about epistemology of science and a new radical understanding of the theory of everything. Worthwhile to be read by anyone interested in new way of understanding nature and reality.
294,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60300266-mark,3,"In the vein of Godel, Escher, Bach, Deutch presents a popular level view of his concept of the underlying commonalities between all branches of knowledge. I got a better understanding of what an ""emergent"" property is, but his signature focus, the multimeter, is still vague."
295,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62235037-sagar,5,What exactly is Multiple universe? How have we come to the conclusion that multiverse exist and why is it wrong to call EVERYTHING around us 'universe'? I think this is a brilliant book from a brilliant person. Must Read! 
296,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69681561-chris-marks,4,"Excellent and thought provoking, even when not entirely convincing. I have a much better understanding and appreciation of Deutsch's multiverse theory than I had based on some too brief earlier exposure. I still don't buy it, but I greatly like some aspects of it."
297,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29771819-clerk,4,"Heavy going in places, but ultimately an optimistic and positive view of the fundamentals of reality and the future of the multiverse. It even expounds a positive view of our role in everything as part of the intrinsic basis of reality."
298,014027541X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55854344-jim,5,Highly compelling argument for the Hugh Everett version of many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
