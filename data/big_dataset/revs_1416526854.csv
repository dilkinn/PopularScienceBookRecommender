Take steps to reduce the human population worldwide to around a billion people and keep it there. Take the biological desire of people to play house and be mothers and fathers, and redirect it into responsible stewardship of the planet.Don’t like that one? Seems too draconian? How about this? End all tax exempt status for churches, mosques, etc. (Resounding voice coming onstage: “Only when they tear my cold, dead fingers from the collection plate!”)Here’s another: realize that to know all is to forgive all, and that we are all just biological automations acting out our genetic drives and have no more free will than an ant on the pheromone trail. Deal with people acting in violent antisocial ways by (1) curing them with psychopharmacology, surgery, retraining, or (2) euthanasia.Decriminalize street drug use. Allow Phillip Morris to get into the cannabis business and Merck to process opium into heroin. If some people become dysfunctional, see previous dangerous idea and employ it.Well, none of John Brockman’s esteemed contributors came up with anything quite THAT dangerous, probably because the danger of such ideas is most immediately to the person who would advance them! Psychiatrist Randolph M. Nesse gives us some guidance on why such ideas are not being advanced in this book in his modest essay on “Unspeakable Ideas.” (pp. 193-195) Here’s one: “when your business group is trying to deal with a savvy competitor, say, ‘It seems to me that their product is superior, because they are smarter than we are.’” Also unspeakable is, “I will only do what benefits me.” Nesse writes that saying something like that is akin to committing “social suicide.”David Lykken thinks that parents ought to be required to get licenses to parent and prove they are twenty-one years old, married, and self-supporting. (pp. 175-176)Jordan Pollack urges us (tongue in cheek, I presume) to embrace “faith-based science.” He writes, “physics could sing the psalm that perpetual motion would solve the energy crisis…” with God “on our side to repeal the second law of thermodynamics!” “Astronomy could embrace astrology and do grassroots PR with daily horoscopes to gain mass support for a new space program.” (pp. 156-158)John Allen Paulos joins the Buddha and David Hume and presents the self as “an ever-changing collection of beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes, that is not an essential and persistent entity but a conceptual chimera.” (p. 152)Some of the other “dangerous ideas” concern such things as science versus religion (e.g., Sam Harris’s “Science Must Destroy Religion” and Philip W. Anderson’s “The Posterior Probability of Any Particular God Is Pretty Small”); exciting speculations (Terrence Sejnowski’s “When Will the Internet Become Aware of Itself?”), cosmological conjectures (Brian Greene’s “The Multiverse,” and Leonard Susskind’s “The ‘Landscape’”).Some of the ideas are not dangerous at all of course, and some are only dangerous to certain segments of society. The idea that the Christian God does not exist is no skin off my teeth and no Buddhist feels threatened by it, but television evangelicals find it downright scary. Judith Rich Harris advances the idea that parents really don’t shape their children’s morays (their peers and the larger society does). This idea isn’t threatening at all unless you are a Pygmalion sort of parent infused with a weighty sense of responsibility, and in that case, her idea can help you to chill out.Some other ideas may or may not be seen as dangerous. Karl Sabbagh suggests that “The Human Brain Will Never Understand the Universe,” and Lawrence M. Krauss wants us to know that “The World May Be Fundamentally Inexplicable.” Personally I think they’re both right, but that shouldn’t keep us from trying to expand the range of our knowledge and understanding. Seth Lloyd even goes so far as to suggest that one of our ideas “is likely to have the unintended consequence of destroying everything we know.” He adds that “we cannot stop creating and exploring new ideas. The genie of ingenuity is out of the bottle. To suppress the power of ideas will hasten catastrophe, not avert it.” (p. 101)There are several essays on how drugs might, can, and will affect us (e.g., “Drugs May Change the Patterns of Human Love” by Helen Fisher, and “Using Medications to Change Personality” by Samuel Barondes). There are essays on politics and economics (e.g., Michael Shermer’s ode to fiscal conservativism and social liberalism, “Where Goods Cross Frontiers, Armies Won’t” and Matt Ridley’s “Government Is the Problem, Not the Solution”), and on the dangers and promises of futuristic technologies by Ray Kurzweil, Freeman J. Dyson and others. In fact there is so much in this book that a reader could study the ideas for decades--seriously--and hardly scratch the surface of what is implied, hoped for, dreamed of, and feared. It is a great collection of ideas, a masterful work of compilation and editing by science’s most talented and creative editor, John Brockman. Don’t miss this book. It’s even better than Brockman’s previous collection “What We Believe But Cannot Prove.”Let me throw in one more dangerous idea not in the book (lest I wax too sanguine): suppose that by bioengineering violent aggression out of the human genome (which seems like a good idea) we end up with something like H.G. Wells’ Eloi? Can it be true that humans must be violently aggressive, and if not, will become stagnant and exploitable? One might argue that there would then be no exploiter, but should one appear what would--could--we do? --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

4,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/667234-james,4,"A mixed bag, but well worth reading. This is a collection of over 100 short-to-very-short essays by leading thinkers in a variety of fields, about both their interpretations of what would constitute a dangerous idea and what specific ideas they think qualify.Quite a few were intriguing and seemed dead on as far as their potential impact on society in general or on subsets such as scientific disciplines, politics, or industries. There were a number that I thought didn't deserve inclusion because they were based on blatantly incorrect assumptions, mostly about sociological phenomena like crime rates or economic factors. And there were some I just couldn't quite understand because they were esoteric beyond what I had the background to understand, mostly in exotic areas of physics.For me, the most valuable find in this book isn't any of the specific things about which its contributors wrote, but the fact that this is one of an annual series from a website called www.edge.org, which exists to seek out leaders in fields of thought and explore what questions they're asking themselves and the answers they're reaching, if any. I'll definitely be bookmarking that site, and I want to dig into the questions and answers compiled there from other years."

Copernicus's idea that the earth went round the moon and Darwin's idea of evolution are given as the stock examples of ideas that were dangerous in the past. What will be proved true in the future that we would find difficult to believe today?I found the articles to be very hit and miss. They variously seemed too obvious, too esoteric or barely worth mentioning. And too many were of the navel gazing ""the idea of a dangerous idea is dangerous"" or variations. One of the problems is that there are a lot of short articles and they've been arranged so that the themes follow on from one writer to the next; this makes for some degree of redundancy. There is a lot here that's interesting to read but the book as a whole wasn't gripping."
6,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3346363-matt-heavner,4,"A really good collection to enjoy the ""dangerous ideas"" from 108 leading thinkers. It is a wide range, roughly and well grouped. It is definitely a good ""meta-thinking"" exercise - exploring the ideas themselves, then thinking about ""What makes an idea dangerous"" and even ""If an idea is dangerous, is there some responsibility to do something about/with that idea?"" (and is that a dangerous idea?) I found some of them very compelling, a few boring/tautological, and some off-the-mark or boring. But overall, worth a read especially when you have the luxury of some time to enjoy."
7,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,3,"Little New Under the SunCue ominous organ music - there are some things Man Is Not Meant To Know!(But we'd be better off if we did!)As a long time SF buff I have to say that very few of the ideas expressed were that unusual or dangerous, and some were somewhat predictable. The book consists of 110 visions (including the forward by Stephen Pinker and afterword by Richard Dawkins) that the various authors consider to be disruptive or game changing. The ""guest list"" is fairly impressive, however most wrote of ideas that I've come across either in story form or in other writings - perhaps reassuring that very bright people swim in the same pool of memes as the rest of us. Quite a few worried about our reaching limits of scientific knowledge. About a dozen dealt with atheism (ho hum) or conceptualizations of religion that were at the level of a high school squeal session. Quite a few expressed concern over our concepts of self or society.Danny Hillis' non response that the ideas he had in mind are too dangerous to express is intriguing if you are aware of his work on Clock Of The Long Now a research initiative to store important human knowledge so that it can be recovered in the far future - how to recreate the such as where are nuclear waste sites located - held against the collapse of civilization. He's been thinking of the truly dangerous for over a decade - it would have been quite interesting to know what possible calamities he's come up with!So what is it that makes for a dangerous idea? To my mind it is not the idea itself that is dangerous, but the potential outcome that might occur if that idea is either acted upon or not acted upon. Thus the idea that God might require human sacrifice is not particularly dangerous as Aztec and Canaanite cults are none too popular at the moment, whereas global warming is dangerous because we either might on act on it, or act on it improperly. Wallet sized nuclear bombs (or home brew nuclear energy - covered in one essay) is only dangerous if technically feasible, which at the moment it is not.On the plus side most of the contributors have produced well polished summaries of their thoughts and this does. Among the more interesting pieces were Rushkoff's ""Open Source Currency"" which I thought was an interesting recasting of the economic value of reputation in a social context, Judith Harris who states that there is no proof that parents have any influence on children (I disagree with the conclusion - our influence may not be what we intended but it's often, not always, there, however the lack of studies was surprising). I've always enjoyed Stewart Brand, and though his idea was stimulating - historians should advise politicians - not very new - I just read that this was done in preparation for the Paris 1919 peace conference - however the material created did not show great evidence of being used. I didn't think it dangerous, however I did get a good book reference out of it. Ray Kurzweil has 2 big ideas - he chose immortality in our time and over the singularity.I do think that the discussion itself is interesting. For example about a week ago there was a ""Dangerous Idea"" conference in Sydney Australia. And with that in mind I've started a discussion group below.Overall not quite up to expectations but that's more me than the text itself which isn't bad and does the job as a springboard for considering a few basic questions. It's also another example IMHO of why Amazon's 1-5 rating isn't fine tuned enough. I'd rate it about 3.4/5 and in spite of the inexpensive price I'd recommend giving it a browse in a bookstore or library before buying."
8,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4635826-dena-burnett,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book, and similar Edge.org compilations. The Good: This was an easy read. I do appreciate how the multiple authors made their ideas accessible, easy to digest, and uncomplicated enough to be thought-provoking. The Bad: There's a lot of navel-gazing and mental masturbation in here. This is my biggest gripe with this series. Yes, it's a set of ideas, but few provoke action and an urgency to problem-solve. If you're going to bring ""the best thinkers in the world"" together, then at least present some thoughts on how to solve the mess they're presenting as our current state. Also, there are few women represented in this collection....less than 15%! This disappoints me; there are many, many intelligent and thoughtful women academics out there. Let their voices be heard as well. "

10,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47239676-sw,3,"I am a bit disappointed with this book. I was expecting the ideas to be more radical. The ideas that we don’t have a soul or that the difference between animals and us is more in degree than in kind for example are not new or thought provoking anymore to me. Also, some of the authors delivered barely a snippet. It felt like getting a bunch of appetizers but no main course. One positive though is that I will be following up on some of the authors’ other books. They were the ones who seemed to have an interesting proposition but did not elaborate much."

I read with great anticipation because I was wating for something dangerous or at least really new. I only got to p192 out of 301pages so maybe there is still something there.from the library computer:Book NewsThis provocative compilation includes responses to the annual question on the Edge Web site regarding ideas that might be considered dangerous. Contributors include the human genome's decoder, a physicist on reducing global climate change via engineering; a computer scientist arguing that mind is everywhere; and an artist on the unpredictable consequences of art. Richard Dawkins reminds us that: ""Yesterday's dangerous idea is today's orthodoxy...."" Please add suggested further reading next year. Annotation ©2007 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)Choice ReviewsIn this book, (Western) scientists and philosophers reflect on current serious and important questions. They are also part of a growing class of intellectuals--the so-called ""third culture""--who articulate issues and sometimes suggest solutions to difficult social, scientific, and cultural problems. In brief pieces, writers express what they regard as dangerous ideas, ranging from changing scientific world pictures, such as the dominance of evolutionary biology and the anthropic principle, to matters of practical relevance, such as media violence and ""the near-term inevitability of radical life-extension and expansion."" It is not clear that all ideas mentioned are dangerous in a frightening sense. Scientific revolutions and interpretations of natural phenomena often alter traditional beliefs and make us doubt long-held religious beliefs. But are they dangerous on that account? The real dangers lurk largely in what could diminish or erase our quality of life and render precarious our survival on the planet--both implicit in technology--and in the hatred and animosity between peoples, races, and religions intensified by Internet free-for-all and repeated political blunders. It is surprising that there are not many contributors touching on these matters. The absence of any non-Western thinker is glaring in this century. Summing Up: Optional.

18,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1248060-rebekah,3,"Despite the lame name, this book is pretty rad. A bunch of scientists/""thinkers"" talking about the things they think about that society is not prepared to think about because they are too politically or morally charged, or because the ramifications (or perceived ramifications) of accepting the theories are too scary. For example, the idea that women in general are innately less adept at maths and sciences might be true, but people would rather reject it for fear that acceptance might lead to early educational ""tracking"" or to job discrimination; or the idea that people's actions are determined by their genetic makeup and their earliest experiences rather than an actual self or soul creates difficulties for holding people accountable for their actions, both in our personal relationships and in legal matters. Each ""dangerous idea"" is just two to four pages, so if one doesn't capture your imagination, another one is just a page away......................Now that I'm about halfway through, I must say that some of the writing is pretty bad and the editing is atrocious, BUT bear in mind that the articles were originally intended for a web site, so I think the authors were more casual than they might have been had they been thinking about their essays in terms of a print copy. I still recommend the book pretty highly- it's easy to tell from the first sentence or two whether the essay is crap or not, so don't feel bad about skipping half of them! There are some real gems."
19,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763730-stewart,4," One hundred eight writers, most of them scientists and academics, contributed to this book. There are well-known people like Steven Pinker, Richard Dawkins, Helen Fisher, and Jared Diamond and lesser-know people. As can be expected, the short essays, ranging from one to five pages each, vary in interest. But many of the essays examine fascinating ideas that may challenge our beliefs and the status quo (hence, their danger). Daniel Golman, for instance, notes the difference between having a discussion with someone in person and by e-mail. On ""flaming"": ""The hallmark of a flame is that the same person would never say the words in the e-mail to the recipient were they face to face."" Karl Sabbagh writes about the immense difficulty of humans knowing the universe: ""And even if we are on the right lines in some areas, how much of what there is to be understood in the universe do we really understand? Fifty percent? Five percent? The dangerous idea is that perhaps we understand half of a percent and all the brain and computer power we can muster may take us up to one or two percent in the lifetime of the human race."" On why aliens have not contacted humans despite there being billions of planets in our galaxy alone: ""Basically I think aliens don't blow themselves up; they just get addicted to computer games. They forget to send radio signals or colonize space because they're too busy with runaway consumerism and virtual-reality narcissism. They don't need Sentinels to enslave them in a Matrix; they do it to themselves, just as we are doing today."" "
20,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14835031-osman,3,A great toilet-side tome to dip into as you defecate. Each pundit has about 2 pages to get their 'dangerous idea' out. Some are dull some are striking- most you have heard before; some regurgitate ancient philosophical conundrums.The ones that are most enjoyable are generally by the best writers; who may not be the most original thinkers. As a Sam Harris fan I place his contribution higher than most of the others simply on the merit of his prose; he is always interesting even when going over familiar ground. There was one essay in here that made me laugh with derrision. By a woman called Judith Rich Harris (who she?). The thesis which she expounds with no little pride (hubris one might say) is that nurture (as opposed to nature) has zero effect on the young. This is self evidently wrong of course. A parent who brain-damages a child with a blunt object must be conceded to have effected their subsequent development. And one can obviously scale back on the drama into greyer (yet still obvious)realms- for example a parent who witholds all education from his child might be suppposed to have had some effect on that childs later intellectual life. I'm not sure how this ridiculous piece got into this book- the author appears to have no qualifications to rank her alongside the other alumini- she is listed as an 'independent investigator'?? 
21,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35599102-monkonacid,4,"Do you like ideas? Cause I do and, boy, have I found a few in this book. My curiosity was more than entertained by ideas of influence that parents have on children, unconscious on free will and anti-depressants on love. How neatly, by the way, was this edition framed by a combined erudition of Richard Dawkins and Steven Pinker that encaptured well the essence of many essays in this book.When it comes to danger of these ideas, entertaining as they are, I couldn't say I got scared all that much by them. Not to say that I am stupidly brave nor brilliantly ignorant. It is that most of the ideas that could be considered treathening from this book have already crossed my mind with the help of movies, books and intuition long ago. So that I was accustomed to facing them by the time I had to face them once more when reading this book. Hence the lack of fear.So, it seems to me, at least, that a wheel perhaps was not created in this book, yet that which was, is worthy of curious attention, too."
22,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4613117-james-ottaway,4,"This book is an amazing collection of 108 responses to the question ""What is your dangerous idea?"". The question was posed to a collection of very impressive names, and the goal I had in reading the book of being mentally stimulated and challenged was certainly met.There are some incredibly interesting excerpts from responses touching on topics such as whether the concept of the soul is a valid one, and whether the notion of free will even exists.Of course the science vs. religion debate makes it's fair share of appearances, but I was impressed that a few of the respondents took it upon themselves to use a slightly different approach.And who can resist reading responses with titles such as 'Everything Is Pointless' or 'Parental Licensure'? Overall this is a great book to force you to think of where you sit in regards to a wide range of topics you didn't even know existed, let alone truly understand."
23,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10024577-holmes,4,"If you want thought-provoking ideas, this book surely delivers them magnificently; in fact, some ideas can be downright mind-boggling and even incomprehensible. Some do not seem dangerous at all, and some will certainly raise a lot of eyebrows. Some are explained almost in scientific rigour, and some are dispensed in just a short paragraph. All in all, this book is a very good one to get you thinking about ideas that you did not realize are even able to be imagined - provided that you are an open-minded person and will not be offended easily by ""dangerous"" ideas. After all, as Aristotle said, ""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."" My only complaint is that the ""leading thinkers"" included in this book are almost all scientists, with a heavy representation of the natural sciences. Where are the economists, historians and artists?"

Many thoughts that resonate today are dangerous not because they are assumed to be false, but because they might turn out to be true.What do the world's leading scientists and thinkers consider to be their most dangerous idea? Through the leading online forum Edge (www.edge.org), the call went out, and this compelling and easily digestible volume collects the answers. From using medication to permanently alter our personalities to contemplating a universe in which we are utterly alone, to the idea that the universe might be fundamentally inexplicable, What Is Your Dangerous Idea? takes an unflinching look at the daring, breathtaking, sometimes terrifying thoughts that could forever alter our world and the way we live in it"
25,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"A “dangerous” idea is not meant to be dangerous literally. Dangerous meaning that the idea is not self-evidently wrong, but by being proven right, or even just by being discussed, it may upset the accepted norms or the current way of thinking or the existing moral order. An example (Steven Pinker’s dangerous idea): What if different groups of people differ genetically in their average talents and temperaments? The question was put to a bunch of “leading thinkers and scientists.” The result is not as impressive as I expected. Not all ideas were dangerous. A lot of the entries were just plain self-promotion by the writers. There were also a lot of repetitive and similar ideas. Not a bad book, overall. "
26,1416526854,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16592280-graham-polando,3,"Very hit or miss, but more hits than misses. Some authors didn't really seem to get the question, which, at least as Steven Pinker introduced it, was about ideas thought to be disruptive, but which the moral order can, at least in theory, accommodate: Pinker cites heliocentrism as a historical example. A disconcerting number of the essays even focus on what to do about those rubes in the Midwest who maintain a semblance of theology; no one seems to appreciate that the apparent universal agreement certainly detracts from that particular idea's ""dangerousness.""None of the essays are particularly long, and some seem half baked, but most are in keeping with the general crowd sourcing idea here. Worthwhile, given the short time investment."

But this one question may be the most important to push the edge of human knowledge; ideas that were once deemed provocative, immoral, even dangerous, have since been accepted by society at large. In our time, they have been supplanted by other ideas we might deem dangerous, some of which could possibly be harmful to mankind. Should such ideas be frowned upon, ridiculed, kept secret, be destroyed? Or should they be sensibly discussed in the open? This is an important book to read, mind-extending and mind-bending."

This edition/collection gave me a lot to think about -- some of which was predictable in terms of subject matter(lots of discussion about physics, creation, and human consciousness), but unpredictable in terms of what these ""scientists and thinkers"" consider the idea connected to these topics. One of my favorites came from David Lykken, whose idea related to ""Parental Licensure."" The responses are short and this book is easy to read in bursts.

It's not bad, but I've heard most of these arguments before. The authors agonise over stuff like the non-existence of the soul, human inequality, eugenics, free will, consciousness, and the general pointlessnes of the universe. Actually it was quite depressing. Today's Leading Thinkers seem to do a lot of worrying and don't have a lot of answers."

Like-minded essays are grouped together, giving an ""overkill"" feeling towards each category (i.e. technology, religion, life on other planets, etc.) What I read, some of these essays are very interesting and fun to ponder. Others, you get the feeling that the participant was either indifferent or didn't ""understand the assignment.""
