0,0465037410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172572-lemar,5,"I just finished Quintessence: The Mystery of Missing Mass in the Universe by Lawrence M. Krauss. The shelf life of a book about an active search in Physics is usually not very long and this was last revised in 2001 however, sadly for the world but happily for readers of this book, there have not been any definitive discoveries since that time. Krauss does an excellent job of presenting the history of the search for missing matter and how the current experiments seeking to validate the competing theories evolved. The reader is well prepared to follow experiments such as Lux , CRESST many more as they unfold. He is engaging and does not underestimate the ability and desire of the reader. I am rooting for axions while recognizing that my support may pass right through them unnoticed. "
1,0465037410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15245796-richard-buro,5,"The short version first:Quintessence The Search For Missing Mass In The Universe by Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss is a review of the search for a substantial part of our universe which is ""dark"" to us at this time. By ""dark,"" physicists like Dr. Krauss mean that the matter and energy is currently unassessed by our best scientific instruments, although there is clearly a good deal of evidence that something must exist that makes up what appears to be missing matter and energy which would result in the visual and instrumental indications about what is currently assessable, and the fact that it does not add up to the available evidence for what should be measurable based on theory and observational data.Dr. Krauss begins with a review of historical information about a fifth state of matter (the quintessence or aether) that has been discussed since Classical times by the Greeks and other philosophers. The fact that there was something in space beyond the sun, moon, planets, stars, and other observable phenomena has been proven by the application of theory and observational data from centuries of Earth-based observations, and several decades of observational data from research probes either in orbit around the Earth or on interplanetary (and in a few cases, interstellar) space.Based on observations, theoretical analysis, and data analysis from the observational data available all appear to point to the fact that the universe has been expanding for some time. In fact the expansion has been theoretically postulated for about a century, and observational data both Earth- and space-based have confirmed what theory has predicted, the universe is expanding. The problem is that even with all of the observations we have (and those which are continuing even now) there is not enough mass in all the stars, planets, galaxies, and other observational phenomena to explain the observed expansion. In fact there is only about 4-5% enough mass to explain things as they apparently are. So what makes up the missing 95-96% of the universe?Based on all available evidence, it appears that about 20-30% of the mass is not directly detectable by our available instruments and probes. Additionally, the 60-70% of the remaining material appears to be a type of energy which is also not directly detectable by our current instrumentality. Dr. Krauss provides the evidence for the current estimates of the observable mass and detectable energy, as well as providing some interesting theoretical postulations on the nature of dark matter and (to a lesser degree)on dark energy. He categorizes the nature of the dark matter and devotes the majority of this revised edition to the best ""candidates"" for near term assessible items that might be the source of the dark matter at least.Dr. Krauss refers to numerous reports, papers, books, and research articles about the search and the theory behind his best ""candidates"" as well as what might be forthcoming in the near term (the next decade or so) in the way of possible detection and examination of these ""candidates"" by our best scientists and engineers. While the seminal works are cited in Notes at the end of the book, and names of principal researchers and their associated institutions are contained in the text and index, there are more mentioned than are included in the notes as citations which might be reviewable. The lack of a complete bibliograahy or more detailed notes is a significant missing feature in this work.While no definitive ""candidate"" for dark matter is forthcoming, the fact that there is detailed discussion about the search and type of instrumentation being considered for this search is covered in great detail at a general level. Appendices help the layman to understand orders of magnitude as well as basic units of measure as discussed in the text. The index at the end is also helpful and fairly complete. There are areas of the work where discussions are a bit technical, but none is beyond the grasp of an educated reader with just a general understanding of high school math. Dr. Krauss has an engaging, enthusiastic writing style which makes the work a good read and worthy of your attention, if you are interested in the topics of dark matter, search for new and exciting space-based information and/or cosmology. The reading level is relatively high so I would recommend it for high school level readers with a grasp of geometry, algebra, chemistry, and physics. It is a good solid work with few if any editorial errors where reading is affected due to spelling or grammatical errors.If dark matter and energy, universal expansion, or science discovery and exploration is your cup of tea, you will probably find Dr. Krauss' work an enjoyable read that needs to be on your To Be Read (TBR) list."

So far, I am NOT disappointed with this one either. I am nearly finished with this....it gets a bit on the heavy side towards the middle and end.Although this is technically my second reading it is much clearer now....and again, despite it being a bit dated, it has enough information to quell those that feel the universe was created by pixies.

He came to my college to give a talk, and after meeting him he signed a copy of the book for me! He's my science geek idol, right up there with Carl Sagan. *swoon*"
4,0465037410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35169038-serkelion,2,"Seppur di natura divulgativa il testo affronta l’argomento in modo preciso e dettagliato. Non sono citate formule matematiche né dimostrazioni, ma i contenuti sono intensi e richiedono una certa preparazione tecnica: è’ necessario conoscere almeno a grandi linee processi come la fusione di Idrogeno in Elio o la curvatura dello spazio-tempo, per poter seguire il filo del discoros. Ai lettori armati di queste conoscenze vengono presentati i diversi temi che suggeriscono l’esistenza della materia oscura, quali ad esempio: la velocità orbitale delle stelle attorno alle galassie (troppo lenta, se non ci fosse un alone di materia attorno alla galassia), le velocità relative tra gli elementi di un ammasso di galassie (che suggeriscono materia persino tra una galassia e l’altra) oppure l’effetto lente che presenta immagini deviate in modo tale da suggerire una massa molto maggiore di quella visibile.Krauss osserva che tali giustificazioni sono in qualche modo correlate, perché assumono tutte l’espansione di Hubble e usano tutte la spettografia come strumento d’indagine principale, per cui ci potrebbe essere un errore di fondo. Ma la teoria della massa mancante è confermata anche da approcci completamente indipendenti, quali ad esempio la teoria dei Big Bang: assumendo per buona la nucleosintesi, e tenendo conto che le osservazioni cosmologiche suggeriscono un universo pressoché piatto, dalla nucleosintesi può derivare solamente l’1% della massa richiesta per giustificare un universo piatto. Questa considerazione è fondamentale, perché conferma il mistero della massa mancante anche dal punto di vista della micro-fisica. Inoltre, il fatto che secondo la micro-fisica la massa barionica è solo l’1% di quella necessaria, mentre dal punto di vista cosmologico la materia oscura è stimata attorno al 90% di quella attesa, siamo davanti ad un altro mistero: perché queste stime sono tanto diverse? Cosa ci sfugge? Possibile che il 99% della materia nell’universo sia diversa da quella barionica?Ho amato e odiato questo libro. L’ho amato perché mi ha permesso di capire in in modo esaustivo il tema della massa mancante. L’ho amato perché mi ha spinto a riesumare conoscenze di fisica che credevo ormai dimenticate. Vent’anni dopo la laurea mi sono ritrovato a ripassare l’interazione a distanza per mezzo di particelle virtuali, l’effetto Joule-Thomson, il teorema del viriale, la nucleosintesi, il modello standard e la rotture di simmetrie.L’ho odiato perché in alcuni passaggi, e in alcuni casi addirittura per interi paragrafi, riporta esempi fuorvianti che producono più confusione che altro. Mi è capitato di restare basito davanti alle spiegazioni di concetti semplici enunciati in modo contorto. Argomenti che conosco bene, ma che spiegati da Krauss sono di difficile comprensione. Che si tratti di un problema di traduzione?Al di là dei contenuti, la lettura è comunque ostica. Il testo manca di un filo conduttore chiaro e preciso. E’ difficile capire dove l’autore ci sta portando, di pagina in pagina. A volte si ha l’impressione di sfogliare il Conoscere degli anni ‘70, dove ogni pagina affrontava un aspetto della conoscenza da un punto di vista diverso, senza un chiaro filo logico. Spesso i singoli periodi sono poco chiari persino dal punto di vista linguistico. Mi è capitato spesso di rileggere una frase cinque o sei volte, per capire chi era il soggetto, chi il complimento oggetto. L’astrofisica è già un argomento difficile, se ci mettiamo anche un’esposizione poco chiara e disordinata, la lettura si fa tormentata.Consigliato solamente ai duri e puri."

Nonetheless, in this book Krauss is able to distill fairly complex ideas into really packed language. Much of the ideas here are fairly inspiring, such as how physicists can use the sun as a radar, or use the earth as a way of detecting dark matter.I thought this was a pretty great book, although I think I need to read it again."

7,0465037410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2794993-joe-white,5,"goodreads review : The Fifth Essence : The Search for Dark matter in The Universepublished 1989Lawrence Krauss5 starsAlthough published almost 25 years ago, this book has in my opinion a very high value for the historical display of the search for dark matter up to the point of publication. I'm not up to date on the latest information in this search, but I think that everything expressed in this text is still relevant. It gives the background for the postulation of theories of what dark matter may be, and demonstrates experiments to find it. The book clearly discusses how some searches for dark matter set bounds on what ranges a specific type of matter should fall into, and consequently the possibility of ruling out some theories if experiments fail to find particles or energy.The book is written in a narrative qualitative form. It does not provide rigorous mathematical proofs, (so page after page of high level calculus and differential equations are avoided.)Although directed to the layman, it would help the layman to polish up his/her review of college level nuclear particle physics, college level astrophysics, ant to re-read some of the earlier discoveries in Newtonian mechanics and electro-mechanical physics."
8,0465037410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,0,"I started this book last december when I was in Siding Spring (the telescope area of Aussie) so I was greatly motivated. it started off very fascinating but then somehow my interest just wore out. i stopped at page 248: ""soon after Wilczek and Weinberg announced their theoretical predictions (of the existence of axions), experimentalists began searching for this new particle. while the theory led to definite predictions in most cases for what they should see, all results were negative. by the early 1980s it looked as if the axion issue was dead.""and so was my interest. the book starts off with solid empirical data and evidence of dark matter and then just gets more and more technical and speculative. i've picked it up about 10 times ever since I stopped, and I always seem to forget what I'd read, so I'd reread this chapter from page 232, this paragraph and everything always seems to sound new. So don't even ask me what is in page 1 to 231. i don't even dare to look. but I'll reread this book after my general relativity course, hopefully it will make more sense. "
