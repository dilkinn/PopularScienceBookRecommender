The Universe, of course, is our own. And Roundworld is Earth. As the wizards watch their accidental creation grow, we follow the story of our universe from the primal singularity of the Big Bang to the Internet and beyond. Through this original Terry Pratchett story (with intervening chapters from Cohen and Stewart) we discover how puny and insignificant individual lives are against a cosmic backdrop of creation and disaster. Yet, paradoxically, we see how the richness of a universe based on rules, has led to a complex world and at least one species that tried to get a grip of what was going on. The Science of Discworld is a 1999 book by novelist Terry Pratchett and popular science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. The book alternates between a typically absurd Discworld story and serious scientific exposition after each chapter.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه مارس سال 2016 میلادیدیسک ورلد (دنیای دیسک) یک سری کتابهای فانتزی هستند، که «تری پرچت»، نویسندهه ی انگلیسی، آنها را نوشته ‌است؛ داستان‌های این سری در جهانی با نام «دیسک‌ورلد» می‌گذرند، که صفحه ‌ای مسطح است، و بر روی شانه‌ های چهار فیل عظیم ‌الجثه قرار دارد؛ این فیل‌ها نیز، بر روی پشت یک «لاک‌پشت غول‌آسا»، با نام «آتوئین بزرگ» قرار دارند؛ در این سری، بارها از کتاب‌های نویسندگانی همچون «جی.آر.آر تالکین»، «رابرت هاوارد»، «اچ.پی لاوکرافت»، و «ویلیام شکسپیر»، به گونه ای خنده دار استفاده شده ‌است؛ از سری «دیسک‌ورلد» بیش از «هشتاد میلیون نسخه» در «سی و هفت زبان»، تا روز نگارش این نگاره به فروش رفته ‌اند؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 25/04/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

Now, what kept me reading was the story of the wizards. I must point out that it was difficult not to cheat and skip over all the science chapters. But I would have enjoyed this book even more if I was younger."

Discworld is the flat world, carried through space on the back of a giant turtle, which has been the source of, so far, twenty-three novels, four maps, an encyclopaedia, two animated series, t-shirts, scarves, models, badges, beer, embroidery, pens, posters, and probably, by the time this is published, talcum powder and body splash (if not, it can only be a matter of time).----------------------------Two of my favorite things combined - science and Discworld. ----------------------------There is just NO WAY this book can disappoint me. Not possible.----------------------------I am excited like ... I don't know, insert your own favorite metaphor here. Yi-peee!"
3,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"Back in the late 90s, there was a whole slew of ""Science Of...."" books. The science of Star Trek, X-Files, Star Wars, all of them did their best to explain the fantastic in terms of what we already knew about science. They weren't trying to disprove these worlds - saying that warp speed is impossible, for example, or how The Force violates any number of natural laws - but rather they tried to figure out how we could explain these things, and perhaps, someday, make them real.This isn't that sort of book.The Discworld, as the writers say straight out, runs on stories, on some mysterious element that we might call Narrativium. Things happen a certain way because that's how they're supposed to happen. The eighth son of an eighth son HAS to become a wizard, even if he turns out to be a daughter. And a million-to-one shot HAS to come off, because the Story demands it.In this story, the wizards at the Unseen University at Ankh-Morpork have a little problem. Their thaumic reactor, built in the middle of the squash court, is pumping out dangerous levels of magic - enough to turn most of the Ankh-Morpork plains into the playground of horrible betentacled Things from the Dungeon Dimension. So, in order to siphon off the massive amounts of magic being generated from splitting the thaum, they channel the extra energy into the Roundworld Project. Essentially they create a universe where magic - and Narrativium - do not exist. It's a place that works on its own laws but, unlike the Discworld, it does not work towards any particular end.Our universe, as it turns out.The wizards watch our world form, try to figure out the rules, and watch it progress. They see life emerge, make its best effort towards intelligence, and then get wiped out. Over and over.The wizards give us an interesting perspective - the creation of the universe and the evolution of intelligent life collapsed down to about a week. They're able to use a kind of magical VR to watch things in real time, but still, they have a wide view of Earth history that allows commentary on the other part of the book....Interleaved with the Discworld story about the Project, Stewart and Cohen talk about the science that the wizards are watching. Where the stars came from, how the moon got formed, what primeval Earth might have looked like, how life arose and, most importantly, how it managed to stick around for so long.Viewed on a long scale, the Earth is not really a very hospitable place. Giant rocks and snowballs falling from the sky every few million years, ice ages and volcanic catastrophes, disasters of nearly every imaginable magnitude. Species rising, flourishing and vanishing without so much as a ripple in the fossil record.... Nice, pleasant weather, like we have now, is relatively rare.As Rincewind says, ""This world is an anvil. Everything here is between a rock and a hard place. Every single thing on it is the descendant of creatures that have survived everything the world could throw at them. I just hope they never get angry....""Pratchett is a fantastic writer, as we all know, and somehow Stewart and Cohen manage to keep up with him. The chapters on hard science are just as interesting and entertaining as those with the wizards. They illuminate the concepts that the wizards don't understand (""There are no turtles anywhere!"") and set you up for what will come next. It's a rare book that can educate and entertain with consistency, and this book achieves it.Next up will be the followup books. Let's see how they hold up...."
4,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17622935-tristia-watson,2,"Imagine sitting down to read a book from your favorite author. At the end of the first chapter your friend takes away the book and replaces it with a transcript of the show Cosmos with Neil deGrasse Tyson. You like Cosmos and Mr Tyson is interesting so you read it. At the first break, your friend takes away Cosmos and replaces it with the book by your favorite author that you had started reading. Now imagine doing this 45 more times and you have the idea behind The Science of Discworld.The Terry Pratchett book is ""The Lost Continent"" (I believe) and it gets interrupted at odd places because Mr Pratchett doesn't do chapters. The science is presented in an interesting way by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen but a lot of the chapters drag on especially when the Pratchett chapters fly by. They've made the effort to find relevant parts of the Pratchett book to match up with relevant parts to the science that they want to discuss but sometimes its a stretch.The book was okay, not sure I would recommended it and I certainly don't want to read the next two books in the series!"
5,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25923230-youkneek,3,"The Science of Discworld is an odd sort of Discworld book. Based on the name, I had thought it was going to delve into more detail about the fictional workings of the Discworld. Like, say, how the giant turtle and the elephants stay alive outside of an atmosphere or how water on the Discworld gets replenished when it keeps falling off the disc… If that last sentence makes it sound like I’ve gone off the deep end, then you clearly haven’t tried reading Discworld.The science in this book is actually more about the real science of our own world, with a very thin Discworld story interspersed between the science bits. The Discworld part of the story takes place in the Unseen University, where the wizards end up creating a simulation of the birth of a universe remarkably like ours, followed by many million years’ worth of evolution on “roundworld”, a planet that is also remarkably like ours. Each short Discworld-based chapter is then followed up with a science chapter discussing topics related to what’s going on in the Discworld story.For the first 25% of this book, I wasn’t sure I was going to make it through to the end. The science parts were boring me to tears because they mostly covered either terribly basic concepts or entirely theoretical topics that I wasn’t very interested in reading about. As it went on, it got more interesting, although there were still scattered bits of boredom here and there. If this had been a book about computer science, I probably would have enjoyed the theoretical parts equally as well as the practical parts. Actually, even though it wasn’t at all the focus of the story, computer science did get a few mentions here and there, and I particularly enjoyed those parts. When it comes to the natural sciences, however, my interest isn’t strong enough to sustain me through theory. I enjoyed it when the authors discussed what we do know and why we think we know it, whereas the various speculations about things we have no way of knowing for sure were more frustrating to me than interesting.The Discworld part of the story was very short, but amusing. It served as a nice way to break up the science bits and provide some humor. However, the story had a major logical flaw that annoyed me to no end. (view spoiler)[It’s supposed to be physically impossible for anybody to get into the Roundworld experiment, but Hex is able to use suits to let people enter Roundworld virtually. Rincewind is the first person made to try this, and the luggage shows up physically in Roundworld, supposedly following Rincewind there. But Rincewind’s actual, physical body is still in Unseen University. There’s no logical reason that the luggage should have ended up inside the experiment. It was only done as cheap story trick to allow the wizards to get materials to and from Roundworld by having them transported via the luggage. (hide spoiler)]So… will I read the second science book? Yes, I think so, once I get to that point in the publication order. Whether or not I read the last two will probably depend on my reaction to the second one."

7,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833607-criticalsock,5,"My girlfriend tried to buy this book for me while we were browsing a second hand bookshop. I said ""No thanks"" and I said it firmly because I really don't like those series tie in books that people write which might have the original authors name on the cover but are actually written by second rate hacks hired by the publisher to milk the last drop of cash from the cow.Luckily my girlfriend ignored me completely and bought it anyway because this is not one of those books.This book doesn't try and give a scientific explanation for how a discworld could exist supported on the backs of four elephants or how discworld light can move slowly enough for you to watch it wash over the landscape. Instead it describes our universe, the solar system, earth and the life on it through the eyes of people living on the discworld. It does it darned well too."
8,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9063055-alexa-billow,4,"Recommended for people who have had the following thoughts:""I've heard a lot about this Discworld business, but I wish it had, like, science, you know?""""I love Discworld, but I wish there was a book that was even more of the wizards of Unseen University being dicks to each other.""""I love popular science nonfiction, but what if I could read a fantasy novel at the same time?""The wizards of Unseen University (and Rincewind) have accidentally created a pocket universe, and in that universe is a world which, against all narrative good sense, appears to be round and not carried on the back of a turtle at all. It runs on some simple rules and a bit of bloody-minded stubbornness. Every time our wizardly friends poke it with a stick, the authors jump in to explain the science of what happens, from the Big Bang to the evolution of humanity. It's a brisk survey of the sciences, returning to the wizards every other chapter for some more stick-poking.The science bits draw heavily on a conceit they call ""lies-to-children,"" by which they mean the oversimplifications you use in teaching to introduce difficult concepts. Things like the planetary model of the atom--completely wrong, but pedagogically useful. Lies-to-children aren't bad; they're necessary. But once you've grasped the basics, the lie-to-children can be swept away and replaced with the facts. Except they aren't, always, which is where the authors of the book figure they come in.I did notice some inaccuracies, especially in the paleontology bits, although I can't entirely decide whether to chalk them up to the book being published 14 years ago, or actually being wrong. And in the molecular biology bits (my actual area of expertise) there were some lies-to-children that never actually got corrected. But in fairness, the book's already 400 pages long. They didn't have time.In spite of all that I enthusiastically recommend this book. It's fun! You don't get someone like Terry Pratchett every century, but the science chapters are almost as cheeky and entertaining as the fiction bits. Rating: there's 3 more books in the series and my birthday is in October please and thank."
9,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9107978-aaron,4,"Don't expect your typical lighthearted novel as you'd normally get from Terry Pratchett. Instead, you will find a hilarious, whimsical look at the deep scientific theories and explanations of how scientists believe our universe and world works. If you've avoided topics like gravitational forces, quantum theory or evolution, then this is the book for you! Seriously.The magic of this book is how the authors take the unreality of Discworld and use it to show the reader how our universe and world work. The wizards of Unseen University take us on a time traveling journey as they peer into our universe beginning at its inception and then periodically along the way until they glimpse us and then our possible future. The beauty of this framework is how complex theories and scientific discoveries are broken down into manageable pieces of information.The authors dismiss the idea of God or gods in favor of evolutionary theory dropping in subtle remarks and even a few not-so-subtle quips. While they admit to science being a huge amount of guessing and not knowing, they refuse to admit the possibility of a Creator.The content is such that young readers would really be lost and even many teens would find this hard to understand. The only curse word doesn't even count in my book because it really was used in context. Sex comes up quite often, but only as it relates as a motivational factor for animals. I'd say this book is really suited to older teens and adults, regardless if they are familiar with Terry Pratchett's works or not."
10,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10942210-john,1,"First book I DNF'd after 30%. I wanted a good fiction and what we got was a class on the creation of the universe. Eh, so disappointed."
11,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,5,"Although I loved the book, the title is maybe a little misleading. Unlike The Science of Star Trek or The Science of Harry Potter, which will explain in exhaustive detail how it might be scientifically possible to build a transporter or a flying broom, The Science of Discworld uses the wizards of Discworld to explain science in our world. Which on the Disc is called Roundworld, and is a wizard's experiment to see how a world without magic or narrativium works.There's no attempt to explain anything that happens in Discworld, because a) there can be no scientific explanation and b) it is explained; it's all magic and narrativium, the element that makes stories work. So to wizards, Roundworld's lack of storyline is baffling and frustrating. That's the Discworld half of the story, their bafflement at how Roundworld evolution works. They have, after all, met the God of Evolution on the Disc.The science half is woven in between Discworld chapters. As Roundworld evolves, the science chapters cut in to explain what's going on and why. I don't have a clue in the world how accurate the science is, but it was enjoyable to read. I'm not usually a reader of hard science. To be totally honest, I'm here for the Discworld story, and nothing else. But I was kept reading through all of the science, which is something for me. At the same time, you really could read only the Discworld sections without missing much. You'd have to really like reading the wizards, though. But honestly, who doesn't?"
12,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2403903-ralph-mcewen,5,I think this is a really good book. I was surprised to find that it had alternating chapters of Discworld focus (entertainment) and our real world focus (science). I think many people would enjoy this Discworld portion and get a better grasp of what science can and can not accomplish by reading this book . I would get a kick out of seeing this book listed in the bibliography of some high school science report. There is enough real information to be used in that manner. I think this format of teach a chapter and entertain for chapter would be greatly successful in general education text for schools. It could keep the pupils engaged enough so they would learn without struggling. Difficult to do but boy it might just be worth it.
13,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17550624-steve,5,"This book is incredibly hard to categorize, it contains elements of non-fiction, fiction, humour and some good old admonishing. It was, in a word, brilliant, and while there very definitely was a plot, it kept getting pushed aside for explanations, both serious and humourous. I very much enjoyed the climax and the resolution. I will have to continue with the series, and try and contain my absolute missing of Pratchett."
14,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45282998-anneke,4,"For me personally it is always harder to read a non-fiction book. It is a shame, because this book is actually a nice mix between science and fiction. Still I struggled at times to keep focussed, eventough the topics are interesting enough. Still 4 stars because I think it is a great idea to mix the information with the storyline like this."

Some prescient comments about the state of politics in the world. "
17,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/639730-dan,4,"There are a ton of these auxiliary-Discworld books out there, and most of them have typically been difficult to find. Luckily, it looks like they're getting easier to track down, which is exciting.I wasn't sure what to expect opening the book, but I'm happy with how it was presented -- alternating chapters of the Wizards (who I never felt had enough books in the latter half of Pratchett's writings) and a deep dive into a pop science topic. While the information in many cases is already dated (!), I still learned quite a bit. And, of course, loved spending more time with the Wizards... good prep for my eventual Discworld re-read.Recommended for the die-hard Discworld fan."
18,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2150560-cyk,5,"OK..first off I'd like too point out i have a slightly better than average grasp on the 3 main sciences...but only slightly.the science isn't really ""dumbed down"" much, but even if that fly's right over your head the comedy is still gold and worth a read.the way Terry wrote this was in alternating chapters, one with stories of ""our"" science, then one with the sciences from the last chapter looked at and explained from the point of view of the diskworld wizards looking at it ""in a bottle""....i guarantee you won't look at a rainbow the same way again, and you'll dread the questions 5 year old's might ask."

As the wizards watch their accidental creation grow, we follow the story of our universe from the primal singularity of the Big Bang to the Internet and beyond.Being a huge lover of science and discworld this was just perfect for me the book is layed in a way that you have 1 chapter with the wizards of Unseen university doing something weird and wonderful but that something would always have something to do with the next subject chapter. For example the wizards get bored and start making comets and snowballs and throwing them at planets and the next chapter was about the reason comets exist and the rest of the book play out like this. So you get a little technical language of science and then you'd get the fun and wacky wizards it's a great mix. I think the only downside for me is that this book was wrote in 1999 and it now being 2019 i feel that maybe in the 20 years since some of the science might have changed or been updated or proved wrong completely so that's a worrie but apart from that the book is solid it's informative and fun your always in a state of wonder unlike school when you was being taught or AkA ""lies to children"" so if you have children or you yourself are intrested in science or discworld or both i would say you should defiantly pick this one up.5/5 stars on goodreads 100/100 Ginger points"

Not only is it most definitely not about the science of Discworld, it is also not some sort of shameless cash-in on a well-loved author.What this book is, then, is a 'popular science' book, dressed up with some (typically amusing) interludes featuring the wizards of Unseen University as they try to understand how our world can work without magic and stories. Pratchett was always keen to educate, and here he tries to condense science into a single volume, using co-authors and science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen to do the hard lifting of explaining the basics and discoveries of physics, chemistry and biology.The authors try to explain how everything really works, although they do acknowledge there is bound to be simplification (or 'lies to children') as some of the concepts are hugely complex. But it never gets boring or too difficult to read.A superb book for anyone who just wants to understand a little bit more about science. And I still use the space elevator analogy to this day. A gem of a book, shame about the title."

I found all these science chapters to be incredibly tedious and boring.  Therefore, this review will mainly be my thoughts on the other portion of the book. ~Spoiler Free~POSITIVE ASPECTS:+ The characters in this book were phenomenal. They're so entertaining and hilarious.+ The humor in this book is actually funny. I laughed out loud several times. NEGATIVE ASPECTS:- Obviously, I hated the science chapters.- Sometimes this book was so confusing. The reason behind a character's actions were left unexplained on several occasions, or the motive just didn't make sense. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be humorous or not, but it just annoyed me.- I have never seen so many typos in a book before. There was a lot of punctuation left out, and spelling errors (not just European spelling).OVERALL:I think this book had potential and could've been so much better than it is. However, I look forward to reading the actual Discworld series. Rating: 2.5 out of 5 stars"
26,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16103061-kathleen,3,"Okay, this is the reason it took me forever to get on with the Great Discworld Reread, because I kind of got stuck on this book for two months.The Science of Discworld is half a Discworld novel (well, more of a novella, since it's actually quite short) about the wizards first inventing magical nuclear power and then using it to create Roundworld, aka our Earth. The other half (or more like three-quarters) of the book is scientists Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen explaining the physical and biological forces behind the corresponding developments on Earth. These include topics like evolution, astrophysics, the probable development of planets and stars, elements, nuclear power, and the origins of life.Now, the scientific sections of the book are very clearly written and very understandable for the layperson. I'm just really not scientifically-minded, and so it was kind of a slog for me to get through those parts. The Discworld novella contained within is hilarious, though, and very much worth the reading. I also would actually recommend reading the scientific sections, but maybe take your time about it. They're more rewarding if you can let them sink in."
27,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7916772-silent-count,4,"I wonder if math and sciences would be more popular if they had writers of Pratchett's quality to write the textbooks. I mean, a phone book provides information but isn't exactly pleasurable to read, much like many textbooks I've come across which are undoubtedly informative but dull and utterly unenjoyable. Would there be more (for example) biologists if the writing quality of the textbooks were such that students would want to read them rather than being forced to by a teacher or parent?Therein lies the magic of 'The Science of Discworld'. It's a tour of various topics in science written in a vivid and enjoyable fashion. The hard science is interspersed with chapters of pure (wizardly) fantasy which serve to cleanse the palette before the next dose of science. It's an unusual approach but I find that it works well.I personally wonder if, had I read this book some 20 years ago, I'd have become a chemist or physicist rather than a computer programmer."

Normally I'll devour a Pratchett book in a few hours and delight in every moment. This one took me a week and a half, and felt like a slog. The reason for this is that it's not just a Pratchett book - it's a Pratchett book split up into chapters which are interspersed with science lectures. The science is interesting and Steward and Cohen make an effort to make it accessible to laypersons, which I appreciated, but it was jarring to be hauled out of the story every other chapter for another look at prehistory.With the two other authors and ""The Science of"" in the title, I figured this wouldn't be a typical Discworld book, but I was hoping I'd like it anyway.

First is via our own beginnings... from the big bang, the creation of atoms, the creation of worlds, the evolution of life & the evolution of intelligence. The second is comparing this through a parallel narrative set in the Unseen University where the wizards are studying a newly-formed universe in a ball. This is to help our own mind-boggling science seem a little easier to comprehend.I enjoyed the wizard's story part of the book. The early physics parts made me remember why I quit A-level physics (my brain tended to steam quite a bit). as soon as we hit biology & evolution I was in my element.A good way to get to know & understand the formation of EVERYTHING.Shame about the crabs!"

Discworld is the flat world, carried through space on the back of a giant turtle, which has been the source of, so far, twenty-three novels, four maps, an encyclopaedia, two animated series, t-shirts, scarves, models, badges, beer, embroidery, pens, posters, and probably, by the time this is published, talcum powder and body splash (if not, it can only be a matter of time).----------------------------Two of my favorite things combined - science and Discworld. ----------------------------There is just NO WAY this book can disappoint me. Not possible.----------------------------I am excited like ... I don't know, insert your own favorite metaphor here. Yi-peee!"
33,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"Back in the late 90s, there was a whole slew of ""Science Of...."" books. The science of Star Trek, X-Files, Star Wars, all of them did their best to explain the fantastic in terms of what we already knew about science. They weren't trying to disprove these worlds - saying that warp speed is impossible, for example, or how The Force violates any number of natural laws - but rather they tried to figure out how we could explain these things, and perhaps, someday, make them real.This isn't that sort of book.The Discworld, as the writers say straight out, runs on stories, on some mysterious element that we might call Narrativium. Things happen a certain way because that's how they're supposed to happen. The eighth son of an eighth son HAS to become a wizard, even if he turns out to be a daughter. And a million-to-one shot HAS to come off, because the Story demands it.In this story, the wizards at the Unseen University at Ankh-Morpork have a little problem. Their thaumic reactor, built in the middle of the squash court, is pumping out dangerous levels of magic - enough to turn most of the Ankh-Morpork plains into the playground of horrible betentacled Things from the Dungeon Dimension. So, in order to siphon off the massive amounts of magic being generated from splitting the thaum, they channel the extra energy into the Roundworld Project. Essentially they create a universe where magic - and Narrativium - do not exist. It's a place that works on its own laws but, unlike the Discworld, it does not work towards any particular end.Our universe, as it turns out.The wizards watch our world form, try to figure out the rules, and watch it progress. They see life emerge, make its best effort towards intelligence, and then get wiped out. Over and over.The wizards give us an interesting perspective - the creation of the universe and the evolution of intelligent life collapsed down to about a week. They're able to use a kind of magical VR to watch things in real time, but still, they have a wide view of Earth history that allows commentary on the other part of the book....Interleaved with the Discworld story about the Project, Stewart and Cohen talk about the science that the wizards are watching. Where the stars came from, how the moon got formed, what primeval Earth might have looked like, how life arose and, most importantly, how it managed to stick around for so long.Viewed on a long scale, the Earth is not really a very hospitable place. Giant rocks and snowballs falling from the sky every few million years, ice ages and volcanic catastrophes, disasters of nearly every imaginable magnitude. Species rising, flourishing and vanishing without so much as a ripple in the fossil record.... Nice, pleasant weather, like we have now, is relatively rare.As Rincewind says, ""This world is an anvil. Everything here is between a rock and a hard place. Every single thing on it is the descendant of creatures that have survived everything the world could throw at them. I just hope they never get angry....""Pratchett is a fantastic writer, as we all know, and somehow Stewart and Cohen manage to keep up with him. The chapters on hard science are just as interesting and entertaining as those with the wizards. They illuminate the concepts that the wizards don't understand (""There are no turtles anywhere!"") and set you up for what will come next. It's a rare book that can educate and entertain with consistency, and this book achieves it.Next up will be the followup books. Let's see how they hold up...."
34,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17622935-tristia-watson,2,"Imagine sitting down to read a book from your favorite author. At the end of the first chapter your friend takes away the book and replaces it with a transcript of the show Cosmos with Neil deGrasse Tyson. You like Cosmos and Mr Tyson is interesting so you read it. At the first break, your friend takes away Cosmos and replaces it with the book by your favorite author that you had started reading. Now imagine doing this 45 more times and you have the idea behind The Science of Discworld.The Terry Pratchett book is ""The Lost Continent"" (I believe) and it gets interrupted at odd places because Mr Pratchett doesn't do chapters. The science is presented in an interesting way by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen but a lot of the chapters drag on especially when the Pratchett chapters fly by. They've made the effort to find relevant parts of the Pratchett book to match up with relevant parts to the science that they want to discuss but sometimes its a stretch.The book was okay, not sure I would recommended it and I certainly don't want to read the next two books in the series!"
35,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25923230-youkneek,3,"The Science of Discworld is an odd sort of Discworld book. Based on the name, I had thought it was going to delve into more detail about the fictional workings of the Discworld. Like, say, how the giant turtle and the elephants stay alive outside of an atmosphere or how water on the Discworld gets replenished when it keeps falling off the disc… If that last sentence makes it sound like I’ve gone off the deep end, then you clearly haven’t tried reading Discworld.The science in this book is actually more about the real science of our own world, with a very thin Discworld story interspersed between the science bits. The Discworld part of the story takes place in the Unseen University, where the wizards end up creating a simulation of the birth of a universe remarkably like ours, followed by many million years’ worth of evolution on “roundworld”, a planet that is also remarkably like ours. Each short Discworld-based chapter is then followed up with a science chapter discussing topics related to what’s going on in the Discworld story.For the first 25% of this book, I wasn’t sure I was going to make it through to the end. The science parts were boring me to tears because they mostly covered either terribly basic concepts or entirely theoretical topics that I wasn’t very interested in reading about. As it went on, it got more interesting, although there were still scattered bits of boredom here and there. If this had been a book about computer science, I probably would have enjoyed the theoretical parts equally as well as the practical parts. Actually, even though it wasn’t at all the focus of the story, computer science did get a few mentions here and there, and I particularly enjoyed those parts. When it comes to the natural sciences, however, my interest isn’t strong enough to sustain me through theory. I enjoyed it when the authors discussed what we do know and why we think we know it, whereas the various speculations about things we have no way of knowing for sure were more frustrating to me than interesting.The Discworld part of the story was very short, but amusing. It served as a nice way to break up the science bits and provide some humor. However, the story had a major logical flaw that annoyed me to no end. (view spoiler)[It’s supposed to be physically impossible for anybody to get into the Roundworld experiment, but Hex is able to use suits to let people enter Roundworld virtually. Rincewind is the first person made to try this, and the luggage shows up physically in Roundworld, supposedly following Rincewind there. But Rincewind’s actual, physical body is still in Unseen University. There’s no logical reason that the luggage should have ended up inside the experiment. It was only done as cheap story trick to allow the wizards to get materials to and from Roundworld by having them transported via the luggage. (hide spoiler)]So… will I read the second science book? Yes, I think so, once I get to that point in the publication order. Whether or not I read the last two will probably depend on my reaction to the second one."

37,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833607-criticalsock,5,"My girlfriend tried to buy this book for me while we were browsing a second hand bookshop. I said ""No thanks"" and I said it firmly because I really don't like those series tie in books that people write which might have the original authors name on the cover but are actually written by second rate hacks hired by the publisher to milk the last drop of cash from the cow.Luckily my girlfriend ignored me completely and bought it anyway because this is not one of those books.This book doesn't try and give a scientific explanation for how a discworld could exist supported on the backs of four elephants or how discworld light can move slowly enough for you to watch it wash over the landscape. Instead it describes our universe, the solar system, earth and the life on it through the eyes of people living on the discworld. It does it darned well too."
38,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9063055-alexa-billow,4,"Recommended for people who have had the following thoughts:""I've heard a lot about this Discworld business, but I wish it had, like, science, you know?""""I love Discworld, but I wish there was a book that was even more of the wizards of Unseen University being dicks to each other.""""I love popular science nonfiction, but what if I could read a fantasy novel at the same time?""The wizards of Unseen University (and Rincewind) have accidentally created a pocket universe, and in that universe is a world which, against all narrative good sense, appears to be round and not carried on the back of a turtle at all. It runs on some simple rules and a bit of bloody-minded stubbornness. Every time our wizardly friends poke it with a stick, the authors jump in to explain the science of what happens, from the Big Bang to the evolution of humanity. It's a brisk survey of the sciences, returning to the wizards every other chapter for some more stick-poking.The science bits draw heavily on a conceit they call ""lies-to-children,"" by which they mean the oversimplifications you use in teaching to introduce difficult concepts. Things like the planetary model of the atom--completely wrong, but pedagogically useful. Lies-to-children aren't bad; they're necessary. But once you've grasped the basics, the lie-to-children can be swept away and replaced with the facts. Except they aren't, always, which is where the authors of the book figure they come in.I did notice some inaccuracies, especially in the paleontology bits, although I can't entirely decide whether to chalk them up to the book being published 14 years ago, or actually being wrong. And in the molecular biology bits (my actual area of expertise) there were some lies-to-children that never actually got corrected. But in fairness, the book's already 400 pages long. They didn't have time.In spite of all that I enthusiastically recommend this book. It's fun! You don't get someone like Terry Pratchett every century, but the science chapters are almost as cheeky and entertaining as the fiction bits. Rating: there's 3 more books in the series and my birthday is in October please and thank."
39,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9107978-aaron,4,"Don't expect your typical lighthearted novel as you'd normally get from Terry Pratchett. Instead, you will find a hilarious, whimsical look at the deep scientific theories and explanations of how scientists believe our universe and world works. If you've avoided topics like gravitational forces, quantum theory or evolution, then this is the book for you! Seriously.The magic of this book is how the authors take the unreality of Discworld and use it to show the reader how our universe and world work. The wizards of Unseen University take us on a time traveling journey as they peer into our universe beginning at its inception and then periodically along the way until they glimpse us and then our possible future. The beauty of this framework is how complex theories and scientific discoveries are broken down into manageable pieces of information.The authors dismiss the idea of God or gods in favor of evolutionary theory dropping in subtle remarks and even a few not-so-subtle quips. While they admit to science being a huge amount of guessing and not knowing, they refuse to admit the possibility of a Creator.The content is such that young readers would really be lost and even many teens would find this hard to understand. The only curse word doesn't even count in my book because it really was used in context. Sex comes up quite often, but only as it relates as a motivational factor for animals. I'd say this book is really suited to older teens and adults, regardless if they are familiar with Terry Pratchett's works or not."

41,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,5,"Although I loved the book, the title is maybe a little misleading. Unlike The Science of Star Trek or The Science of Harry Potter, which will explain in exhaustive detail how it might be scientifically possible to build a transporter or a flying broom, The Science of Discworld uses the wizards of Discworld to explain science in our world. Which on the Disc is called Roundworld, and is a wizard's experiment to see how a world without magic or narrativium works.There's no attempt to explain anything that happens in Discworld, because a) there can be no scientific explanation and b) it is explained; it's all magic and narrativium, the element that makes stories work. So to wizards, Roundworld's lack of storyline is baffling and frustrating. That's the Discworld half of the story, their bafflement at how Roundworld evolution works. They have, after all, met the God of Evolution on the Disc.The science half is woven in between Discworld chapters. As Roundworld evolves, the science chapters cut in to explain what's going on and why. I don't have a clue in the world how accurate the science is, but it was enjoyable to read. I'm not usually a reader of hard science. To be totally honest, I'm here for the Discworld story, and nothing else. But I was kept reading through all of the science, which is something for me. At the same time, you really could read only the Discworld sections without missing much. You'd have to really like reading the wizards, though. But honestly, who doesn't?"
42,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2403903-ralph-mcewen,5,I think this is a really good book. I was surprised to find that it had alternating chapters of Discworld focus (entertainment) and our real world focus (science). I think many people would enjoy this Discworld portion and get a better grasp of what science can and can not accomplish by reading this book . I would get a kick out of seeing this book listed in the bibliography of some high school science report. There is enough real information to be used in that manner. I think this format of teach a chapter and entertain for chapter would be greatly successful in general education text for schools. It could keep the pupils engaged enough so they would learn without struggling. Difficult to do but boy it might just be worth it.
43,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17550624-steve,5,"This book is incredibly hard to categorize, it contains elements of non-fiction, fiction, humour and some good old admonishing. It was, in a word, brilliant, and while there very definitely was a plot, it kept getting pushed aside for explanations, both serious and humourous. I very much enjoyed the climax and the resolution. I will have to continue with the series, and try and contain my absolute missing of Pratchett."
44,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45282998-anneke,4,"For me personally it is always harder to read a non-fiction book.

Luckily, it looks like they're getting easier to track down, which is exciting.I wasn't sure what to expect opening the book, but I'm happy with how it was presented -- alternating chapters of the Wizards (who I never felt had enough books in the latter half of Pratchett's writings) and a deep dive into a pop science topic. While the information in many cases is already dated (!), I still learned quite a bit. And, of course, loved spending more time with the Wizards... good prep for my eventual Discworld re-read.Recommended for the die-hard Discworld fan."

The Universe, of course, is our own. And Roundworld is Earth. As the wizards watch their accidental creation grow, we follow the story of our universe from the primal singularity of the Big Bang to the Internet and beyond.Being a huge lover of science and discworld this was just perfect for me the book is layed in a way that you have 1 chapter with the wizards of Unseen university doing something weird and wonderful but that something would always have something to do with the next subject chapter. For example the wizards get bored and start making comets and snowballs and throwing them at planets and the next chapter was about the reason comets exist and the rest of the book play out like this. So you get a little technical language of science and then you'd get the fun and wacky wizards it's a great mix. I think the only downside for me is that this book was wrote in 1999 and it now being 2019 i feel that maybe in the 20 years since some of the science might have changed or been updated or proved wrong completely so that's a worrie but apart from that the book is solid it's informative and fun your always in a state of wonder unlike school when you was being taught or AkA ""lies to children"" so if you have children or you yourself are intrested in science or discworld or both i would say you should defiantly pick this one up.5/5 stars on goodreads 100/100 Ginger points"

Not only is it most definitely not about the science of Discworld, it is also not some sort of shameless cash-in on a well-loved author.What this book is, then, is a 'popular science' book, dressed up with some (typically amusing) interludes featuring the wizards of Unseen University as they try to understand how our world can work without magic and stories. Pratchett was always keen to educate, and here he tries to condense science into a single volume, using co-authors and science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen to do the hard lifting of explaining the basics and discoveries of physics, chemistry and biology.The authors try to explain how everything really works, although they do acknowledge there is bound to be simplification (or 'lies to children') as some of the concepts are hugely complex. But it never gets boring or too difficult to read.A superb book for anyone who just wants to understand a little bit more about science. And I still use the space elevator analogy to this day.

I found all these science chapters to be incredibly tedious and boring.  Therefore, this review will mainly be my thoughts on the other portion of the book. ~Spoiler Free~POSITIVE ASPECTS:+ The characters in this book were phenomenal. They're so entertaining and hilarious.+ The humor in this book is actually funny. I laughed out loud several times. NEGATIVE ASPECTS:- Obviously, I hated the science chapters.- Sometimes this book was so confusing. The reason behind a character's actions were left unexplained on several occasions, or the motive just didn't make sense. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be humorous or not, but it just annoyed me.- I have never seen so many typos in a book before. There was a lot of punctuation left out, and spelling errors (not just European spelling).OVERALL:I think this book had potential and could've been so much better than it is. However, I look forward to reading the actual Discworld series. Rating: 2.5 out of 5 stars"
56,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16103061-kathleen,3,"Okay, this is the reason it took me forever to get on with the Great Discworld Reread, because I kind of got stuck on this book for two months.The Science of Discworld is half a Discworld novel (well, more of a novella, since it's actually quite short) about the wizards first inventing magical nuclear power and then using it to create Roundworld, aka our Earth. The other half (or more like three-quarters) of the book is scientists Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen explaining the physical and biological forces behind the corresponding developments on Earth. These include topics like evolution, astrophysics, the probable development of planets and stars, elements, nuclear power, and the origins of life.Now, the scientific sections of the book are very clearly written and very understandable for the layperson. I'm just really not scientifically-minded, and so it was kind of a slog for me to get through those parts. The Discworld novella contained within is hilarious, though, and very much worth the reading. I also would actually recommend reading the scientific sections, but maybe take your time about it. They're more rewarding if you can let them sink in."

I mean, a phone book provides information but isn't exactly pleasurable to read, much like many textbooks I've come across which are undoubtedly informative but dull and utterly unenjoyable. Would there be more (for example) biologists if the writing quality of the textbooks were such that students would want to read them rather than being forced to by a teacher or parent?Therein lies the magic of 'The Science of Discworld'. It's a tour of various topics in science written in a vivid and enjoyable fashion. The hard science is interspersed with chapters of pure (wizardly) fantasy which serve to cleanse the palette before the next dose of science. It's an unusual approach but I find that it works well.I personally wonder if, had I read this book some 20 years ago, I'd have become a chemist or physicist rather than a computer programmer."

Normally I'll devour a Pratchett book in a few hours and delight in every moment. This one took me a week and a half, and felt like a slog. The reason for this is that it's not just a Pratchett book - it's a Pratchett book split up into chapters which are interspersed with science lectures. The science is interesting and Steward and Cohen make an effort to make it accessible to laypersons, which I appreciated, but it was jarring to be hauled out of the story every other chapter for another look at prehistory.With the two other authors and ""The Science of"" in the title, I figured this wouldn't be a typical Discworld book, but I was hoping I'd like it anyway.

The second is comparing this through a parallel narrative set in the Unseen University where the wizards are studying a newly-formed universe in a ball. This is to help our own mind-boggling science seem a little easier to comprehend.I enjoyed the wizard's story part of the book. The early physics parts made me remember why I quit A-level physics (my brain tended to steam quite a bit). as soon as we hit biology & evolution I was in my element.A good way to get to know & understand the formation of EVERYTHING.Shame about the crabs!"

Discworld is the flat world, carried through space on the back of a giant turtle, which has been the source of, so far, twenty-three novels, four maps, an encyclopaedia, two animated series, t-shirts, scarves, models, badges, beer, embroidery, pens, posters, and probably, by the time this is published, talcum powder and body splash (if not, it can only be a matter of time).----------------------------Two of my favorite things combined - science and Discworld. ----------------------------There is just NO WAY this book can disappoint me. Not possible.----------------------------I am excited like ... I don't know, insert your own favorite metaphor here. Yi-peee!"
63,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"Back in the late 90s, there was a whole slew of ""Science Of...."" books. The science of Star Trek, X-Files, Star Wars, all of them did their best to explain the fantastic in terms of what we already knew about science. They weren't trying to disprove these worlds - saying that warp speed is impossible, for example, or how The Force violates any number of natural laws - but rather they tried to figure out how we could explain these things, and perhaps, someday, make them real.This isn't that sort of book.The Discworld, as the writers say straight out, runs on stories, on some mysterious element that we might call Narrativium. Things happen a certain way because that's how they're supposed to happen. The eighth son of an eighth son HAS to become a wizard, even if he turns out to be a daughter. And a million-to-one shot HAS to come off, because the Story demands it.In this story, the wizards at the Unseen University at Ankh-Morpork have a little problem. Their thaumic reactor, built in the middle of the squash court, is pumping out dangerous levels of magic - enough to turn most of the Ankh-Morpork plains into the playground of horrible betentacled Things from the Dungeon Dimension. So, in order to siphon off the massive amounts of magic being generated from splitting the thaum, they channel the extra energy into the Roundworld Project. Essentially they create a universe where magic - and Narrativium - do not exist. It's a place that works on its own laws but, unlike the Discworld, it does not work towards any particular end.Our universe, as it turns out.The wizards watch our world form, try to figure out the rules, and watch it progress. They see life emerge, make its best effort towards intelligence, and then get wiped out. Over and over.The wizards give us an interesting perspective - the creation of the universe and the evolution of intelligent life collapsed down to about a week. They're able to use a kind of magical VR to watch things in real time, but still, they have a wide view of Earth history that allows commentary on the other part of the book....Interleaved with the Discworld story about the Project, Stewart and Cohen talk about the science that the wizards are watching. Where the stars came from, how the moon got formed, what primeval Earth might have looked like, how life arose and, most importantly, how it managed to stick around for so long.Viewed on a long scale, the Earth is not really a very hospitable place. Giant rocks and snowballs falling from the sky every few million years, ice ages and volcanic catastrophes, disasters of nearly every imaginable magnitude. Species rising, flourishing and vanishing without so much as a ripple in the fossil record.... Nice, pleasant weather, like we have now, is relatively rare.As Rincewind says, ""This world is an anvil. Everything here is between a rock and a hard place. Every single thing on it is the descendant of creatures that have survived everything the world could throw at them. I just hope they never get angry....""Pratchett is a fantastic writer, as we all know, and somehow Stewart and Cohen manage to keep up with him. The chapters on hard science are just as interesting and entertaining as those with the wizards. They illuminate the concepts that the wizards don't understand (""There are no turtles anywhere!"") and set you up for what will come next. It's a rare book that can educate and entertain with consistency, and this book achieves it.Next up will be the followup books. Let's see how they hold up...."
64,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17622935-tristia-watson,2,"Imagine sitting down to read a book from your favorite author. At the end of the first chapter your friend takes away the book and replaces it with a transcript of the show Cosmos with Neil deGrasse Tyson. You like Cosmos and Mr Tyson is interesting so you read it. At the first break, your friend takes away Cosmos and replaces it with the book by your favorite author that you had started reading. Now imagine doing this 45 more times and you have the idea behind The Science of Discworld.The Terry Pratchett book is ""The Lost Continent"" (I believe) and it gets interrupted at odd places because Mr Pratchett doesn't do chapters. The science is presented in an interesting way by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen but a lot of the chapters drag on especially when the Pratchett chapters fly by. They've made the effort to find relevant parts of the Pratchett book to match up with relevant parts to the science that they want to discuss but sometimes its a stretch.The book was okay, not sure I would recommended it and I certainly don't want to read the next two books in the series!"
65,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25923230-youkneek,3,"The Science of Discworld is an odd sort of Discworld book. Based on the name, I had thought it was going to delve into more detail about the fictional workings of the Discworld. Like, say, how the giant turtle and the elephants stay alive outside of an atmosphere or how water on the Discworld gets replenished when it keeps falling off the disc… If that last sentence makes it sound like I’ve gone off the deep end, then you clearly haven’t tried reading Discworld.The science in this book is actually more about the real science of our own world, with a very thin Discworld story interspersed between the science bits. The Discworld part of the story takes place in the Unseen University, where the wizards end up creating a simulation of the birth of a universe remarkably like ours, followed by many million years’ worth of evolution on “roundworld”, a planet that is also remarkably like ours. Each short Discworld-based chapter is then followed up with a science chapter discussing topics related to what’s going on in the Discworld story.For the first 25% of this book, I wasn’t sure I was going to make it through to the end. The science parts were boring me to tears because they mostly covered either terribly basic concepts or entirely theoretical topics that I wasn’t very interested in reading about. As it went on, it got more interesting, although there were still scattered bits of boredom here and there. If this had been a book about computer science, I probably would have enjoyed the theoretical parts equally as well as the practical parts. Actually, even though it wasn’t at all the focus of the story, computer science did get a few mentions here and there, and I particularly enjoyed those parts. When it comes to the natural sciences, however, my interest isn’t strong enough to sustain me through theory. I enjoyed it when the authors discussed what we do know and why we think we know it, whereas the various speculations about things we have no way of knowing for sure were more frustrating to me than interesting.The Discworld part of the story was very short, but amusing. It served as a nice way to break up the science bits and provide some humor. However, the story had a major logical flaw that annoyed me to no end. (view spoiler)[It’s supposed to be physically impossible for anybody to get into the Roundworld experiment, but Hex is able to use suits to let people enter Roundworld virtually. Rincewind is the first person made to try this, and the luggage shows up physically in Roundworld, supposedly following Rincewind there. But Rincewind’s actual, physical body is still in Unseen University. There’s no logical reason that the luggage should have ended up inside the experiment. It was only done as cheap story trick to allow the wizards to get materials to and from Roundworld by having them transported via the luggage. (hide spoiler)]So… will I read the second science book? Yes, I think so, once I get to that point in the publication order. Whether or not I read the last two will probably depend on my reaction to the second one."

I said ""No thanks"" and I said it firmly because I really don't like those series tie in books that people write which might have the original authors name on the cover but are actually written by second rate hacks hired by the publisher to milk the last drop of cash from the cow.Luckily my girlfriend ignored me completely and bought it anyway because this is not one of those books.This book doesn't try and give a scientific explanation for how a discworld could exist supported on the backs of four elephants or how discworld light can move slowly enough for you to watch it wash over the landscape. Instead it describes our universe, the solar system, earth and the life on it through the eyes of people living on the discworld. It does it darned well too."

It runs on some simple rules and a bit of bloody-minded stubbornness. Every time our wizardly friends poke it with a stick, the authors jump in to explain the science of what happens, from the Big Bang to the evolution of humanity. It's a brisk survey of the sciences, returning to the wizards every other chapter for some more stick-poking.The science bits draw heavily on a conceit they call ""lies-to-children,"" by which they mean the oversimplifications you use in teaching to introduce difficult concepts. Things like the planetary model of the atom--completely wrong, but pedagogically useful. Lies-to-children aren't bad; they're necessary. But once you've grasped the basics, the lie-to-children can be swept away and replaced with the facts. Except they aren't, always, which is where the authors of the book figure they come in.I did notice some inaccuracies, especially in the paleontology bits, although I can't entirely decide whether to chalk them up to the book being published 14 years ago, or actually being wrong. And in the molecular biology bits (my actual area of expertise) there were some lies-to-children that never actually got corrected. But in fairness, the book's already 400 pages long. They didn't have time.In spite of all that I enthusiastically recommend this book. It's fun! You don't get someone like Terry Pratchett every century, but the science chapters are almost as cheeky and entertaining as the fiction bits. Rating: there's 3 more books in the series and my birthday is in October please and thank."
69,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9107978-aaron,4,"Don't expect your typical lighthearted novel as you'd normally get from Terry Pratchett. Instead, you will find a hilarious, whimsical look at the deep scientific theories and explanations of how scientists believe our universe and world works. If you've avoided topics like gravitational forces, quantum theory or evolution, then this is the book for you! Seriously.The magic of this book is how the authors take the unreality of Discworld and use it to show the reader how our universe and world work. The wizards of Unseen University take us on a time traveling journey as they peer into our universe beginning at its inception and then periodically along the way until they glimpse us and then our possible future. The beauty of this framework is how complex theories and scientific discoveries are broken down into manageable pieces of information.The authors dismiss the idea of God or gods in favor of evolutionary theory dropping in subtle remarks and even a few not-so-subtle quips. While they admit to science being a huge amount of guessing and not knowing, they refuse to admit the possibility of a Creator.The content is such that young readers would really be lost and even many teens would find this hard to understand. The only curse word doesn't even count in my book because it really was used in context. Sex comes up quite often, but only as it relates as a motivational factor for animals. I'd say this book is really suited to older teens and adults, regardless if they are familiar with Terry Pratchett's works or not."

71,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,5,"Although I loved the book, the title is maybe a little misleading. Unlike The Science of Star Trek or The Science of Harry Potter, which will explain in exhaustive detail how it might be scientifically possible to build a transporter or a flying broom, The Science of Discworld uses the wizards of Discworld to explain science in our world. Which on the Disc is called Roundworld, and is a wizard's experiment to see how a world without magic or narrativium works.There's no attempt to explain anything that happens in Discworld, because a) there can be no scientific explanation and b) it is explained; it's all magic and narrativium, the element that makes stories work. So to wizards, Roundworld's lack of storyline is baffling and frustrating. That's the Discworld half of the story, their bafflement at how Roundworld evolution works. They have, after all, met the God of Evolution on the Disc.The science half is woven in between Discworld chapters. As Roundworld evolves, the science chapters cut in to explain what's going on and why. I don't have a clue in the world how accurate the science is, but it was enjoyable to read. I'm not usually a reader of hard science. To be totally honest, I'm here for the Discworld story, and nothing else. But I was kept reading through all of the science, which is something for me. At the same time, you really could read only the Discworld sections without missing much. You'd have to really like reading the wizards, though. But honestly, who doesn't?"
72,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2403903-ralph-mcewen,5,I think this is a really good book. I was surprised to find that it had alternating chapters of Discworld focus (entertainment) and our real world focus (science). I think many people would enjoy this Discworld portion and get a better grasp of what science can and can not accomplish by reading this book . I would get a kick out of seeing this book listed in the bibliography of some high school science report. There is enough real information to be used in that manner. I think this format of teach a chapter and entertain for chapter would be greatly successful in general education text for schools. It could keep the pupils engaged enough so they would learn without struggling. Difficult to do but boy it might just be worth it.
73,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17550624-steve,5,"This book is incredibly hard to categorize, it contains elements of non-fiction, fiction, humour and some good old admonishing. It was, in a word, brilliant, and while there very definitely was a plot, it kept getting pushed aside for explanations, both serious and humourous. I very much enjoyed the climax and the resolution. I will have to continue with the series, and try and contain my absolute missing of Pratchett."
74,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45282998-anneke,4,"For me personally it is always harder to read a non-fiction book.

Still 4 stars because I think it is a great idea to mix the information with the storyline like this."

Luckily, it looks like they're getting easier to track down, which is exciting.I wasn't sure what to expect opening the book, but I'm happy with how it was presented -- alternating chapters of the Wizards (who I never felt had enough books in the latter half of Pratchett's writings) and a deep dive into a pop science topic. While the information in many cases is already dated (!), I still learned quite a bit. And, of course, loved spending more time with the Wizards... good prep for my eventual Discworld re-read.Recommended for the die-hard Discworld fan."

The Universe, of course, is our own. And Roundworld is Earth. As the wizards watch their accidental creation grow, we follow the story of our universe from the primal singularity of the Big Bang to the Internet and beyond.Being a huge lover of science and discworld this was just perfect for me the book is layed in a way that you have 1 chapter with the wizards of Unseen university doing something weird and wonderful but that something would always have something to do with the next subject chapter. For example the wizards get bored and start making comets and snowballs and throwing them at planets and the next chapter was about the reason comets exist and the rest of the book play out like this. So you get a little technical language of science and then you'd get the fun and wacky wizards it's a great mix. I think the only downside for me is that this book was wrote in 1999 and it now being 2019 i feel that maybe in the 20 years since some of the science might have changed or been updated or proved wrong completely so that's a worrie but apart from that the book is solid it's informative and fun your always in a state of wonder unlike school when you was being taught or AkA ""lies to children"" so if you have children or you yourself are intrested in science or discworld or both i would say you should defiantly pick this one up.5/5 stars on goodreads 100/100 Ginger points"

Not only is it most definitely not about the science of Discworld, it is also not some sort of shameless cash-in on a well-loved author.What this book is, then, is a 'popular science' book, dressed up with some (typically amusing) interludes featuring the wizards of Unseen University as they try to understand how our world can work without magic and stories. Pratchett was always keen to educate, and here he tries to condense science into a single volume, using co-authors and science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen to do the hard lifting of explaining the basics and discoveries of physics, chemistry and biology.The authors try to explain how everything really works, although they do acknowledge there is bound to be simplification (or 'lies to children') as some of the concepts are hugely complex. But it never gets boring or too difficult to read.A superb book for anyone who just wants to understand a little bit more about science. And I still use the space elevator analogy to this day.

I found all these science chapters to be incredibly tedious and boring.  Therefore, this review will mainly be my thoughts on the other portion of the book. ~Spoiler Free~POSITIVE ASPECTS:+ The characters in this book were phenomenal. They're so entertaining and hilarious.+ The humor in this book is actually funny. I laughed out loud several times. NEGATIVE ASPECTS:- Obviously, I hated the science chapters.- Sometimes this book was so confusing. The reason behind a character's actions were left unexplained on several occasions, or the motive just didn't make sense. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be humorous or not, but it just annoyed me.- I have never seen so many typos in a book before. There was a lot of punctuation left out, and spelling errors (not just European spelling).OVERALL:I think this book had potential and could've been so much better than it is. However, I look forward to reading the actual Discworld series. Rating: 2.5 out of 5 stars"
86,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16103061-kathleen,3,"Okay, this is the reason it took me forever to get on with the Great Discworld Reread, because I kind of got stuck on this book for two months.The Science of Discworld is half a Discworld novel (well, more of a novella, since it's actually quite short) about the wizards first inventing magical nuclear power and then using it to create Roundworld, aka our Earth. The other half (or more like three-quarters) of the book is scientists Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen explaining the physical and biological forces behind the corresponding developments on Earth. These include topics like evolution, astrophysics, the probable development of planets and stars, elements, nuclear power, and the origins of life.Now, the scientific sections of the book are very clearly written and very understandable for the layperson. I'm just really not scientifically-minded, and so it was kind of a slog for me to get through those parts. The Discworld novella contained within is hilarious, though, and very much worth the reading. I also would actually recommend reading the scientific sections, but maybe take your time about it. They're more rewarding if you can let them sink in."

I mean, a phone book provides information but isn't exactly pleasurable to read, much like many textbooks I've come across which are undoubtedly informative but dull and utterly unenjoyable. Would there be more (for example) biologists if the writing quality of the textbooks were such that students would want to read them rather than being forced to by a teacher or parent?Therein lies the magic of 'The Science of Discworld'. It's a tour of various topics in science written in a vivid and enjoyable fashion. The hard science is interspersed with chapters of pure (wizardly) fantasy which serve to cleanse the palette before the next dose of science. It's an unusual approach but I find that it works well.I personally wonder if, had I read this book some 20 years ago, I'd have become a chemist or physicist rather than a computer programmer."

Normally I'll devour a Pratchett book in a few hours and delight in every moment. This one took me a week and a half, and felt like a slog. The reason for this is that it's not just a Pratchett book - it's a Pratchett book split up into chapters which are interspersed with science lectures. The science is interesting and Steward and Cohen make an effort to make it accessible to laypersons, which I appreciated, but it was jarring to be hauled out of the story every other chapter for another look at prehistory.With the two other authors and ""The Science of"" in the title, I figured this wouldn't be a typical Discworld book, but I was hoping I'd like it anyway.

First is via our own beginnings... from the big bang, the creation of atoms, the creation of worlds, the evolution of life & the evolution of intelligence. The second is comparing this through a parallel narrative set in the Unseen University where the wizards are studying a newly-formed universe in a ball. This is to help our own mind-boggling science seem a little easier to comprehend.I enjoyed the wizard's story part of the book. The early physics parts made me remember why I quit A-level physics (my brain tended to steam quite a bit). as soon as we hit biology & evolution I was in my element.A good way to get to know & understand the formation of EVERYTHING.Shame about the crabs!"

Instead of trying to explain the science behind the story Universe, The Science of Discworld has the wizards of Unseen University create their own little baby Universe and watch it evolve.The book works by switching back and forth between the story narrative and explaining the science (of the real world, aka Roundworld.) It's a delightfully fresh approach and has a satisfying effect.The science in the book is solid and full of interesting little tidbits. Even avid science readers will find cool things to learn from it.Finally, anyone who enjoys the humor of Discworld should enjoy this book. Highly recommended."

This book is a short story cobbled together by Pratchett while Ian Stewart and Jack Cohan wrote about sciency stuff between the chapters. Actually there was much more science then there was Disc-world story. That was probably a good thing (even though I love love love Terry Pratchett), the story just wasn't very engaging. But the science and explanations of our universe and world were top notch. Everything was tied in well together. And it still had it's funny moments, even for a denser read than I was expecting.

Not only will it give some insight as to the authors point of view, it will actually explain the scientific plausibility of many of the fantastic ideas he explores. I describe this series to my friends and family as ""if Monty Python had written Harry Potter."" I think it was Arthur C. Clarke who said that ""Technology, sufficient advanced, is indistinguishable from magic."" Pratchett, simply put, reverses this. "

It is a walk-through of scientific discoveries and conceptions of cosmology taken from an outside perspective (the lens of the Diskworld magicians in their parallel academia).  It is about how human narratives and expectations channel how and what we study, how we perceive our results, and what our expectations are. It is about how we are taught science, what he calls ""lies-to-children"" and how we maintain them, and many other things besides. "

I'm not sure why I thought that.While it's definitely not what I expected (duh), it was a very enjoyable read. I love Pratchett's way of reading, he can make anything interesting. And, being a major science nerd, the subject was already interesting to me. Maybe it was a very superficial approach to the science, but it gives you a very good, general idea of astronomy and physics (at least the current theories)."

The odd-numbered chapters are basically a Discworld story, and the even-numbered chapters are popular science exposition.The Discworld story is set entirely on the grounds of Unseen University, the school for wizards (but not witches) in the city of Ankh-Morpork.

(The story speculates on possible cultures long before the rise of humans, of which pretty much all evidence would be wiped out by impactors and such. In the non-fiction chapters, they admit that this is just silly speculation, but they _do_ point out that, if it were true, how would we know?)The non-fiction chapters are not only science exposition, but exposition on the practice, history, and philosophy of science. They are a pretty good read ... I'm tempted to say better than the story, but really it's a tossup.The fiction chapters depend somewhat on previous knowledge of the inhabitants of UU, especially Chancellor Ridcully, Assistant Librarian (and later in the story Egregious Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography) Rincewind, and the Librarian, plus the Luggage. You can pick most of it up from context and exposition, but the Luggage in particular would be confusing to one not familiar with it.In all, an enjoyable read, but not quite as enjoyable as the ""real"" Discworld books."

Disregarding the times where they insulted people who were religious (which would include many scientists), I had a number of issues. There were several points where they revealed that earlier science in the book at been a ""lie-to-children"" (a lie to ""help"" understanding, which I can't stand and they seem to bemoan early on). There were sections where they fudge and qualify a theory, for example: at least once they said something they ""felt"" had no proof but put it forward as an argument for their ideas; some paragraphs are laden with ""perhaps"", ""must have"" and such. They posited multiple hypotheses for some ideas, without going into why those ideas started or which they think makes sense, but also complained about some theories saying they didn't think they were right (no evidence or argument given). They used a term ""extelligence"" long before defining it. They have some paragraphs that are one sentence statements, where I saw them and immediately wanted more details, for instance: ""why do we know this creature had hooves simply from its tooth?""If you want to read a good Discworld story, read any of the main series.

I started it a few years ago, but then put it down and never picked it back up again. It has been sat on myself now now for at least 10 years, waiting for the right moment for me to pick it back up up and read the last piece of Sir Terry Pratchett writing that I have untouched in my possession.There isn't much of Sir Terry in this, but there is certainly enough for those who mourn his passing to get a little extra hit of his magic. What there is however, is lots of really well explained science. There is a lot of this book that I already have a passing knowledge of common but there's a huge amount that I didn't know anything about at all. What this book does, which is the exclusive preserve of people who really know their stuff, is to explain in simple terms so extremely complicated ideas.Whatever you do or don't know about science and history of the Earth and the history of the Universe and someone, it is highly likely that this book will offer you some insights into a least part of your understanding. And best of all it does it it with a gentle humour that doesn't distract from the subject matter, but always gives a reverential nod to the genus of Sir Terry Pratchett and makes the core material accessible."
108,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,3,"This is not a book that tells you how Terry Pratchett's Discworld works. This is a book that tells you how Earth as we know it was created with an inserted Discworld narrative.I found this book to be entertaining and the science bits to be accurate (for what is provided) with pithy observations and witty sentences. However, the science is a rather basic summary in a somewhat erratic order of the creation of the universe and evolution on planet earth. I started to get a bit bored with the science chapters, though this is possibly due to having read too many books about the universe and evolution to get excited about a repeat. The alternate chapters that deal with the Wizards of Unseen University get more amusing as the book progresses, especially after Rincewind, the Luggage and the Librarian (Ook!) make an appearance. There is nothing like a wizardly outside assessment of Roundworld to show us how crazy life on Earth really is. This was a fun read. I highly recommend this book to fans of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, especially those who aren't too clued up about general science. The alternate science and fantasy chapters of this book might even appeal to younger school children and encouraging an interest in reading and science."
109,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26268161-eilis-o-sullivan,4," This was definitely one of the more unusual Discworld novels that I have read. The fact that it examines our world by making small comparisons to the Discworld made it very interesting in a lot of ways. I was personally quite take with the chapters that explored stuff that we have named but doesn't actually exist or the discussion of the evolution of mammals and how they took over the world. The story of the Wizards was also really good and I loved how each time something happened that seems relatively normal for them it just seems utterly ridiculous. The fact that their world, the Discworld relies on everything being very literal, such as magic existing or darkness and light both existing means that we can look at our world and our universe with a different perspective. Plus the Bursar turning around and being able to understand relativity was outright hilarious.  The only things that make the book suffer is that the science takes up much more of the book than anything else. What doesn't help is the science is slightly out of date since this book was written in the early 2000's. Anything that is explored might be the same, but might also have changed drastically by now. Such as Pluto being demoted from Planet status.  Overall it was an enjoyable, if slow, read and as long as you don't find the science to outdated should be good fun as well. It is a big warning for anyone who isn't aware that this is not like other Discworld books. This is a science book with a Discworld story mixed in. "
110,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24702165-stephen-hergest,3,"When an experiment to split the Thaum results in an excess of magical energy, the wizards of Unseen University pull an old experiment off the shelf and create a pocket universe - our own. But Pratchett's story is only a frame for the story of Earth and the universe, from the Big Bang to humanity's (probably) destiny in the stars. Mathematician Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen spin a highly readable cosmological and biological history of Earth, in a universe (improbable to the wizards) devoid of the essential elements Narritivium (we only think we're living a story - the asteroids have other ideas), Chelonium (the stuff of Turtles), and Elephantium. Still, there may be something called Bloodimindium, as life has a habit of turning up where it can't.Cohen and Stewart certainly make a case for the impermanence of life forms, past and present, and how Life needs mass extinctions in order to reset and experiment until it finds something that works. Food for thought, as our own mass extinction approaches. Did the dinosaurs have a society? No way to prove they didn't. Will humanity make it to the stars? Not even the wizards know; they fast-forwarded a lot. Might be the cockroaches, instead."

Here physics and chemistry get intertwined with the latest toys of the wizards at Unseen University. And awesome. things follow. If you want to discover how Roundworld came into being (and was very close to being dominated by a civilization of crabs) side by side with the terrified Rincewind, this book should be for you. In its chapters the explanation of natural science phenomena are followed by the discoveries (and often - the experiments) of the high-ranked staff of the university, presenting both extraordinary explanations and the amazing humor of Terry Pratchett.Probably the only downside to this book (or rather - a disadvantage for some of the readers, who are not yet familiar to the works of Prarchett, so correct yourselves) is the necessity to possess some prior knowledge to characters inhabiting Discworld. But for every Pratchett fan it should be an amazing read and certainly it was for me."
112,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19647364-usfromdk,2,"This book was disappointing. It's at times quite quotable and not badly written, but it contains way too much popular science and way too little Discworld science for my taste. Mostly a rehash of lots of stuff I already knew about topics like physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and Earth science that most people should already know, but probably don't; which also means that many people will like the book better than I did. As is always the case for popular science books it contains many insufficiently documented/substantiated claims, but the regular 'breaks' provided by Pratchett's narrative enabled me to disregard these problems long enough to finish the book.Many people will like this book, and the 2-star rating mostly just indicates that I wasn't in the target group, not that I think it's a terrible book (...and just to remind people, I use the rating system the way goodreads intended it to be used: 2-star books are 'okay')."
113,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2985573-k-fox,3,"The Science of Discworld presents a depiction of the history of a universe very similar to ours (while citing real world science and displaying the actual periods of Earth’s history at times) through an experiment gone wrong at the Unseen University. Thus, the wizards of Discworld get to experience and explore Roundworld in a fun and witty adventure while the reader also gets a fun little lesson in history and science.This is a fun book for anyone. If you find science confusing and annoying, this is a fun way to approach it and learn more. If you are more familiar with science and enjoy re-hearing things you know and seeing new ways to present facts, this is a wonderful resource. It was published in the early 2000’s so some of the science is a bit dated, but not enough to hurt the book in my opinion."

I believe that the science chapters are the best example of how Pratchett had become so well-read - he was interested in everything and he used everything he read and learned in the Discworld. The first Science of Discworld book contains a lot of information about how planets are created, how our planet came into being, how life came into being on it, how resilient life on Earth is, and everything that we knew in 2002 about space travel and other planets and cosmic objects. It is fascinating stuff, with dinosaurs in it, as well as bacteria that live at hydrothermal vents, how long cement cures once it's been laid down (10 years), and how excreta might have been what caused life to proliferate so quickly once the smallest of life had come into being (Excreta occurs).

That said, this is not what I expected and when I realized what it was it felt watered down. The Science of Discworld is more like the science of our universe juxtaposed against an Unseen University ""roundworld"" experiment. It feels just to be another cosmology/all-that-we-know-about-science-to-date with some occasional Discworld flavor. If you excised all the Discworld bits, I think it would stand alone with ease. In other words the science bits and the Discworld bits are disconnected and independent. It has its Pratchett moments, but in the science side it just reads like a straight cosmology book. I read enough of those as it is, so this was a bit disappointing. "

And so was created a universe in a bottle, eventually containing a bizarre collection of round things.....Alternating between the usual chaos we have come to expect from the faculty of the Unseen University and a few science writers from an oddly shaped roundworld, we go on a journey from the big bang to sometime in the future within a simulated universe.Note to Wizards, don't let the librarian near the experiment."

I do know that in this book, the contents of the Discworld and science chapters are closely linked, which is quite good, and it's nice to see a bit more of an in-depth role for Rincewind when dealing with Ridcully and the other faculty members.

Instead of trying to explain the science behind the story Universe, The Science of Discworld has the wizards of Unseen University create their own little baby Universe and watch it evolve.The book works by switching back and forth between the story narrative and explaining the science (of the real world, aka Roundworld.) It's a delightfully fresh approach and has a satisfying effect.The science in the book is solid and full of interesting little tidbits. Even avid science readers will find cool things to learn from it.Finally, anyone who enjoys the humor of Discworld should enjoy this book. Highly recommended."
121,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3641855-joe-kendall,4,"So you may be wondering how a book can be both fantasy and non-fiction. Well Terry Pratchett and his co-writers have done it here. This book is a short story cobbled together by Pratchett while Ian Stewart and Jack Cohan wrote about sciency stuff between the chapters. Actually there was much more science then there was Disc-world story. That was probably a good thing (even though I love love love Terry Pratchett), the story just wasn't very engaging. But the science and explanations of our universe and world were top notch. Everything was tied in well together. And it still had it's funny moments, even for a denser read than I was expecting.

Not only will it give some insight as to the authors point of view, it will actually explain the scientific plausibility of many of the fantastic ideas he explores. I describe this series to my friends and family as ""if Monty Python had written Harry Potter."" I think it was Arthur C.

But Pratchett's story is only a frame for the story of Earth and the universe, from the Big Bang to humanity's (probably) destiny in the stars. Mathematician Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen spin a highly readable cosmological and biological history of Earth, in a universe (improbable to the wizards) devoid of the essential elements Narritivium (we only think we're living a story - the asteroids have other ideas), Chelonium (the stuff of Turtles), and Elephantium. Still, there may be something called Bloodimindium, as life has a habit of turning up where it can't.Cohen and Stewart certainly make a case for the impermanence of life forms, past and present, and how Life needs mass extinctions in order to reset and experiment until it finds something that works. Food for thought, as our own mass extinction approaches. Did the dinosaurs have a society? No way to prove they didn't. Will humanity make it to the stars? Not even the wizards know; they fast-forwarded a lot. Might be the cockroaches, instead."
141,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7238474-daniel-vasilev,5,"There are books, which make you feel nostalgic for them even before you have reached the back cover, and ""The Science of Discworld"" is definitely a perfect example for one. Here physics and chemistry get intertwined with the latest toys of the wizards at Unseen University. And awesome. things follow. If you want to discover how Roundworld came into being (and was very close to being dominated by a civilization of crabs) side by side with the terrified Rincewind, this book should be for you. In its chapters the explanation of natural science phenomena are followed by the discoveries (and often - the experiments) of the high-ranked staff of the university, presenting both extraordinary explanations and the amazing humor of Terry Pratchett.Probably the only downside to this book (or rather - a disadvantage for some of the readers, who are not yet familiar to the works of Prarchett, so correct yourselves) is the necessity to possess some prior knowledge to characters inhabiting Discworld. But for every Pratchett fan it should be an amazing read and certainly it was for me."
142,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19647364-usfromdk,2,"This book was disappointing. It's at times quite quotable and not badly written, but it contains way too much popular science and way too little Discworld science for my taste. Mostly a rehash of lots of stuff I already knew about topics like physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and Earth science that most people should already know, but probably don't; which also means that many people will like the book better than I did. As is always the case for popular science books it contains many insufficiently documented/substantiated claims, but the regular 'breaks' provided by Pratchett's narrative enabled me to disregard these problems long enough to finish the book.Many people will like this book, and the 2-star rating mostly just indicates that I wasn't in the target group, not that I think it's a terrible book (...and just to remind people, I use the rating system the way goodreads intended it to be used: 2-star books are 'okay')."

Thus, the wizards of Discworld get to experience and explore Roundworld in a fun and witty adventure while the reader also gets a fun little lesson in history and science.This is a fun book for anyone. If you find science confusing and annoying, this is a fun way to approach it and learn more. If you are more familiar with science and enjoy re-hearing things you know and seeing new ways to present facts, this is a wonderful resource. It was published in the early 2000’s so some of the science is a bit dated, but not enough to hurt the book in my opinion."

I believe that the science chapters are the best example of how Pratchett had become so well-read - he was interested in everything and he used everything he read and learned in the Discworld. The first Science of Discworld book contains a lot of information about how planets are created, how our planet came into being, how life came into being on it, how resilient life on Earth is, and everything that we knew in 2002 about space travel and other planets and cosmic objects. It is fascinating stuff, with dinosaurs in it, as well as bacteria that live at hydrothermal vents, how long cement cures once it's been laid down (10 years), and how excreta might have been what caused life to proliferate so quickly once the smallest of life had come into being (Excreta occurs). "

That said, this is not what I expected and when I realized what it was it felt watered down. The Science of Discworld is more like the science of our universe juxtaposed against an Unseen University ""roundworld"" experiment. It feels just to be another cosmology/all-that-we-know-about-science-to-date with some occasional Discworld flavor. If you excised all the Discworld bits, I think it would stand alone with ease. In other words the science bits and the Discworld bits are disconnected and independent. It has its Pratchett moments, but in the science side it just reads like a straight cosmology book. I read enough of those as it is, so this was a bit disappointing. "

And so was created a universe in a bottle, eventually containing a bizarre collection of round things.....Alternating between the usual chaos we have come to expect from the faculty of the Unseen University and a few science writers from an oddly shaped roundworld, we go on a journey from the big bang to sometime in the future within a simulated universe.Note to Wizards, don't let the librarian near the experiment."

I do know that in this book, the contents of the Discworld and science chapters are closely linked, which is quite good, and it's nice to see a bit more of an in-depth role for Rincewind when dealing with Ridcully and the other faculty members.

Instead of trying to explain the science behind the story Universe, The Science of Discworld has the wizards of Unseen University create their own little baby Universe and watch it evolve.The book works by switching back and forth between the story narrative and explaining the science (of the real world, aka Roundworld.) It's a delightfully fresh approach and has a satisfying effect.The science in the book is solid and full of interesting little tidbits. Even avid science readers will find cool things to learn from it.Finally, anyone who enjoys the humor of Discworld should enjoy this book. Highly recommended."

This book is a short story cobbled together by Pratchett while Ian Stewart and Jack Cohan wrote about sciency stuff between the chapters. Actually there was much more science then there was Disc-world story. That was probably a good thing (even though I love love love Terry Pratchett), the story just wasn't very engaging. But the science and explanations of our universe and world were top notch. Everything was tied in well together. And it still had it's funny moments, even for a denser read than I was expecting.

Not only will it give some insight as to the authors point of view, it will actually explain the scientific plausibility of many of the fantastic ideas he explores. I describe this series to my friends and family as ""if Monty Python had written Harry Potter."" I think it was Arthur C. Clarke who said that ""Technology, sufficient advanced, is indistinguishable from magic."" Pratchett, simply put, reverses this. "

And, being a major science nerd, the subject was already interesting to me.

Since I like to mix it up, once I finished the Rincewind track, I decided before addressing one of the other tracks, that I would read the Science novels, as they seemed to be somehow related to 
The Last Continent
. They are and they aren't. The story in The Science of Discworld features the wizards of the Unseen University and even Rincewind (so if you want to get technical, you could argue this is a Rincewind novel) but the real meat of this book is in the bits that are not written by Terry Pratchett, but instead by the science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen.Honestly, this book cooks when Stewart and Cohen use the events in the chapter previous (written by Pratchett) to explain the science not of Discworld, but of our world. I've argued in the past that good science-fiction and fantasy often shows us a mirror of our own world through a fantastical lens, but Stewart and Cohen take this to an all new concrete level--the intention here is to teach people about science in an easy and interesting way, using Discworld as the mirror image to explain the basics of all sorts of scientific topics. Unfortunately, the story Pratchett uses here as the frame for these discussions really isn't all that great and is kind of a throwaway. The implication here is that the Wizards create their own universe, which allows Stewart and Cohen to discuss the Big Bang, evolution, technology--everything really. But Pratchett's narrative reads like Stewart and Cohen gave him a bulleted list of what they wanted to discuss and then left him to his own devices. So we get the usual jokes that we would expect from a novel featuring Rincewind and the wizards, but it's nothing we haven't seen before and as such isn't anything to get excited about.If this was just a Pratchett novel, I'd probably give it two stars, and if it was just a scientific topics omnibus by Stewart and Cohen, I'd give it four. So I just split the difference. At this point, I am kind of getting sick of Rincewind and the wizards, but I'm interested to see what else Stewart and Cohen have to say about the wizards' (or our) universe."

In UU's squash court, young Ponder Stibbons has invented a device to split the thaum.The unexpected result is the birth of a universe. To the wizards, it's a small globe in which cosmic evolution takes place. They wind up focusing their attention on one world, ""Roundworld,"" that is, or resembles, ours to the nth decimal place.

This book is a short story cobbled together by Pratchett while Ian Stewart and Jack Cohan wrote about sciency stuff between the chapters. Actually there was much more science then there was Disc-world story. That was probably a good thing (even though I love love love Terry Pratchett), the story just wasn't very engaging.

Since I like to mix it up, once I finished the Rincewind track, I decided before addressing one of the other tracks, that I would read the Science novels, as they seemed to be somehow related to 
The Last Continent
. They are and they aren't. The story in The Science of Discworld features the wizards of the Unseen University and even Rincewind (so if you want to get technical, you could argue this is a Rincewind novel) but the real meat of this book is in the bits that are not written by Terry Pratchett, but instead by the science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen.Honestly, this book cooks when Stewart and Cohen use the events in the chapter previous (written by Pratchett) to explain the science not of Discworld, but of our world. I've argued in the past that good science-fiction and fantasy often shows us a mirror of our own world through a fantastical lens, but Stewart and Cohen take this to an all new concrete level--the intention here is to teach people about science in an easy and interesting way, using Discworld as the mirror image to explain the basics of all sorts of scientific topics. Unfortunately, the story Pratchett uses here as the frame for these discussions really isn't all that great and is kind of a throwaway. The implication here is that the Wizards create their own universe, which allows Stewart and Cohen to discuss the Big Bang, evolution, technology--everything really. But Pratchett's narrative reads like Stewart and Cohen gave him a bulleted list of what they wanted to discuss and then left him to his own devices. So we get the usual jokes that we would expect from a novel featuring Rincewind and the wizards, but it's nothing we haven't seen before and as such isn't anything to get excited about.If this was just a Pratchett novel, I'd probably give it two stars, and if it was just a scientific topics omnibus by Stewart and Cohen, I'd give it four. So I just split the difference. At this point, I am kind of getting sick of Rincewind and the wizards, but I'm interested to see what else Stewart and Cohen have to say about the wizards' (or our) universe."
195,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935560-dan-l-danehy-oakes,3,"I'm quite surprised that this book took me a week to read. No, seriously. The odd-numbered chapters are basically a Discworld story, and the even-numbered chapters are popular science exposition.The Discworld story is set entirely on the grounds of Unseen University, the school for wizards (but not witches) in the city of Ankh-Morpork. In UU's squash court, young Ponder Stibbons has invented a device to split the thaum.The unexpected result is the birth of a universe. To the wizards, it's a small globe in which cosmic evolution takes place. They wind up focusing their attention on one world, ""Roundworld,"" that is, or resembles, ours to the nth decimal place. Here, against all odds, life begins and survives massive vulcanism, comet/meteor smashes, Snowball Earth, and so on, eventually producing sapient life -- several times. (The story speculates on possible cultures long before the rise of humans, of which pretty much all evidence would be wiped out by impactors and such. In the non-fiction chapters, they admit that this is just silly speculation, but they _do_ point out that, if it were true, how would we know?)The non-fiction chapters are not only science exposition, but exposition on the practice, history, and philosophy of science. They are a pretty good read ... I'm tempted to say better than the story, but really it's a tossup.The fiction chapters depend somewhat on previous knowledge of the inhabitants of UU, especially Chancellor Ridcully, Assistant Librarian (and later in the story Egregious Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography) Rincewind, and the Librarian, plus the Luggage. You can pick most of it up from context and exposition, but the Luggage in particular would be confusing to one not familiar with it.In all, an enjoyable read, but not quite as enjoyable as the ""real"" Discworld books."

Disregarding the times where they insulted people who were religious (which would include many scientists), I had a number of issues. There were several points where they revealed that earlier science in the book at been a ""lie-to-children"" (a lie to ""help"" understanding, which I can't stand and they seem to bemoan early on). There were sections where they fudge and qualify a theory, for example: at least once they said something they ""felt"" had no proof but put it forward as an argument for their ideas; some paragraphs are laden with ""perhaps"", ""must have"" and such. They posited multiple hypotheses for some ideas, without going into why those ideas started or which they think makes sense, but also complained about some theories saying they didn't think they were right (no evidence or argument given). They used a term ""extelligence"" long before defining it. They have some paragraphs that are one sentence statements, where I saw them and immediately wanted more details, for instance: ""why do we know this creature had hooves simply from its tooth?""If you want to read a good Discworld story, read any of the main series.

I started it a few years ago, but then put it down and never picked it back up again. It has been sat on myself now now for at least 10 years, waiting for the right moment for me to pick it back up up and read the last piece of Sir Terry Pratchett writing that I have untouched in my possession.There isn't much of Sir Terry in this, but there is certainly enough for those who mourn his passing to get a little extra hit of his magic. What there is however, is lots of really well explained science. There is a lot of this book that I already have a passing knowledge of common but there's a huge amount that I didn't know anything about at all. What this book does, which is the exclusive preserve of people who really know their stuff, is to explain in simple terms so extremely complicated ideas.Whatever you do or don't know about science and history of the Earth and the history of the Universe and someone, it is highly likely that this book will offer you some insights into a least part of your understanding. And best of all it does it it with a gentle humour that doesn't distract from the subject matter, but always gives a reverential nod to the genus of Sir Terry Pratchett and makes the core material accessible."

This is a book that tells you how Earth as we know it was created with an inserted Discworld narrative.I found this book to be entertaining and the science bits to be accurate (for what is provided) with pithy observations and witty sentences. However, the science is a rather basic summary in a somewhat erratic order of the creation of the universe and evolution on planet earth. I started to get a bit bored with the science chapters, though this is possibly due to having read too many books about the universe and evolution to get excited about a repeat. The alternate chapters that deal with the Wizards of Unseen University get more amusing as the book progresses, especially after Rincewind, the Luggage and the Librarian (Ook!) make an appearance. There is nothing like a wizardly outside assessment of Roundworld to show us how crazy life on Earth really is. This was a fun read. I highly recommend this book to fans of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, especially those who aren't too clued up about general science. The alternate science and fantasy chapters of this book might even appeal to younger school children and encouraging an interest in reading and science."
199,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26268161-eilis-o-sullivan,4," This was definitely one of the more unusual Discworld novels that I have read. The fact that it examines our world by making small comparisons to the Discworld made it very interesting in a lot of ways. I was personally quite take with the chapters that explored stuff that we have named but doesn't actually exist or the discussion of the evolution of mammals and how they took over the world. The story of the Wizards was also really good and I loved how each time something happened that seems relatively normal for them it just seems utterly ridiculous. The fact that their world, the Discworld relies on everything being very literal, such as magic existing or darkness and light both existing means that we can look at our world and our universe with a different perspective. Plus the Bursar turning around and being able to understand relativity was outright hilarious.  The only things that make the book suffer is that the science takes up much more of the book than anything else. What doesn't help is the science is slightly out of date since this book was written in the early 2000's. Anything that is explored might be the same, but might also have changed drastically by now. Such as Pluto being demoted from Planet status.  Overall it was an enjoyable, if slow, read and as long as you don't find the science to outdated should be good fun as well. It is a big warning for anyone who isn't aware that this is not like other Discworld books. This is a science book with a Discworld story mixed in. "

Since I like to mix it up, once I finished the Rincewind track, I decided before addressing one of the other tracks, that I would read the Science novels, as they seemed to be somehow related to 
The Last Continent
. They are and they aren't. The story in The Science of Discworld features the wizards of the Unseen University and even Rincewind (so if you want to get technical, you could argue this is a Rincewind novel) but the real meat of this book is in the bits that are not written by Terry Pratchett, but instead by the science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen.Honestly, this book cooks when Stewart and Cohen use the events in the chapter previous (written by Pratchett) to explain the science not of Discworld, but of our world. I've argued in the past that good science-fiction and fantasy often shows us a mirror of our own world through a fantastical lens, but Stewart and Cohen take this to an all new concrete level--the intention here is to teach people about science in an easy and interesting way, using Discworld as the mirror image to explain the basics of all sorts of scientific topics. Unfortunately, the story Pratchett uses here as the frame for these discussions really isn't all that great and is kind of a throwaway. The implication here is that the Wizards create their own universe, which allows Stewart and Cohen to discuss the Big Bang, evolution, technology--everything really. But Pratchett's narrative reads like Stewart and Cohen gave him a bulleted list of what they wanted to discuss and then left him to his own devices. So we get the usual jokes that we would expect from a novel featuring Rincewind and the wizards, but it's nothing we haven't seen before and as such isn't anything to get excited about.If this was just a Pratchett novel, I'd probably give it two stars, and if it was just a scientific topics omnibus by Stewart and Cohen, I'd give it four. So I just split the difference. At this point, I am kind of getting sick of Rincewind and the wizards, but I'm interested to see what else Stewart and Cohen have to say about the wizards' (or our) universe."
225,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935560-dan-l-danehy-oakes,3,"I'm quite surprised that this book took me a week to read. No, seriously. The odd-numbered chapters are basically a Discworld story, and the even-numbered chapters are popular science exposition.The Discworld story is set entirely on the grounds of Unseen University, the school for wizards (but not witches) in the city of Ankh-Morpork. In UU's squash court, young Ponder Stibbons has invented a device to split the thaum.The unexpected result is the birth of a universe. To the wizards, it's a small globe in which cosmic evolution takes place. They wind up focusing their attention on one world, ""Roundworld,"" that is, or resembles, ours to the nth decimal place. Here, against all odds, life begins and survives massive vulcanism, comet/meteor smashes, Snowball Earth, and so on, eventually producing sapient life -- several times. (The story speculates on possible cultures long before the rise of humans, of which pretty much all evidence would be wiped out by impactors and such. In the non-fiction chapters, they admit that this is just silly speculation, but they _do_ point out that, if it were true, how would we know?)The non-fiction chapters are not only science exposition, but exposition on the practice, history, and philosophy of science. They are a pretty good read ... I'm tempted to say better than the story, but really it's a tossup.The fiction chapters depend somewhat on previous knowledge of the inhabitants of UU, especially Chancellor Ridcully, Assistant Librarian (and later in the story Egregious Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography) Rincewind, and the Librarian, plus the Luggage. You can pick most of it up from context and exposition, but the Luggage in particular would be confusing to one not familiar with it.In all, an enjoyable read, but not quite as enjoyable as the ""real"" Discworld books."
226,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58768901-gareth-madeley,1,"A short and below average (for Terry Pratchett) Discworld story merged with an interesting science textbook which could have done with quite a bit of editing or pruning back.The chapter system was very jarring, with a handful of pages dedicated to the story which paused at an odd moment followed by two or three times as many pages dedicated to the science.The science section felt off to me. Disregarding the times where they insulted people who were religious (which would include many scientists), I had a number of issues. There were several points where they revealed that earlier science in the book at been a ""lie-to-children"" (a lie to ""help"" understanding, which I can't stand and they seem to bemoan early on). There were sections where they fudge and qualify a theory, for example: at least once they said something they ""felt"" had no proof but put it forward as an argument for their ideas; some paragraphs are laden with ""perhaps"", ""must have"" and such. They posited multiple hypotheses for some ideas, without going into why those ideas started or which they think makes sense, but also complained about some theories saying they didn't think they were right (no evidence or argument given). They used a term ""extelligence"" long before defining it. They have some paragraphs that are one sentence statements, where I saw them and immediately wanted more details, for instance: ""why do we know this creature had hooves simply from its tooth?""If you want to read a good Discworld story, read any of the main series. If you want a good science book, don't look here."

I started it a few years ago, but then put it down and never picked it back up again. It has been sat on myself now now for at least 10 years, waiting for the right moment for me to pick it back up up and read the last piece of Sir Terry Pratchett writing that I have untouched in my possession.There isn't much of Sir Terry in this, but there is certainly enough for those who mourn his passing to get a little extra hit of his magic. What there is however, is lots of really well explained science. There is a lot of this book that I already have a passing knowledge of common but there's a huge amount that I didn't know anything about at all. What this book does, which is the exclusive preserve of people who really know their stuff, is to explain in simple terms so extremely complicated ideas.Whatever you do or don't know about science and history of the Earth and the history of the Universe and someone, it is highly likely that this book will offer you some insights into a least part of your understanding. And best of all it does it it with a gentle humour that doesn't distract from the subject matter, but always gives a reverential nod to the genus of Sir Terry Pratchett and makes the core material accessible."

This is a book that tells you how Earth as we know it was created with an inserted Discworld narrative.I found this book to be entertaining and the science bits to be accurate (for what is provided) with pithy observations and witty sentences. However, the science is a rather basic summary in a somewhat erratic order of the creation of the universe and evolution on planet earth. I started to get a bit bored with the science chapters, though this is possibly due to having read too many books about the universe and evolution to get excited about a repeat. The alternate chapters that deal with the Wizards of Unseen University get more amusing as the book progresses, especially after Rincewind, the Luggage and the Librarian (Ook!) make an appearance. There is nothing like a wizardly outside assessment of Roundworld to show us how crazy life on Earth really is. This was a fun read. I highly recommend this book to fans of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, especially those who aren't too clued up about general science. The alternate science and fantasy chapters of this book might even appeal to younger school children and encouraging an interest in reading and science."
229,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26268161-eilis-o-sullivan,4," This was definitely one of the more unusual Discworld novels that I have read. The fact that it examines our world by making small comparisons to the Discworld made it very interesting in a lot of ways. I was personally quite take with the chapters that explored stuff that we have named but doesn't actually exist or the discussion of the evolution of mammals and how they took over the world. The story of the Wizards was also really good and I loved how each time something happened that seems relatively normal for them it just seems utterly ridiculous. The fact that their world, the Discworld relies on everything being very literal, such as magic existing or darkness and light both existing means that we can look at our world and our universe with a different perspective. Plus the Bursar turning around and being able to understand relativity was outright hilarious.  The only things that make the book suffer is that the science takes up much more of the book than anything else. What doesn't help is the science is slightly out of date since this book was written in the early 2000's. Anything that is explored might be the same, but might also have changed drastically by now. Such as Pluto being demoted from Planet status.  Overall it was an enjoyable, if slow, read and as long as you don't find the science to outdated should be good fun as well. It is a big warning for anyone who isn't aware that this is not like other Discworld books. This is a science book with a Discworld story mixed in. "

But Pratchett's story is only a frame for the story of Earth and the universe, from the Big Bang to humanity's (probably) destiny in the stars. Mathematician Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen spin a highly readable cosmological and biological history of Earth, in a universe (improbable to the wizards) devoid of the essential elements Narritivium (we only think we're living a story - the asteroids have other ideas), Chelonium (the stuff of Turtles), and Elephantium. Still, there may be something called Bloodimindium, as life has a habit of turning up where it can't.Cohen and Stewart certainly make a case for the impermanence of life forms, past and present, and how Life needs mass extinctions in order to reset and experiment until it finds something that works. Food for thought, as our own mass extinction approaches. Did the dinosaurs have a society? No way to prove they didn't. Will humanity make it to the stars? Not even the wizards know; they fast-forwarded a lot. Might be the cockroaches, instead."

Here physics and chemistry get intertwined with the latest toys of the wizards at Unseen University. And awesome. things follow. If you want to discover how Roundworld came into being (and was very close to being dominated by a civilization of crabs) side by side with the terrified Rincewind, this book should be for you. In its chapters the explanation of natural science phenomena are followed by the discoveries (and often - the experiments) of the high-ranked staff of the university, presenting both extraordinary explanations and the amazing humor of Terry Pratchett.Probably the only downside to this book (or rather - a disadvantage for some of the readers, who are not yet familiar to the works of Prarchett, so correct yourselves) is the necessity to possess some prior knowledge to characters inhabiting Discworld. But for every Pratchett fan it should be an amazing read and certainly it was for me."
232,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19647364-usfromdk,2,"This book was disappointing. It's at times quite quotable and not badly written, but it contains way too much popular science and way too little Discworld science for my taste. Mostly a rehash of lots of stuff I already knew about topics like physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and Earth science that most people should already know, but probably don't; which also means that many people will like the book better than I did. As is always the case for popular science books it contains many insufficiently documented/substantiated claims, but the regular 'breaks' provided by Pratchett's narrative enabled me to disregard these problems long enough to finish the book.Many people will like this book, and the 2-star rating mostly just indicates that I wasn't in the target group, not that I think it's a terrible book (...and just to remind people, I use the rating system the way goodreads intended it to be used: 2-star books are 'okay')."

If you find science confusing and annoying, this is a fun way to approach it and learn more. If you are more familiar with science and enjoy re-hearing things you know and seeing new ways to present facts, this is a wonderful resource.

I believe that the science chapters are the best example of how Pratchett had become so well-read - he was interested in everything and he used everything he read and learned in the Discworld. The first Science of Discworld book contains a lot of information about how planets are created, how our planet came into being, how life came into being on it, how resilient life on Earth is, and everything that we knew in 2002 about space travel and other planets and cosmic objects. It is fascinating stuff, with dinosaurs in it, as well as bacteria that live at hydrothermal vents, how long cement cures once it's been laid down (10 years), and how excreta might have been what caused life to proliferate so quickly once the smallest of life had come into being (Excreta occurs).

It feels just to be another cosmology/all-that-we-know-about-science-to-date with some occasional Discworld flavor. If you excised all the Discworld bits, I think it would stand alone with ease.

The odd-numbered chapters are basically a Discworld story, and the even-numbered chapters are popular science exposition.The Discworld story is set entirely on the grounds of Unseen University, the school for wizards (but not witches) in the city of Ankh-Morpork. In UU's squash court, young Ponder Stibbons has invented a device to split the thaum.The unexpected result is the birth of a universe. To the wizards, it's a small globe in which cosmic evolution takes place. They wind up focusing their attention on one world, ""Roundworld,"" that is, or resembles, ours to the nth decimal place. Here, against all odds, life begins and survives massive vulcanism, comet/meteor smashes, Snowball Earth, and so on, eventually producing sapient life -- several times. (The story speculates on possible cultures long before the rise of humans, of which pretty much all evidence would be wiped out by impactors and such. In the non-fiction chapters, they admit that this is just silly speculation, but they _do_ point out that, if it were true, how would we know?)The non-fiction chapters are not only science exposition, but exposition on the practice, history, and philosophy of science. They are a pretty good read ... I'm tempted to say better than the story, but really it's a tossup.The fiction chapters depend somewhat on previous knowledge of the inhabitants of UU, especially Chancellor Ridcully, Assistant Librarian (and later in the story Egregious Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography) Rincewind, and the Librarian, plus the Luggage. You can pick most of it up from context and exposition, but the Luggage in particular would be confusing to one not familiar with it.In all, an enjoyable read, but not quite as enjoyable as the ""real"" Discworld books."

Disregarding the times where they insulted people who were religious (which would include many scientists), I had a number of issues. There were several points where they revealed that earlier science in the book at been a ""lie-to-children"" (a lie to ""help"" understanding, which I can't stand and they seem to bemoan early on). There were sections where they fudge and qualify a theory, for example: at least once they said something they ""felt"" had no proof but put it forward as an argument for their ideas; some paragraphs are laden with ""perhaps"", ""must have"" and such. They posited multiple hypotheses for some ideas, without going into why those ideas started or which they think makes sense, but also complained about some theories saying they didn't think they were right (no evidence or argument given). They used a term ""extelligence"" long before defining it. They have some paragraphs that are one sentence statements, where I saw them and immediately wanted more details, for instance: ""why do we know this creature had hooves simply from its tooth?""If you want to read a good Discworld story, read any of the main series.

I started it a few years ago, but then put it down and never picked it back up again. It has been sat on myself now now for at least 10 years, waiting for the right moment for me to pick it back up up and read the last piece of Sir Terry Pratchett writing that I have untouched in my possession.There isn't much of Sir Terry in this, but there is certainly enough for those who mourn his passing to get a little extra hit of his magic. What there is however, is lots of really well explained science. There is a lot of this book that I already have a passing knowledge of common but there's a huge amount that I didn't know anything about at all. What this book does, which is the exclusive preserve of people who really know their stuff, is to explain in simple terms so extremely complicated ideas.Whatever you do or don't know about science and history of the Earth and the history of the Universe and someone, it is highly likely that this book will offer you some insights into a least part of your understanding. And best of all it does it it with a gentle humour that doesn't distract from the subject matter, but always gives a reverential nod to the genus of Sir Terry Pratchett and makes the core material accessible."

This is a book that tells you how Earth as we know it was created with an inserted Discworld narrative.I found this book to be entertaining and the science bits to be accurate (for what is provided) with pithy observations and witty sentences. However, the science is a rather basic summary in a somewhat erratic order of the creation of the universe and evolution on planet earth. I started to get a bit bored with the science chapters, though this is possibly due to having read too many books about the universe and evolution to get excited about a repeat. The alternate chapters that deal with the Wizards of Unseen University get more amusing as the book progresses, especially after Rincewind, the Luggage and the Librarian (Ook!) make an appearance. There is nothing like a wizardly outside assessment of Roundworld to show us how crazy life on Earth really is. This was a fun read. I highly recommend this book to fans of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, especially those who aren't too clued up about general science. The alternate science and fantasy chapters of this book might even appeal to younger school children and encouraging an interest in reading and science."
259,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26268161-eilis-o-sullivan,4," This was definitely one of the more unusual Discworld novels that I have read. The fact that it examines our world by making small comparisons to the Discworld made it very interesting in a lot of ways. I was personally quite take with the chapters that explored stuff that we have named but doesn't actually exist or the discussion of the evolution of mammals and how they took over the world. The story of the Wizards was also really good and I loved how each time something happened that seems relatively normal for them it just seems utterly ridiculous. The fact that their world, the Discworld relies on everything being very literal, such as magic existing or darkness and light both existing means that we can look at our world and our universe with a different perspective. Plus the Bursar turning around and being able to understand relativity was outright hilarious.  The only things that make the book suffer is that the science takes up much more of the book than anything else. What doesn't help is the science is slightly out of date since this book was written in the early 2000's. Anything that is explored might be the same, but might also have changed drastically by now. Such as Pluto being demoted from Planet status.  Overall it was an enjoyable, if slow, read and as long as you don't find the science to outdated should be good fun as well. It is a big warning for anyone who isn't aware that this is not like other Discworld books. This is a science book with a Discworld story mixed in. "

But Pratchett's story is only a frame for the story of Earth and the universe, from the Big Bang to humanity's (probably) destiny in the stars. Mathematician Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen spin a highly readable cosmological and biological history of Earth, in a universe (improbable to the wizards) devoid of the essential elements Narritivium (we only think we're living a story - the asteroids have other ideas), Chelonium (the stuff of Turtles), and Elephantium. Still, there may be something called Bloodimindium, as life has a habit of turning up where it can't.Cohen and Stewart certainly make a case for the impermanence of life forms, past and present, and how Life needs mass extinctions in order to reset and experiment until it finds something that works. Food for thought, as our own mass extinction approaches. Did the dinosaurs have a society? No way to prove they didn't. Will humanity make it to the stars? Not even the wizards know; they fast-forwarded a lot. Might be the cockroaches, instead."

Here physics and chemistry get intertwined with the latest toys of the wizards at Unseen University. And awesome. things follow. If you want to discover how Roundworld came into being (and was very close to being dominated by a civilization of crabs) side by side with the terrified Rincewind, this book should be for you. In its chapters the explanation of natural science phenomena are followed by the discoveries (and often - the experiments) of the high-ranked staff of the university, presenting both extraordinary explanations and the amazing humor of Terry Pratchett.Probably the only downside to this book (or rather - a disadvantage for some of the readers, who are not yet familiar to the works of Prarchett, so correct yourselves) is the necessity to possess some prior knowledge to characters inhabiting Discworld. But for every Pratchett fan it should be an amazing read and certainly it was for me."
262,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19647364-usfromdk,2,"This book was disappointing. It's at times quite quotable and not badly written, but it contains way too much popular science and way too little Discworld science for my taste. Mostly a rehash of lots of stuff I already knew about topics like physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and Earth science that most people should already know, but probably don't; which also means that many people will like the book better than I did. As is always the case for popular science books it contains many insufficiently documented/substantiated claims, but the regular 'breaks' provided by Pratchett's narrative enabled me to disregard these problems long enough to finish the book.Many people will like this book, and the 2-star rating mostly just indicates that I wasn't in the target group, not that I think it's a terrible book (...and just to remind people, I use the rating system the way goodreads intended it to be used: 2-star books are 'okay')."

Thus, the wizards of Discworld get to experience and explore Roundworld in a fun and witty adventure while the reader also gets a fun little lesson in history and science.This is a fun book for anyone. If you find science confusing and annoying, this is a fun way to approach it and learn more. If you are more familiar with science and enjoy re-hearing things you know and seeing new ways to present facts, this is a wonderful resource. It was published in the early 2000’s so some of the science is a bit dated, but not enough to hurt the book in my opinion."

I believe that the science chapters are the best example of how Pratchett had become so well-read - he was interested in everything and he used everything he read and learned in the Discworld. The first Science of Discworld book contains a lot of information about how planets are created, how our planet came into being, how life came into being on it, how resilient life on Earth is, and everything that we knew in 2002 about space travel and other planets and cosmic objects. It is fascinating stuff, with dinosaurs in it, as well as bacteria that live at hydrothermal vents, how long cement cures once it's been laid down (10 years), and how excreta might have been what caused life to proliferate so quickly once the smallest of life had come into being (Excreta occurs).

That said, this is not what I expected and when I realized what it was it felt watered down. The Science of Discworld is more like the science of our universe juxtaposed against an Unseen University ""roundworld"" experiment. It feels just to be another cosmology/all-that-we-know-about-science-to-date with some occasional Discworld flavor. If you excised all the Discworld bits, I think it would stand alone with ease. In other words the science bits and the Discworld bits are disconnected and independent. It has its Pratchett moments, but in the science side it just reads like a straight cosmology book. I read enough of those as it is, so this was a bit disappointing. "

And so was created a universe in a bottle, eventually containing a bizarre collection of round things.....Alternating between the usual chaos we have come to expect from the faculty of the Unseen University and a few science writers from an oddly shaped roundworld, we go on a journey from the big bang to sometime in the future within a simulated universe.Note to Wizards, don't let the librarian near the experiment."

Instead of trying to explain the science behind the story Universe, The Science of Discworld has the wizards of Unseen University create their own little baby Universe and watch it evolve.The book works by switching back and forth between the story narrative and explaining the science (of the real world, aka Roundworld.) It's a delightfully fresh approach and has a satisfying effect.The science in the book is solid and full of interesting little tidbits. Even avid science readers will find cool things to learn from it.Finally, anyone who enjoys the humor of Discworld should enjoy this book. Highly recommended."
271,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3641855-joe-kendall,4,"So you may be wondering how a book can be both fantasy and non-fiction. Well Terry Pratchett and his co-writers have done it here. This book is a short story cobbled together by Pratchett while Ian Stewart and Jack Cohan wrote about sciency stuff between the chapters. Actually there was much more science then there was Disc-world story. That was probably a good thing (even though I love love love Terry Pratchett), the story just wasn't very engaging. But the science and explanations of our universe and world were top notch. Everything was tied in well together. And it still had it's funny moments, even for a denser read than I was expecting.

To the wizards, it's a small globe in which cosmic evolution takes place. They wind up focusing their attention on one world, ""Roundworld,"" that is, or resembles, ours to the nth decimal place. Here, against all odds, life begins and survives massive vulcanism, comet/meteor smashes, Snowball Earth, and so on, eventually producing sapient life -- several times. (The story speculates on possible cultures long before the rise of humans, of which pretty much all evidence would be wiped out by impactors and such. In the non-fiction chapters, they admit that this is just silly speculation, but they _do_ point out that, if it were true, how would we know?)The non-fiction chapters are not only science exposition, but exposition on the practice, history, and philosophy of science. They are a pretty good read ... I'm tempted to say better than the story, but really it's a tossup.The fiction chapters depend somewhat on previous knowledge of the inhabitants of UU, especially Chancellor Ridcully, Assistant Librarian (and later in the story Egregious Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography) Rincewind, and the Librarian, plus the Luggage. You can pick most of it up from context and exposition, but the Luggage in particular would be confusing to one not familiar with it.In all, an enjoyable read, but not quite as enjoyable as the ""real"" Discworld books."

Disregarding the times where they insulted people who were religious (which would include many scientists), I had a number of issues. There were several points where they revealed that earlier science in the book at been a ""lie-to-children"" (a lie to ""help"" understanding, which I can't stand and they seem to bemoan early on). There were sections where they fudge and qualify a theory, for example: at least once they said something they ""felt"" had no proof but put it forward as an argument for their ideas; some paragraphs are laden with ""perhaps"", ""must have"" and such. They posited multiple hypotheses for some ideas, without going into why those ideas started or which they think makes sense, but also complained about some theories saying they didn't think they were right (no evidence or argument given). They used a term ""extelligence"" long before defining it. They have some paragraphs that are one sentence statements, where I saw them and immediately wanted more details, for instance: ""why do we know this creature had hooves simply from its tooth?""If you want to read a good Discworld story, read any of the main series. If you want a good science book, don't look here."
287,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59978163-tobias,4,"I've had this for years and never quite got around to reading it properly. I started it a few years ago, but then put it down and never picked it back up again. It has been sat on myself now now for at least 10 years, waiting for the right moment for me to pick it back up up and read the last piece of Sir Terry Pratchett writing that I have untouched in my possession.There isn't much of Sir Terry in this, but there is certainly enough for those who mourn his passing to get a little extra hit of his magic. What there is however, is lots of really well explained science. There is a lot of this book that I already have a passing knowledge of common but there's a huge amount that I didn't know anything about at all. What this book does, which is the exclusive preserve of people who really know their stuff, is to explain in simple terms so extremely complicated ideas.Whatever you do or don't know about science and history of the Earth and the history of the Universe and someone, it is highly likely that this book will offer you some insights into a least part of your understanding. And best of all it does it it with a gentle humour that doesn't distract from the subject matter, but always gives a reverential nod to the genus of Sir Terry Pratchett and makes the core material accessible."
288,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,3,"This is not a book that tells you how Terry Pratchett's Discworld works. This is a book that tells you how Earth as we know it was created with an inserted Discworld narrative.I found this book to be entertaining and the science bits to be accurate (for what is provided) with pithy observations and witty sentences. However, the science is a rather basic summary in a somewhat erratic order of the creation of the universe and evolution on planet earth. I started to get a bit bored with the science chapters, though this is possibly due to having read too many books about the universe and evolution to get excited about a repeat. The alternate chapters that deal with the Wizards of Unseen University get more amusing as the book progresses, especially after Rincewind, the Luggage and the Librarian (Ook!) make an appearance. There is nothing like a wizardly outside assessment of Roundworld to show us how crazy life on Earth really is. This was a fun read. I highly recommend this book to fans of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, especially those who aren't too clued up about general science. The alternate science and fantasy chapters of this book might even appeal to younger school children and encouraging an interest in reading and science."
289,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26268161-eilis-o-sullivan,4," This was definitely one of the more unusual Discworld novels that I have read. The fact that it examines our world by making small comparisons to the Discworld made it very interesting in a lot of ways. I was personally quite take with the chapters that explored stuff that we have named but doesn't actually exist or the discussion of the evolution of mammals and how they took over the world. The story of the Wizards was also really good and I loved how each time something happened that seems relatively normal for them it just seems utterly ridiculous. The fact that their world, the Discworld relies on everything being very literal, such as magic existing or darkness and light both existing means that we can look at our world and our universe with a different perspective. Plus the Bursar turning around and being able to understand relativity was outright hilarious.  The only things that make the book suffer is that the science takes up much more of the book than anything else. What doesn't help is the science is slightly out of date since this book was written in the early 2000's. Anything that is explored might be the same, but might also have changed drastically by now. Such as Pluto being demoted from Planet status.  Overall it was an enjoyable, if slow, read and as long as you don't find the science to outdated should be good fun as well. It is a big warning for anyone who isn't aware that this is not like other Discworld books. This is a science book with a Discworld story mixed in. "
290,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24702165-stephen-hergest,3,"When an experiment to split the Thaum results in an excess of magical energy, the wizards of Unseen University pull an old experiment off the shelf and create a pocket universe - our own. But Pratchett's story is only a frame for the story of Earth and the universe, from the Big Bang to humanity's (probably) destiny in the stars. Mathematician Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen spin a highly readable cosmological and biological history of Earth, in a universe (improbable to the wizards) devoid of the essential elements Narritivium (we only think we're living a story - the asteroids have other ideas), Chelonium (the stuff of Turtles), and Elephantium. Still, there may be something called Bloodimindium, as life has a habit of turning up where it can't.Cohen and Stewart certainly make a case for the impermanence of life forms, past and present, and how Life needs mass extinctions in order to reset and experiment until it finds something that works. Food for thought, as our own mass extinction approaches. Did the dinosaurs have a society? No way to prove they didn't. Will humanity make it to the stars? Not even the wizards know; they fast-forwarded a lot. Might be the cockroaches, instead."
291,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7238474-daniel-vasilev,5,"There are books, which make you feel nostalgic for them even before you have reached the back cover, and ""The Science of Discworld"" is definitely a perfect example for one. Here physics and chemistry get intertwined with the latest toys of the wizards at Unseen University. And awesome. things follow. If you want to discover how Roundworld came into being (and was very close to being dominated by a civilization of crabs) side by side with the terrified Rincewind, this book should be for you. In its chapters the explanation of natural science phenomena are followed by the discoveries (and often - the experiments) of the high-ranked staff of the university, presenting both extraordinary explanations and the amazing humor of Terry Pratchett.Probably the only downside to this book (or rather - a disadvantage for some of the readers, who are not yet familiar to the works of Prarchett, so correct yourselves) is the necessity to possess some prior knowledge to characters inhabiting Discworld. But for every Pratchett fan it should be an amazing read and certainly it was for me."
292,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19647364-usfromdk,2,"This book was disappointing. It's at times quite quotable and not badly written, but it contains way too much popular science and way too little Discworld science for my taste. Mostly a rehash of lots of stuff I already knew about topics like physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and Earth science that most people should already know, but probably don't; which also means that many people will like the book better than I did. As is always the case for popular science books it contains many insufficiently documented/substantiated claims, but the regular 'breaks' provided by Pratchett's narrative enabled me to disregard these problems long enough to finish the book.Many people will like this book, and the 2-star rating mostly just indicates that I wasn't in the target group, not that I think it's a terrible book (...and just to remind people, I use the rating system the way goodreads intended it to be used: 2-star books are 'okay')."
293,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2985573-k-fox,3,"The Science of Discworld presents a depiction of the history of a universe very similar to ours (while citing real world science and displaying the actual periods of Earth’s history at times) through an experiment gone wrong at the Unseen University. Thus, the wizards of Discworld get to experience and explore Roundworld in a fun and witty adventure while the reader also gets a fun little lesson in history and science.This is a fun book for anyone. If you find science confusing and annoying, this is a fun way to approach it and learn more. If you are more familiar with science and enjoy re-hearing things you know and seeing new ways to present facts, this is a wonderful resource. It was published in the early 2000’s so some of the science is a bit dated, but not enough to hurt the book in my opinion."
294,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2698659-roberta,5,"I've read reviews of Pratchett fans who skipped the science chapters of these books, and I do not understand that. I believe that the science chapters are the best example of how Pratchett had become so well-read - he was interested in everything and he used everything he read and learned in the Discworld. The first Science of Discworld book contains a lot of information about how planets are created, how our planet came into being, how life came into being on it, how resilient life on Earth is, and everything that we knew in 2002 about space travel and other planets and cosmic objects. It is fascinating stuff, with dinosaurs in it, as well as bacteria that live at hydrothermal vents, how long cement cures once it's been laid down (10 years), and how excreta might have been what caused life to proliferate so quickly once the smallest of life had come into being (Excreta occurs). "
295,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6336797-james,2,"I love Terry Pratchett. His satire and wit is brilliant. That said, this is not what I expected and when I realized what it was it felt watered down. The Science of Discworld is more like the science of our universe juxtaposed against an Unseen University ""roundworld"" experiment. It feels just to be another cosmology/all-that-we-know-about-science-to-date with some occasional Discworld flavor. If you excised all the Discworld bits, I think it would stand alone with ease. In other words the science bits and the Discworld bits are disconnected and independent. It has its Pratchett moments, but in the science side it just reads like a straight cosmology book. I read enough of those as it is, so this was a bit disappointing. "
296,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29170317-kim-clarke,5,"So the Wizards have discovered a vast energy source in an effort to keep warm in winter, so much energy that the prevent the High Energy Magic building from turning Ankh Morpork into a smoking crater (which might be said to be an improvement), Hex diverts the extra power to an experiment Ponder Stibbons has been considering. And so was created a universe in a bottle, eventually containing a bizarre collection of round things.....Alternating between the usual chaos we have come to expect from the faculty of the Unseen University and a few science writers from an oddly shaped roundworld, we go on a journey from the big bang to sometime in the future within a simulated universe.Note to Wizards, don't let the librarian near the experiment."
297,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6286612-molokov,4,"For this readthrough (aloud), we only covered the Discworld chapters, so it was a much shorter read. However, the story of the wizards and their ""Roundworld"" project is highly entertaining, even if I only have vague memories of the explanatory parts in the science chapters. I do know that in this book, the contents of the Discworld and science chapters are closely linked, which is quite good, and it's nice to see a bit more of an in-depth role for Rincewind when dealing with Ridcully and the other faculty members. Quite a fun read, especially for science nerds. I'd actually like to read it again with the science chapters at some point soon."
298,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31388894-sarah,4,"Thanks to aphantasia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia), I have trouble with science concepts for processes I have never/can't actually see. (Probably why the only class I ever failed was undergraduate-level Astronomy; had to do that sucker twice.) A lot of this was early solar system forming, super long time evolving processes, which I have to kind of just trust to other, smarter people. But the fiction story interspersed among the nonfiction chapters was super funny and more helpful for me. I would never be a good sci-fi writer because, while I'm good at science, it's a very, very narrow range of all possible sciences."
299,0091886570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42072706-troix-nayhelm,4,"a shorter, simpler discworld story alternating with wonderfully written ponderings on science and philosophy. the conversational tone of the nonfiction chapters do a great job of inviting and welcoming the reader into formulating their own conclusions and theories, so I'd certainly recommend this to a student or writer who is familiar with fiction but not research papers. great for bite-size reading-- a short chapter and the following segment exploring ideas discussed is plenty satisfying and will keep you thinking. looking forward to the following two in the series-- however many months it takes."
