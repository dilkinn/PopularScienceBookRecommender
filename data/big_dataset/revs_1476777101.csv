0,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Exuberantly (and openly) speculative, Kaplan connects a wide range of magical beliefs, traditions, myths, and legends, with current scientific and historical explanations. “Science of the Magical” is interesting, fun, and sometimes even persuasive.As a science journalist for the Economist, Kaplan is wide ranging in his interests, consulting with specialists in biology, astronomy, minerology, physics, toxicology, paleontology, etc. to help evaluate the plausibility of various scientific explanations for mysterious phenomena. In some cases, Kaplan personally enters into the “research,” tracking wolves and ravens through Yellowstone to investigate their relationship, attempting to navigate a sailboat using Iceland spar (a crystal used to locate the sun during foggy conditions in Icelandic saga), trying to investigate the source of prophetic inspiration at Hera's oracle at Cumae, etc.As you would expect, Kaplan is equally skeptical of supernatural events in all religions and cultures, but he writes in the spirit of “explaining” rather than “debunking,” and his attitude towards the people of a less scientifically oriented world is consistently respectful. As he says, 	 “Yet it would be wrong to always portray people who lived long ago as the clueless ones. 	Things have sometimes worked in reverse, with our ancestors understanding the world in a remarkable way that has been lost, to the ravages of time. 	 Legend tells of the Vikings possessing an artifact called the sunstone, which allowed them to 	successfully navigate the Atlantic Ocean centuries before the invention of the magnetic	compass. For decades, historians dismissed the sunstone as mere fantasy, but evidence is now 	emerging from the fields of physics, mineralogy, and archaeology that this object actually 	existed. Similarly, stories in The Odyssey portray the Greeks as aware of plants with powerful medicinal properties. They considered them to be magical herbs, and often connected them to fantastic stories of the gods. For centuries such tales were disregarded as nothing more than fictions, but recently a number of scientists and historians have started to think that the Greeks 	were onto something” (pp. 4-5).(One of the most intriguing stories he goes on to tell is about moly, an herb which Odysseus is given by the god Hermes to protect him from the magic of the sorceress Circe. In 1981, neurologists proposed that Odysseus's moly may have been snowdrop, a plant matching the description of moly in the Odyssey, and which contains a chemical compound which has “the ability to protect specific neurotransmitters from being damaged by diseases and toxins” (p. 35). The compound, galantamine, is currently being used in Alzheimer's treatments, and, Kaplan points out, it would have been particularly useful in Odysseus's situation since its effects are relatively long lasting.)Breezy and sometimes (especially in the footnotes) flippant, Kaplan's tone suits his approach to the subject, in which he takes his science seriously, checking details with specialists and requiring a fair degree of probability to support theories, but also cheerfully allows that his suppositions of scientific explanations for magical phenomena may well be wrong. (And, speaking of the footnotes, some of them are pretty funny. There is a footnote reference to Pratchett's Death of Rats which caught me by surprise and made me laugh. The quotations from movies, at the beginning of each chapter, are also fun.) I enjoyed this very much."

If you are on a quest to expand your brain and find magic, mythology, ancient lore and religion all to be interesting topics but can't handle one more dry, unemotional observation, you should really consider giving this book a go. I can't honestly say that I have ever read a nonfiction book where the footnotes were funny, until this one. Matt Kaplan approaches science through a different perspective. Clearly he is intelligent and interested in many facets of the world around us and that comes through in his writing, but he approaches things in a way that makes the reader feel involved and keeps you wondering what he is going to conquer next. Through his recounting of personal experiences interwoven with scientific fact, he gives us a broader view of the topics at hand.You'll feel smarter after you read his work, but you won't feel that usual brain burn that tends to follow reading a serious text. This would be a great book for older students, as it won't put them to sleep. The author included a variety of different topics and made each one of them interesting and easy to understand. Honestly, this is the most fun I've had with a nonfic in a long time, possibly ever. Highly recommended. Looking forward to checking out the author's other work now.

2,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,4,"A few months ago I started reading The Pained Bird by Jerzy Kosinski and I found myself astonished by the portrayal of a folk doctor Olga the Wise One as being exquisitely knowledgeable and outrageously ""out there"" in her beliefs. She takes in a young outsider and he watches her treat patients with skill that, in its way, borders on magic. On the other hand, the boy has to suffer the troubling mystical and xenophobic notions that seem to come hand-in-hand with the medical knowledge based in science. Because he is darker than the other country folk, he is considered to be ""possessed"" by an evil spirit, and this causes him not only to be mistrusted, but also to mistrust himself. A lot of us might know in a logical sense that stories aren't true, but they can still affect our belief systems in damaging and dangerous ways. To a degree, there are many whose belief systems are still very much stuck in the middle ages and probably long before that, because the power of stories is profound and often keeps us from unlearning nonsense and relearning updated ways of looking at the world. (It's hard to let go of a flat earth, because it's not as good for Gods to play frisbe with. Gods play frisbee, not soccer!!!)But, back to the Kosinsky and Olga the Wise who is at once a deeply intelligent scientist and a peddler of bizarre and mistaken but not uncommon xenophobic mystical notions. And I got to thinking, it makes sense to a degree that these things could come together, folk beliefs about the supernatural etc. and rigorous science, an odd but not incomprehensible marriage of convenience. One small example, strangers might bring 'new' diseases with them that could harm people who have not built immunity to them (I should know...I live near Amherst, a place named for the guy who used Smallpox as biological warfare against the Native Americans) and so folk medicine and superstition ('foreign' people being possessed by evil spirits, i.e.) might grow tangled together and stay tangled for a good many generations (or eons.) So how do we look at ancient texts and old myths and try to parse out what in them resembles truth. Of course, this isn't a new line of inquiry. The first thing that comes to my mind is biblical historians trying to prove that things that happen in sacred texts have some basis in historical reality. And I imagine there is a long history of people studying other mythologies and folklores for hints of 'real' history and science. Kaplan doesn't go too deeply into the work of his predecessors and I think it would be a much better book if it gave a bit more credit to those who came before him, not just because it's a nice thing to do, but also because it would strengthen and deepen and add seasoning to his arguments. This book is a quick romp through a subject matter that could go on and on and on. The 'quick romp' factor accounts for some of this books charms and some of its drawbacks.For example, in the opening chapter, he breaks up ""healing"" into ""Prayers, Sacred Pools, Regeneration, and Holy Eyeliner"" and twenty pages later we're in the next chapter. ""Transformations"" goes on for another mere twenty pages, including a two-page verse excerpt from Ovid's Metamorphoses about Hermaphrodite and another couple of paragraphs of Kaplan explaining his childhood rebellion and its relationship to his art museum experiences (unlike other rebelling kids, he didn't ""drink"" and ""drive too fast"" but rather, since his mother was a Renaissance scholar, he decided to go for Baroque.) His discussion of transgender folks leaves quite a bit to be desired. The one good thing I can say about this chapter is that he mentions that hormone blockers have been used therapeutically with kids successfully and with little to no side-effects for many years for conditions not related to being trans. That's nice because some people worry trans kids shouldn't use hormone blockers because it might ""stunt"" their growth, etc. It's safe, people. And I can't tell you how often I wish they were available when I was a kid (along with some more supportive parents). If you are looking for a thorough, scholarly and well-contextualized address of the topics addressed in this book (mythology, folklore, folk medicine, magic, science...), this isn't it. If you are looking for an interesting and intelligent book that touches upon many topics and includes the author having conversations with quite a few experts on intersting subjects, such as whether looking at the livers of animals for the sake of prognostication might have any real-life scientific merit, well, you're in luck. This book is more of a 3.5 when I look at it as a whole, but I decided to round up as there are so many wonderful moments scattered throughout."

4,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/894917-angelina,4,"I love Matt Kaplan's writing style; I love that he takes science and traditional folk beliefs and shows how the two influence each other in meaningful ways. His footnotes are clever and funny, which makes reading his books instructional and amusing."

While the book isn't one of those open a page and bam QUOTES GALORE sort of book, it's a very eye-opening book.Science of the magical looks at things that we consider magic or mythical, to see if there can be any basis in reality. So, can superheroes really exist? What about love potions? And was Circe from The Odessy really a witch? All these, and more, are topics covered in the book.Matt Kaplan writes in an engaging, and easy to understand style. Each chapter can stand alone, and within each chapter, he writes about his discoveries in the order that he makes it. There are tons of references, and I'm glad that he is there to break it down for the reader. I read this in two sittings, and neither time did I have to close the book because I was learning so much that my brain needed to take a break. I was learning, but it wasn't a chore.I don't really have much to say, apart from that. If you're the sort that's inspired or curious about myths and legends (or you want to find out the possibility of becoming one of the X-Men), I think you'd enjoy this book. As for me, I'm going to try to see if I can get my hands on a copy of one of his earlier works - Science of Monsters (or something like that).To close, I leave you with another quote that I particularly liked:With this final point in mind, I'd argue that science and magic are not as much at odds with each other as we tend to think. I might even describe the experience of discovering the science behind our myths as magical.Disclaimer: I got a free copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a free and honest review.This review was first posted at Inside the mind of a Bibliophile"
6,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861086-margaret-sankey,3,"This is fun popular science, as Kaplan, as in his previous book, tries to figure out how ancient ""magic""--oracles, divination, holy people, sacred caves--might have actually worked. Along the way, he considers how livers actually do tell you if an animal has been on good land or under stressed conditions, that scientific observation shows that Tibetan monks can control their body temperatures through meditation, the Oracle at Delphi was probably the result of fumes from the rocks, and that Mayan royal focus and insight may well have been the result of sticking cactus spines into their genitalia.

Literature, history, mythology, biology - you'll find a nice mix of everything here. Hard to add anything more to this review - you'll just have to find out the magical (or scientific?) world of this book for yourself."
9,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/446799-audra,1,"Did not finish - far too speculative, with a hokey ""dad-joke"" tone - for someone who loves both science and the wide world of things considered magic, this book was a huge disappointment.

13,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11188049-jordan,4,"Find this review at Forever Lost in Literature!**I received a copy of Science of the Magical by Matt Kaplan courtesy of NetGalley and Scribner**Have you ever found yourself wondering about the Philosopher's Stone and the myth of its 'powers'? What about love potions and sleeping draughts? The effect of moon phases? Look no further, because Science of the Magical explores all of that!Science of the Magical is by far one of the most entertaining and enjoyable nonfiction books I have read all year. Matt Kaplan is truly a master at creating a lively and engaging narrative that combines science with ancient history, mythology, and folklore. Kaplan's purpose is to describe the scientific accuracy and origins of these myths. What I really appreciated about his writing was that he didn't try exceptionally hard to make the scientific aspect fit, and he also didn't poke fun at the origins of some of these ideas, whether they seem silly or not.The information presented throughout this book is the kind that makes you turn to the nearest human in your vicinity (or move to a location where there is a human in the area) and say, ""Hey, did you know?"" or ""Wow, listen to this..."" My poor mother said she didn't mind, but after you've done it for the twentieth or so time, you start to wonder if she really means that. Kaplan introduces such a wide variety of magic and myths that the book easily flows from one topic to the next. Almost all of these supernatural ideas have a natural or almost scientific origin that led to their creation, and it is extremely fascinating to discover this backstory.Overall, Science of the Magical will be receiving four-and-a-half stars. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who's even slightly curious about magical and mythical things. Similarly, you're looking for something funny and informative at the same time, here you go! This would be perfect for anyone who just needs a good book to read and enjoy, because Kaplan will definitely give you that."
14,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23079142-sarah-coolcurrybooks,3,"In Science of the Magical, science writer for The Economist Matt Kaplan investigates possible scientific truths behind tales of the magical from folklore, mythology and pop culture. For instance, can examining the liver of an animal really tell you anything about the future? Or is there something to the eye make up that the Ancient Egyptians wore to grant protection? As it turns out, the liver of an animal can tell you much about the environmental conditions it lived in, and the eye makeup contained chemicals that brought some protection from disease.Science of the Magical is basically a collection of interesting facts. At times it was interesting, and at times it felt like he was reaching. Given the nature of the book, it’s easy to pick up and put down again. It took me about three weeks to actually read the entire thing when I more usually read books in a matter of days.I did like the breezy style and references to pop culture. There was a footnote that referenced Discworld that I absolutely adored.The book was generally well researched, but I do have issues with a couple of sections. There’s a section about genderbending, such as Tiresias from Greek mythology, where Kaplan starts talking about transgendered people. However, he never actually speaks to someone who’s transgender. He does the same thing for a section on savants when he’s talking about autistic people and never speaks to someone autistic. He talks to psychologists who study these people, but he never talks to the people themselves!I’m not certain if I’d recommend Science of Magic or not. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t read it, but I finished it a week ago and feel like I’ve already forgotten most of it. In whole, it failed to make an impression, probably due to the disparate nature of the stories it investigates.Review originally posted on The Illustrated Page."
15,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"“The Science of the Magical” is exactly what the title sounds like: explanations for things people have called ‘magic’, both in the past and present. The book ranges widely; he covers transforming into animals, healing pools, oracles, animals with uncanny behaviors, berserker warriors, near death experiences, Captain America, things from ancient history to modern days. Kaplan is a science writer, and as such has a lot of contacts in all areas of science, which helped a lot in his investigations. Some things are fairly easy; hot springs made people feel better simply by being warm in areas and times that were really hard to stay warm enough in. Hot water helps many cases of sore, aching joints. No real mystery there. Predicting the future by watching the movements of birds was a little harder, but he makes a good case for birds being able to sense which way the winds are prevailing. It turns out that shifting currents can mean a winter either colder or warmer than usual, depending on which way it’s moving, much as El Nino/La Nina means for us in the Pacific Northwest. The birds are just following the winds. The Oracle at Delphi has been pretty well explained before; the cave she did her prognosticating in had a crack in the floor that exhaled toxic fumes that caused oxygen starvation in the brain. Super soldiers close to existing, between amphetamines to keep soldiers awake and provide focus, steroids to enhance strength, and drugs that increase red blood cell count and thus the amount of oxygen present in the blood- shades of Lance Armstrong there!The author writes in a clear, accessible style. He always stays respectful of the culture from which the magical belief comes from. He’s very witty as well as well educated. The book reads like what you’d get if Terry Pratchett actually wrote a science book (instead of teaming up with science writers)- especially in the footnotes. Fast and fun to read. "
16,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/784856-stephanie,4,"**An eARC was received from the publisher via Netgalley**One of the recurring themes in my life has been the dichotomy of science vs spirituality, and it's no surprise that I was immediately drawn to this book, which proposed to examine a selection of magical beliefs in a scientific manner.What I was not prepared for or expecting was the humour in this book. Kaplan writes with a snarky, sardonic wit, and the footnotes especially demonstrate this. There's a keen mind behind that wit, too, so don't mistake this for some fluffy text - but the humour and voice make this a book which is very easy to read.There are so many things explored in this book - the philosopher's stone, the effect of moon cycles, Berserkers, the Sybils - and each of them is examined in depth, with Kaplan bringing in experts aplenty and taking journeys to investigate the ""magical"" phenomena (including trying to get past a locked gate into a cave containing poison gas, and realising that the locks and gates were there for a very good reason).Very readable and fascinating. Recommended."
17,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9785054-paul-flagg,4,"What a fantastic work of nonfiction! This book's cover initially caught my attention, and once I read the title, I knew I had to read the book. Full of fact and folklore, Science of the Magical debunks many myths and magical practices by breaking them down using science, but it also considers the heretofore unknown as a kind of magic in itself. Exploring the use of wands and love potions to healing springs and oracles, this fascinating book offers the reader equal measures of science and fiction. Kaplan writes so very beautifully and adds bits of humor throughout that make this such a captivating read. I was caught from the beginning and enjoyed every bit of this book to the very end. I am really looking forward to reading his other book, The Science of Monsters."
18,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9389270-snowynight,2,"while a book of interesting trivia and fact, the way he talks around the actual people is a bit annoying (e.g. in the section of genderbending, rather than interviewing actual transgender people who receive treatment before adolescence, he talks to the doctors instead about the supposed effect of early transition and doesn't seem to think he needs to talk with the actual people with actual experience there.)"

21,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28829430-david-gamble,3,"I really looked forward to reading this book, but then felt disappointed. First, the author clearly hasn't experienced the kind of mysticism or magic that makes the science the side point, so it's written as 'if there's no scientific reason outside the practitioner it wasn't real/they weren't on to something/it was just superstition.' There's not enough focus on any one topic, either. It felt almost like pointing at a topic, presenting a study or two, and moving on- this didn't do any justice to any of the things talked about. It didn't dig deep enough, or, in some cases, even represent what was being researched well. There was also a layer of frustration for me as a person whom this author would obviously be uncomfortable around as he consistently suggests that oracles, hermaphrodites, diviners, and others are people to be uncomfortable around or are strange and not understandable. As someone who falls into those (and other) categories, reading the book made me very aware that the author saw me as a not real thing and as something to be uncomfortable around. I'm not using those personal feelings for the rating I'm giving it, but if you're actually a practitioner, intersex, or anything else, prepare for a heaping dose of 'you're a freak or mentally ill.' Finally, and I didn't use this as a marker for the rating either because I see it's again personal, I found myself incredibly bored most of the time, spacing out on certain things and having to re-read them. I think the writer must just come from a much more drab world than I do. That said, there were some interesting studies present in the book. This person clearly did research on their own outside of what's already published, and I have to give credit there. "
22,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999358-rachel-noel,5,"I absolutely loved Kaplan's book ""The Science of Monsters"" and had been eagerly looking for a copy of this book as well. I am happy to report, I was not disappointed! My feelings towards both of these books are actually summarized by Teller (of Penn & Teller) in the introduction: ""To any enlightened dweller of our century, knowing increases wonder. I don't just think this, I know it. If you believe, you oversimplify in the way a child might initially believe there is no complex evolution of life. That simplification in no way increases your sense of wonder. If, however, you know how life came to be on our planet, the wonder is immense!"" And that is the attitude that permeates all of these chapters in ""Science of the Magical"". Finding the truth behind the mysticism, knowing how the trick is done, just makes all of it so much more intriguing and amazing! Sometimes it's just coming to grips with how much our ancient ancestors actually knew, even if they didn't fully understand.Kaplan does a wonderful job of making all of this science very accessible to readers of any background and interest. He also does a very good job of citing his sources. Because of this, I've increased my TBR list substantially, but Kaplan writes these things in such a way that I want to know more! I need to know more!This book is such a treasure and would be enjoyable to pretty much anyone with any interest in the science behind all things mystical. Instead of ""killing the joke"" by over-explaining it, it's like the cool science experiment that changes your world view. This book was a great read, I couldn't put it down! 5 hoots!"
23,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8588962-alicea,3,"Science of the Magical: From the Holy Grail to Love Potions to Superpowers by Matt Kaplan is a compendium of magical anecdotes. (It would have to be with a mouthful of a title like that.) Kaplan organizes everything under different subsections which allows him to cover a lot of ground but as someone who has delved into a lot of this genre much of it was already known to me (or self-explanatory). My favorite thing about this book were the often hilarious footnotes which I think saved the book from becoming too overblown. For instance, while a lot of the book was informative and genuinely interesting it was marred by the author's writing 'voice' which came across as forced. It seemed like he was trying too hard to be 'cool' and 'relevant' and instead it was just grating. By the time the reader reaches the conclusion, you expect there to be some sort of overarching theme or lesson learned but Kaplan seems to almost have tacked it on at the very end in an almost halfhearted fashion. It doesn't so much as conclude as leave the reader feeling somewhat disappointed that it wasn't well-rounded. I don't want this to come out as overwhelmingly negative because if you're someone who hasn't read much on these topics then this would be a great jumping off point but for the more seasoned reader it's less of a revelation and more of a rehashing. If you want a book which is full of facts and historical anecdotes then you could do worse by picking up this book. 6/10"
24,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414282-peter-bradley,4,"Please give my review on Amazon a helpful vote - https://www.amazon.com/review/R2UNKOA...This is the written equivalent of the old ""In Search Of..."" documentary television series. The series would offer rational explanations for topics like Noah's ark, or vampires, or other things that straddle history and myth. The series was vastly entertaining, but essentially fluff.This book seems to have higher quality material than the old series. Some of it was top-notch speculation, e.g., the oracle at Delphi, but some of it went of the tracks, e.g., the Adam and Eve story is about humans consuming mind-expanding mushrooms. The writing as a whole was breezy and entertaining. The author, Matt Kaplan, is a science writer, so he is up to date on current science. He liberally sprinkles his knowledge into his sections on various ancient ""magic"" to provide an explanation for the lore, and, on occasion, he tests his theories. I enjoyed his descriptions of his personal experiences ""in search of"" answers, and the book had sections that provoked a ""gosh-wow!"" reaction for me.The book is enjoyable, but not deep. "
25,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65511494-the-ether,4,"This book is probably 7/10. Right up my alley, as I like to learn. Kaplan ran the gamut on the magical stuff, although sometimes left me with a few more questions than answers. For example, the Oracle of Delphi were women that inhaled a vapor, which he discusses, but still made many prophetic predictions, which he doesn't. Additionally, he tends to go into detail where he doesn't necessarily need to, like when he's talking about autistic savants and starts naming brain molecules. Highly, HIGHLY researched and actually pretty funny, worth a read. The only other issue I had was that I was uncomfortable reading more than a few pages at a time, because I was afraid of losing some of the knowledge he was dispensing or glossing over something I shouldn't.PROS: Well researched; informative; FUNNY!; interesting subject matterCONS: A little too detailed in some places (which slows the pace), and not in others (see example above); doesn't answer alot of questions - after the science is detailed, he doesn't post an opinion or speculation regarding further origins, or provide any more insight as to origin of the myths or propose any alternative solutions. "
26,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28627991-gina,4,"This book is the product of some very in-depth research. Well written, it covers a very wide range of ancient (and more recent) myths with scientific explanations. I would say this book would interest anyone with a thirst for scientific knowledge just as much as the person who enjoys a good mystery. Do love potions work? What about the legend of the Fountain of Youth? How much influence does the moon REALLY have on our lives? And Mario - what about those magic mushrooms? Does anything like those magical plants exist in reality? When you realize the eons of time the author covers in talking about legends, you also come to accept that we really aren't any different this many years past. Current superhero movies attest to that. We are fascinated by what our brains tell us is scientifically impossible.We continue to search for magic in our lives, and we always will. "
27,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5613182-emily,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I picked it up on a whim and was afraid it would be a bit dense, but it really dug into many issues that I find quite interesting. I found myself wanting to discuss a lot of it with someone else, if only I could have a book club! Nevertheless the book really spoke about how myths and religion may seem outlandish now but most likely have scientific explanations for miracles, plagues, love potions etc. The quote at the very beginning from LOTR really explains it the best ""And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth."""

The author also injects a lot of humor by way of the footnotes and the writing in general without it ever feeling as if it is interrupting the flow of his discussion. I don't want to give anything away as part of the fun of this one is learning as you go, but I will say there was a moment my brain automatically jumped to a nerdy conclusion regarding Ravens and Wolves and Game of Thrones that the author immediately called me out for while reading that I loved. "
29,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91990113-anita,2,"I guess I was looking for the wrong things in this book. I was hoping for more insight into the prophet's stone, the emerald tablets, the tree of life, etc., something along the lines of Jewish Mysticism. I enjoyed some of his interviews with a Jewish scholar, as well as the last chapter, concerning neurological and physiological studies. Parts of it peaked my interest, but left me wanting more. Although his modern super-hero movie references were cute, they were as superfluous as his mythological references. I do not recommend this book. "
30,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17521135-brandi-thompson,4,"This was almost a five star book for me, but he lost me a little bit in the last couple of chapters. Overall, this is a fun, engaging, smart book that uses modern science to investigate myths and magic. There are plenty of fun geek references thrown in, to boot. My only complaint is that the last couple of chapters felt slightly haphazard and rushed in comparison to the rest of the book. Still a great book and I would recommend to most any nerd who wants a quick, fun read. "
31,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47643872-ezza-syuhada,5,I really liked this book. It was a highly enjoyable read. Did it answer all the questions it posed? No... No it didnt but how could it? The questions asked in this book were a wide array and some the answers have been lost to time. In conclusion reading this book has made me realize the endless possibilities available in the world and I also enjoyed how the author linked past historical myths to facts as well as tell a modern parallel of the same story. 
32,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33143539-catherine-milos,3,"I found Kaplan's book a bit dull and repetitive in places, but overall it was an insightful look at how science and magic are symbiotic. He covered a wide range of topics and ideas. I was hoping for a more in-depth look, though. Great read. Science, Journalists, and fantasy lovers would be interested in this book."
33,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9747042-jolanta,5,"I'm going to echo everyone who enjoyed this book because it combines folklore and mythology with a good dose of science. I can see how all the scientific information might be too nerdy for some people who expect more information about mythology, but everyone who likes both should find this title an enjoyable read."
34,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45258156-jamie-z,5,This was a fantastic read that blended mythology with science and gave us very possible explanations for many magical things I've always been curious about. Matt Kaplan does thorough and interesting research and doesn't present a solution without the facts to back up his hypothesis. I loved his other book and I loved this one as well. I will definitely blind-buy anything else he puts out.
35,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,3," An interesting read about how much of what we now know as science was once considered magic. Kaplan touches on the idea that we tend to underestimate the nderstanding of people from the past because of this, but he doesn't follow up on the implications of that, which is what would have made this book great. "
36,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91666094-jessica-lalonde,3,"I found the writer's style to be distracting. It felt like the script to a youtube video, and the information he provided wasn't anything groundbreaking. I think this may just be my own fault, so I won't rate it lower. I think I was expecting more of a ""how magic could work"" from a scientific perspective, more than ""why we believe in magic"", which is what this book was. "
37,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5580637-sandy,2,"Too little science and too much of the author's personality. Quirky pop culture references are ok, but not really what the title and description of the book led the reader to expect. Disappointing and unoriginal. "
38,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32625845-meghan,2,The topic is really promising but I was disappointed with the execution. Not a fan of the overly casual writing style. Also some of the examples were really weak and it would've been more compelling to cover just the strongest and most interesting cases in more depth.
39,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10615754-rem71090,5,"Matt Kaplan is a giant nerd and I want to be his friend. There is a clear tone to this book, and I suspect Kaplan and I have different views on many things, and I can understand where people might get rubbed the wrong way. That said, the tone and humor really work for me "
40,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74839503-alanna,5,I found it to be incredibly well researched. I enjoyed that Kaplan took a skeptical approach but rather than look for ways to debunk these beliefs he explains how they could have come about through science.

46,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56636670-j-milius,4,"An engaging sampling of myth and history, examined through the lens of various scientific disciplines. Accessible and prone to stir up all kinds of story ideas."
47,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13843729-k,5,I really liked this. Nice combination of telling the stories and the science behind them.
48,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50934336-kimberly-smith-williams,3,Kaplan discusses autism as a burden and a future cure. Unnecessary and detracts from the book and his reputation.

52,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23314911-matt-kaplan,4,"This book takes a fun scientific look at how our ancestors used mythology to explain amazing things that they saw in the natural world around them but did not understand.It is not a dense academic text on either science or mythology but rather a light survey that explores a wide range of topics ranging from how we can build better antibiotics by studying the beliefs of the ancient Egyptian followers of Horus to how modern medicine is moving towards making Wolverine from X-men into a reality. Overall, it was a joy to write* and a pleasure to read, even when I had to read it for the twentieth time in editorial, but how can I possibly give it five stars? First of all, wouldn't that be incredibly arrogant? Second, if I were to give myself five stars, what am I supposed to give the Odyssey, Neil Gaiman's American Gods** or Terry Pratchett's Small Gods? Nope, I have to limit myself to four.The book is shelved in a lot of stores as about the paranormal and, frankly, that's just odd. At its heart, this is a science book with a hefty dash of mythology (both ancient and modern) thrown in. I'd understand if some stores shelved it in mythology, that's not completely crazy, but the definition*** of ""paranormal"" is ""not scientifically explainable"" and the entire concept of the book circles around providing scientific explanations. As for what I really liked in this book, I had a great time researching the content behind the transformations chapter and I think that comes through in the voice of the writing there. It was horrid having to edit that section because I kept getting caught up in reading the material rather than thinking about wretched matters of punctuation and structure. I was blown away by a lot of the science that went into the healing chapter too and there, again, I think the enthusiasm leaps off the page. Even so, my favourite chapter, by far, is Animals as Omens, Guides and Gods. I say that mostly because that's the chapter with Oscar in it and I can't read that bloody section without getting tears in my eyes when the little boy is told the cat is helping grandma get to heaven. But it also looks at the science behind animals sensing weather and geologic disasters before they strike, the ecology behind the Viking god Odin's animal companions and the key animal themes in Game of Thrones**** and how James Cameron hired botanists to help him fuse the latest discoveries on plant signal transduction into Avatar.  * For I am that Matt Kaplan.** I don't know how that book can only have a 4.1 on Goodreads. Madness.*** At least according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. **** Winter is coming. "
53,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33276635-chaunceton-bird,4,"This was an entertaining examination of the science behind what our ancestors (and present-day believers) perceived to be magic or the work of the gods. The book naturally had to be selective in its choice of which mystical stories to analyze, as human history is overflowing with ""magic"" and ""spiritual experiences,"" and no book could reasonably be expected to cover it all. The examples this book uses are interesting. However, as a descendant of western Europe, I would have liked to see more analysis of common Judeo-Christian myths. That said, the book does (briefly) discuss near-death experiences, and a couple bible/torah-based stories. Overall this was entertaining and enlightening. Mr. Kaplan provides theoretical scientific explanations for what humans have in the past perceived to be physically impossible without the assistance of magic or deity. For example, in 150 BCE, humans thought that, say, seizures were largely the result of demonic possession. In 2016, humans understand epilepsy. Sapping some of the mysticism from both our historical and present human experience benefits humanity by diminishing gullibility and encouraging iconoclasm. "
54,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2107008-adriana,5,"I absolutely loved this book. I had the opportunity to see Kaplan discuss this in a college course style presentation at my local bookstore, and it was riveting enough that I bought the book on the spot.Besides having an absolutely stellar career as a science journalist with a background in paleontology worthy of Dr. Jones, apparently Matt Kaplan has an undeterred curiosity about what ties the brain makes between the ever-evolving scientific world, and what was once defined as ""magical"" in earlier times, and might still be considered unexplained now.Making the connection between Egyptian, Viking, Mayan, Christian and Greek/Roman myths to comic book superheroes and supernatural practices (rain dances, sorcery, alchemy, etc.), some of my favorite explorations of topics in this book were when Matt and his team would set up a lab experiment to test a theory (i.e. is there a material that can detect poison, which chalices were once made out of?) and sometimes, they would come up with exciting results, and sometimes not. The pure childhood indulgence, albeit via an adult budget and funding of many of his experiments, just goes to show how we never lose our curiosity, we just get better at problem solving. And sometimes, suspension of disbelief with full ability to research into methods, can yield some pretty exciting results. Discussing specifics of Kaplan's ""myth or magic"" experiments would only ruin the pure enjoyment and intellectual stimulation of reading this book. "
55,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6159190-chris-keeve,2,"Started out with a compelling thesis that was gradually abandoned in favor of vaguely pretentious anecdotes and pseudo-investigative trivia. It's a great concept, but there's no depth."
56,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,2,"Meh. Some parts are at least halfway interesting, like Iceland spar as the Norse ""sunstone."" But, that's not magical, and it was never claimed to be so, a millennium ago.The association of ravens and wolves was more interesting indeed. While having metaphysical connections to Norse religious belief (and to American Indians, Siberians and others that didn't get mention), it's not *magical.* There's no myth of Odin becoming a shape-changer via magic potion.And, other things in this book are simply overreach. Given that most religious scholars believe an ""Exodus"" never happened and never existed, trying to explain it in terms of natural events is a waste of paper. That's not to mention that, even if an actual Exodus had happened, most the events were not ""invoked"" by a Moses the magician. Even worse is his attempt to look at Genesis and claim that the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil probably reflects,if not magic mushrooms, the idea that other plant foods can have mind-altering properties. Rather, the expulsion myth probably shares distant roots with the Near Eastern source of Persephone in Hades.Why a Carl Zimmer so favorably blurbed this, I don't know."
57,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/412055-kerfe,4,"""Does knowing how something magical works make it into something other than magic?"" That is Matt Kaplan's quest.Science seeks explanations. And nature has endless solutions to problems. Much of legend and myth has a basis in the workings of the natural world. What we don't understand looks magical. And humans are also easily fooled.But looking for the reasons doesn't decrease delight in the world: ""knowing increases wonder."" Like Kaplan, I found myself often going ""wow!"" Just because you know why something is happening doesn't make what happens any less amazing.One of my favorite chapters explains the complicated reciprocal relationship of ravens and wolves, and how this may have led to the stories surrounding the Norse god Odin. And yes, birds really can be used to predict weather. Our ancestors were close observers of the natural world, and the integration of their lives with plants and animals involved ""magic"" that we are often now re-learning.Which makes it even more important to preserve the diversity of this interconnected and mysterious planet we inhabit. To retain the magic."
58,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15563192-tinika,3,"Science of the Magical: From the Holy Grail to Love Potions to Superpowers is a book of speculation regarding the truth behind myth and legend. It is not as good as one would have expected with such an awesome premise. Science of the Magical tries to cover a lot. Our stories of the magical and supernatural have a long and broad history and Matt Kaplan tries to include everything - enchanted objects, magical healing, transformation, etc. - meaning that it is difficult to skim beyond the surface in such a short book. Kaplan does give intriguing suppositions to the experts for comment but rarely gets a definitive answer. After all, those guys seeking super strength or immortality a few thousand years ago did not leave detailed lab notes so we can only guess how Berserkers got their strength or what Homer really meant when he talked about men turning into pigs. Yes, Science of the Magical does include some probables but many more possibles and quite a few pulling at straws. Fun but not as informative as it promises."
59,1476777101,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49411105-balkanoide,5,"This book caught me by surprise. I was in the train on my way back from a family weekend, my computer and phone had died out and so I was stuck with nothing to do, except for this book my uncle had given me as a present - cause he loves scientific books and somehow assumed I would like it too, even though I'm much more into fiction. Well, I soon found myself captivated by the way the author Matt Kaplan takes apart each myth, bit by bit, as if I'm reading a mystery novel; only the clues are actually based on real scientific evidence! As if that wasn't enough, the author then takes things the other way by looking at how modern fiction has inspired scientific progress. I found his interviews with the scientists the most gripping, as he starts by exposing himself by asking these seemingly insane ideas to actually get not far fetch answers on how those things could become possible. This book has made me value fiction and classics in a new way. "
