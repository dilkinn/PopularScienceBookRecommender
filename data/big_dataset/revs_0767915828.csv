0,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7816541-john,1,"DOES THE AUTHOR HAVE A CONSCIENCE?What I liked about this book: It is very well written. Dr. Stout’s ghostwriter is exceptionally gifted and the book has a delightfully brisk pace, very clear language, and (mostly) smooth transitions.Its substance, however, is cartoonish pop psychology masquerading as information. It draws its popularity from the same source as the The Da Vinci Code, under-informed, uncritical readers with a penchant for sensationalism; mostly [redacted]. In the hands of its intended audience, it is pure mind poison.So here’s what I did not like about the book: (1) It invites readers with no professional training to set out on a scavenger hunt to unearth a very subtle psychiatric condition amongst their friends and acquaintances and to label, publicly “out,” and ostracize them as “sociopaths.” This book sells itself partly as a kind of witch-hunt manual, helping the reader hunt down the evil sociopaths next door (invariably people who have wronged you or whom you don’t like) and expose them and expurgate them from your life and human society.(2) It invites readers to see themselves as victims of an invisible class of evil people and to put anyone who cheats, or hurts, or manipulates them into this class of secret evil victimizers. This evil class is partly bred by American tradition and society because they reward people for being competitive and individualistic and then helps the evil sociopaths hide. Thus, the reader is indirectly victimized even by the institutions of American culture. But this book gives you the easy steps you need to survive the evil, so buy a copy for your friends—your non-sociopath friends, that is. (3) The book’s promulgation of the revolutionary notion that all crime and anti-social behavior, which are not the product of extreme hardship or extreme emotional distress, are perpetrated by sociopaths. The book literally divides the human race into two groups, those with a conscience, who never do anything really bad unless they are starving or out of their mind with rage, and “them,” the conscience-free sociopaths, who do all the remaining evil with a cool head. 	Thus, all con men are sociopaths. All non-starving burglars and thieves are sociopaths. Art thieves, sociopaths. Insider traders, sociopaths. Leaders who start wars are sociopaths (Jefferson Davis? Sociopath. He promoted slavery too, so he’s a double sociopath—twice the evil in one conscienceless evil man.) Your ex who lied to you and manipulated you? Sociopath. A friend lies to you three times—only probably a sociopath.  This idea is so bad, it is amazing it made it into print. Notice how perniciously it dovetails with a reader’s own emotional frailties. So your ex isn’t just your ex now—he or she is a sociopath, which explains why he or she never really loved oh-so-lovable you. One can see why the book finds a market.(4) The book’s reckless and unexplained attribution of sociopathy to a range notable figures in politics and history. Conspicuous examples include former U.S. President George W. Bush, whose sociopathy as a cause of unnecessary wars is tediously and ham-handedly alluded to over and over; and Napoleon Bonaparte (whom I never have a kind comment for, but who’s loyalty and affection for his family is well-documented); Genghis Khan, Jochi Khan (only because he had too many wives—sociopath), Kublai Khan, Mussolini, and every other cheap target that no one would want to defend. The book then implies that most politicians and successful business people are probable sociopaths. (5) Obviously, part of the problem is the book’s (and the profession’s) vague factors for determining who is a sociopath. The books recommends tests such as: Has the person lied to you three times? Probably a sociopath. Has the person hurt you more than once and asked for mercy? Definitely a sociopath. And similarly half-witted tests that really only make sense if you buy into the book’s core doctrine that, barring extremis, only sociopaths do bad things. However, even the constellation of factors from the DSM is embarrassingly non-specific: (a) failure to conform to social norms; (b) deceptiveness; (c) impulsiveness or failure to plan ahead; (d) irritability and aggressiveness; (d) reckless disregard for personal safety or the safety of others; (e) consistent irresponsibility in work or financial matters; (f) lack of remorse for misconduct. Sounds like most high school students. Thus, the mean old woman next door who has a trust fund and fights with her neighbors over trifles and who puts a rock over a groundhog hole in her own yard is a sociopath. The perpetually indolent new husband who doesn’t care at all about his wife or new son and has a transient interest in lithographs is a sociopath. You can find a sociopath wherever you want to—with the help of this book. (6) I can hardly do better to illustrate the sensationalist, cartoonish, and genuinely anti-social nature of this disservice to books than to quote the publisher’s marketing snippet: “Who is the devil you know? Is it your lying, cheating ex-husband? Your sadistic high school gym teacher? Your boss who loves to humiliate people in meetings? The colleague who stole your idea and passed it off as her own? In the pages of The Sociopath Next Door, you will realize that your ex was not just misunderstood. He’s a sociopath. And your boss, teacher, and colleague? They may be sociopaths too.” And so on. They have judged their audience well.(7) Since suspicion must now necessarily fall on me, let me say, for the record, I am NOT a sociopath. I have a conscience. I feel guilty all the time, often for things I shouldn’t. I am not a sociopath denier. I believe in sociopathy. I believe it is fairly common. However, I don’t believe this book’s practical recommendations allow ordinary people to determine who is a sociopath. If a person lies to you, or hurts you, or cheats you, you should drop them because that person did bad things to you, not because a book says the person has a psychiatric disorder that makes them a member of an invisible evil society of the congenitally amoral that you can only see with included decoder glasses. The main fallacy of the book is that it begins by saying sociopaths are hard even for professionals to detect, but then claims that this book can let anyone do it. This is accomplished because the book makes the remarkable conclusion that everyone who persistently does bad things is a sociopath. Thus, repeated bad behavior – rage or poverty = sociopathy. Believe it if you want to, but I say it’s nuts.So what value is the book? It is mainly good at one thing: Making money for Martha. Beyond that, it is also very thought provoking as an exemplar of what can pass for legitimate publishing these days. Even so, the book asks many good questions. It provides much serious-sounding analysis containing some sound and even highly intelligent components, but then goes on to provide simplistic and twisted “answers” that are little more than attractive fodder for simple minds. The books gets one star, not because it is all bad or badly executed. There are innumerable quality chunks in it. However, the cumulative effect of the book is, in my opinion, as dangerous and anti-social as the activity of any sociopath. ""Warning"" people that those who do bad things are ""sociopaths,"" invites people, who now see themselves as victimized members of a good class, to label nearly everyone around them as a semi-human sociopath or suspect semi-human sociopath. This pernicious effect of the book is not only terrifically obvious, but far outweighs any claim that the book, in its present form, is valuable as a ""warning"" or ""tool"" for people to protect themselves with. The book wantonly maximizes these anti-social and sensationalist effects and embraces them as a path to the best seller list and to big money. The complete absence of conscience from the author's decision-making is all too palpable. How ironic."

They are but 4% of the total population--1 in 25--and the principal comfort the rest of us can take is not only that we outnumber them but also that we are happier than they because their apparent freedom--which stems only from a lack of restraint--can end in nothing but boredom and bleakness, for they know nothing of community and love."

3,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,1,"Somehow or other this review lost it's original story. I don't know how, so I'm putting it in. Not so much because it is a review of the book (it isn't) but because I never want to forget it, I want to set it down. Living next door to a sociopath is terrible, one of the worst things you an imagine. I want to remember it properly and this was the story. The part of the review that remains is the end story that led up to the finale as it were, that I wrote at the time it was happening. So I've left it at the bottom.***I can't remember exactly what I wrote but essentially the neighbour had lived in the building when it was two apartments, the landlady had built two more upstairs and that pissed her off. She told the landlady the builder was stealing materials. The apartments are set in quite a lot of land and require a gardener, the neighbour wanted to arrange that and also the letting and collecting of rents as the landlady lives on another island. She wanted there to be a high turnover of tenants so she scratched cars, picked locks or otherwise got into apartments, disconnected the gas, drained the cisterns, complained about them etc. People left. She pretended to be my friend for a year or so because her best friend was a very long-time good friend of mine. When I had to leave my apartment (because the landlord wanted to rebuild it), she found me this place. She told terrible lies about her life, maybe I was meant to know she was lying, maybe not. Because of that she popped my car tyres - three times in a week once, which led the tyre lady who fixes them to do it for free, interfered with the radiator and scratched the car. She did a lot of stuff in my place and around it. She killed my cat.The mistakes she made were that the builder, who was my next door neighbour at the time, is a very decent person and he was building it up for free for the landlady because her husband had died and she needed security and the families were very close. So the builder couldn't steal what was his! The neighbour knew none of this.The second mistake she made was that I lived next door to the builder for fifteen years so they knew me. They knew I wasn't a troublemaker. The third mistake was that although the policeman who dealt with it, and who was a friend, couldn't devise a method to catch her. She disconnected the electricity when she bust into my house so the cameras didn't work. Although he couldn't do it, he did support me and on the day when he was away that her boyfriend threatened me and my son with the rock, and he phoned the police station to complain, he got an officer whose father and my grandmother were close friends. He said the right things... And that was the end of that. Then the update. Terrible story eh? Two and a half years of that. Oh and my close friend doesn't speak to me. She said that the (ex) neighbour wouldn't stand for her still being friends with me so... sorrry. There you go. Our kids grew up together.***Original review with a lot missing, hence the story aboveI'm on page 50 of The Sociopath Next Door. Its like my mind goes blank faced with any kind of self-help book. Perhaps, even with my appalling criminal neighbour I'm beyond redemption. I cannot finish this book. Hell, I can hardly start it. Its sitting in my kitchen window so if the psychopathic neighbour decides to break in again she will see it :-) I'm giving it another go.Missing bit***I wrote this when it was happening Update: My only way of annoying my neighbour (I'm neither a criminal nor a psychopath) was revving up my jeep outside her window for a minute or two and it drove her insane. :-) Eventually her boyfriend came out and threatened to throw a rock through the windscreen and when my son objected to his behaviour he picked up a bigger rock and told him he would fuck-him up if he went to the police. We had the police up within the hour. A stupid man he phoned the landlady to complain and she told him that since he didn't live there or pay rent there he had no right to complain. The landlady then phoned the neighbour who presumed I had complained, the boyfriend not having wanted to confess his ignominous dismissal by the landlady, and said it was all a lie, I had made it up. She also quite gratuiously told the landlady that the only reason she had taken my cat was that I put it in the back of her car and it woke up eight miles later and scratched hell out of the boyfriend so they threw it out of the car! (Anyone with a cat knows the cat would have scratched them to death by the bottom of the drive). The landlady said that it was the boyfriend, not me, who had phoned her and that she was a liar and gave her notice to leave.That was back in November. She's still there. Hides her car and pulls her blinds down in case a lawyer comes to serve her papers. The landlady says she has a lawyer but since she lives on a different island she hardly ever comes over to see what is going on. I don't care, the neighbour is so frightened she hides behind her pulled-down blinds and restricts her mischief to keying mine and another neighbour's vehicles. I could live with it.It took more than a year for the landlady and lawyers to get her out. Since then I've had nice neighbours. Original review was written 28 April 2009, but most of the story was missing, so I rewrote it 5 August 2013"
4,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/892816-matthew,2,"If given the opportunity to read a text about sociopathy and its prevalence, don't bother reading Stout's work. Instead, read ""Without Conscience"" by the psychologist Hare. Hare's work on sociopathy is notable in the field, and after reading it, you will be shocked to notice that entire sections of ""The Sociopath Next Door"" appear to be lifted from ""Without Conscience,"" slightly reworded, and placed into the text. ""The Sociopath Next Door"" is still an interesting book, but it is at best a 'see spot run' version of Hare's only slightly longer book."
5,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1066467-bob,5,"This book has sparked more re-evaluation by me than any other book I've read for quite some time. The good news is that 96% of people have a conscience. The bad news is that 4% don't, and they can be a real problem, especially because their destructiveness may go undetected for some time. The author postulates that conscience is based on the ability to have emotional attachment to other people. Sociopaths are incapable of such attachments. They see other people as objects which are to be dominated or manipulated. Sociopaths are capable of simulating positive emotions when it suits their manipulative purposes. The classic example is the abuser who tries to get the victim to pity and forgive the abuser: ""I am so tormented by tormenting you!"" -- NOT. In fact, a constant appeal to pity and sympathy is put forward as one of the most telling signs that one is dealing with a sociopath.This is all complicated by the fact that sociopaths are often quite charming (manipulation, remember?) Unlike people with attachment disorder who are incapable of charm. But a sociopath can be ruthless when it serves their interests and they think they can get away with it. So, a sociopath may be well-liked in public and hated by those in private life who are toyed with to satiate the sociopath's relentless crusade against being bored. The sociopath doesn't feel bad about the victims, unlike a narcissist who feels bad if other people don't like the narcissist as much as the narcissist does.Since starting to read the book, I've been looking at all of my friends and family (and myself) as if with new eyes. That some people who I know are sociopaths would go a long way to explain some of the behavior I'd otherwise be at a loss to explain. I might have considered the possibility sooner had I known that sociopathy occurs so frequently.The book contains much interesting info, including how to recognize and deal with a sociopath. The only part of the book that dragged for me was The Origins of Conscience, but luckily it only drones on for fifteen pages. The rest of the book I found to be very interesting.Okay, now that I'm on guard against sociopaths, the next book I need to read is how not to be paranoid!"
6,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,2,"There's a whole lot of fear mongering going on here. The Sociopath Next Door, I'd give it 2.5. I keep going back and forth between 2 and 3 stars. According to Martha Stout, just about everyone knows a few sociopaths.......DUH. I know two people for sure that I used to work with....they were chilling. I may even be related to one. But the author gets a little dramatic. Yes, these people are ruthless, they don't care about anyone's feelings (they really don't have many of their own). But if you keep your eye's open, hopefully you can spot them and avoid them. If you can't avoid them, then just don't get caught up in their games....because us folks with a conscience are just game pieces to them. But the author makes it sound as if we are all doomed and we must prepare ourselves for the Sociopath Apocalypse (a better title for this book).I found a site that lists a Sociopath tendencies.....symtoms of SociopathsRemind you of anyone? Sure does to me.....you betcha don't ya and also too.Sociopaths suck. They are the mean people. But their existence must suck for them. So good, thanks Karma.There were some good stories in this book and the descriptions of the sociopath were well done. As I was reading, I had a few moments of....""Oh, so that was the deal with THAT asshat!"""
7,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"***NO SPOILERS***Two aspects of this book are noticeably fitting from the start: its cover design and its title. The cover’s zoomed-in focus on three pairs of eyes has significance that's unclear until many pages in, a significance that no doubt will startle and intrigue. As for the title, it might sound somewhat melodramatic, but it underscores one of Stout’s most important points; if there’s one thing she wanted to make very clear it’s that sociopaths (sometimes called “psychopaths”; psychiatrists seem divided on whether these terms are one and the same), are veritable experts at hiding in plain sight; the majority are not crazed shadowy figures lurking in alleyways. They’re more charming and charismatic than the average person, and they take exorbitant pride in fooling everyone around them by lying, manipulating, feigning the empathy they naturally lack, and “playing the pity card.” People like reading about people. Stout knew this and smartly interspersed her narrative with captivating non-fictional anecdotes (and the occasional fictional anecdote) to illustrate her to-the-point explanations about this terrifying disorder. Such a set-up keeps interest high while making the subject very accessible to the lay reader; this is not a tedious psychiatric work that feels like homework to read. Stout’s book probably is ideal to read, in addition to (and preferably after), Dr. Robert Hare’s more academic Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us. Hare, being the foremost expert in the field of psychopathy, approaches the subject even more thoroughly, but Stout’s book is direct and gripping from page one. Readers searching for a quality book about sociopathy will be pleased with this choice. Final verdict: A must-read-now that will change the way readers view the world around them."
8,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61659069-bren,2,"“Sociopathy is the inability to process emotional experience, including love and caring, except when such experience can be calculated as a coldly intellectual task.” ― Martha Stout, The Sociopath Next DoorI Just could not get into this book or rather maybe I should say could not take this book as seriously as I expected I would.I also feel it is a bit dangerous. This book is giving readers information that may not be accurate in my view.The book is about..well..Sociopaths. And what makes one a Sociopath. But the qualifications listed and the judgments made are in my opinion, quite misleading.I am from a family of psychologists and if there’s one thing I know you don’t do, is to throw around labels easily. Reading this book was a little surreal to me. The qualifications listed as to what makes one a Sociopath could describe literally dozens of people I’ve met most of whom are not sociopaths. The characteristics are very general and ignore the fact that there are other personality disorders that are also lethal like borderline and narcissistic personality disorder.Not everybody who displays the characteristics described here are sociopaths and many people who do NOT display all these characteristics are in fact sociopaths. This book is so general. It is black and white thinking and I do not like the message it gives to readers.Writer uses some examples..some of the people she describes most likely ARE sociopaths, one in particular. I am not a psychologist myself so I really cannot say for sure. But that is not what gets me. It is the info she gives to readers that bothers me. For example..if a person lies so and so many times..chances are they are a sociopath. I just..could not believe that. There are plenty of reasons people lie and not all of them would be given such a dire prognosis. Also plenty of people DO NOT lie who may in fact be sociopaths. These blanket generalizations, in my view, are not healthy to throw around.At the end of the day I felt that the information was much to general(that's an understatement) and did not tell me anything I didn’t already know and much of what it told me I didn’t necessarily buy into. The topic of sociopathy and personality disorders in general is a very complicated and in-depth subject matter and requires a lot more than a short books such as this to really understand it. At the end of the day I was disappointed with this book."
9,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,4,"The author asks “Why have a conscience?” She argues that being truly human entails having one, and warns the majority of us about the four percent of people who are sociopaths. This is a chilling book. I have met people who fit her description. One need not be a serial killer to be a sociopath. One needs only to be immune to caring about the humanity of others. P 3 It chafes to be so free of the ridiculous inner voice that inhibits others from achieving great power, without having enough talent to pursue the ultimate successes yourself. Sometimes you fall into sulky, rageful moods caused by frustration that no one but you understands.But you do jobs that afford you a certain undersupervised control over a few individuals or small groups, preferably people and groups who are relatively helpless or in some way vulnerable. You are a teacher or a psychotherapist, a divorce lawyer or a high school coach. Or maybe you are a consultant of some kind, a broker or a gallery owner or a human services director…Whatever your job, you manipulate and bully the people who are under your thumb, as often and as outrageously as you can without getting fired or held accountable. You do this for its own sake, even when it serves no purpose except to give you a thrill. Making people jump means you have power—or this is the way you see it—and bullying provides you with an adrenaline rush. It is fun…Maybe you cannot be a CEO of a multinational corporation, but you can frighten a few people, or cause them to scurry around like chickens, or steal from them, or—maybe best of all—create situations that cause them to feel bad about themselves. And this is power, especially when the people you manipulate are superior to you in some way. Most invigorating of all is to bring down people who are smarter or more accomplished than you, or perhaps classier, more attractive or popular or morally admirable. This is not only good fun; it is existential vengeance. And without a conscience it is amazingly easy to do. "
10,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16842102-mizuki,4,"Note: I read the Chinese translation of the book.4% in the human population are sociopaths, meaning: they have (1) anti-social personality or (2) they don't have this thing that we call conscience.So what should we do with this knowledge? Here are a few hints:(1) Sociopaths do not feel remorse on behalf of other people, nor can they be affected or restricted by conscience and/or sense of guilt.(2) Sociopaths cannot feel real emotion and connection with other people--yes they may manage to have lovers or spouses or even children, but these spouses and children are more like possessions to them than real human beings.(3) Sociopaths need lot and lot of excitement and sense of victory to fill the emptiness in their lives---that's the reason why winning and controlling other people (e.g. family members, coworkers, relatives etc) seem to be so important to them.(4) Sociopaths cannot be cured, there is no known cure for anti-social personality. Plus most of these sociopaths do not admit they have any problem.(5) NOT every sociopath would become serial killers or criminals, in fact many of them are ordinary people who have never broken any law, some of them even manage to become successful businessmen or politicians.(6) Even though many if not most sociopaths have never physically killed or maimed anyone, but they can do just as much damage if not more. (7) It is not correct to believe everyone has a conscience, some people (the author claims there make up 4% of the population) simply don't have one, and these people think and function in a way which is fundamentally different from us.(8) In the mind of the sociopaths, everyone who obeys morality, laws and orders are fools. Plus in their mind, everyone expects themselves are only game pieces on the board for them to manipulate and move around.(9) Last but not least, people who were born with the basic sense of conscience, also aren't above doing crime and hurting other people. Because it isn't uncommon for conscience to be misdirect or blurred away. For example, people can think like this: killing people is immoral, but since People of Colors/sex workers/homeless people etc are not people, so killing them is not immoral.Well, some reviewers dislike the author Martha Stout for singling out and labeling people as 'sociopaths'. However, as a layman, I have to ask: 'why fool ourselves with the fantasy that everyone has a heart when it is obvious that some people just don't? Why shouldn't we be taught to recognize the typical traits of predators and psychic vampires before they can hook their claws on us?'I will be honest, the first 70 pages of the book do not tell me anything I didn't know, but the rest of the book is a lot more enjoyable.PS: talking about sociopath, do all the typical traits mentioned above remind you of a certain someone named Trump?"
11,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16752141-abel,4,"A weird byproduct of listening to this book (a Daily Deal, well worth it) was a conscious undercurrent of pitting myself against the composite sociopaths depicted. I kept thinking, I hope it's not me. Or, It can't be me. Then that led to, Only a sociopath would see himself in a book about sociopaths. So ultimately I decided that I'm a narcissist with sociopathic tendencies. See? This is exactly why I don't read side-effects of medications, or delve too deep into Zen Buddhism--koans? Get the hell outta here, those break my fragile mind, cause cosmic vertigo--or follow any campaign trails. Some things, while enlightening, taint a neurotic. So what'd I do about rekiltering my autodiagnosis? I bought a book about narcissism. And of course I'll find myself in there. (Review soon!) I will have to cleanse the palate with something after all this mental disorder, maybe Seuss."
12,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/187043-laura,2,"You know that neighbor of yours who ignores you when you say hello to him in the hall? Well, he might not be just a garden-variety jerk -- he may be  A SOCIOPATH!! In fact, four percent of the United States' population is composed of sociopaths. You know what this means, don't you? TROUBLE!!That might as well be the flap copy of Martha Stout's book, which doesn't seek to enlighten so much as to inflame. Stout throws out a lot of scary-sounding statistics cobbled together with some vaguely philosophical maundering about the nature of conscience, presents a bunch of unpleasant characters purportedly drawn from real life, and informs us that sociopaths are freely interspersed among us, trying as hard as they can to ruin our lives. All is not lost, though, as Stout also gives us a list of 13 rules we can use to thwart the sociopathic horde -- some of which, such as ""The best way to protect yourself from a sociopath is to avoid him, to refuse any kind of contact or communication,"" might be of limited use if the person you're dealing with is, say, your boss (a likely scenario, if you take Stout's thesis seriously). She then ends the list with ""Living well is the best revenge."" Uh, what?To make matters worse, a glance at the end notes reveals that Stout bases her conclusions on statistics gathered from old studies -- the book was published in 2005 and a lot of the source materials are dated 1997 and earlier -- which makes you wonder about the basis of her conclusions. Stout doesn't help her argument by using composite characters, at least one of whom (the aforementioned nasty neighbor) appears to be completely fictional. Another supposed case study, while perhaps based on a real person, is obviously mostly fictional, as Stout purports to tell us what exactly what the person was thinking when she did so and so a terrible thing to such and such an innocent victim. The reader is left wondering why, if this problem is so widespread, Stout couldn't have presented her audience with some real people.The most interesting and enlightening parts of the book are Stout's recounting of other studies -- for example, the famous Milgram experiment. Stout also presents an interesting discussion of the difference between sociopathy and narcissism. But these brief glimmers of interest provide nowhere near enough basis to slog through this whole book. "
13,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"This is a good, though somewhat light (being intended for the pop-psych crowd) description of just what a sociopath is, what makes them tick, how to recognize them, and how to avoid them. It's not full of gruesome crimes or case studies, because Stout's key message is that sociopaths, for the most part, are not psychotic serial killers. They are seemingly ordinary people who can live ordinary lives fooling most everyone around them. And if you do realize that someone is a sociopath, there isn't much you can do about it if they aren't actually doing anything criminal. Sociopaths all play dominance games and view other people -- even their own families -- as objects to be manipulated and used, so the only thing you can do is disengage, even if the sociopath is your own parent or child. The scariest and most heartbreaking thing about them is that they are completely incurable.Stout's lengthy explanation of conscience is sometimes interesting, though full of a lot of speculation, blending as she does viewpoints from every field from religion and mysticism to evolutionary psychology. She tries to address questions like ""What causes sociopaths?"" and ""What evolutionary advantage could there be in having no conscience?"" (and conversely, ""What evolutionary advantage is there in having a conscience?""), but like anything treading the murky waters of evpsych, it's mostly speculation. The fact is that (according to Stout) 1 in 25 Americans is a sociopath, and this crosses all economic and social strata. Contrary to what you might assume, sociopaths don't seem to be produced by abusive or traumatic childhoods. She tries hard to argue that sociopathy is a combination of innate and environmental factors, and clearly there is no gene for sociopathy, but it does seem to be the case that sociopaths are pretty much born, not made. If there is any way to detect early warning signs that a young child might have sociopathic tendencies and correct it before it's too late, psychology does not yet seem to have figured it out.Stout claims (without a lot of evidence, I thought) that sociopathy is more common in Western society. Obviously sociopaths have always existed in every society, but she argues that Western society encourages sociopathic behavior by giving rewards to ""winners"" even if they win through ruthless and unscrupulous means. I find this questionable; not that sociopaths can rise high in the political or business world (obviously they can) but that any other society is better at filtering out people without a conscience. There's plenty of ruthlessness and corruption in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and even small tribal societies, so I really doubt sociopaths thrive less there than here in the U.S.Stout ends the book with an attempt at a reassuring message that sociopaths really don't win in the end; that they mostly live hollow lives of perpetual unfulfillment and can never even appreciate what they are missing. This may be true, but I suspect a lot of sociopaths feel pretty darn self-fulfilled when they get what they want. Nice guys may not always finish last, but if you're competing with a sociopath, it's going to be an ugly race, and the evidence around us suggests we are competing with a lot of them."
14,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27279812-dino-jess-the-book-eating-dinosaur,3,"Let's get this out of the way - I find the idea of sociopathy (some call it psychopathy, others call it anti-social personality disorder) infinitely fascinating. The fact that some people can go about their lives with the inability to love, the inability to form emotional attachments and a pure and total lack of empathy for their fellow man is as interesting as it is terrifying. In practice, sociopathy is a scary thing. I have a feeling I have crossed paths with more than one sociopathic person in my life, and you probably have too. This book helped shed some light on exactly why I might have felt that a certain person was a little off when I first met them, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting. This book does give hints and tips about pin pointing the sociopaths in your life, but it is weighed down so heavily in overly wordy, scientific language that at times I thought I was back in high school falling asleep while trying to read my psychology text book. If you're into a lot of references, heavily researched hypotheses and the occasional case study, then this book is for you. I much preferred the case study chapters and they were the only thing that kept me going throughout this book. As it is, this took me a month to read. This shit is dense.However, having said that, this book is filled with truth bombs. The reflections of society as a whole, flashbacks to studies about human nature and hypotheses about the evolution of conscience as our seventh sense are equal parts enlightening and horrifying. This was a mixed bag, the case studies were incredible but I wish there were more of them. Overall, I feel like I learnt a lot and will hopefully be able to more effectively identify sociopaths in the wild, now. I will probably read more from this lady, she certainly knows what she's talking about. Or does she? Perhaps she's a sociopath herself and we'll never know, unless we use her tricks against her! Now I'm just being paranoid. Or am I? o.O3 StarsI originally picked up this book because this amazing podcast mentioned it in passing. If you like true crime, you should be listening to them. And if you are already, let me know! I'd love to know if you're a fellow murderino. "
15,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3705476-shell,5,"Let me begin by saying, I'm not a psychologist and honestly, I know very little about it. I took two psychology classes in college years ago and that's about the extent of my knowledge. I did, however, love this book. It was comprised mostly of case studies and Dr. Stout's 25 years of experiences dealing with clients who have been affected and harmed by sociopaths in their lives. It discusses how manipulative, deceitful, charming, personable and fake a sociopath can be and the lengths one would be willing to go to get what they want. Whether it be the power of getting others to respond and do as they wish, dominating another, controlling another or getting good people to doubt themselves. Whatever the case may be, a sociopath does it with a plan in mind. He or she knows what they want and what will give them a moment of feeling power over another. I've always believed that there is a little good in everyone. At some point in everyone's life they did at least one good deed. Maybe they smiled and said hello to an old woman who was feeling particularly lonely one day, or made a child laugh, or comforted a dying parent. I still believe that, despite the knowledge that it may not be true, because some actions are not about how it made the person doing it feel, but how it made the other person who received the action feel. Even a sociopath could unknowingly make someone's day. This book discussed how 1 in 25 people is a sociopath. 1 in 25! That's a number far greater than I would have assumed had I been asked how many sociopaths I thought there were in the world before reading this book. Sociopaths are individuals without a conscious, ones with the ingrained inability to do what many of us do naturally, to love. Dr. Stout also gives examples and ways in which those with a conscious can recognize the sociopaths they come into contact with and protect themselves against them. After reading this, I've discovered two things. One, I'm lucky and very grateful to have a conscious, to be able to love, to enjoy just listening to my child laugh or hearing my husband snore (What? It's cute!), or being able to derive pleasure from a simple conversation with a good friend. The second thing I learned is that regardless how much it is said that you should not pity a sociopath, because pity is one of the major tools used against those with a conscious, I still do. To live a life without ever really caring? Without ever really being able to love? What would be the point?"
16,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/230747-julie,4,"Wow--4% of those around us are...sociopaths! Don't read this book if you have a tendency to be paranoid. I'm now looking around me now wondering, ""Is SHE a sociopath? Is HE?""A sociopath is someone without conscience (in short, they cannot love or attach value to other living things). One WITH conscience cannot fathom what this might even be like, and ""sociopath"" seems like such an extreme label, so the non-sociopaths rarely identify sociopaths as sociopaths (""we"" make excuses for their questionable behavior, because how on earth could someone actually be doing what this looks like they're doing?). That makes them dangerous. A couple quick giveaways (in addition to your intuition that ""something's wrong with this person"") is: they are charming as hell, and, weirdly enough, they want your pity.Rule of thumb: dump a person if they lie, break promises, or lame out on a responsibility 3 times. Do not play their game (you won't win), and cut them out of your life. See? I'm paranoid!"
17,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35928172-kristina,4,"This book provided an excellent psychological perspective on conscience. I am used to approaching conscience from a religious angle as I (love to) teach Catholic morality to eighth-graders. This analysis of sociopathy was fascinating and informative and gave much insight into the different types of sociopaths, the vital nature of conscience and empathy, and the knowledge gained from years of morality research. A worthwhile investment of time, I think everyone could benefit from this glimpse into the darker side of psychology. "
18,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/239943-derek,1,"In a reprehensible mix of lowest common denominator psychology, fear-mongering, and insultingly juvenile ""real life"" examples, Martha Stout explores the claim that one in every 25 people is a sociopath in The Sociopath Next Door. If the conceit of the book isn't enough to send you packing, be prepared to sit through poorly supported claims, Intro to Psychology theorizing, and unbelievable religious moralizing toward the people who Stout describes simply, and without much extroplation, as those completely devoid of a conscience.The book's problems are many. The most apparent to anyone who can read a narrative that isn't scrawled in crayon is that her real life examples of sociopaths, knowingly composited from different people, read not like people but rather cardboard cutouts over which she has draped symptoms of sociopathy. As for those people in the narratives who are not sociopaths but rather the unfortunate souls who interact with them, she's provided similarly cursory and stereotyped portrayals--the pretty young doctor, the successful businessman in his Audi, the trusting daughter. These 4-6 word descriptions are about as deep as she goes. I guess I should be pleased that she takes the time to come up with names for them. That must have been exhausting.Outside of the poor narratives, which a generous reader might be willing to overlook given her background, the other unavoidable criticism of this book is the dangerous amateur psychology that it so freely encourages. You know a sociopath! Make a list and figure out who it is! Who cares if you have absolutely no education or experience to justify making such a serious accusation! You're now an empowered reader! It's this democratization of knowledge and expertise that's so pernicious, and elevates the book from being mere fluff that people who know better can just ignore.Given that psychology already has enough of an uphill battle in portraying itself as a hard science (which I am in no way suggesting it is not), Stout gladly puts it back about ten years by concluding her book with an ill-advised marriage of psychology and religion, finding moralistic justification for the things she attempts to prove scientifically throughout the rest of the text. It's unclear why this might be included, but when she describes sociopaths who have no choice in being absent a conscience, but also describes them, essentially, as sinful, her message becomes so diluted and ill-conceived as to be worthless.This of course says nothing of the fact that her description of sociopathy is so insultingly simplified to just be ""the lack of a conscience,"" ignoring the complex biological, neurological, and psychological interwokrings at play in someone who might be considered a sociopath."
19,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5032263-jacqueline,5,"A familiar stranger came into my life last year... he pulled one after another of the power games Stout details in her book... at first I could not even open this book, recommended to me by my physician, because it was eerily and creepily too real for me. Once I did though, I couldn't put it down. Martha Stout describes this kind of person (and the individual I knew) so thoroughly that it is altogether frightening. I did not believe such people exist... now I know first hand that they do. Reviewers who pan this book have clearly never been taken in by a sociopath (or they haven't realized it), or they would realize how chillingly cunning and methodical the remorseless are in their games. Ultimately the book is hopeful, giving us two things: the tools to recognize the sociopaths among us (beware crocodile tears that seem to be turned on and off at will, and the overplaying of the ""pity"" card), and the comfort that the numbers and actions of those who do have a conscience by far outweigh the numbers of the conscienceless."

I'd like to read like a billion page DSM where every single disorder had a nice book like this under its heading. First on my wishlist would be borderline personality disorder. Then Aspberger's.In fact this book, writing-quality-wise, is sort of on the level of a stretched-out Newsweek article, maybe. Yeah, a cross between a stretched out Newsweek article and a stretched-out DSM article. It's a really easy read and isn't necessarily bursting with new insights on every page. But it's so fun! It made me want, overall, to be reading easier books. I read this book on successive trips to a Barnes and Noble, which I found to be very enjoyable."

22,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1505629-grace,4,"The Sociopath Next Doorby Martha StoutA few months ago I was given the opportunity to read “The Sociopath Next Door” and before doing so I chose to look it up on Goodreads, to see what my fellow readers thought of it. The reviews were not encouraging. I looked elsewhere for something to read. Then, a few days ago a family member bought the audio book version (from iTunes), and I had nothing else to listen to while gardening. I’m deeply glad that fate intervened. I can completely understand why people who saw the cover, and read the blurb on this book would be dissatisfied with it. I’m sad to say that it seems clear that the publisher and author of this book did not communicate well. This is not a book about sociopaths, so much as a book about conscience, and why selfishness is so utterly destructive. It is a celebration of human nature, and the fact that we feel and love. It is a warning against the small percent of people who do not, and would pray on you if they could. I would not call “The Sociopath Next Door” unscientific, but it is certainly more abstract than most books on similar topics. The ideas explored, while well researched, are not easy to put labels to. This book moved me, unexpectedly and completely. There is such a great love of people as a whole in Mrs. Stout’s writing, and such a depth of compassion without ever crossing out of the realm of scientific inquiry. “The Sociopath Next Door” is a book you should read if you wish to learn more about sociopathy, to understand the human conscience, to learn how to recognize and protect yourself from the influence of a sociopath, or if you simply wish to have a new appreciation for the goodness in humanity and the beauty that is our ability to love each other.

23,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47747655-lara,4,"I read this quite awhile ago maybe 15 years ago.. I read it at a time where I was trying to understand a man who had been living in my basement.. someone whom I told my friends might be the one to throw my body in a lake or bury me in my own backyard. Charming, incredibly farm boyishly handsome, clean good looks, mussels to die for, smoooith skin, gap toothed grin, made me laugh till I fell over on the street while we were walking, smooth talker, Come to find out he had about 2 or 3 too many girlfriends...hidden here or there. Two of them pregnant u found out not long after he asked me to marry him...I had to ask him how many other women he had proposed to that week. Dang and he would not leave. Had to shoehorn him out and then chase him down on his way out of town to retrieve some of my stuff. Impossible to track the dude down, no past, said he came from the Boundary waters...My big little sociopath! No more mine praise someone! "
24,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,4,"For many years we’ve been friends with this guy whom I’ll call Steve. Steve is an upstanding member of the community, has a picture-perfect All-American family, a respectable job, and a wide circle of friends. He comes across as charming and very friendly, and seems to be very eager to help and please those around him. However, after getting to know him just a little bit better all these aspects of Steve’s life appear to be an act. Steve is in fact extremely competitive even over the dumbest things, scheming, and manipulative. The more I got to know him, the less I wanted to know about him. His constant scheming was eventually too much to handle, and we were forced to cut all personal ties with him. All along I was wondering what is it that made Steve act in the way that he did. A few years ago I came across an article on Wikipedia on psychopathy, and that’s when things finally started making sense. It turns out that psychopaths/sociopaths are actually very common in the society at large. Most of them are not Hannibal Lectors of Hollywood’s imagination. They are not serial killers, nor are the majority of them necessarily physically violent. All of them, however, have one main thing in common: they wreak havoc on almost all lives that they touch. Most disturbingly, there are surprisingly many of them around: one to four percent in the US, depending on how rigorous your classification criteria are. “The Sociopath Next Door” is in many ways the best book on sociopaths/psychopaths that I’ve read. What distinguishes it from many other similar books is its very practical and applied approach. Furthermore, Martha Stout is an excellent writer in her own right and this is an eminently readable, even literary, book. Book’s a pleasure to read, and were the subject matter not this serious and frightening, this would make a great pleasure read.There are three main things that I loved about the book.1.	Stout reduces psychopathy/sociopathy to just one most salient feature: lack of conscience. She argues, quite persuasively, that all other features of sociopaths are secondary. This insight alone can explain why sociopaths come in so many different guises. 2.	Stout provides a very easy and counterintuitive way of identifying sociopaths. One thing that really gives them away is the “pity play”: all of them to various extents tap into their victims’ compassion in order to manipulate them.3.	Stout provides an excellent and very effective thirteen-point list of ways in which we can deal with sociopaths. Unfortunately there is no way of “curing” these people, so the best we can hope is to try to reduce their effects on others. I have been practicing pretty much all of the recommendations on my own to begin with, and I can assure you that they are very, very effective.So if this is such a wonderful and useful book, why did I give it only four stars? Because I fear that Stout had overreached. If this had been only a book about individual sociopaths, who they are, and how to deal with them this would have been a wonderful and self-contained book. However, it seems that one of the main motivations behind writing this book had been to denounce wars, and the wars waged by the United States in particular. I have no doubt that many politicians and World leaders are in fact sociopaths, including some US presidents. Nonetheless, reducing all of warfare and a pretty big chunk of international relations to psychological defects of a few individuals, without providing a single concrete shred of evidence for such a claim, is at best intellectually questionable. I am afraid that this other underlying theme has a potential to seriously undermine Stout’s main points and insights about sociopaths. Fortunately, this part of the book can be to a large extent ignored. "
25,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18974711-darth-j,5,"I found this book to be fascinating. I originally picked this book up as part of my research for a novel, but I didn't expect to be so entertained by it. It's a sad truth that statistically one in 25 people you will meet in life is a sociopath (per the book), and I have found that to be somewhat accurate as I've met two truly conscienceless people in my life. While I wouldn't say this is the only book on the subject, it definitely made for an engaging read."
26,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-again,4,"4.4 starsI have a sister who is a sociopath and a malignant narcissist, so I studied this book carefully and took lots of notes. But really, it turns out that if you encounter a sociopath, the best thing to do is completely eliminate them from your life, if possible. They have no conscience and are irredeemable. If you continue to associate with them, they will never stop using and victimizing you. They need it like we need air. Hurting others and getting away with it is their only true pleasure in life. It makes them feel smarter and more clever and superior to everyone around them.The tricky thing about sociopaths is that their victims are the only ones who know how evil they are. They are very skilled at appearing to be normal and can be quite charming. And they are master-level gaslighters, so they can convince people that they aren't really seeing what is right in front of them."
27,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36632347-lisa,5,"Absolutely fascinating!!! Everyone should read this book!!! We all have sociopaths in our lives. . . But we may not know it. This book helps us better recognize him or her. 4 % of our population are sociopaths. . . The science and stories (composites of Dr Stouts past patients) are so interesting. Seriously, I could not put this book down!!On a personal note, a lot of us have been very hurt by sociopaths. Dr Stout validates mixed feelings we may have towards them, especially if it’s someone we love/ed. Our mixed feelings are 100% normal, as 96% of the population are empathic and compassionate. But those 4% who roam our country with NO conscience whatsoever (it’s lower in some non western cultures and Dr Stout explains why), wreak havoc on the rest us. A great read , highly recommend!!! "

I thought then, as I think now, that it could very well be true. Give me a good schizophrenic any day over a sociopath or a psychopath, please. They have much better dreams, too.Seriously though, it does come to my mind that if there are that many people without the spark that gives them empathy, it does explain the bankers."

A pity, but as both books state the reasons behind psychopathy are mostly unknown so maybe one shouldn't expect too much. The culture-point was intriguing but it wasn't explored enough, the exploration of the importance of our conscience was rather interesting as well. I'd recommend to read it in combination with Hare's book (read this one after Hare's). They are similar, or rather this one copied some parts, but this one explores the reasons a tick better than Hare's. It is also less obsessive. "

REALLY?), it's not particuarly ""Alarmist"", per se, but it does encourage readers (some of whom would presumably be lay-people like me) to judge their immediate circles, and ascribe qualities or issues to these people that are not necessarily there. ""You will realize that your ex was not just misunderstood""; that's an impressive sounding statement, and a spectacular justification for a break-up, but there's a fine line to be drawn when it comes to impromptu ""diagnosing"" of your social circles. (Oftentimes even experienced clinicians have trouble diagnoising people's pschyological issues, and they have a MANUAL (theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) to provide them guidance.)All that said, I'll leave at it that, as many reviewers below have posted far more eloquent (and critical) reviews than I ever could"
33,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1062342-polly-trout,4,"I definitely recommend this book, but it also left me with more questions than answers, and there were some elements of her argument that frustrated or troubled me. A sociopath (also called a psychopath, or somebody diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder) is a person without conscience, someone who cannot feel love, remorse, or shame. Roughly 4% of Americans can be diagnosed as sociopaths. Stout is a respected researcher and clinical practitioner, and although this is a brief, popular introduction, it intelligent and research-based. According to the DSM-IV, sociopaths are have at least three of the following characteristics: failure to conform to social norms, deceitfulness, manipulativeness, impulsivity, failure to plan ahead, irritability, aggressiveness, reckless disregard for safety of self and others, consistent irresponsibility, and lack of remorse after having hurt or mistreated another person. Stout departs from the DSM-IV and argues that the fundamental character traits of the sociopath are the inability to feel love, lack of conscience, boredom, manipulation of sympathy for personal gain (""the pity play""), and treating others like objects rather than human beings. Stout argues that sociopathy is genetically inherited, untreatable, unredeemable, and that the the only defense against sociopaths is to avoid them like the plague. She also argues (effectively, I think) that only some sociopaths are violent and predatory; others are passive and parasitical. I have met sociopaths who fit Stout's description, and agree that avoiding them is almost always the best plan. But still, the book leaves me with a lot of unanswered and troubling questions. The research Stout quotes suggests that while sociopathy is partly genetically inherited, culture and environment also play an important role. I've also read research studies elsewhere that while the majority of sociopaths are untreatable, a solid minority, perhaps 25%, do improve in longitudinal studies. Stout draws a very black and white line between sociopaths and ""the rest of us,"" and unapologetically demonizes and dehumanizes sociopaths -- yet she also discusses the fact that when ordinary people hurt others, the two most common reasons for the cruel behavior is following the lead of a trusted authority, and dehumanizing the out-group that is under attack. So there's a weird paradox in dehumanizing the sociopath -- they are dangerous, but still human, so when we treat them as devils rather than human beings, we are feeding into the moral failure that we condemn.So yes, most of the time the best strategy when you meet a sociopath is to run like hell -- but we can't always do that, because they don't disappear, they just move on and prey on the next person down the road. Only 20% of the people in prison are sociopaths, the rest are decent people who made bad choices or who are just being screwed over by the system. Most sociopaths are smart enough to stay within the law and many rise to positions of power -- many CEO's can be diagnosed as sociopathic. So I'm wondering, how can we encourage people who are born with a genetic predisposition toward sociopathy to develop social and emotional skills that rein in their destructive tendencies? And, how do we limit the social power of sociopaths so that they do not end up in positions of authority, poisoning the ordinary people who are under their sway?I suspect that rather than being an either/or situation, sociopathy is a spectrum disorder and there is a wide array of ability levels along the compassion vs. ice cold malevolence spectrum. It is difficult or even impossible to make good psychiatric diagnoses bases on symptoms, and I suspect that some of the people who are diagnosed as sociopathic do have rudimentary abilities for forming emotional attachments, but are deeply damaged and developmentally delayed in the limbic system. For these people, ironically, the only hope they have of getting better is to experience a single loving relationship, which they can then use as a model for emotional growth. But they are also very dangerous, and exhausting, and it is easy to put a lot of time and energy into someone in this category and feel like it has been totally wasted, because any growth that happens is extremely slow and only emerges over years or decades. If you do find yourself dealing with someone with zero conscience/ability to love, or extremely damaged and remedial abilities. it is extremely important to NOT LET THEM MANIPULATE YOU OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU. Partly for self protection, and because your resources will make more of a difference in the world if you give them to decent people who are struggling towards love and compassion. But mostly, because when you allow someone to hurt you and use you, you are feeding their sickness and making them worse. It's like giving crack to an addict, or a gun to a child throwing a tantrum. You will get hurt, you are also making the sociopath more sick and dangerous by feeding the downward spiral, and therefore creating more danger for all the other people down the line that the sociopath will be manipulating after you. On the other hand, dehumanizing and demonizing the sociopath ALSO aggravates the condition, by feeding into his amoral worldview and strengthening the cognitive feedback loop that he uses to justify his bad behavior. So the only solution is to offer unconditional spiritual love integrated with the moral courage to oppose the manipulative and cruel behavior -- and that's hard fucking work, let me tell you. That's why just staying out of the way is usually the best plan."
34,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,This audible book raise a lot of issues for me and made me think. And yet I didn't feel like it was an awfully good book because it never really helped me understand what a sociopath is and how a person becomes one. The psychologist who wrote the book seems somehow in her career to have run across quite a few. And she gave a number of examples of people with this disability as she indicated that 4% of people in the world are sociopathic.The book starts out with a story of a man who heads off to work with a busy day ahead and an overnight trip out of town on business. But he forgets to provide for his beloved dog in his absence. This is made into a great moral dilemma which he resolves by ignoring a work related responsibility to go back home and tend to the dog. This event was alluded to several more times in the book. But I didn't get it. Part of the scenario was that the man had a furnace repair man at his house and it seem like he simply could have called the repair company and had the furnace repair man do what needed to be done for the dog which was to put out food and water. This simple solution was never mentioned and it bothered me!I have wanted to read this book for a long time and it has been on my TBR list forever. So when I saw the Audible book for sale at a reduced price I snapped it up. But I was ultimately disappointed that because I just never could figure out why people get this way. It seems that they are just born this way. And there is no cure.I am especially interested in what makes some people have an extremely heightened level of conscience. I think about conscientious objectors to war quite a lot. I think about people who intentionally break the law to stand up for a greater good. I think about people Who intentionally stop across the line and are arrested in protest demonstrations. I think about war tax resistors who conscientiously refused to pay all or a portion of their federal income taxes so they will not pay for war and killing.Are people who do bad things on a massive scale all sociopaths? Can we identify a Sociopath by his or her actions? This book did not answer that question for me though it did imply that the answer is yes. The implication is that this disability is genetic but too difficult to be easily traced. The book suggests that it is not a good thing to be without a conscience. It surprises me that it devotes so much time to apparently asking that question when it is so I obvious. I wanted a little more science and a little less individual stories. But maybe it is hard to do science in the Audible format.
35,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5972274-maxine,4,"""The Sociopath Next Door"" delivers both good and bad news. The good news is, not all sociopaths are violent murderers or serial killers. The bad news is, you probably know a sociopath. Maybe even more than one.By some estimates, as many as 1 in 25 people have this mental aberration, making them impervious to the pain or the feelings of others. Sociopaths have no ability to feel pity, empathy, guilt, or love. Sociopaths are completely devoid of conscience.How to spot them? Well now, that's the tricky part. You see, sociopaths are often very charming, almost charismatic. That's because it's in their best interest to appear charming--not because they actually care. When it's necessary, they're great flatterers. Though they do not ever feel pity for anyone else (they're incapable, remember?), they rely on pity from others, and use it as a means of controlling and manipulating them. Sociopaths know that others do have consciences, and feel guilt. That's precisely how they get away with outrageous behavior. They know that others will excuse it, thinking, ""He couldn't possibly have done that purposely."", because they themselves wouldn't. It's chilling to think that people like this actually exist. More disturbing that, upon reflection, most of us realize that we know or have known at least one. That they can so easily insinuate themselves into our lives is frightening, because, truth is, they're almost impossible to spot, and equally hard to escape. As a cautionary tale, The Sociopath Next Door should be required reading. However, once you've read it, you'll never feel quite as secure again."

And they are masters at being charming, helpful, generous and sensitive while they are figuring out where you are vulnerable. Then... POW!

The 13 rules for for dealing with a sociopath in your life was the best part (pp. 156-162), but I also appreciated Stout's description of the different ways in which sociopathy can manifest. "
38,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26216302-valyssia-leigh,1,"First of all, let me state that I in no way dispute the overall premise of this book. I have no problem believing that the occurrence of sociopathy is extraordinarily high, especially in Western culture. Nor do I find the idea that not all sociopaths are blood thirsty murders surprising, or even novel. I'm perfectly comfortable with the concept that classifications have subclassifications and even sub-subclassifications. The world at large isn't particularly good at presenting us with just one thing and the other. Nature loves variation. Noted. Not a problem.Not the problem.The Sociopath Next Door is so tailored to the ‘average’ American that it’s close to useless and full of generalizations, some of which I found insulting. Here’s one of the more harmless examples: ""All five year olds can tell whether a person is a male or a female."" Martha Stout makes that statement, or one very much like it right near the beginning of the book. As a woman who has lived most of her life with little figure and no care for cosmetics, I’ve overheard more than one curious child ask their parent whether I was a boy or a girl. I’ve almost always smiled in response. It was pointless to correct, or say much more than, “It’s okay,” when that seemed appropriate. Putting people on the spot for no good reason is rude. So are most blanket statements. Martha Stout spoke of criminality and poverty throughout this book in those terms. To her mind anyone who is jailed automatically has a criminal mind and socially irresponsible tendencies. She appears insensate to the idea that in and amongst the US’s ludicrously inflated incarcerated population there might be one or two good people who just had a devastating turn of bad luck, or uh, something...because heaven knows there aren't any bad laws on the books, the police are entirely blind to all of those wonderful differences that make us unique individuals, and the judicial system's integrity is unimpeachable. Every person living below the poverty level in the US isn’t a dishonest, pilfering, worthless sack of bones with no ambition. Saying so, or even just insinuating that, shows a certain contempt that I find unpleasant. I could go into the minimum wage, the availability of jobs, discrimination in the workplace, the immensely top-heavy division of wealth in this country...and explain exactly why this is so, but I don't think that’s necessary. The disparagement is so vast the issues should be apparent to anyone who isn’t living in a bubble of stupefying privilege. Furthermore, not only is this book mildly insulting to anyone intelligent enough to think outside the box, it also condemns people for doing just that. ‘Failure to conform to social norms’ is one of the author’s ‘signs of sociopathy.’ So basically, if you choose not to follow the herd, you might just be a psychopath. And if you eat red meat, you might just be a cannibal. * has a Fried Green Tomatoes flashback * Good to know. Thanks. My only purpose in buying this book was as a resource for developing fictional characters. I knew it wasn’t going to be terribly technical. If I’d wanted that, I would’ve bought a text book on abnormal psychology and muddled through it. What I hoped was that it might be useful in at least defining terms, providing labels, and giving the material structure, much like the ‘For Dummies’ series attempts to do. Those books are mostly great for teaching the reader the basics and the buzz words so they can discuss the subject with some intelligence and go on to read more advanced works if a greater understanding is desired. This book accomplished nothing like that. Instead what I found was a series of sometimes specious arguments on the subject so watered-down to suit the palate of its target audience that using the author's guidelines to judge I might be suspected of sociopathy. Anyone who fails to toe the expected, idealized lines of ‘college followed by an entirely monogamous marriage resulting in two-point-five kids and a house in the suburbs all framed in by a faith in (the right) God’ might be.Oh well. I should’ve known from the alarmist title that this wasn’t the book for me, but I gave it a chance. "
39,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108848-tracy,5,"I read this book last month to help me be able to identify people who will try to hurt me.That sounds paranoid!I deal with the near-public on an almost continuous public, however, and that ""public"" quickly becomes the group of folks I deal with every day of the week. I have to work with them closely, I have to try to teach them, and I end up living with them in my head for those seven days of the week. It's not the best thing for me to do, but it is what happens. They pop up in my mind. At the end of all this, they get to decide if I gave them a product that was worth their money: Am I a good professor? Would they buy the product again? Unfortunately, some of these people are callous. They don't care whether how they treat others in my class or me is beautiful, ugly, hurtful, responsible...in short, they don't care about anyone else.I do not believe they are all sociopaths, but they verge on it - they head towards this lack of civility as so many of us do in this city that is losing its civility.This book seriously helped me. It helped me watch out for the signs of true sociopathic behavior. It helped me be able to not worry about whether I care about these people. It helped me come up with a plan for how to deal with one of them if I end up having to work with one.It helped, also, sort through the various kinds of sociopaths. They are not all murdering, drooling, Dr. Hydes. Instead, they charm, are witty, and they do everything they can to make you do exactly what they want. Since the simply do not care what you actually feel about them, so long as you do what they want, they act without regard for how you might feel. They count on your doing the ""right"" thing, the ""caring"" thing. If you do the thing that protects yourself, they don't care about that, either.They can be next door, they can be at work, they can ruin your life. It's a great book, and it ultimately helped me feel much better about my own choices of caring, which I had not expected. Her argument about why it's wonderful to NOT be a sociopath is a jewel."
40,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914586-mark,3,"So I picked up this book because I heard somebody saying that ""some of the traits of a sociopath aren't that bad."" Then, that same day I saw this book so I bought and read it on a whim. Not that anyone cares. Anyway, Stout - probably as she intended - writes with a clinical voice even when she is trying to be personable. It can be annoying at times, but, in the same way, it is very good writing for communicating her thoughts. She makes the argument that sociopathy is far more prevalent in our society than what we may believe and realize. She basically defines a sociopath as a person that can make any decision without conscious or remorse (no matter how aweful it may be.) To her sociopaths seem to govern themselves and their actions by a part of their ego similar to Freud's concept of the super ego. I don't necessarily disagree with her, but being more of a math/science type I am stuck with her lack of ability to ever fully test her hypothesis. Even diagnosis of people that we would truly call sociopaths can never be truly tested and so I have a problem with her basically pushing this idea as being so prevalent that it is epidemic, when she cannot quantify her results even on the individual scale. Point being, people are crazy and can be truly evil even in the context of minutia; so Dr. Stout, if you want to call them sociopaths then so be it, but you really dilute the term when you extend it to such demographics.- Mark, I do not have a Ph.D."
41,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951784-kristi,5,"I thought this was a useful book that can explain anti-social personality disorders in a straightforward way that a layman can understand. It's short and I've used this information to in turn derive specific examples in explaining sociopathy to others. Everyone should read this because you will recognize those puzzling people you've wondered, ""What the..."" because their behavior didn't make sense, their motives seemed unclear and therefore were confusing. Sociopaths do not run on the same logic and motives that the rest of us do. They might mess with someone simply for the pleasure of doing so, simply so they can think how smart they are for outwitting us. They are excellent at playing victims when needed (like a weapon in their arsonel) crying big crocodile tears and eliciting compassion from others. But make no mistake, that's where their empathy begins and ends--for themselves. They mimic human behavior and emotions, but do not feel things in the same way we do. It's all about them. This book will give you the tools for recognizing the sociopaths that you have or will run across in your life and give you useful advice about how to deal with them. Concisely: don't engage with them. On a personal note the way I can tell if someone is a sociopath is often the way I automatically respond to them like they are a tractor beam that can suck me in, they are so charming and alluring. I trust that feeling and stay away. "
42,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/919308-simon,4,"Being a thriller writer, books like this are catnip to me. I enjoyed it. Very accessible and easy to understand. Thought the examples/illustrations were a little drawn out."
43,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,3,"Eh. I think I was hoping for something more scientific and informative. Instead, I got a lot of musings on where conscience comes from and whether we'd be better off without out it, interspersed with sociopath anecdotes which were apparently composites rather than actual stories. Yes, philosophical questions about conscience are fascinating to contemplate, but I was hoping to learn more about the latest research on sociopathy.For example, the author occasionally references the fact that there is a typology of sociopaths (e.g., covetous sociopaths, abrasive sociopaths) but never lays this typology out for us. In contrast, when she offers up a checklist for who might be a sociopath in your life, the checklist seems vague and unscientific. Perhaps I wouldn't have appreciated a book at the other extreme, dry and annotated, but there is a happy medium and this book didn't fall there.I did appreciate the concept that not all sociopaths are serial killers and we probably encounter many in our day-to-day lives without even realizing it because they're not wearing a sign or doing anything overtly sociopathic. Confessions of a Sociopath: A Life Spent Hiding in Plain Sight was the first book I read that made that point, but this book was more credible. The author seems to have had an impressive career, which made it all the more surprising to me that this book was less research data and more musings and anecdotes.Still, though, I gave it three stars because these issues are fascinating and because it makes me feel good to explain away some of the nasty people I've encountered as possible sociopaths who fly under the radar because they've never killed anyone. That's worth something, I guess."
44,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1,"This is a pathetically worthless book,As I read through the chapters I thought the author was laying it on a bit thick, so I went to the notes to see where she got her info. Nothing there, so I read the authors note. NONE OF THESE PEOPLE EVER EXISTED!!!I don't mind an author changing names or dates to protect privacy,but all her characters are COMPOSITES.Non fiction novels ARE NOT NON FICTION. She'd pick 20 or so tidbits from 20 different people and pile it all together, plus no doubt a bunch of stuff she made up to make the story more interesting. It's unlikely that in 300,000 years of human history that no person ever had done the specific things she listed.It wouldn't be so bad if she had a talent for writing,but she doesn't, the text is a big snoreeeeeeeeeeeeeee.....And, it's probably at least the 400th book written that has the old1961 Yale experiment Milgram did, and every literate person in the world has already read about more times than they want.FRESH MATERIAL PLEASEThe whole book is like a kettle of mush.Another tidbit of deception, the author's photo looks like a young woman, actually she must have been over 50 when the book was written."

46,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24198043-mollydee,4,"It is hard to do a review for a non fiction book. I can say I am interested in the subject, between being in Psychiatric Nursing, and having a husband in Law Enforcement I am more than used to sociopaths and their behaviors. This book is geared for a regular person who does not have any knowledge of sociopaths and their behavior and is very well done. It was broken up very well. Between different theories on why 1 in 25 Americans have no conscience, to stories of her own patients that she took apart and explained and discussed, to how this crosses lines from psychology into religion and culture. I think the best part is the complete knowledge it gave. The way it was presented was excellent. It was an easy read. My favorite part was the description of how much damage sociopaths do to our culture, and theirselves, and all those in their path. Whether it is a man running a company and doing things that are bad, or someone stealing something just of the heck of it. These people do not grapple with what most of would if we behaved that way because we have a conscience and the people described have no conscience. We also expect someone important and who is somewhat of an authority figure to have a conscience. It is surprising to find out, if we ever do, that they do not. Then there are those who just like to annoy everyone in anyway they can because they do not have any feelings or connections to other humans. The book also gets into some of our more famous sociopaths like Hitler and Ghengis Khan. The best thing that Dr. Stout did, was give us ""Thirteen Rules For Dealing With Sociopaths In Everyday Life"" which was worth the price of the book at all costs. Everyone should have this information. As a matter of fact, I found out a friend of mine, who is no longer a friend, was a sociopath. To a ""T"". I had a feeling at the time, but, because I have a conscience, I found it so hard to believe that anyone could act that way. I kept saying she way under undue stress and had very bad luck. But she had no conscience. And then the last chapter brings in all of the religions and cultures that may not say that there are sociopaths as we would recognize them, but they all have their own word for that type of person. And the religions all have the biggest rule of conscience, no matter how you say it, ""Do unto others as you would have done unto you"". The last chapter was my favorite.I highly recommend this book for the simple fact of the knowledge it contains and how useful it can be."
47,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,4,"Going slow here. This is an interesting, informative, thought provoking, and somewhat frightening book. When I picked it up (at the library thus sending it to the top of my ""to be read list"") and first read the title and cover blurb ""1 in 25 ordinary Americans secretly has no conscience and can do anything at all without feeling guilty. Who is the devil you know?""I was tempted to make a few light remarks. I won't however. This is an interesting book and while I give it 4 stars for what I find to be some obvious omissions in Dr. Stout's (Ph.d.) questions and overall discussion it's still (I believe) a valuable read.It would be very difficult if not impossible to single out parts of the book to go into here as there is a flow to her examination of sociopathy, the existence of conscience and/or lack thereof. The discussion includes not only examples and short case studies it contains views of the ideas surrounding the ""condition"" (my word, used for convenience sake) but it's effects. Many of the people Dr. Stout works with have been damaged by their interaction with those whom would be described as conscienceless.I'm not worried about spoilers here as this is a nonfiction book, but about trying to give an idea of the cogent discussion found in this book in a few words, and ending up misrepresenting it. In the process of reading this volume, I recognized traits I've seen and dealt with all my life. From my parents attempt to keep things very low key, don't rock the boat when as a child I would become outraged at some action (bullying, theft etc.) to individuals who always present themselves as needing sympathy. It can be I suppose somewhat eyeopening. So, while not the end all and be all on this subject this is I believe a valuable book for we ""poor lay people"" who have to deal with people.Of course it might also be somewhat valuable to the sociopaths among us in helping them stay camouflaged. Another scary thought. One of the more disturbing cases in the book (to me anyway) concerned a psychologist who had no compunction, of any kind. Apparently a sociopath who would without a second thought destroy one of her patients to strike at a third party.Again, while not ""the book with all the answers"" about the subject (I doubt that exists) this is a book I'd recommend. "
48,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22890390-meghann,1,"I actually started this book probably five years ago. I got a chapter or two into it and became so angry that I had to stop reading. I don't like dnf-ing a book, and this one has been sitting on my shelf mocking me ever since. So I tried it again determined to finish it no matter what.I think this actually could have been an interesting and informative book. But all the catastrophizing just drove me mad. Yes, there are sociopaths out there. Yes, people have been hurt by sociopaths. It's awful. But this book makes it seem like they are everywhere. Right off the bat it suggests your best friend who lied to you several times or your boyfriend who lied (no minimum amount of lies required) are sociopaths. Is your boss mean to you? Sociopath! Did someone hurt your feelings? Sociopath!

I'm a big believer in an internal locus of control. If we just assume that anyone who makes us feel bad is a sociopath and victimizing us, we miss the opportunity to look at our role in what happened and what we have the power to change moving forward. I'm seriously not victim shaming here. Anyone who was victimized by an actual sociopath deserves all the love and support in the world. But it seems dangerous for this book to encourage its readers to seek out and diagnose the sociopaths in their lives (because there are four of them) and blame things on a mental disorder that they are not qualified to diagnose."
49,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334938-taryn,3,"""Psychologically speaking, conscience is a sense of obligation ultimately based in an emotional attachment to another living creature (often but not always a human being), or to a group of human beings, or even in some cases to humanity as a whole.""The last few books I have read featured sociopaths and/or narcissists, so this book caught my eye! As the cover and title suggest, it is alarmist and sensationalist. It was also a bit shallow and repetitive.The parts I found most interesting in this book were:1) “Thirteen Rules for Dealing with Sociopaths in Everyday Life”2) The case studies were cartoonish, but they were effective in illustrating that a sociopath is not necessarily the psycho murderous criminal you might imagine. (ex. The slacker story.)3) Interesting discussion on conscience.4) The book is about 10 years at the point and many of the experiments Stout references are much older than that. In fact, you've probably seen these studies referenced many times before in other books. Even so, it is interesting to read the results of these older experiments.I think this book would be most useful for people who have dealt with or are dealing with an actual sociopath. I could also recommend it for someone who wants a quick overview on conscience and sociopathy."
50,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,2,"I did find this book somewhat flawed in the sense I didn't know what the author means when she defines a sociopath as having no conscience, or 'love and empathy' for others, or sense of guilt or shame, or remorseness and so on. Everyone's favorite sociopath is Adolph Hitler but I would argue in Hitler's own world view he did not lack any of those things from his own perspective since he thought of himself as one and the same with Germany and the masses thought the same for him. Hitler was a sociopath, his followers were sociopaths, but using lack of conscience as a criterion at most leads to a tautological trap that seems non helpful. (In the end great Philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas or Heidegger will have the conscience be the cause of itself since they can't square the circle otherwise). The real question I would ask 'do we have a sociopath in the White House'. My answer in a word would be yes. Oddly, this author differentiated narcissist from Sociopath as mostly being of different beings. I would say with certainty we have a narcissist in the White House and mostly likely a sociopath, and that every single person who shouted 'send her back' at the KKK/Nuremberg rally last week (7/16/2019) is a sociopath since all fascist are sociopaths."
51,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2986010-francisco,5,"A sociopath is someone who does not have a conscience. But what exactly is conscience? Stout defines conscience as a sense of obligation based on an emotional attachment to another or to others. The sociopath simply does not ""feel"" that attachment. He or she can distinguish between right and wrong and can foresee the consequences of an evil act and may be deterred by the possibility of punishment. But if the risk of getting caught is non-existent or low he will do the hurtful thing, whereas most of us might still restrain ourselves from the evil act, even if we can get away with it, by the empathy we feel for whoever we plan to hurt. The interesting thing about this book is that it focuses not on criminal sociopathic behavior but on ""mean"" behavior of the day to day variety. It is eye opening to recognize the sociopath father, boss, husband, boyfriend, colleague (sociopath's can be very charming). But it is even more disturbing and painful to see the slow erosion of conscience in our culture and, if we are very honest, in ourselves. It is a tough read even though the book reads like a suspenseful novel. But then again, shouldn't we be brave now and then and take on a tough read?"
52,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1405910-april,4,"I think I must be a bit of a weirdo in that I quite like learning about anomalies and different sorts of things. Obviously being a sociopath is not normal and it’s outside my realm of experience, thus I find it fascinating as a topic. After a pretty big tragedy struck (not me personally), I found myself wanting answers and wondering how a person could do something like that. And so, I plunked down a $10 gift card and $0.91 to purchase The Sociopath Next Door by Martha Stout on Audible in hopes of gaining an understanding of how people who do not possess a conscience think and also function. Thankfully, The Sociopath Next Door reminded me exactly why I delve into non-fiction quite often.Read the rest of my review here link goes live 2/24/13"
53,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19675171-sheila-denn,2,"This is one of those books that you like less the more you think about it. It's a pop psychology book that is essentially trying to use scare tactics to get the reader all freaked out about sociopaths in our midst. It does this using an awful lot of anecdotes, and a frustratingly small amount of data, not much of which is recent. The central claim is that some 4 percent of people in western societies are afflicted with a sociopathic disorder of one sort or another, a claim that is repeated ad nauseam throughout the book without much to back it up. And as far as advice on what to do when faced with a sociopath, say, in a work situation, the book's advice is basically to avoid that person, because apparently therapeutic approaches don't work. So I'm hard pressed to say what this book is really useful for."
54,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3851259-sarah-hyatt,1,"This book was ridiculous and stupid.A lot of people are complaining about fear mongering - maybe I'm biased, but I didn't get that from it. That would be attributing a lot more credibility to this book than it deserves. I worked for a boss who showed a lot of sociopathic symptoms, and many of the effects the author describes are valid. If she's angry or bitter against some sociopathic person who has affected her own sense of confidence in herself, she has my empathy. But the ridiculous almost fundamentalist bias of this book, coupled with some severely negative and offensive discussion of adoption (reactive attachment disorder = sociopathy? Are you kidding me?) ruined it for me. The title also has little to do with the content, which would have made a better blog entry than book, and would have been greatly enhanced by a less biased and fundamentalist author."
55,0767915828,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134131-kim,4,"Marth Stout contends that 1 out of 4 people is a sociopath. However, most do not murder others-- simply because it doesn't suit their purposes to do so. When you consider the number of people out there who DO murder and that most murders are committed not by strangers, but by people known to the victims, it becomes believable. When I read this book I began to think of all the people I know who seem to be able to lie so smoothly and do things to hurt friends and family members so easily and carelessly without thinking. Normally we call people like that ""selfish"" but that's exactly what a sociopath is-- someone who has the inability to empathize with another's feelings. "

I thought it was well-written, in simple language that anyone can understand. (Unlike many books written by psychologists.)Obviously you cannot expect to purchase and read one book and suddenly become an expert on diagnosing sociopathy. However, I found the information extremely interesting. Martha Stout gives us great insight into human nature. "
