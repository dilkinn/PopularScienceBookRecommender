0,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51511176-fraser,5,"A good summary of what we know about gut health and a great collection of simple recipes. I was surprised to learn that the microbes in our gut don't just help regulate weight, they influence how much food is extracted from what we eat, control hunger signals, regulates our immune system, influence our cravings and even influence our mood. A few notes:- avoid drinking your calories (juice, beers etc)- cut back on readily absorbed carbs to avoid insulin spikes (bread, potatoes, rice)- eat slowly at a table and pause after the main course to allow hunger hormones (PPY the appetite suppressant) to kick in - branch out and get as much diversity in your diet as possible. 75% of the world's food comes from just 12 plants and 5 animal species! The more different plants you eat the more diverse your microbiome. - avoid antibiotics where possible and avoid eating animals raised with antibiotics. It can take months to years for your microbial community to bounce back.- open a window to increase the diversity of microbes in your house- Great foods for your gut: olive oil, oily fish, seaweed, cocoa, turmeric, garlic, shallots, leeks, white onions, eggplant, Jerusalem artichoke, asparagus, barley, flax seeds, yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut, apple cider vinegar. - Foods to avoid: sugar and anything processed with emulsifiers, trans fats, artificial sweeteners- get better sleep and meditate"

2,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10278527-asho,4,"If it weren't for the two small children that dictate my life, I'd have never put this book down. It's an entertaining, as well as informative, read written in language that is easy to understand but still thought-provoking. It is such a fascinating subject-matter that we are still only on the cusp of fully understanding. Dr Mosley navigates the facts, fiction and educated supposition of the field quite well. At times the anecdotal evidence is overwhelming, but in a field yet so devoid of exploration, it's largely all we have and I find this book informed and reasoned as opposed to the quackery a lot of books in this genre can be. It is for this reason that I put a lot of prior research into which book on the subject to purchase and read, as my time and money need to be used well these days. There are general guidelines provided for those who just want to tweak their lifestyle and/or do it in their own way, and there is total handholding with a meal plan and recipes for those who like that approach. I'm not going to lie, as someone who needs a major dietary and lifestyle overhaul, some of the recipes are a little alien-sounding, but not all, I'm glad to say. This book personally speaks volumes to me as my family battles complicated autoimmune conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, and reading the book is like finding the final piece of the puzzle of self-management. But I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think it speaks to a lot of the modern problems that plague us and seems a real answer as opposed to a lot of the theories out there with regards to society's health decline. This book is far from a conspiracy-reinforcer that often puts me off a lot of books and blogs out there on nutrition and health. The reason I haven't afforded it 5 stars is largely due to editing issues which are something I detest of published books at the best of times but particularly in non-fiction. There is also some strange formatting with regards to the pictures of the recipes in the Australian Kindle version I read, but that's nothing major. I also sometimes find the examples used a bit thin/superficial even for an ""entertaining"" non-fiction book, such as references to Rebel Wilson's diet. I also wasn't a fan of the politicised comment regarding ISIS. It just didn't need to be used in a diet book. Finally, a word of caution to mothers; this book talks about the benefits of vaginal birth and breastfeeding and the evils of c-sections and antibiotic use in labour and infancy. It's not worded in a heavy way, but it is pretty emphatic that vaginal and breast are best. It's backed-up with studies and isn't incorrect, but I would have preferred a stronger caveat that sometimes intervention is best. I know first-hand that there's already a lot of judgement and guilt placed on mother's, most of all by ourselves, and that many desperate women out there are all too quick to blame themselves for anything that causes our children to be less than perfect. If you are looking for answers for illness in your children, read this book but be aware that many of the interventions experienced in birth/child-raising, are beyond our control and usually used because they minimise risk of negative outcomes. For instance, better our child is safe from life-threatening infection than not, even if that means they have eczema/asthma/ASD. This book may just help us in better managing our family's health, but don't use it to beat yourself up (and certainly the book isn't written in that tone, I just wish to forewarn).All-in-all, this is a fantastic book that I would recommend everyone read. I'm genuinely excited about this new field and can't wait to see what unfolds from the research. I hope Dr Mosley updates this book as new discoveries are made."
3,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46500234-val-robson,3,Very interesting and informative read. There's a lot to take in and I feel I need to go back and read some of it again. I would like confirmation from professionals in the field as to whether they agree with the contents of not as I felt that some of the advice was based on anecdotal evidence or studies that did not involved enough subjects to be scientifically representative. I was quite irritated with the section on babies born by Caesarean being proclaimed inferior health-wise to those born vaginally - more likely to be obese and develop allergies in later life. The media seems to enjoy placing guilt trips on mothers who did not give birth 'naturally' while overlooking that many of these mothers would have died in the not too dim distance past if Caesareans were not an option. 
4,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11431921-carol---reading-writing-and-riesling,5,"My View:I am a big fan of Dr Michael Mosley. I like him, I like his style of reporting and documenting science based health information which is presented in clear, easy to read language and is backed by Dr Mosley’s personal scientific experimentation, research and the research of others. Gut based health is something that I (and my immediate family) are very aware of and very interested in. There is still so much to learn about the gut and its microbiome – this book is an excellent starting point, a useful reference and the recipes are easy to follow and taste delicious. Learn about resistant starches (not all starches are created equal), probiotics, prebiotics, fermented foods and how to re boot your biome and so much more. Gut health is so important to your overall health. Change your gut biome – one delicious meal at a time, change your health. "

6,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29791454-domhnall,5,"Not a diet book or a fad book but a really useful and interesting account of the complex eco-system that is our gut, supported by decent science. So much of our mental life revolves around our alimentary canal in all its features, yet we understand it no better than we understand the depths of the oceons and in our ignorance, we not only fail to act in ways that help that hidden ecosystem but also fail to appreciate why this is a matter of our survival. At the moment when we hear that over 50% of food eaten in Britain is manufactured and processed by the food industry, it is sobering to be told that that industry is actively wrecking our guts in ways that are deeply harmful. When the adverts proclaim a new health food, the evidence is that it is usually not healthy. The book explains what is happening in sensible, well reasoned and easily readable terms and how we can recover our health by eating differently and intelligently. "
7,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28060634-vashti,3,"An insightful book on gut health, with some handy recipes at the back. For me, it's nothing groundbreaking as I've read quite a bit on this topic already, but I enjoyed trying some of the recipes like pumpkin porridge, and its encouraged me to bring fermented foods like kefir into my diet."

I didn't know that inside of your digestive track little terrorist bacteria wait until they have the numbers and then hold you to ransom; forcing you to indulge in sugars and carbs!? Hell no, I certainly do not negotiate with terrorists - good bye sugar and starchy/carby foods.Worth reading - even if just to add to your research in maintaining a healthy mind and body."

12,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54373153-katrina-b,3,"Michael Mosley is a British television journalist, producer and presenter, working with the BBC. He's famous for all sorts of health-related shows including 'Trust me, I'm a doctor' and 'Eat, fast, and live longer'. In 2017 Michael Mosley released 'The Clever Guts Diet' book about gut health. In this book, Michael Mosley describes the gut system and the inter-related part of the enteric nervous system, and the make up of the biome of the intestines. The explanation given is that certain foods have certain effects on the the gut biome, which can and does have feedback loops. That each person can and does have different responses to different foods. What is good for one person, isn't necessarily for the next person, and that there is an Israeli team setting up testing so that advice can be specialised for the individual. His end conclusion is that we are better off eating the Mediterranean diet with lots of carotenoids, flavonoids, resistant starches, and fibres, and having intermittent hunger periods to promote the population of Akkermansia species in our guts.It is a relatively small book read fairly fast. How much of the data in this book is cherry picked? A good question I am unable to answer."
13,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66779571-lisa-randall,4,Great book Really good and very informative. Great recipes and there are meal plans to follow. The reason I haven't given 5 stars is in one part of the book it says to cut out veg like broccoli in phase 1 and then the meal plans in Phase 1 are full of broccoli?? I don't know whether to include them or not?

The Clever Gut Diet focuses on the complex world of the intestines and the bacteria needed there for healthy living. Called the biome, this environment is strongly influenced by what you eat and by the amount of sleep and exercise you get.Mosley has written an interesting and informative book on the various gut flora and how to bring your body into a balance that allows you to profit from the food you eat. Also included are many recipes designed to bring your system into better harmony.The short course? Restrict refined sugar as much as possible, and abandon processed foods. Try fasting (600-800 calories of healthy food) 2 days a week to encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria.Yes, Scott, you could have written this book!😊"
15,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2734623-debbie,4,"The thing that grabbed my attention when I first saw this book mentioned on the blog Booker Talk was the promise that it would cut sugar cravings. My sweet tooth has plagued me my whole life.Mosley explains why our ""modern guts"" are out of whack and what we can do to reset them. It all sounded so reasonable that two-thirds of the way through the book, I returned my library copy and ordered both the book AND the cookbook from Amazon. There is now the need to reread, and to get my husband on board. Once I do, I may rate this even higher."
16,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67812503-thor-olafsson,4,A fascinating topic.....and a true eye opener. The author´s humor and simple writing style make it a totally entertaining read :)
17,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4772003-em,4,"Easy to read, yet satisfyingly scientific. Thankfully this is not a fad diet book, but one that explains the digestive system, then links a lot of different research through its impact on the gut 'biome'.

It's not about calories or restriction; it's about the sort of food and lifestyle changes you should make if you have gut problems, or simply want to keep yours in good condition."" - page 9Optimum health comes first, it's that simple. Your health is the foundation upon which everything else in your life is built, if you have a low level of health then everything and everyone else in your life will suffer as a result. More and more research is showing that your gut and the many species of good and bad bacteria that can thrive there are key to your health. Therefore, understanding how to look after your guts and cultivate the right bacteria in them is one of the best places to start taking control of your health and, building on decades of research, The Clever Guts Diet provides an easily digestible place to start for the health conscious person to start taking charge of their guts. High recommend to everyone!"
23,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11859377-astrid,5,"I love Michael Mosley. I think he's an absolute credit to his profession, and I love the way he goes above and beyond to prove/disprove theories just to help others, as well as himself.This book didn't disappoint. It's a journey into your microbiome which is in your gut. It contains information on how to 'change' it, or make it more diverse. We are learning all the time in the science field that the gut could be the route of a lot of problems - including such things as depression and anxiety. It's a fascinating area and Dr. Mosley does a fantastic job at explaining it. He's not patronising, but at the same time he doesn't shy away from medical/scientific language. He explains everything very well and in the right amount of details. I also really liked that he says he can't shy away from chocolate no matter how much he tries - chocolate is my downfall too, made me feel a bit better about myself!Who would I recommend this book to? Anyone that's interested in their microbiome or altering their diet to make their gut healthier, and possibly losing weight and making yourself more 'happy' in the process. Anyone that's interested in different diets as well - there's a good few recipes at the back of the book that are gut-friendly. I'd also recommend it to anyone that's enjoyed any of Michael Mosley's programmes on television - he's very much the same in the book. Very enjoyable and enlightening to read."
24,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39525399-lou-griffiths,4,"As always, enjoyable, approachable and informative....healthier gut here I come."
25,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53429295-kate-littlejohn,5,"The new findings and research about the gut ‘world’ is fascinating. Dr Michael Mosley presents it in his infectiously enthusiastic way, that is easy to read and understand. The edition I read had Australian references for more information and there were recipes in the back to help you on your way. "
26,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16475102-abhinav-talwar,4,"The Clever Guts Diet is chiefly about the microbiota which colonises a humans large intestine and how the variety and density of each species present here is increasingly being shown to have significant effects on the health of an individual.Many scientists and health care practitioners are aware of the significance of the link between gut health to overall health and over the last few decades increasing research, testing and hence evidence is accumulating to support the tie that gut health has with a number of conditions. To rattle off a few: Diabetes type 2, obesity, glucose intolerance, coeliac disease, Irritable bowel syndrome to anxiety and depression.Michael Mosley's repeatedly emphasises to the reader that through his and other scientist’s research and experiments that a marked difference in the microbiota in the large intestine results in very different responses in the way in which individuals digest and assimilate nutrients in the same food.The range of experiments he enlists include: contaminating mice with the faeces from people with a good proportion of good bacteria and in another with large proportions of the mischievous ones and observing how they respond to the same food, swallowing a pill sized camera in front of a live audience and viewing the digestion of his food from the inside, a vast number of nutrition studies done in the Wiezmann Institute to FMT.He further goes on to outline how some companies have exploited the prospects of this gut information through the promotion and mass-selling of a number of redundant products. He gives the low down on which pre and pro bacteria rich foods, supplements as well as yogurts to go for on his website.You can check out his website here: https://cleverguts.com/ FYI, Pre-biotics feed good bacteria present within your body and Pro-biotics provide bacteria.He ends the book with an assortment of recipes which he, his wife and a leading nutritionist have put together which empower the reader to immediately put into action the knowledge acquired through reading this book. There are a number of takeaways from this book which is why I rated it so. I would encourage the health conscious individual to pick this up since they will get value from it. Nonetheless, if you do not want to or are short of time for this kind of stuff, below is my list of a take-aways to promote gut-health, courtesy of ‘The clever guts diet’:- Eat oily fish-Consume Garlic, Turmeric and various Fibre one example being Inulin.-Eat a variety of colourful vegetables very regularly-Intermittent fast-Eat apples, seaweed, barley, oats -Eat fermented food wherever you get the chance. Some examples include: Kefir, Kimchi, Sauerkraut.-Eat yogurts with live active bacteria- Eat certain cheeses- Feta, Gouda, Mozzarella, Cottage- read the labels and they will let you know what is in there.- Avoid anti-biotics unless inexorably necessary.-Avoid dairy and gluten for 1-2 weeks and then re-introduce back into your diet and see if there are significant differences in your activity level, mood and overall wellbeing. Use a food diary to monitor this. He has a reboot gut biome programme with guideline meals in the recipe section of his book.-Anyone can get their poo sampled through the a biome society for just under 3 figures. This will tell you what proportion of what species is currently inhabiting your gut and allow you to monitor results diet and lifestyle changes have had on your inner population so that you can personalise your diet accordingly or continues as you are.-Exercise regularly but not excessively. HIIT is theform he promotes. -Sleep at a regular times at least 4 times a week and wake up at the same time.- Avoid situations which are stressful for you.- Eat a Mediterranean like diet.- Practice mindfulness.- Research bacteria present in the gut and try to eat foods and create a lifestyle which produce proportions of good and bad bacteria that make you feel fit and healthy most of the time. To name drop some good bacteria mentioned, he talks about:AkkermansiaBifidobacteriaLactobacillus.Although not a traditional diet book (good marketing mate), I am really looking forward to making his suggested Chocolate and Aubergine brownies tomorrow. Hmmmm...nom,nom,nom."
27,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9467019-karen,4,"What happens in our bodies when we eat a meal or swallow a drink?Many people would rather not know the answer and yet the last few years have seen more and more evidence about the importance of our digestive system to overall health and well-being. Three separate specialists from different branches of medicine  and health have all told me in the last year that the gut is now considered as a second brain: a highly integrated system that manages a set of processes as complex as all those neural pathways. When a surgeon, a physiotherapist and a mindfullness teacher all sang the same song  I began to sit up and pay attention.Which is how I came to be reading Michael Mosely's book: The Clever Guts Diet: How to Revolutionise Your Body From The Inside Out.I’ve seen Michael Mosely multiple times on British television through his Trust Me I’m A Doctor series and he always struck me as the kind of man who isn’t swayed by fads or pseudo science of the kind  trotted by many a clean eating celebrity.  He has a deeply inquiring mind  that often leads him to take extreme actions in a search for answers. In this case, his desire to know how the digestive system really works, what foods might trigger problems like allergies or IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and cancer, led him to an experiment with a live audience at the British Museum.After a meal of steak, chips and kale washed down with apple juice he then swallowed a microscopic camera called a “pillcam”, which captured digital images of  his gastrointestinal tract . The idea was to watch in real-time what happened to his meal once the microbes got to work.Mosely loves those microbes.  He can name the different species of the 50 million microbes (mainly bacteria)  that live in the gut and make up the microbiome.The bad news? A diet limited in variety and heavy in processed food – along with antibiotic overuse – has ravaged the modern microbiome. This helps explain dramatic increases in health conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, allergies, food intolerances, asthma and eczema.But there is good news in the book too. It's possible, says Mosely, to halt the damage and reboot the system back to health with a gut-friendly eating regime. Avoiding fruit juice is an early piece of advice. It moves through the body so quickly there’s little time for its nutrients to be absorbed. Worse still: it creates a spike in blood sugar levels.  Sugar encourages the growth of the microbes that love sugar,. They crave even more of it - telling your brain (and you) to eat more ... and more....  In the meantime, the good microbes get destroyed.So message number one: cut down (or even better, out) uncessary sugar.Message number two:  encourage the growth and variety of “good” gut microbes, by eating probiotics (fermented foods that contain live bacteria and yeast) and prebiotics (certain vegetables and pulses containing indigestible plant fibre).The Clever Guts Diet is based on research Mosely conducted for more than a year during which he interviewed multiple experts and read scores of research papers. The result is a  treasure house of insights and factual information.   It's often amusing. Often provokes a reaction of Yuck when you read it. But it's also thought provoking. This is not a book for anyone who feels in the slightest bit queasy when confronted by information about bodily functions but it is definitely a book for anyone who wants to take back control of their health."
28,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5733902-sally,5,"We hear a lot about 'intestinsal flora' and this is an accessible and fascinating account of the digestive system and the stuff it does that we don't realise.Gamely swallowing a camera for an eye-witness account,the author describes the stomach: ""a cavernous,exotic landscape...pink and pulsatile, a place of slobber and rawhide""...the small bowel : ""it reminded me of the last time I went snorkelling in a bay full of seaweed"" ....churning the chyme ""in a frantic corkscrew motion""...note too that the digestive system (a hugely complex food factory) contains as many neurons as the brain of a cat, as it exchanges information with the brain) ....and thence to the colon, wherein dwells this eco system of bacteria, fungi, viruses and ""simplre, primitive animals called protozoa.""(Also learnt something about that alleged ""white elephant"" the appendix: Apparently after a bad attack of diarrhoea, the sufferer needs to reseed his purged guts with 'good' bacteria, and the organ in question acts as ""the Noah's Ark of the gut world, ready to repopulate your gut when the waters subside."" Fascinating stuff.Fascinating too to learn that the newborn imbibes its iniial hit of bacteria from its mother during birth: those born in a more sterile manner through Caesarean, are 64% more likely to be obese adults than those not!The book then goes on to look at WHY these microbes matter...involved in everything from weight gain to IBS, allergies, sleeplessness, stress...And how to cultivate them through 'prebiotics'(healthy foods that encourage growth) and 'probiotics' (stuff that actually contains microbes direct- yogurt, fermented foods.) They also do well under an intermittent fasting regime, and with exercise.I was minded to recommend this book to a friend with IBS but may pass on that, since the author's top success story was a sufferer who undertook the rather extreme step of deliberately infecting himself with hookworm. ""They damp down our immune responses by secreting compounds that manipulate our immune system...that enables the worm to survive but it also has benefits for us."" And yet with the previously ill guy now able to eat the hottest curries...it sounds like a price worth paying!Includes numerous recipes.VERY interesting...arent humans brilliantly made?! And all this goes on with us barely aware of it beyond the odd gurgle or bit of acidity! (And they say we got here by accident...puh-lease!!) "
29,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28095365-kerry-johnson,4,"This book is basically a summary of the documentary series that Dr Mosley produced, along with some recipes. Not that I'm complaining - there was a lot of info to get through and I appreciate the notes.I came away impressed but a bit disappointed - it's wonderful to know so much about my gut ""biome"" - but as everyone is different, it seems to me that unless I know what exactly my deficiencies are and what eating pattern works for me, the advice falls a bit short.There is a lab you can send your poo off to that will give you an idea of your deficiencies, but the other lab is still only trialing the diet advice (admittedly with good results, but not yet widely available). So I'm left a bit flummoxed by what I should do exactly with all this new found knowledge about my rich inner world. Will the first poo test be enough to help me change or improve my eating habits? I'm going to do more research and I feel this book has given me a good jumping off point. Some of the recipe ingredients - like coconut oil - raised my eyebrows a bit as it seems to be being debunked as good for us. One glaring omission in the recipe sections was a basic kimchi recipe. He'd extolled its virtues quite a lot.Glad I read it and I will keep it on hand, but if you saw the series and were on the fence, this book isn't going to sway you - there's not much new in it. But if, like me, you saw the series and were intrigued - this is like the study guide to it."
30,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75776865-ron-w,5,"The book completely flipped my previous thinking on how our intestines function. I knew bacteria were important, I just didn't know how important. At school, I was one of the senior high biology ""nerds,"" yet Mosley's book really opened my eyes as to how what we eat really affects everything from mood to longer term health. Mosley seems to emphasize as well that we need to treat antibiotics as a last rather than a first resort, and only take them when an infection is really stubborn. The problem is that antibiotics are the 'carpet bombing' of medicine so it really affects our gut 'biome' (bacterial ecosystem). Factoids and advice are also given, such as don't drink your calories, chew slowly so your receptors have time to tell you you're full, cut down on dense carbs to avoid sugar spikes, and when possible do some HIT (high intensity training) for short bursts.There are also some great recipes at the end of the book to try and get you to put as much bacteria into your body as possible, apparently the more the merrier. In short - I had no idea how simple the whole thing is. Just love your guts!!! There are so many fad diets out there, but Mosley really puts it all back into a simpler perspective allowing any reader to save his / her gut, health, and sanity. A must read for all individuals and families - tell this stuff to your kids (start early)!!!"

But perhaps they are not unrelated?We have always suspected that the brain and the gut are linked. They form in utero at the same time, and now we know that a large number of brain cells are present in the gut. The two communicate via the vagus nerve.So we really SHOULD listen to our gut.Of my three kids, the one that struggles more with weight is the emergency cesarean child, and the emergency appendectomy child and the … you get it - the medical disaster kid.After a number of years of restricted diet, we’ve reached a point where they can eat wheat again. I even bake my own sourdough.More than a decade ago we did all the stuff Mosley talks about here: poo tests, leaky gut, allergy blood tests, trial diets, supplements, etc. You name it, I tried it.And after reading this, I’m gonna be shoving pro-biotics down his throat.And making my own yogurt.I like Mosley’s style. I have watched a few of his programs and I know people who have found his 5:2 diet to be life-changing. He comes across as a credible person in an area where there are so many quacks.4 stars"

Speaking of sh*t, or poo as author Michael Mosley likes to call it, there’s a lot of mention of that in this book as testing it is quite the thing to do when you’re monitoring your health it seems. Dr Mosley’s book also includes pages of helpful and healthy recipes to try out and I will certainly be giving them a go. The book also introduced me to Mosley’s 5:2 Fast Diet, where you eat 600- 800 calories on two days a week and I’m certainly going to give that a go to re-kickstart my healthy eating and living regime. I’ve just bought Mosley’s Fast Diet book so we’ll see how that goes. In the meantime, I can recommend The Clever Guts Diet as a thoughtful, illuminating and clever book about how your gut and how you nurture it affects how you feel. It may even change the way you eat for the better."

Based on Dr Michael Mosley's book, Hippocrates was right! Gut, the not-so-glamorous organ of the human body, plays important role in extracting energy from our food, accounts for most of our immune system and produces lots of essential hormones that influence everything from our appetite to our mood. Not only all (I think, most) disease begins in the gut, but good health also somewhat begins in the gut. Deep buried in our intestines, the gut is ""made up of the same cells, neurons, which are found in the brain"" and ""there are over 100 million neurons [in it], as many as you would find in the brain of a cat,"" write Dr Michael. Technically, the gut is our 'second brain’ (I have a 'gut feeling' about this). Whenever I see a cat now, I imagine its brain is neurotically almost the same numbers as my gut!To read my short review of Dr Michael Mosley's The Clever Guts Diet: How to Revolutionize Your Body from the Inside Out (2017), CLICK HERE: https://www.richardangelus.me/2019/11..."
34,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5836076-carolyn,4,"I liked that this book talked about overall gut health, and the author backed up assertions with scientific studies. The only problem I had with the book is that it spent a bit of a chunk of time focusing on why vaginal births and being breast fed is best for baby’s gut biome. The book does mention studies that back it’s claim up, but I think it might make Mothers/women feel guilty if she did need to have a c-section or was unable to breast feed. It could have been a bit softer in that respect. We women feel bad enough as it is, why build upon that stress? Maybe it should be doctors that perform unnecessary c-sections that should feel more guilt. That’s my only negative caveat. The rest of the book was very informative. It made me interested to learn about how fasting/low calorie days can improve but health. It was kinda gross when he mentioned that fish oil tablets are essentially rancid fish, but good to know. Eat more fish, Seaweed, and fermented foods and give your tummy a break every so often. I like the advice. I kinda want to have my gut biome analyzed now."
35,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10189861-holly,4,"3.5 This is a good introduction to understanding the gut. The language is simple, it's easy to read and littered with scientific studies/statistics/personal accounts.The cons for me are that he is peddling his other books and diets, that a lot of the studies are one-offs or only conducted on mice (which doesnt mean itll have the same cause and effect on humans) and studies are either largely based on the user (I.e. on what they *say* they did) or such a range of things changed that the author saying it was a specific factor cannot be verified. It is quite a general book so if you have 0 knowledge it's a good start, but I would have liked to have been given directions on some more specific texts (other than his own website)Although, I will say it was refreshing to hear that a man will gobble up chocolate if it's anywhere near him, and will obsess over it if he has it but tries to postpone eating it (as a junk food addict myself, I'm always trying to convince myself there is a way I can overcome this, and the author reinforces that the only way is to NOT BUY ANY)."
36,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34116860-ian-williams,3,"THE Clever Guts Diet deals with the microbiome system in your gut that breaks down food and converts it into hormones and chemicals that are essential for our bodies. There are trillions of them. There are many different types – good biome and bad ones – and they battle it out for dominance in your gut. Addictions are explained and so is the reason for the difficulty in dieting. The pace slackens in the second half of the book as recipes are given to help keep your microbiome in good shape. Basically it becomes a cook book. None of the recipes appealed to me. However, there is a lot of information of use here and a lot to learn from. - Did you know that you have a brain in your stomach? Seriously, it is true. Your gut has neurons that control its actions. It has more neurons than a cat’s brain, which means that your stomach is smarter that a cat. I love that fact. "
37,1780723040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7554420-ruth,4,"Michael Moseley makes the subject of gut bacteria quite riveting, and crucially, quite easy to understand. Research is increasingly indicating that the role gut bacteria play in our physical and mental health is really quite staggering, and there is a lot we don't yet understand, but Moseley explains the current state of our understanding in lay person's terms very effectively. He occasionally feels like he may be oversimplifying, and using words like 'poo' makes it feel like he's dumbing it down more than he really is, but this is a readable and enlightening book. I stopped at the narrative part, but there are also lots of recipes designed to help boost your gut health. We've made the change to eating more plain yoghurt and unpasteurised cheese thus far - sprinkling turmeric on our morning egg proved a step too far."

However, there are a number of half truths in the book with unpublished research, old wives' tales and weird solutions that should stay on the internet forums. The author makes disclaimers that readers should be cautious about these yet-to-be-proven methods, but I wouldn't have used up the book's pages on them. Some parts leave a bad taste, such as the author's use of the word 'unsightly' for fat around the waist, or a paragraph about too much exercise being bad for you (can you explain more about the science behind that?). The book is still great for emphasising the importance of gut health, giving practical advice on food choices. It is a good read, but I think there are better choices out there to learn about your gut."

The main point I learned from this book is that I should dive further into fermented foods and the gut helath/ microbiome. It certainly helped me further in my personal search of fixing my own gut. But since I´ve been eating plant based for 4.5 years, some advice he gives in his book like eating oily fish or eggs etc do not resonate with me; hence, it is not a 5 star book for me personally because it ""just"" gave me a further understanding of the gut, not a complete understanding.
