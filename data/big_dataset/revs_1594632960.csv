It was fun to see the way innovations in one area could set off subsequent innovations that seem totally unrelated. The unpredictable consequences of new discoveries is interesting and explaining it through history made it resonate much more, it really humanized the people being talked about. I really appreciate the author's discussion about what actually helps people make these leaps and ideas that revolutionize everything because it's one that even though I see acknowledged more often now isn't as widely believed. Which is awful because it holds people back from doing amazing things because they have a faulty view of how progress really works. I really enjoyed the book though, if you liked Freakonomics you'd probably like reading this one also, it utilizes the same out of the box thinking."
1,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,3,"I picked this book up on holidays on the north coast right in the middle of one of the worst cold's I have ever had. So this review comes with a drugged up warning. Lots and lots of psuedoephidrine.The title's promise of ""Six innovations that made the modern world"" was probably stamped by some marketing schlep rather than the author. The book rather consists of six technological avenues that shaped how we live. These are divided by chapter and consist of concepts like 'cold', 'light', 'clean' and 'sound'. Yes, by the title, sound was an innovation that made the modern world. Ugh.Anyway the stories inside each chapter are somewhat fascinating and full of intrigue. The author develops several ideas throughout: that some technological developments are inevitable, and some are way out of left-field. Kinda what we know anyway, but it's great to hear these examples.So I'd say a good, light holiday read for anyone who is fascinated by the history of technology. He is a good writer and I'll check out his other stuff. But for me it could have delved a bit deeper into his premise and still been a great, light holiday read."
2,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Johnson's long view of how innovations in 6 different fields shaped our civilization takes traces them from their original uses & discoveries through their current uses. It's an often amazing journey as he points out huge changes made possible by them & the odd consequences in other portions of our lives that we normally wouldn't associate with them. The Wall Street Journal did a good review here:http://www.wsj.com/articles/book-revi...1. GLASS - from King Tut's jewelry to dishes to lenses, glass has certainly been one of our oldest & most important arts. Lenses meshing with the printing press for glasses eventually led to the microscope & telescope, expanding our views immeasurably. Its use as building & communication materials is even more astonishing.2. COLD - is even more interesting in the way it blossomed in just the past couple of centuries & has caused huge shifts in economics & populations through food storage & habitability. Birdseye & Carrier transformed our food & living spaces.3. SOUND - told me that the cave paintings might have been more for marking spots for the best sound than for art. Turns out even dabs of color in the Lascaux caves in France were mapped to the best echo spots, so it has a much older heritage than I'd previously thought. Even so, things really got hopping in the last century or two as we turned it into electric.A recurring theme is that inventions & innovations are generally not light bulb moments of geniuses, but built on the thoughts & tech of the times with a lot of hard work, odd consequences, & failure. Sound illustrates this very well. Martinville's phonoautograph in 1857 set the stage for Edison's phonograph 2o years later & wasn't used the way he imagined at all. Sonar was developed prior to WWI, spurred by the loss of the Titanic, but Langevin couldn't get anyone interested & it wasn't used even though it could have saved thousands from U boats far more cheaply than any other method. Certainly he never thought it would be used for sonograms.Unintended consequences: ...By the end of the decade, the sex ratio at birth in hospitals throughout China was almost 110 boys to every 100 girls, with some provinces reporting ratios as high as 118:100. This may be one of the most astonishing, and tragic, hummingbird effects in all of twentieth-century technology...The normal ratio is 105:100 in the US which makes the statistic a little less tragic. Scientists don't really know what drives the difference in the sex ratio in most cases, although China's is a fact. http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/...4. CLEAN - the past was filthy & now we've gotten to the point where we can make things too clean. The clean up of cities was amazing. I read The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic - and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World, also by Johnson, so knew some of this section. I hadn't realized the entire city of Chicago was jacked up, though. That 3 billion people still live in squalor is ridiculous.5. TIME - was interesting, although I've read about it before, especially the difficulties in navigation before the first clocks let us figure out longitude & now we use a similar method with GPS (time difference between 3 satellites). More interesting was the need for time accuracy in our daily lives as we industrialized & communicated faster. His examples of train schedules was excellent as were the explanations of how it got more accurate as technology progressed.He also made a great example of how Edison was not a genius inventor on his own. He was one of the pioneers of having a team in various disciplines. Many others had the idea of the light bulb for decades, but his team came up with the best filament first & he was excellent at marketing.6. LIGHT - was very expensive before the electric light. I was shocked by how expensive & what a difference it has made in our lives especially when coupled with other inventions. It was a byproduct of fire, our first great discovery, & yet didn't change much for 100,000 years. Not much more than a century ago, we were hunting sperm whales to mine their heads for oil. Now we're using lasers in an attempt to create a sun.I highly recommend this. It was very well read & would be an excellent read for any SF author. Johnson even engages in some what-if scenarios. There are a lot ideas here that show just how amazing & odd our history is, especially in the past couple of centuries. Indeed, we've come a long way, baby!"
3,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2688545-andrew,4,"History is most frequently told from the perspective of hero protagonist or the victorious civilization or as if everything was part of an inexorable and clear plan of progress. History writing is by definition hindsight, and we are wont to weave all details into one clear narrative. The genius of this book is to show the chaos of history and juxtapose it next to the inevitability of basic chemistry and physics. Steven Johnson succeeds exceptionally well in this enjoyable and delightful read about invention and the making of modern society."
4,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"In this book Steven Johnson considers six innovation that the modern world really cannot live without. These are cold, glass, sound, light, time and clean. Slightly obscure you might think, but these six objects have given us so many things like air conditioning, microscopes, clean water, time zones, lasers and the telephone.As he writes about each subject, he reminds you of life before these inventions, with no artificial light, drinking water that could kill you in 48 hours and food that spot quickly in the summer. He tells about the characters that put their reputations and money on the line to get these things off the ground. Others then saw the potential of the ideas and the spinoff ideas from the initial one have been phenomenal. For example before Gutenberg, it was only a handful of monks that needed glasses for near sighted work. After the first books appeared, people realised that they couldn't see the text and the market for reading glasses, using the newly developed lenses took off. The most fascinating was the way that the entire city of Chicago was jacked up to allow space underneath to install a sewerage system.Johnson has a way of conveying ideas and concepts that make this a pleasure to read, well worth reading."
5,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20174779-jason-anthony,5,"When reading nonfiction, I have two set rules: (1) Did I learn something new?and(2) Did I enjoy the writing (and/or material)?Steven Johnson's ""How We Got to Now..."" led me to strong YES responses for both.In this book (which isn't short, but feels very short because you want to race right through it), Johnson tracks how some of our most important inventions (glass, water treatment, electricity) changed the world in both predictable and unpredictable ways. The writing is quick and entertaining; the tidbits of knowledge are non-stop.For example, did you know that the phrase ""always a bridesmaid, never a bride"" originated as a Listerine ad for the ladies? (I did not!)The closest parallel I can think to this book is the work of Malcolm Gladwell. However, as Gladwell treads in my research domain, I often know when he's exaggerating, twisting, or taking credit for others' ideas. Here, there's none of the latter (he speaks of others genius and rarely hints at his own ideas) but I can't speak to the world of physics and hard science. That being said, I have no reason to doubt his historical accuracy.I strongly recommend the book and only wish it lasted longer. (My kindle ended it at about 60% because of all of the end notes, so it felt especially quick!)"
6,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,4,"I find it interesting to read the history of trends and technology that have impacted our lives, enjoy it even more when it is delivered in energetic and amusing fashion. Beyond the ""butterfly effect"" wherein the interaction of the air of the flap of wings of a butterfly in California, say, leads to the formation of a storm in the Atlantic. While this is an interesting aspect of chaos theory, the author prefers the ""hummingbird effect"" where the changes in on thing can be directly linked to another like the role of pollen on hummingbird flight patterns and wing development. This effect the author puts to use to describe ""strange chains of influence"" where ""innovation or cluster of innovations, in one field ends up triggering changes that seem to belong to a different domain altogether."" An example is the development of printing by Gutenberg leads to the availability of books which leads to an awareness of a need for spectacles to see small items clearly which leads to the development of artisans working glass and the development of specialized lenses which leads to microscopes and telescopes which leads to advancements in science and health which reverberate today. Johnson analyses 6 major areas of development glass, cold, sound, clean, time and light. The book is full of interesting anecdotes - the New Englander who thought he could make a fortune delivering ice to the tropics only to find once he got there that no one wanted it. Or the Frenchman who invented a method of recording sound long before Edison's phonograph and who would be honored today but for one problem - he forgot about playback! The author posits that most inventions tend to arise in clusters based on where current practice and technology exist in the ""adjacent possible"". But he also notes that some ""time travelers"" are able to develop ideas long before they can be put to practical use a la Babbage and his analytical engine and Ada Lovelace's designs for computer programming, DaVinci and his helicopters, etc. The book is well illustrated, moves at a rapid clip and is an amusing and educational read."
7,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5591839-radwa,4,"Bookclub pick by: Good Mythical Morning book club.The most important thing with nonfiction books like this one is to learn something new, and that's what happened after reading this book.This book takes a different approach, as Johnson calls it ""The Hummingbird effect"" which is different from the butterfly effect, as in he looks at inventions that had their effect on other innovations in completely different fields, in an almost not intentional or intentional way. He also talks about some of the non-standard inventions like glass and time and clean, or approaches some well-established inventions in a new way that is new and refreshing like light and sound and cold. Of course, the book as it says in the introduction looks solely on the way these innovations affected and came about in the US and Europe. so the ""we"" in the title is actually more about how Americans and Europeans innovated these ideas or made any progress with them. The only drawback is that he doesn't mention how some of the innovations came to being first in some other places like Asia or some Arabian country. I enjoyed this book, the info and little pictures that came with it, and Johnson's style is really smooth and introduces new information and historical facts with so much ease. Highly recommended. "
8,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World by Steven Johnson“How We Got to Now"" is a fascinating history on how six major innovations caused strange chains of influence. Contributing editor to Wired magazine and best-selling author of seven books, Steven Johnson, provides the readers with a real treat. Brilliant storytelling and a keen eye for patterns of intersection of science and technology results in a wonderful reading experience. This captivating 304-page book includes the following six chapters/innovations: 1. Glass, 2. Cold, 3. Sound, 4. Clean, 5. Time, and 6. Light. Positives:1.	Great science writing. It’s well researched, enlightening and a pleasure to read. 2.	Fascinating topic, how innovations are connected and the strange chains of influence resulting from them.3.	Excellent format. Each chapter covers a specific innovation. The prose is smooth and informative. Johnson is a gifted storyteller.4.	Great use of photos and visual material to complement the excellent narration.5.	A recurring theme throughout the book, “Innovations usually begin life with an attempt to solve a specific problem, but once they get into circulation, they end up triggering other changes that would have been extremely difficult to predict.” It’s what the author refers to as the “hummingbird effect”.6.	The focus of the book is on how the changes came about. 7.	Love how science, history and technology are weaved into great storytelling. “After years of trial and error, experimenting with different chemical compositions, the Murano glassmaker Angelo Barovier took seaweed rich in potassium oxide and manganese, burned it to create ash, and then added these ingredients to molten glass. When the mixture cooled, it created an extraordinarily clear type of glass. Struck by its resemblance to the clearest rock crystals of quartz, Barovier called it cristallo. This was the birth of modern glass.”8.	Enlightening tidbits throughout. “In the monasteries of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, monks laboring over religious manuscripts in candlelit rooms used curved chunks of glass as a reading aid.”9.	What propelled the modern self? Find out.10.	An interesting look at ice. “This was Tudor’s frugal genius: he took three things that the market had effectively priced at zero—ice, sawdust, and an empty vessel—and turned them into a flourishing business.” Cool stuff.11.	A fascinating look at the history of Chicago. “The conventional story about Chicago is that it was made possible thanks to the invention of the railroad and the building of the Erie Canal. But those accounts tell only part of the story. The runaway growth of Chicago would have never been possible without the peculiar chemical properties of water: its capacity for storing and slowly releasing cold with only the slightest of human interventions.”12.	A look at simultaneous inventions. “One of those simultaneous inventors was the French engineer Ferdinand Carré, who independently designed a refrigeration machine that followed the same basic principles as Gorrie’s.”13.	What is the connection between telephones and the building of skyscrapers? Find out.14.	The invention of the vacuum tube. “Over the next decade, engineers at Bell Labs and elsewhere modified his basic three-electrode design, removing the gas from the bulb so that it sealed a perfect vacuum, transforming it into both a transmitter and a receiver. The result was the vacuum tube, the first great breakthrough of the electronics revolution, a device that would boost the electrical signal of just about any technology that needed it.”15.	An interesting history of clean. “It is a well-known story that the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis was roundly mocked and criticized by the medical establishment when he first proposed, in 1847, that doctors and surgeons wash their hands before attending to their patients.”16.	Great insights into the development of measuring time. “KEEPING PROPER TIME IS ULTIMATELY all about finding—or making—things that oscillate in consistent rhythms: the sun rising in the sky, the moon waxing and waning, the altar lamp, the quartz crystal. The discovery of the atom in the early days of the twentieth century—led by scientists such as Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg—set in motion a series of spectacular and deadly innovations in energy and weaponry: nuclear power plants, hydrogen bombs.”17.	Interesting insights on why Thomas Edison gets the credit for the light bulb.18.	The “mystery” behind flash photography and the tool it provided that led to a grand movement of social reform.19.	The history of neon lights and bar codes and its impact.20.	Notes and a formal bibliography. Negatives:1.	I would have added a timeline to show how these six innovations intersected. 2.	Those who saw the documentary will not find anything particularly different from the book. In summary, this book was a real treat; it’s beautifully written and quite enlightening. Steve Johnson selects six basic innovations that have impacted the world and does a wonderful job of showing how they went beyond just solving the initial intended problem. I can’t recommend this gem enough!

There's also a PBS series that brings it to life, but the book by itself is great. "
10,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,An odd reading experience for me in that it felt like I was reading this short book for a month and yet I read it within a week. And while I liked the general concept and a couple of its ideas I was disappointed by its sweeping superficiality. It was like visiting those foreign lands at EPCOT - sort of interesting but lacking in depth (not nearly what it’s made out to be).The book was written in conjunction with the PBS series by the same name but I couldn’t escape the feeling that it was thrown together later to capitalize on the popularity of the show. Maybe the series is similarly lacking in depth; I didn’t see it and have no desire to do so.The opening chapter about glass was the book’s best section and was merely okay while the final chapter about light was a complete slog. Anyone interested in a better discussion about Frederic Tudor (covered in the second chapter “Cold”) may consider reading “The Frozen Water Trade” (by Gavin Weightman).Edit - Some reviewers panned this book and praised “Connections” (by James Burke) as a much better alternative. I have to vigorously disagree. While I disliked this book I found “Connections” to be borderline unreadable for its overly sweeping historical analysis and mind-numbingly dense descriptions of how things worked.
11,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59722693-reem,5,"A must read book!It's very interesting to look for the origins of things.Johnson discussed in his book six innovations, started with glass, cold, sound, clean then time and light.And he spotlighted the development of each one Until it reached what it is now.....I love this quote at the end of book."" Don't be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinkingDon't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your inner voice and most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.""❤"
12,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7858123-phil,2,"I guess I will be the black sheep and give this one a bad review :)The good news is that the stories about technological innovations are fascinating. The author (as advertised) draws several interesting connections between seemingly unrelated technologies, and points out several cases where the environment and context of the invention played a much larger role in its success than the genius of the inventor.So what's not to like? For me, the problem is the commentary between these anecdotes. The themes are interesting at first, but one can only hear about the ""long view"" and ""adjacent possible"" so many times. There is commentary between every story about innovation. Every. single. one. Sometimes it overplays a story that didn't need to be overplayed, sometimes it is repetitive, and sometimes it simply doesn't add any new insight. By the end of the book I was trying to skip these passages.Overall there is great information, but a frustrating presentation. I'm reading this book for fun so the latter issue tips it towards a bad review for me."
13,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"How We Got to Now is a reasonably entertaining and easy to read survey of six topics which shaped the world we live in now, in various ways. The main benefit is that Johnson tries to look across disciplines and from different angles, and tries to capture the whole of the picture. The six topics he picked make sense: glass, (artificial) cold, (the understanding of) sound, hygiene, time (and the accuracy thereof) and (artificial) light — they’re summarised under six headings: glass, cold, sound, clean, time, light. That does sound a little odd with the title, since sound is hardly something we invented. Nonetheless, he makes good points about the way science and technology surrounding those topics has made our modern lives what they are.Not world-shattering, but entertaining enough!Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
14,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15450606-tawney,4,"I received this book compliments of Riverhead Books through the Goodreads First Reads program.In the late 1970's James Burke hosted a television show called Connections in which he demonstrated how one innovation led to another in a seemingly unrelated way. Steven Johnson's How We Got To Now, which is the companion book to his PBS programs, quickly reminded me of that earlier series. Thankfully it is less frenetic and more focused. Johnson has chosen to explore the importance of six topics and unravel the journey of each to Now. While the current outbreak of Ebola has highlighted the importance of sanitation, most of the time we take Clean for granted. The same is true of Glass, Cold, Sound, Time and Light. We utilize the discoveries and refinements made possible by hard work, networking, accident, serendipity. Innovations don't leap from out of the blue and they lead to unintended consequences, good, bad, in between, and they lead to change. The stories of How We Got To Now are lively and often surprising, with a cast of familiar and unfamiliar names. Johnson ties it together with some general observations on how innovations occur. The book is well illustrated, includes a bibliography and apparently will include notes, index and credits (the ARC is lacking these)."
15,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8093511-patricia,5,"Fascinating! The author looks at the topics of glass, cold, sound, clean, time and light and explains how one discovery led to others, with very unpredictable results. For example, the invention of the printing press led to more books which led to more people realizing they needed spectacles which led to an improvement of the glassmaking process to make corrective lenses which led to the invention of microscopes which opened a new world to scientists studying disease. Sometimes many inventors work on similar ideas at the same time - other times an inventor may make a huge leap by getting ideas from different disciplines. I really enjoyed the book and I think I will watch the PBS series now."
16,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2530249-phil-simon,5,"Johnson again paints a rich tapestry of innovation, much of it unexpected and not linear. His stories often begin in odd places before they coalesce. I've enjoyed just about all of his books and this one is no exception. I was familiar with a few of the stories (Babbage, Edison) but certainly not all of them. This book is informative and very enjoyable to read. "
17,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/991644-mark-bao,4,"4.5 stars. Glass, which started as a novelty and an ornament, exploded when the printing press, a coevolutionary/symbiotic factor, created a desire to read more, but also exposed the fact that many people were farsighted and needed glasses. The economic incentive to produce glasses led to improvements and discoveries in glass, leading to the development of microscopes and biology, and the invention of fiber optics which is at the backbone of the internet today.The key idea in this book is that inventions and discoveries are, by nature, networked, and exhibit what Johnson calls the ""hummingbird effect"". Each discovery expands what Stuart Kauffman calls the ""adjacent possible"", the scope of possibilities now unlocked by that new discovery. This adjacent possible is sometimes combined with other factors that allow for coevolution and symbiosis, like how flowers offered more nectar to incentivize increased pollination, which caused hummingbirds to evolve wings that allowed them to extract nectar while floating in air. Many times, this constitutes the engine of invention and discovery. Glass is certainly the most convincing case.• Cold caused innovations in preservation and, Johnson argues, a migration to hotter climates that air conditioning enabled, causing political changes due to retirees moving to the South.• Sound led to a sort of liberation for African–American culture through jazz, sonar, and ultrasound.• Clean led to the all-important germ theory and a healthier populace. • Time led to an industrial society and computers, and this is where Johnson reiterates that ""our ability to measure things turned out to be as important as our ability to make them"" (176). Our measure of time led to us changing our experience of our lives to be set within the grid of hours.• Light, which was attributed to Edison mostly because he knew how to market and he built a better product (but did not invent incandescent lights in the first place), led to photography being immensely more useful with flash photography which led to political change, and also led to the importance of lasers in the development of fusion energy.Johnson concludes by saying that the best inventors that tend to see far ahead seem to be ones that cross disciplinary lines and aren't afraid to try something crazy – like what Astro Teller calls the 10% change vs. the 10x change. 10% changes are within disciplines. 10x changes are cross-discipinary.It's clear that this is a really well-written book that is pretty engaging. I finished this (short, 250-page) book in the span of 36 hours, and everything was extremely understandable and couched in laymen's terms. Certainly, the ""long lens"" that he takes to the historical impact of innovations makes for a great narrative. The real benefit of this book is that Johnson talks about these innovations in a way that explains exactly how they're relevant in the real world, and he puts this overarching model of invention and discovery over it, one that is evolutionary and a sort of genealogy, which ties the innovations together conceptually. Finally, he extends his model of discovery and invention to what it means for policy: if we understand that invention and discovery is done as a network, collaboratively, then we should advocate more liberal, not stronger, patent laws. It's an extremely coherent narrative that is as informative as it is entertaining.However, it suffers from uncontrolled expectations. The Glass example was so good and fitting and overarching that each of the four following innovations, up until Light, made it difficult to follow up. It seemed to follow the format of a term paper: present your second-best idea up front, followed by some of the more duller ideas, and then go out with your best one. The best and second-best seemed to be reverse in this narrative, which felt like Glass promised some great things that the rest of the chapters failed to quite deliver up to. That's not to discount the innovations that he talks about – they could have just been way more hard-hitting.Finally, it also suffers from the common problem that plagues nonfiction books of this ilk, which comes from the need to weave a narrative and from historical look-back format of this book: historical revisionism. Sadly, Johnson makes no reference to the problem of revisionism, and general readers won't make the attempt to go into the primary sources to validate whether some of Johnson's pivotal points, like the economic engine of people needing eyeglasses due to the printing press caused an explosion in glass production, are actually true or not. So, readers should take a skeptic's perspective to this book, as with any book on history as longitudinal as this one.All in all, this book inspired me to be one of the makers that contribute to the path of discovery and be a part of the combinatorial hummingbird effect of invention, in the hopes that our collective human work will lead to a second volume of this book a few hundred years from now, perhaps subtitled ""Six More Innovations That Made The Modern World."""
18,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5363453-kimberly,4,Completely fascinating look at how we got to today. I was enthralled reading about innovations and inventions through the lens of the butterfly effect. The only thing keeping this book from reaching a 5 for me is because I often got lost in the science jargon. It frequently took me a moment to reorient myself to what was being talked about. 
19,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,5,"What does the printing press have to do with germ theory? How did glass give rise to the selfie? And what’s the deal with time? If you are wondering about the answers to these questions then you’re going to want to pick up How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World. It’s a brief but comprehensive book, covering a wide range of topics in just enough depth to give the reader a glimpse into how the technology of today is rooted in some pretty basic and amazing discoveries.The book’s premise is that there is a thing called the hummingbird effect. According to the author, the hummingbird effect is defined as, “An innovation, or cluster of innovations, in one field ends up triggering changes that seem to belong to a different domain altogether. Hummingbird effects come in a variety of forms.” He goes on to say that, “This may sound, at first blush, like a variation of the famous ‘butterfly effect’ from chaos theory……. But in fact, the two are fundamentally different. The extraordinary (and unsettling) property of the butterfly effect is that it involves a virtually unknowable chain of causality…..” but with the hummingbird effect the link is clear.So basically, things are linked in a linear fashion and one discovery has led, through a chain of events, to what we have and use in the modern world. There actually aren’t that many “lightbulb” moments in the world of discovery. Instead, most inventions are made using the networks/systems model. So, if person A didn’t discover something, then chances are someone else would have because most technologies were being worked on and tinkered with by many people, not just one. Not only that, but many inventions that “made it” are a result of a good invention and good marketing – some inventions actually came a lot earlier than we thought, only never heard about them because their inventors were terrible at promoting the product or finding a market for it at the time. As for the “lightbulb” moments, they were generally accidents and not intentional, so those people were just plain lucky in that their mistakes worked out.I must say, I learned a lot from this book. It’s broken down into six chapters – glass, cold, sound, clean, time, and light – and each starts with a simple invention that was revolutionary at the time and follows its direct links to what we have today. It blends both the fun and weird backstories of the inventors themselves with the science that went into into their products (whether intentional or not). Each chapter is independent of the others so you can either read the entire book or read one chapter at a time over a longer period.

20,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254805-bob-h,5,"This is a brilliant, but simply-written, story of where our civilization is now, or at least, six of the things we take for granted: glass, cold (refrigeration and more), sound, clean (that is to say, cleanliness), time, light.Some of it seems fairly obvious: glass, of course, and the profound changes it would cause once people could make it -- a printing press meant more with eyeglasses which people could read by, not to mention lenses for microscopes and telescopes with which to study everything from bacteria to the cosmos. Johnson also shows us the subtler changes glass wrought in society, fiber-optics in our day, and the surprising effect of the simple mirror, when it appeared.So it is with refrigeration, and the author shows us its first beginnings in cutting and transporting ice from wintry climes over long distances, and its surprising commercial success in the 19th Century. We learn about the inventors, Clarence Birdseye -- who would pioneer methods of freezing and transporting food, and keep it appetizing -- and Willis Carrier, whose work in air conditioning would spark major population movements and economies.We learn about sound, and the minds that advanced it: Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Lee De Forest, and Bell Labs, all well-known but it's still a fascinating story. The author shows how their inventions built on previous, if incomplete, tinkering -- and, just as important, the marketing of these new technologies, which could advance some inventors and stymie others.We get a lesson in urban planning with cleanliness, for we see how cities could not grow without potable water and efficient sewage systems, or effluent-borne disease -- typhoid, cholera and such -- would impose its own deadlly limits. We see that level sites like Chicago, where drainage would be difficult, would require inventive new engineering to make the cities livable -- along with artificial light. Johnson shows us how fast we've come from whale-oil lanterns to neon, the laser and the bar-code scanner. And in these last two chapters we learn how invention builds on invention -- even Edison's light bulb would only be the ultimate try at a practical (and marketable) light bulb.In all, it's a truly fascinating story of what underpins our lives today, and a lucid, easy-to-follow explanation of the science, urban planning, marketing and sociology behind it. That Johnson can muster this much science and make it understandable, intriguing and relevant says much for his literary quality -- not just his science.Highest recommendation."
21,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1840662-leslie,5,"This was a fascinating look at innovation and discovery. Concentrating on just six areas – glass, cold, sound, clean, time, light – and using what he calls the “hummingbird effect,” the author demonstrates how discoveries build upon one another and bring about changes in seemingly unrelated areas, leading us in directions we never imagined.For example, glass: before the 15th century, most people were farsighted and never knew it; most couldn’t read and had no need to see tiny shapes formed into words. Therefore, spectacles remained rare and expensive items. The invention of the printing press changed that when it brought the written word to the masses, creating a market for spectacles. People began experimenting with lenses; microscopes, telescopes, and cameras were invented, creating a multitude of new discoveries in the sciences as a result.The author discounts the lone genius theory where one person magically came up with an idea and “invented” it. He demonstrates how most innovations were collaborations. An example was the light bulb: multiple individuals were working on developing a light bulb, and many “invented” it, but the person known for the light bulb was the one whose bulb outperformed the others and was most successful in bringing it to market. And that was Thomas Edison.I could babble on a lot about this book and how much I enjoyed it. But instead I’m going to encourage you to give this a read or a listen and have fun learning about how all the things we take for granted became part of our daily lives. And no, you do not need to know one bit about science to enjoy this – just curiosity about the world around us.Audio production:I can be a bit of a science nerd and once I started reading this I didn’t want to stop and switched between audio and print so I could keep going. The audio was competently read by George Newbern in a very listenable but documentary-like style. For those who prefer the visual, there were some very cool drawings, photos, and illustrations that make having a print copy worth while. But in either format it was an enjoyable read."
22,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59633249-debsd,4,"An accessible, interesting and well-written book which reminded me very much of the Connections series that James Burke wrote and presented in the late 1970s. There's the same method of choosing a subject and taking it for a walk through history, technological advances, human endeavour, imagination and frailty. Johnson does an excellent job of walking the line between ""too technical"" and ""talking down to the reader""."
23,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/958157-abby,5,"This book is an extremely fascinating look at key innovations and the many ways they shaped our modern world. Johnson does an amazing job of explaining complex paradigm shifts in technology and culture, blending different elements into a cohesive narrative. It was especially interesting to discover how the 'adjacent possible' opened the door for change and how most inventions emerged from networks of people, incremental changes and were invented simultaneously in various different areas around the same moments in history. In particular, the sections based around 'Glass' and 'Time' I found to be very mind-blowing. Such a cool look at a lot of items in modern life that we take for granted."
24,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14698328-gruia,2,"A rushed birth this was: great book in chapter one (Glass), feels more and more rushed with each incoming chapter. The principal idea is highlighted early - new technology creates fresh needs (abundance of books kickstarts optical science) and has unexpected lateral effects. After that the text is concerned with reinforcing the idea by repeating it over and over with examples, interspersed with inspirational passages.One thing of note in the latter part is the recognition of Thomas Edison not as an inventor per se, but as the creator of the modern R&D department."
25,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,Kind of like the old book connections and any other history of invention book you've read. Not one of Stephen Johnson's better works. A little too lightweight on the treatment of the history of invention.1/10/2016  Actually on second reading. It is a little better than I thought. But it is still kind of short.
26,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10232829-tammy,5,"Johnson brings the history of civilization to life through 6 seemingly common and simple innovations. It's easy to read and Johnson's writing style is engaging and interesting. Want to look at our modern world in a fresh way, this will do it. "
27,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"In How We Got to Now, Steven Johnson explores what he calls the “hummingbird effect.” In chaos theory the butterfly effect describes the way that one seemingly insignificant event can, through the unfathomable interconnections of complex systems, create a major event elsewhere that appears to be unconnected. The hummingbird effect, on the other hand, describes the way that one innovation can lead to a series of other innovations in a variety of fields, and even to changes in culture. And unlike the butterfly effect, with the hummingbird effect you can see how one thing leads to the next. In this book Johnson illuminates this idea by tracing these connections. One clear and simple example is the following: The invention of the printing press led, of course, to a greater dissemination of information and the creation of a more educated public, but through the hummingbird effect it also led to an increased demand for reading glasses, this led to the creation and growth of the lens making industry, this led to the invention of both microscopes and telescopes which led to all sorts of results from the Hubble telescope to the creation of modern medicine. Johnson follows a collection of seemingly simple innovations to their sometimes surprising and earth changing results. This book is interesting and thought provoking, but sometimes Johnson takes things too far. I knew this would be the case right at the beginning when he claimed that the renaissance was a result of the invention of mirrors. Too far!!! I also disagree that the South became a Republican stronghold because the invention of air conditioning permitted heat hating Northern Republicans to move south of the Mason-Dixon line (the political realignment had much more to do with the shifting politics of the Republican and Democratic parties. As the South became Republican the North became Democratic, even though Southerners didn’t move north in great numbers.)Johnson bases a lot of his conclusions on flimsy evidence, but that’s okay. This is a book that is designed to provoke thought and to get you to look at the world in a new way. In these objectives it is very successful. Arguing with the book as you read it is just part of the fun."
28,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28116714-shane-garland,4,"Interesting but very broad account of a few of the most important concepts that have advanced the world. He does claim there are 6 innovations which is a bit misleading, because they are more of general ideas (ie light, cold, time) which encompass a large amount of technologies. Instead of focusing on one game changing technology, he gives himself latitude to take a broad view and talk more in general terms."
29,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,3,"How We Got to Now is a funny, accesible, mostly accurate presentation of how networks of inventors, researchers, and innovations have allowed the creation and mass use of certain things that define life in the modern world. Johnson has a gift for weaving together disparate stories from a variety of time periods and disciplines while explaining how those stories create a cohesive and relevant whole. In that sense, I think How We Got to Now is a great book. However, I have a few big problems with history as presented by Johnson for the topics that I more familiar with. For the chapter on cold, which is as about refrigeration and cooling technology, he starts out a New England businessman trying to sell ice in the Carribean in the last two hundred years. There is no mention of the fact that people have been researching cooling technology (with the methods and information available during their respective periods of history) for millenia. The search for better refrigeration is not a post-Renaissance urge, as Johnson would have readers believe. For a better understanding of the history of refrigeration than is presented in How We Got to Now, I suggest Chilled by Tom Jackson.For the chapter on light, most of the focus is on Thomas Edison, which is understandable, as he is credited with inventing the first truly mass-market light bulb. However, Johnson also credits Edison with 'fathering' the modern electrical grid used to power cities, which is untrue. Edison did create some of the first power grids, but he was a champion of direct current eletricity. DC was eventually surpassed and replaced by alternating current electricity (AC), for which have to thank Nikola Tesla. There is a reason why it's Tesla who is nicknamed 'the man who invented the twentieth century,' and Johnson does not give him credit where credit is due. Both of these cause me to wonder just how 'streamlined' the other sections of the book are, which is not a good feeling for a reader to be having after reading a work of nonfiction. I realize that not every bit can be included in books for reasons of space if nothing else, but even a sentence or two would have been enough to fix these two glaring and important omissions that I spotted. For that, I docked How We Got to Now two stars. I like it's tone and how accesible it is to any reader that might pick it up, but I am unlikely to reccomend it to anyone."
30,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66567613-luisa-knight,5,"A completely absorbing merger of science and history! Johnson does a remarkable job of bringing the world of science and invention to life through the historical stories he shares. His insight is astounding. So is his keen ability to show how an invention not only revolutionized its own industry but in some cases changed the world politically, socially, economically, and how it bridged into other unforeseen industries. This alone is enthralling and worth the read.This book is more historical than scientific - so while the author does explain some science, it’s not heady enough to lose readers. Something I appreciated. I highly recommend this book! You’ll be hard pressed not to share all the fascinating tidbits of information you will learn. My husband’s been hearing a bunch of the book’s facts from me for a few days now.Cleanliness: Evolutionary references are mentioned several times throughout the book but not enough to detract from an appreciation of the narrative. At one point the author mentions that the discovery of keeping more accurate time has proven that the biblical story of a young earth is just that, a story.**Like my reviews? Then you should follow me! Because I have hundreds more just like this one.

These were the hackers of the first optical revolution.”—page 21A 'companion-book' to what's shaping up to be an excellent, six-part documentary series on PBS, HOW WE GOT TO NOW: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World, by Steven Johnson stands very well on its own.

Stream and watch the PBS documentary, if you have the chance, too.""We like to organize the world into neat categories: photography goes here, politics there.

32,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18074409-charles-moore,4,"I am getting to like Steven Johnson. This is the second of his I've read the other being ""The Invention of Air."" He does remind me a lot of James Burke whose ""Connections"" sparked a whole sub-genre of technical-science history like Johnson's and was also acclaimed on PBS. Johnson uses six examples of change and adaptions (versus Burke's more narrowly defined linear steps) as their routes bounce around, hesitate, or lurch forward. He makes the interesting connection between a rogue water-cleaning experiment in New Jersey to the increase in public swimming pools to the rise (?) of the bikini! I like that he reminds us in ""Light"" that in about only 150 years we've gone from a dark world to an overly lighted world and so many diversions along the way thanks to light. What also makes this interesting is that he combines the social improvements (light gets us reading gets us education) not just end products. He thankfully on mentions Steve Jobs only once or twice and ""Silicon Valley"" never, I think.Sometimes these technical-history books are a bit brief and shallow. I can't tell which this is but I know that for the most part we're better off reading them and trying to keep technology as a process rather than product.###"
33,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27258720-neal,2,"This book had a tremendous amount of potential given that there are so many stories and dots to connect when it comes to the history of innovation. This book aimed to focus on the stream of innovations that emerged from a key innovation occurring at the right time ... even if the key elements underlying the innovation were not really new. This makes for a really interesting story. My difficulty with the author's approach is that the exposition seems rather random. The connections seem to be based on the ephemera that the author knows rather than the result of deep research and rigorous thought. Having read a fair amount on the history of science, technology and innovation, this comes across as more of a pastiche of more interesting (and harder to read) work. Maybe it's because the book was to be the basis of a TV series and, thus, did not need to be too extensive in its exposition. If you are just curious about innovation and haven't really read anything before, this book will be fine. [Note: I listened to an unabridged audiobook of this book. It was well narrated.]"

Someone discovered how something worked, and it took off and changed the world into how it is today. This was a series I saw on PBS some time ago, so I heard some of it before.  Pretty good book, but all the nuggets of interesting information got buried in too much rhetoric. Succinct is not a word I would use to describe this book. The writing style was to introduce, tell anecdote/trivia, then spend another 50 pages rehashing everything in different words. Over and over. I'd get about halfway through a chapter and skip to the next one. Seriously, if this book was half as long, it would be 5 stars.  So, interesting but very wordy. Perhaps watching the whole series on TV would cut the content down a bit. Yeah, probably. Go watch the series. It's probably on PBS.Also, half a star deducted for talking about Edison in glowing terms with no mention of Tesla. Booo!! HISS!!!"
35,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225357-kyle,4,"I've been known to wax poetically about Johnson, so it comes as no surprise that I really enjoyed How We Got to Now, his new book that focuses on six case studies of how things we take for granted changed the world: glass (telescopes, microscopes, fiber optics, eyes glasses), cold (refrigeration, air conditioning), sound (radar, ultrasound), time (increased precision in measuring time), light (light bulbs, neon signs, encoding data with light), and clean (improving sanitary conditions).In the first chapter alone (the one focused on glass) Johnson managed to press all my buttons as he discussed the glass makers of Murano (been there, loved it), the observatories at the top of Mauna Kea (stargazed there), and Diego Velázquez's Las Meninas (my favorite painting). I'm also looking forward to watching the companion PBS series Johnson hosted. "

I didn't know about the PBS series because I live in Japan, but I think I will track down some clips. I am thinking of using this book with a freshman class in a Japanese university; it's fairly easy to read and the chapters are not too long, but they are filled with ideas for class discussion and topics for students to research on for class presentations."
37,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8486961-iamreddave,4,Great book on six technologies that make the modern world tick. Johnson is a great writer and I must get some of his other books. If you like big history of the 'Guns germs and Steel' type this is just your sort of thing. Two similar books I have read recently is the more linear 'Centuries of Change' by Ian Mortimer and the less linear 'Stranger than we can imagine' by Higgs. That might help you pick your next read based on how odd you like your history.

The book becomes verbose near the end, as if Johnson struggles to convey what readers can do with the information laid out in earlier chapters, but is still worth a read even if it has no practical application... simply for the joy of understanding more deeply how our world came to be."

There was certainly some of that, but mostly it was a chain reaction story--this led to that and without glass there wouldn't be microfiber and without that telephones etc. It was fascinating, but not all I hoped it would be.

In its scientific commentary on convergence of ideas, the exploration of the events or innovations that directly related to the development of larger, more progressive inventions—what Johnson calls the the adjacent possible, How We Got to Now is fascinating, expansive, and (strangely enough) beautiful. There's a tone from Johnson that reflected my amazement at what and when certain people seemed to be ahead of the idea game. Whole sections devoted to large (sometimes unfathomably so) subjects—Glass, Cold, Sound, Clean, Time, Light—but presented almost conversationally, as if you were sitting, front and center, in a class led by this man as your professor. What he does, Johnson does very well here. I could read multiple volumes of this kind of book. Don't miss out and make the mistake of skipping either the Introduction (subtitled: Robot Historians and the Hummingbird's Wing) or the Conclusion (subtitled: The Time Travelers), as they both are as essential and engrossing as any of the other given chapters."

To compare man’s inventions to macro evolution is ludicrous. Advances in technology take an incredible amount of intelligence, information, and design. To claim that the hummingbird devised a special way of flying with no information or intelligence can only have one explanation—willing ignorance (2 Peter 3:5)!! To state that carbon dating proves the Biblical account of creation is a myth is ridiculous. To get thousands of years from carbon dating or millions of years from other types of radiometric dating, you have to assume that you know how much of the element you started with, and that it breaks down at the constant rate visible today. Both of those assumptions cannot be proven. What makes a lot more sense is to believe that an intelligent designer created this world with its amazing components. Oh, and by the way, the Intelligent Designer put silicon dioxide (used to make glass/lenses) on this earth so we could discover our world!!"
47,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32014570-elizabeth,3,"I received this book free in a First Reads Giveaway. I would recommend it to anyone that likes learning about anything. It is written at a level suitable for teens through adults with no prior knowledge of history, science, invention, etc... necessary. Science is not my forte and I was able to follow easily the developments Johnson wrote on because they were explained simply (and because almost all of them are part of everyday life). If you're looking for a rock solid, evidenced journey from point A to point B to point C this isn't what you'll find. It's impossible to know how history may have been different without one person or one invention because we only have the one version. Johnson (most of the time) connects the dots well. Sometimes these connections are a bit far flung but all are probable and the majority are probably correct. I'll be passing my copy on so others can have a bit of light-hearted nerdiness. "
48,1594632960,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6546332-ms-wendy-b,5,"An Interesting and well-written book about invention/innovation. Most books I’ve read on this topic have focused upon on a particular individual and the specifics of the invention, whereas this title explores the bigger picture of innovation. Chapters are organized around phenomena: glass, cold, sound, heat, time, and light, examining how multi-disciplinary advancements and numerous individuals enabled significant technologies that changed society. The discussion of “hummingbird effects” — unintended but spin-off social, political, and cultural impacts of various innovations — was particularly thought-provoking. This book would be an excellent read for high school teachers and students prior to an inquiry-based learning project since it essentially discusses the underpinnings of inquiry-based learning: multi-disciplinary approaches to problem-solving, the necessities of failure(s) before success, and the unforeseen consequences that might arise from an innovation."

All of these innovations came about from people who were working in many disciplines, or from teams of people with different areas of specialty. I've recently had several conversations with students about needed to stand out in the crowd of industrial design students, and one way is to embrace learning, hobbies, talents, whatever.

He came closely up to it when describing stenography. But it seems music, and the writing down of specific notes that are symbols for specific sounds would have been a more apt piece of his discussion."

It is as much, if not more, about the interconnectedness between everything than about the individual inventions. Author, Steven Johnson, explores the myriad of origins for bright ideas recognizing the role of chance and timing in addition to creativity and problem solving. The content of the book gives you pause to reflect on the impact of innovation on our lives while also the implications for those who lived without them. I learned far more than I expected to."

There are concepts in this book that I’ll reference in my daily life. Concepts like the hummingbird effect, the adjacent possible, and time traveler innovation.I would recommend this, especially if you are craving interesting quips during quarantine. "

Some of these stories are a bit too familiar in this genre. All serious biographers of computer science have told the Ada Lovelace story, many of them better than told here. Overall very well written, but not as deep or insightful as others in the genre. "

It looks at how new scientific advances can lead to profound changes in seemingly unrelated fields, and to society as a whole. It left me wanting more, and I now have a list of people that I must research further, particularly Ada Lovelace. "

While some sections made me wonder about over generalization, the writing and history kept me eager to hear more. And some of that more isn’t in the book. Alexander Graham Bell’s use of a cadaver ear makes perfect sense and yet I’ve never heard of it before. It was just a passing fact bomb that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about. Now I have to look for a book on Bell. The reading never ends. "

Johnson is a great narrator and has excellent material to explain scientific advancements in our world and now they came about. He focuses on six topics in particular which we generally take for granted and you learn a lot of new things about how they evolved. The chapters are entitled Clean, Light, Time, Sound, Cold, and Glass.Strongly recommend for science-curious people! The video, too. "
