See, I am a curious little critter, but for a long time, many too specific fields were unreachable, because there was nothing on the market that could help a layman understand such complex fields as chemistry and all that engineering around how things are made. But finally, the rise of entertaining, hard fun, edutainment has begun. The chapters are more like short- stories, interesting tales including history, personal anecdotes, and no chance to ever get boring or too broken down or too complex, the perfect balance, as all things should be.There are some books that deal with everyday things, basics of different fields of science, and they always have the same effect on me. Like good fiction, they open the mind for theories, ideas, inspiration, and, most important, enthusiasm, awe, and mindfulness for the everyday things around us. Of course, there has to be an equilibrium of productive optimization of lifetime and running around enchanted by the smallest grain of anything as if stoned, but we tend to avoid the intuitively deemed unproductive just realizing the world, seeing it as less valuable.But this closes certain gates to creativity and new, fresh impulses because in finding out new facts about and properties and features of things we used to find normal and have seen and used tens of thousands of times, we expand the mind and its potential.What often stuns me the most is that there are so many experts in extremely complex endeavors like building a smartphone or any complex machinery, who are actually just using relatively primitive methods, often, like in pharmacy, just knowing that it works and not exactly why and there are so many still unknown factors, especially in the fields of physics, chemistry, and biology, that will open options that seem unimaginable today. And we are already so far, so highly developed, have so much individual potential that can be unleashed with all that tools and all of it will seem so 21st century anachronistic to future generations.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materia..."

Endless talks of the differing types of ceramics, stress versus strain...zzz.But have no fear because Mark is here. And Mark makes materials science sexy.Stuff Matters brings to life the man-made world around us. Suddenly steel, concrete and paper are fascinating when presented in an intelligent, funny and whimsical way. Materials science textbooks seem to be a collection of phase diagrams stitched together and put between some covers, but there are no phase diagrams here (but I would have loved one for chocolate (6 different crystal structures!(The one we usually experience is structure V, makes a nice snap, high melting point))) )) ) .Yes there is a whole chapter on chocolate. All throughout Mark tells some fascinating tales, both personal and historical, that add to the flavour of the book. He devotes each chapter to a certain material and even these chapters have varying styles. These differing styles mostly worked well, but I did not really appreciate the screenplay on plastics. But altogether a rather fascinating book that should keep most scientifically minded or curious types engrossed and amazed at the materials around us. I had never heard of Mark before now, but the book tells that he has regular TV appearances on UK telly. I'm going to have to keep an eye out. If he is half a good a presenter as a writer it should be some great TV."
2,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"So here you are, sitting on your couch or lying in bed, sipping some tea and reading this review. Imagine that an alien life form suddenly appears, armed with a high tech material-deteriorating gun that is programmed to destroy every man-made material in sight (yeh, I know that's unlikely but just imagine it anyway), aims it at you, and POOF! You are now sitting naked, suspended in mid air, your tablet/laptop gone, your cup of tea gone, the glasses that allow you to read have disappeared. You no longer even have your smartphone to take a picture of this alien, and now no one is going to believe you when you insist that this happened. Instead, you're going to go running outside without a stitch of clothing, the neighbours will call the cops on you, and you will find yourself locked up in a mental ward. Well, that's if the alien doesn't decide to beam you up into its spaceship and perform any number of experiments that will also not be believed by your fellow humans. Sucks, doesn't it? I'm glad I'm not you and glad I've never had the experience of Alien-with-a-Material-Deteriorating-Gun show up in my bedroom. I'm glad the material that makes my life comfortable hasn't been annihilated, and the likelihood of an alien suddenly blasting it all away is pretty much nil. In Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World materials scientist Mark Miodownik talks about nine different materials that are prevalent in our everyday lives and which would be sorely missed if they suddenly disappeared. He talks about their molecular makeup and why they have the properties they do. He answers such questions as:•Why razors become dull and paper clips bend•Why we don't taste the metal of our cutlery•Why chocolate tastes the way it does, which is nothing like a cocoa bean tastes•Why our skin cannot tan through glass•Why elastic is stretchyMr. Miodownik talks about graphene and graphite, aerogel and paper, and several other man-made materials. I especially loved learning about aerogel, which I'd never heard of before and find utterly fascinating. It is amazing how it was first made, why it is the way it is, and what it can be used for. There are so many interesting facts in this book and anyone who enjoys learning about ""things"" will no doubt find this book interesting as well. This book will not, however, tell you what to do if Alien-with-a-Material-Deteriorating-Gun shows up in your room. My suggestion, if you're worried about the above scenario happening, is... Um.... well, never mind, I can't think of one. Rest assured though, it most certainly will not. Your materials will not disappear and you will not have to insist to an unbelieving world that this happened. I'm sorry to have made you worry, but thank you for reading my review anyway.(Aerogel, an ultralight material that is 10X stronger than steel and yet weighs only a tiny bit more than air.

3,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"Picture this:You’re in a lovely antique shop and you’ve just profaned against every law of kinesthetic awareness by tripping over your own feet. You’re committed now. Committed to one of those falls that seems to turn you into a temporal torpedo. You know the ones: You pitch forward, arms outstretched, sometimes windmilling, angled in just such a way that the clumsy aerodynamic qualities of your forehead masticate the surrounding space-time like a Brontosaurus chewing a tough steak, making your stutter stepping feel finite but unbounded. Like you’ll just keep going across the universe until you arrive back at the beginning. Your face red like a Maraschino cherry.If you’ve never experienced one of these infinite fumbles, count yourself lucky.First you shoulder tackle a rack full of pencils, sending a spray of wood and graphite before you like the prow of an abandoned cruiser. You only have a moment to concern yourself over the fact that there were so many writing implements in an antique shop before you’re then spellbound by Van der Waals forces, which allow the layers of graphite to slide against one another and off onto your paper whenever you take a notion to sketch a monster truck vomiting snakes.Congratulating yourself on pirouetting away from the shelf full of precious metals, you imagine their atomic nuclei embedded in a pudding of delocalized electrons, and understand how this property, the free movement of electrons, allows them to be good conductors of heat and electricity. It also makes for malleability, which is damn handy for crafting a katana, a gilded toilet, or the titanium bust of Eratosthenes that makes all visitors to your house feel a vague unease because you’re just not that good with faces. It’s also a source of strength, and they would’ve done a damn sight better at resisting your plyometric assault. They’re also quite sparkly!That’s great and all, but I think we’ve established at this point that you’re not nearly graceful enough to pull off that maneuver without there being consequences. And, sure enough, you do a little compensatory shuffle and bulldoze into a cabinet of expensive china and priceless Fabergé eggs. Shattering covalent and ionic bonds with the cellular fuel you liberated from a partially developed chicken embryo this morning. The breakdown and reassembly of chemical bonds driving you onward like an organic wrecking ball. The mortified owner of the shop calls out:“Notice how the ceramics and glasses shatter along regular lines due to the patterns present in their crystal lattices!”You continue through the exploded shards of history, you smile over your shoulder and toss a thumbs up to this kindly old man who moonlights as a materials scientist, rendering your next collision unavoidable. Lucky for you it’s just a sheet of papyrus, which is held together by microscopic bridges of cellulose called fibrils. You tear through the collective strength of those pithy bastards with a kinetic energy roughly equivalent to a coked out Garry Bussey kick boxing a kindergartner. Unfortunately, this ancient sheet of dead plant matter was positioned in just such a way as to occlude from view a towering slab of self healing concrete.The Proprietor: “As you well know. Concrete is quite stout. But it is prone to weathering and cracking. What we have here is Bioconcrete, which is infused with bacteria that allow for the healing of these structural damages. It’s really quite fascinating!And it would be, if you didn’t painfully ricochet off of it and lose consciousness.How did this all happen? Well, you got really excited about this book you read called Stuff Matters, which reveals the exotic dimensions of matter that go unappreciated in our daily lives. How, according to the fixed rules of electron exchange dictated by the quantized energy shells surrounding atomic nuclei, ‘stuff’ in all it’s myriad forms most wonderful and useful, has come to define our trajectory as a species. Elated by this outlook on life, you skipped merrily into the shop, determined to survey stuff at its most peculiar and precious. Hoping, just maybe, there would be some aerogel, uranium, or anti-matter for sale. You gleefully signal to the man at the counter.“Hi! You wouldn’t ha....”"
4,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,4,"Reading this book brought to my mind a scene from the 1980s British TV comedy “Blackadder III”, set during the Regency. In the scene in question, Blackadder and the Prince Regent discuss a northern industrialist who is visiting London:BLACKADDER: He has patented a machine called the Ravelling Nancy.THE PRINCE REGENT: What does it do?BLACKADDER: It ravels cotton, Sir.THE PRINCE REGENT: What for?BLACKADDER: That I cannot say, Sir. I am one of those people who is quite happy to wear cotton but have no idea how it works.Mark Miodownik’s book doesn’t cover the nature and manufacture of cotton, but he chooses a number of other materials and shares his passion for telling us “how they work”. He bases the book around a photo of himself, and tells the story of 10 materials captured within the photo. These are steel, paper, concrete, foam, plastic, glass, graphite, porcelain and rather oddly I thought, medical implants and chocolate. I say oddly since I’ve never really thought of the last two as “materials”. I get of course that implants are made of a material, and I suppose chocolate is one too. Actually the chapter on chocolate answered something that has puzzled me ever since I made a trip to the USA a number of years ago, and out of curiosity decided to try one of the famous Hershey bars. I thought it was revolting and couldn’t understand why American consumers would buy such a vile tasting product. The author not only explains my reaction but suggests that many Americans would feel the same way about British chocolate.For each chapter the author provides a basic guide to the chemistry involved, as well as a history of the development of the material. For products like concrete and glass he shows how earlier materials have evolved into the high-tech products available today. With steel and porcelain, the story starts with earlier, less complex materials used for the same purposes. The only chapter I didn’t like was the one on plastics. The author wrote this in the style of a fake movie script, which didn’t work for me.This is a good book for the layman, clear and easily comprehensible, and the author manages to convey quite a lot of his own enthusiasm."
5,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,5,"Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World is a nonfiction science book written by materials engineer: Mark Miodownik. I first heard of Stuff Matters after scanning a random list of 2014’s best audiobooks. Figuring I would get a head-start on my 2015 resolution to read more nonfiction, I figured why not? I loved this book! It was absolutely fascinating. Yes, I knew I enjoyed science before reading this book. I took many science-based courses as my “extras” in college just because I found them interesting. But Mr. Miodownik's teaching style blew all of my professors out of the water. If I had him as my professor, I might just have changed my major. His incorporation of personal life experiences and relatable metaphors allowed me to easily grasp all the concepts he referenced. Each chapter in this book focuses on a different material, but my personal favorite was aerogel. I mean, look at this!There are a few types of aerogel in existence but Mr. Miodownik focuses mainly on silica aerogel. It's the world's lightest known solid that can support thousands of times its own weight, with a melting point of over 2,000° F. It has typically been used for the purposes of space exploration, but the possibilities are endless! The fact that someone could develop a material like this blew my mind. Other materials discussed in Stuff Matters includes metal, paper, concrete, chocolate, plastic, glass, graphite, and porcelain. Mr. Miodownik discussed how each material was discovered, how the structure of each material causes it to exist and be useful, how the worlds’ use of each material has evolved past to present through engineering, and the future potential of some of the materials. What was most fascinating (to me anyway) was Mr. Miodownik’s discussion of psychophysics, the study of how humans sensually react to materials. For example, at checkout, some stores package purchases exclusively in paper bags versus plastic (Victoria’s Secret, Yankee Candle, Trader Joe’s, to name a few), which in turn causes many shoppers to feel like they have just embarked on a higher quality shopping experience. But a lot of research went into how consumers respond to the material of paper. The same goes for potato chips. Did you know that there is research devoted only to the sounds of your favorite potato chip packaging? If anything I've commented on thus far has sparked your interest, then Stuff Matters is right up your ally. All I can say is I want to go back to college now... and if I can find more books like this one, my 2015 resolution will be a breeze!My favorite quote:”It is often said that there are very few places left on earth that have yet to be discovered. But those who say this are usually referring to places that exist at the human scale. Take a magnifying glass to any part of your house and you will find a whole new world to explore. Use a powerful microscope and you will find another, complete with a zoo of living organisms of the most fantastic nature. Alternatively, use a telescope and a whole universe of possibilities will open up before you.”"
6,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,"This book has forced me to face the reality that I dislike panoramic popular science so adjust your own expectations accordingly.This is what he had to say about paper:“What is it about paper that allows words to be expressed that might otherwise be kept secret? They are written in a private moment, and as such, paper lends itself to sensual love - the act of writing being one of touch, of flow, of flourish, of sweet asides and little sketches, an individuality that is free from the mechanics of a keyboard. The ink becomes a kind of blood that demands honesty and expression, it pours on to the page, allowing thoughts to flow.”Here’s a thought from my mechanical keyboard - Stick to materials science and leave this sort of soppy writing to the good folks at Harlequin Romance.When he does stick to materials science we get good stuff like this:“This new generation of toughened glass has a layer of plastic in its middle, which acts as a glue keeping all the shards of glass together. This layer, known as a laminate, is also the secret behind bulletproof glass, which is essentially the same technology but with several layers of plastic embedded at intervals within the glass. When a bullet hits the material, the outermost layer of glass shatters, absorbing some of the bullet’s energy and blunting its tip. The bullet must then push the glass shards through the layer of plastic beneath it, which flows like tough treacle, thus spreading the force over a wider area than the point of impact. No sooner has it got through this layer than the blunted bullet encounters another layer of glass, and the process starts all over again.“The more layers of glass and plastic there are, the more energy the bulletproof glass can absorb. One layer of laminate will stop a 9-millimeter pistol bullet, three layers will stop a .44 magnum pistol bullet, eight layers will stop a person with an AK-47 rifle from killing you.”If the author had gone into greater depth on fewer subjects and eliminated his personal ruminations this would have been a great book."
7,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"Yes, it took me almost two years to read this book and I am glad that I didn't rush through it. I am a layperson when it comes to materials science and engineering. That, in some measure, makes me grateful for the person who can explain, using my vocabulary, those concepts and relationships that underlie his professional focus. Miodownik is one of the best I have ever come across, and it is clear that he enjoys talking about it with people like me. ""This book is for those who want to decipher the material world we have constructed and find out where these materials came from, how they work, and what they say about us.""Miodownik looks at: SteelPaperConcreteChocolateFoamPlasticGlassGraphitePorcelainImplantsHe shares history, examples and deeper thoughts about why this all matters. He concludes: ""In a very real way, then, materials are a reflection of who we are, a multi-scale expression of our human needs and desires."" He certainly has convinced me."

9,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"In my head there is a spectrum of interestingness for science that runs from geology to the really weird bits of physics. I have never yet found a popular science writer, however good, who can make geology truly interesting, while something like quantum physics is so fascinating (and strange) that it takes little effort to make it fascinating (though it’s hard to make it comprehensible). Materials science – what I call ‘how stuff works’ when talking to junior school children generally sits near to geology on that spectrum. But Mark Miodownik has managed the near-impossible and made it a deeply enjoyable read.I thought things were going to be a bit dire when he starts with the story of how he was attacked as a teen with a razor blade on the London Underground and developed a fascination with the nature of metal, an opinion that wasn’t helped by the rather self-indulgent approach of basing the book around a photograph of the author sitting on his roof terrace. But very soon the superb storytelling took over and we were into the fascinating world of Bessemer and the making of steel. In fact so well are the stories told throughout the book that the author’s photograph of himself becomes an old friend and interesting as a focus. It really works.The book has ten sections, covering metals, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam (particularly aerogel), plastic, glass, graphite, porcelain and rather bizarrely ‘implant’ covering both bones and artificial items in the body like screws. These are all delightful excursions into the subjects with plenty of diversions along the way.Two of the sections, paper and plastic, are weaker than the other because Miodownik decided to try a different format for the chapter. Paper has very little content (which is perhaps why he used this approach), consisting primarily of two page spreads describing different types of paper which gets a little repetitive. Plastic is done in the form of a film script (to reflect the importance of plastic film to moving pictures), but this seemed rather strained. Miodownik is also loose with the facts in stating that ‘the biggest diamond yet discovered… is an entire planet five times the Earth.’ That’s not science. All we know is that a star’s variation suggests a companion that has the right sort of density to possibly be mostly diamond. However these blips don’t damage the book’s integrity.Overall a delightful book on a subject that is relatively rarely written about – you could say the cinderella of the sciences. You will discover facts you didn’t know, how basic but important elements of our lives like cement or chocolate work at the structural level – and along the way will enjoy some excellent storytelling.

10,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"Good book, cool but a little skimpy. Not quite up to the hype.	3.5 stars, rounded up. Read 6-2014."
11,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"Almost everything we touch has had some form of human interaction to change it from one form to another. Some of these interactions are simple, involving the changing of the shape and form, others are much more complex and involve heat and chemical interaction. Using a photo of himself drinking a coffee and eating a bar of chocolate, Miodownik takes us through a range of different materials that you are likely to come across every day, such as glass, steel, plastics, concrete, paper and even chocolate.Each chapter takes one aspect of he picture, for example the steel legs of the table, and then he explores the social and historical detail behind the material, from how it was mined, how they used it way back in history, as well as the technological advances that happen to make the material what it is today. Some of the material he writes about are not what you would expect, chocolate for example, but in this he explains some of the chemical processes that are used to change the bitter, fibrous beans to the seductive food that is chocolate. Paper too is an unusual choice, but when you think about it, this is a material that meant that people no longer needed to rely on oral traditions and could communicate with words and drawings and pictures. There was never a plastic age, as we have had a stone age and iron age in the past, but I think that you could safely classify the post war years in that way. The first plastics were nitrocellulose, and were used to replace Ivory billiard balls, where as now we have a whole raft of plastic types to choose from, and they can be formed and moulded in many ways. Glass to is an amazing substance. As bill Bryson said in Notes from a Small Island: call me obtuse, but you could stand me on a beach till the end of time and never would it occur to me to try to make it into windows. And it is an amazing material. Naturally fragile, it can be made much tougher by tempering it or by adding thin layers of plastic it becomes bullet proof. Concrete, like glass was a material that the Romans had, whilst they didn’t have the fine control and understanding that the modern chemists and engineers have, they knew how to build with it, so much so that the Pantheon still is the largest unreinforced dome in the world and it is 2000 years old.A morning coffee wouldn’t be the same with out a cup to drink it out of, and Miodownik looks at the history of china and porcelain. The finest porcelains were perfected by the Chinese who had almost transparent cups. After the Europeans stole the technology from them, we developed our own industry here using China clay mined in Cornwall. Other material include carbon, available in the ludicrously expensive form of diamond and the much cheaper, and more useful form of graphite. Miodownik is well qualified to write this too, he is Professor of Materials at UCL, and his boundless enthusiasm for any and all materials comes across vividly in this book, just like you would see him on the telly in fact. Even though he is vastly experienced and knowledgeable, this is a popular science book, and really does not go into a huge amount of depth on each subject. The writing style is chatty, which will annoy some people no doubt, and I am not sure who convinced him that doing the chapter on plastics as a play would work, because it doesn’t. All that said, this is a good introduction to the things that we see, use, sit on, write with and drink from every day; 3.5 stars though."
12,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is an entertaining, engaging book about many of the everyday--and rare--materials that are in our world. Some of the materials occur naturally like diamond and coal. But the majority of materials discussed in the book are man-made, and Mlodownik makes them all sound fascinating! He describes steel, plastic, chocolate, glass, ceramics, silicon chips, graphene, elastic, graphite, paper, concrete, silverware and porcelain. And even though most of these materials seem so mundane, Miodownik has a gift of telling their stories in an entertaining way.My favorites? Well, at the top of the list is silicon aerogel, a man-made material that has remarkable properties. As you can see in the picture below, it is translucent, as it is composed 98% of air. But it is strong, and is a fantastic heat insulation. Note in the picture that the matches are sitting on a circular disk, supported by a translucent rectangular plate that seems to have no edges. The heat of the blow torch does not reach the matches! The chapter about chocolate is also very interesting, as it is produced in a complex process. Graphene is very interesting, too, as is the discussion about isotopes of various materials.Mlodownik makes each material come alive, through history and entertaining anecdotes. I definitely recommend this book to all those who would like some light non-fiction.I listened to this book as an audiobook. The narrator, Michael Page, reads this book well and helps to keep it fresh and alive."
13,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15155099-jacob,4,"Are you one of those people who once excitedly sat down to watch ""How it's Made"" only to be utterly disappointed by the fact that it's basically just a bunch of B-reel of machines doing everything and no narrated exploration as to what chemicals are used along with the whys and hows that allowed them to settle on their usage to begin with? Well, my strange kin, that is what this book is. It is the whys, wheres, and whens of a some of the most common place items and objects with enough tangential information drops to make this once disappointed man all fuzzy with electric fluttering of joy. Miodownik has written a humorous, informative, and anecdotal book that is as fun for us to read as it was for him to write. If this could be expanded and turned into a science textbook I would throw myself back into college to get my Teacher's Certificate and teach the class myself.You'd do that for me, right, Mark? Mark? Mr. Miodownik? Damn."
14,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6460330-cherie,3,"Well written, just sciency enough to keep me interested without going overboard on the science.I learned something in each of the topics covered.My favorite sections were on chocolate and carbon.

15,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13133225-ankit-goyal,5,"""We inhabit an immaterial world, too: the world of our minds, our emotions, and our perceptions. But the material world, although separate, is not entirely divorced from these worlds—it strongly influences them, as anyone knows.""Brilliant , well written , humorous , wide encompassing! Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World by Mark Miodownik covers all the bases in a fast paced , engaging and humorous style which actually even includes a screenplay penned by the author to bring alive the invention of plastics .  Bring Alive !  That is the biggest takeaway from the book as Mark literally animates the physical world of materiality with carefully researched and humorously narrated anecdotes. ""Along the way, we find that, as with people, the real differences between materials are deep below the surface, a world that is shut off from most unless they have access to sophisticated scientific equipment.""Mark sets out his philosophy in the opening few pages itself . He is crystal clear that the account is not one merely of the physical and functional properties of materiality . Each and every material he discusses is brought to life in vivid hues in its full historical , cultural , emotional and philosophical connotations. He even has a name for such an approach to the physical , an institutionalised academic discipline ,  Psychophysics  .  ""But there is also a scientific discipline especially dedicated to systematically investigating our sensual interactions with materials. This discipline, called psychophysics, has made some very interesting discoveries.""He sets the tone of such an approach at the very outset and we strangely find the chapters labelled  Indomitable , Trusted, Fundamental , Delicious  ( we thought we were reading material science ? )etc. for each separate material that he takes up . Such a welcome perspective really keeps one hooked . For example , he says about stainless steel :""It reflects back to us our feeling of modernity, of being clinical, and of having conquered grime, and the dirt and messiness of life. Of being indomitable ourselves.""And again , about paper :""The yellowing and disintegration of paper are disturbing, and yet, like all antiques, paper gains an authenticity and power from its patina of age. The sensual impressions of old paper allow you to enter the past much more readily, providing a portal to that world.""This is not to say that he has missed out on the technical and commercial details of his materials . Again , he has conveyed the sheer wide encompass and impact of these wonderful materials in anecdotal style : ""Without plastics, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid—and all other movies —would never have existed; neither would the cinema matinee, nor the cinema itself, and our visual culture would be very different indeed. So although I am no fan of excessive plastic packaging, I hopeI’ve shown that, if there is one place a plastic candy wrapper should feel safe and appreciated, it is to be a movie theatre."" And again , 
""Vinyl changed music, how we recorded it and how we listened to it, and along the way it created rock stars""
And Mark also voices his reflections on interesting alternate history scenarios:
""Whether it was the lack of these two crucial optical instruments ( microscope and telescope) that prevented the Chinese from capitalizing on their technological superiority and instigating a scientific revolution, as happened in the West in the seventeenth century, is impossible to say.""
All in all , a very well written book that would satiate both general and technical readers alike !"
16,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"Who would have thought a book on material science can be so fascinating? I loved how the author brought in his personal perspective and stories into the narrative. Materials, such as steel, paper, concrete, glass and chocolate (to name a few covered in this book), do affect each and every one of us on a personal level; although we tend to take most of it for granted given its normality in our quotidian lives. Also, far from being dry, the author has an expressive writing style which makes reading this book most enjoyable. 
One of the most fundamental of these material structures is the atom, but it is not the only structure of importance. At the larger scales there are dislocations, crystals, fibers, scaffolds, gels, and foams, to name a few that have been featured in this book. Taken in isolation, these structures are like characters in a story, each contributing something to its overall shape. Sometimes one character dominates, but it is only when they are put back together that they explain fully why materials behave the way they do.
Just like characters in a story - no character can stand on their own, and it is through interaction with others that makes them who they are. Similarly, we all have relationships with our material world and through our interaction with our smartphones, laptops, clothes, books, writing instruments, eating utensils, drinking receptacles, etc, etc, they bring personal meaning to our daily lives."

Having read this book, I don't think I will look at the material world in the same way again. Highly recommended!"

This week I've caught myself holding grains of sand up close to my eye, gently stroking glass, trying to taste stainless steel, and staring at everyday concrete like I'm in the Louvre."
19,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,3,"“Why can you see through glass?” and “Why does paper fold neatly but not plastic wrap?” are the sort of questions that an arbitrary world believes are endearing when issuing from the mouth of some precocious moppet, but generate uncomfortable silences when voiced by a jowly middle-aged man, like self. It seems odd to me, especially when the questions above provide a much broader avenues for cheerful and interesting conversation than conversational gambits which I have observed are more frequent, like “What do you do for a living?” and “How much did you pay for your house?”These and other more cheerful questions (“Why doesn't a spoon taste like anything?”, “Who was the recipient of the first stapler?”) are answered in this worthwhile book, which falls into a certain “science for nitwits poets” genre which is very enjoyable in these distressing times – deep enough to distract from the proliferation of imbecile leaders across the globe, easy enough to lessen the feeling that maybe one should have listened more attentively in high school science class.Although I enjoyed reading this book, I wish to complain briefly about the inclusion at Kindle location 184 of a Bosnian man named Radivoke (perhaps Radivoje) Lajic, whose picture I offer for your consideration:  Summary of complaint for busy people: The claim below of Radivoke Lajic is (to put the politest possible spin on it) unproven and should not be presented as fact in a non-fiction book by a major publisher.Details: Radivoke Lajic claims that meteorites have struck his home with great frequency. Lajic's explanation: ""I am obviously being targeted by extraterrestrials.” Patient Zero of this preposterous (there! I've said it!) bit of pre-Trump fake news is apparently The Daily Telegraph of London. This newspaper, founded in 1855 and once possessing a reputation for “quality”, apparently found that its original 2008 clickbait story on Lajic had legs so they doubled-down with an equally-knuckleheaded 2010 followup. In short order, lazy journalists all over the world, who have apparently sacrificed all dignity in the pursuit of “content”, re-wrote the story just enough to escape prosecution and slapped it into what pathetic electronic and/or print publication it was their ill-fortune to work for. (See examples from the New York Daily News, Gizmodo, and, perhaps most shamefully (younger readership, more impressionable minds), Discover Magazine.) And it found its way into this book.This story further fries my biscuit when it alleges that scientists at “Belgrade University” are examining the rock and otherwise taking this seriously. The problem is there is no Belgrade University. University of Belgrade, yes, but no Belgrade University. It took me two minutes to discover this on the Interwebs. Perhaps you may think that I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but, if you were reading a publication and it claimed that experts from the University of Harvard were working on some problem, wouldn't you perhaps feel a little skeptical about whether these so-called experts exist? Perhaps it's too much to expect the New York Daily News or Discover Magazine to dispatch a correspondent, but how about the Daily Telegraph? They must have had someone on the group to get the picture and “facts” in the first place.Perhaps more important than the existence or non-existence of an alleged Serbian university is just the sheer lack of interest in questioning the story. A justifiably cranky 2014 blog post attributes this to “complete credulousness”, but I think it's actually due to a more-disturbing and harder-to-excuse cynicism, which says that adding another puff of smoke to the world-wide cloud of data smog is no big deal as long as you can continue to pay your mortgage. I'd like to end a sustained bout of crankiness with a ray of hope. The place I found someone speaking a lick of sense about this whole matter was on the bulletin board of the newspaper column “The Straight Dope”, when poster CalMeacham posited: His house was hit once by a meteorite, and he misinterprets other sounds and vibrations as more meteorite hits, then goes looking for the meteorite and finds other pieces of that first one. Once he finds them, of course, he stops, so he doesn't find the other pieces, until his next misinterpreted meteorite strike, when he goes out prospecting again. I like this interpretation -- it doesn't require him to be a liar, and meteorites have been known to fracture in the air or on impact. And it doesn't require a statistical anomaly. (If this is the case, all his meteorites will be identical -- no mixture of stony meteorites and iron-nickel ones.)I agree and also like this interpretation because, in the 2010 Telegraph article, it says that the alleged additional meteor strikes only happen when it is raining – when you are likely to be inside your house, sheltered from the wind, listening and interpreting the sounds of your house settling.It seems likely I will never know the truth about Radivoke Lajic, but it won't bother me as much as the fact that I still don't understand (and have wondered for decades) why giant slabs of concrete, standing in the mighty rivers and supporting the bridges in and out of the world's great cities, don't eventually get all soggy and mushy. The closest thing this book gets to an explanation is to say that concrete is waterproof, but it also says the concrete, while waterproof, is never completely dry and has water in it. I think I'll have to hire an endearing moppet to ask around for an explanation."

I like an author who takes mundane everyday objects like stainless steel cutlery, the ubiquitous sea of paper products around us, graphite in pencils and WD-40, plastic and shows the history and science behind the making of these modern ordinary products. It is quite extraordinary the repertiore of substances that humans have invented from nature's building blocks. I only had a small set of legos as toys as a kid but the idea of building a wide variety of structures from simple elements has always been intellectually fruitful be it the 26 letters of the alphabet whose combinations fill the Library of Congress or the 100 or so atoms of the periodic table that make everything in our ordinary world. This book on our ingenuity in manipulating stuff is a delight."

Mentioned often, the author is very attached to the Six Million Dollar Man (Steve Austin / Lee Majors) 1973 - 1978 as an illustration of all things-sciencey. I get that.Mr. Miodownik's writing style reminded me of Mary Roach's approaches to a topic and I've read all her books. I'm excited that there are more of these books to enjoy learning about the world. Again - if you want something different, this is a very good choice - not dry and dusty at all.Enjoy your science!"

When we speak, write and arguably think, we use words as our material. Words matter. In this book he chooses several ubiquitous materials that matter to all of us and inform our lives. His unique gift is that in examining their origin and molecular structure, he adds to the sublime presence of materials like concrete and chocolate rather than deconstructs their mystery. "
25,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1661541-robert,4,"Wow!First, thanks to Quest Scouts for introducing me to this book. I would have never read it had it not been an objective for the Prism & Light quest. In full disclosure, I tried to read this last summer and got nowhere. I had checked it out of the local library, but could not concentrate on the text. I read almost exclusively on the Kindle. Wanting to bang out this objective, I purchased the book.The science presented here is in layman's terms. I appreciated that. I was able to follow all the ""sciency"" talk because Miodownik presented the material well. While no Pulitzer writer, I very much enjoyed the writing style of this book. I made a note after the plastics chapter that I thought he and I would get a long well. The way he brooded over the discussion at the candy counter at the theater and then developed a chapter-long response to swat down his opponent was masterful! That he chose to write the chapter as a screenplay just was absolutely perfect! This is my kind of snark.The chocolate chapter was brilliantly written as well. Frankly, I do not eat sweets as a carnivore, but after reading that I looked for a piece in our cupboard. No, we didn't have any. He described the melting of the chocolate in one's mouth in such expressive fashion.The entire book centers around a mundane photograph. I like how he used that to develop each chapter. Clever.The beginning of the book details a horrid incident in which the author was stabbed. It was the type of attention grabber I teach my students to use to get the reader interested. Wow!I learned a few things while reading this including, ""The impact in terms of energy usage of a single-use paper bag has been found to be greater than that of a plastic bag."" I found that interesting.Miodownik had moments of very good writing like this description of a shopping bag:It comes out first in its flat-pack condition, but then its bottom is pushed out and it makes that glorious sound of thunder as the concertinaed paper sides are deployed into their upright positions. There it sits on the shop counter, like a butterfly recently emerged from its chrysalis: perfect, elegant and poised. Suddenly my purchase seems right, now that the clothes have been allocated this special receptacle to chaperone them back home.I really enjoyed this book, something that is out of my normal reading sector. I found it accessible, interesting, and informative."
26,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"This was a pretty interesting look at the make-up and origins and useage of the stuff we use and take for granted every day. I particularly found the chapters on steel and concrete to be interesting. I didn't really love the layout or format of this book though, and found myself wishing that it was just more of a straightforward chapter on each material rather than the clever vignettes that he used. It's maybe a little unfair, since usually that would work for me, but I just didn't enjoy it here. But still, this is interesting and informative if you're the type to want to know what things are made of and where they come from. So. There ya go. "
27,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/885076-matt,4,"There's definitely some questionable fact-telling here that made me at times wonder about the accuracy of other chapters: (e.g. ""Dark chocolate usually contains 50% cocoa fat and 20% cocoa nut powder [referred to as '70% cocoa solids' on packaging]"" is misleading at best, but doesn't go far enough in breaking down what the packaging copy means nor does it state a truth regarding the percentages in true dark chocolate). The only culinary book that Miodownik mentions in his recommended further reading is Harold McGee's ""On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen,"" published in 1984. I'm assuming this is where he obtained his information, so I'm wondering if this ""fact"" is explained in the source material.That said, the author's enthusiasm is real, and I found myself considering items in my environment that I'd always taken for granted: silverware, paper, books, cement, glass. In very few words Miodownik is able to create visuals that clearly explain the movements and ""shapes"" of molecules in a way I've not encountered before. Fascinating. A book that made me look at the world differently and understand it better."

The author is a materials scientist, and his goal is to help us understand how all of the materials we use in everyday life came to be. In a way, it's a paean to human creativity: how did people ever figure out the way to turn sand into glass? And not just glass, but many different types of glass for a variety of purposes? Though Miodownik is a scientist, he writes for a general audience, and anyone who is at least moderately interested in science will enjoy this book. I did, and so did my 11-year-old son."

He tells the stories of each element in regards to his own life, which is a nice personal touch in what would otherwise be dry subject matter. I didn't find every element nearly as compelling as the author made it out to be (despite his obvious enthusiasm for each one), but it was still an enjoyable short listen.Michael Page is one of the reasons I listened to this book. He's been the narrator of three other (fiction) books I've listened to, all of which I enjoyed. He has great range and I just enjoy his voice. Usually you don't see a narrator of this caliper for a nonfiction book.Final verdict: 4 star story, 5 star narration, 4 stars overall"
37,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16767917-sherri,4,"I'm not sure what made me decide to listen to this book. It's not like I was looking around hoping to find a book about concrete (or paper, or graphite or glass or any of the other materials covered in this book). But here's the thing, it was fascinating. No lie. My regard for Miodownik grew with every word. It didn't matter if he was taking about--concrete, glass, paper chocolate, lead, gels -- he made it all interesting and relatable. It made me so much more aware of the the materials around me and our physical and emotional relationship to them. This should be a must read for architects, engineers, artists, and designers of all kinds, and a great read for everyone else. Miodownik is sentimental and passionate about his subjects, sometimes to the extreme. He talks about chocolate like he is practically making love to it (and that's only a slight exaggeration). Even so, I didn't mind his self-indulgent high drama because it felt sincere (not contrived), and because it's hard not to admire someone who has so much enthusiasm for his subjects. "
38,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"Mark Miodownik presents the history and science behind everyday materials, including some edible ones. The author's style is conversational and light, yet hard science is presented in an understandable way. For example, there isn't a whole lot of difference between a diamond and graphite, other than the chemical bonding properties of four electrons in the outer shell of each carbon atom. (By the way a diamond isn't forever, which I believe is another fallacy of a certain ad campaign.) Hand drawn diagrams are included in many chapters, which I found to be helpful even though the illustrations are not fancy.Most of the ""stuff"" included in the book were all inspired by a single photo of the author, sitting at a table and reading a book while sipping (what I assume to be) tea. There were a few materials in the photo that weren't included, such as denim, but that is a trivial gripe. 4.5 stars and recommended to most everyone. Even if you don't care to read it for any other reason, borrow it from the library and enjoy the chapters about chocolate, paper and books."

This book is a love letter to various materials by a curious nerd.In this book he goes over several basic day to day elements such as paper, glass, plastic, concrete etc. But the details are not boring. The structure includes brief introduction via personal experiences with the material, brief anecdotal history, detailed physical/chemical properties of the material, it’s various types and practical applications.I specially enjoyed following chapters and found some information really interesting:a) Steel:1. Pyramids were built using copper chisels. They were required to be sharpened every 2-3 blows.2. Mr, Gillette democratized shaving by introducing use and throw blades.3. Metals are crystals and are sharpening blade is just rearranging of crystals.b) Paper: 1. is a merely 2000yr technology2. is made of Cellulose fibres.3. Why does it get yellow over time? a chemical exposed to sun oxidizes.4. scroll vs book. Romans created codex or book structure. Before that Chinese, who invented paper always used scrolls.5. Paper bends because cellulose fibre break where bent while others stay intact6. Thermal paper used so that cash registers never run out of ink.7. Money is most seductive in paper form. Literal manifestation of trust in economic system.c) Concrete1. Concrete is a living breathing thing.2. Takes any shape, mixes with steel in a as homogeneous body. 3. Concrete can crack. Water entering concrete can rusk the steel inside. The remedy is introduction of bacteria that in contact with air generates calcite, closing the gapsd) Chocolate.1. Material poem!2. Benefits, antioxidants. Mayan people discovered. They drank chocolate as it would melt otherwise.e) Aerogel: 1. Aerogels are Liquid trapped in solid. made from Collagen.2. Typically light gets scattered on entering atmosphere . Blue gets scattered more because of shorter wavelength hence sky is blue.3. Aerogels have Thermal insulation.4. Kisler formed Monsanto with a plan to use his patented Santogel commercially. Didn’t work- look what monsanto has become now!5. NASA had successful space mission to collect stardusk. They used giant tennis rackets and aerosols f) Plastic 1. Celluloid 2. Discovered when backyard scientists were finding replacement of ivory used in billiards game balls.3. Used films strips. Imagine world without plastic. Drag!g) glass1. Electrons repositioning and light entering makes it possible for glass to be transparent2. Romans invented windows. Before it was open air3. Colored glasses were status symbols. Explains why old churches have those.4. Pyrex- boro-silicate. It is immune to thermal shock5. Opaque materials were used for drinking, conducting chemical experiments etc6. before glass- drinks were served in opaque containers. Pilsner lager - is a light better looking beer done with Bottom fermenting . looked better in glass.7. Toughened glass- windscreen. atoms in high tension. laminated glass. toughened glass with plastic laminate.8. Bulletproof glass has several layers of plastic and glass. As bullet hits one layer, gets blunt, and repeats to next layer1 layer- protects from 0.22 mm3 layer - 0.378 layer - AK-47 bullet etch) Diamond/Carbon/ Graphite1. Pencil has graphite2. Carbon dating - age of fossils3. Diamond when burned in vacuum forms graphite. Diamond is not forever. Pretty good marketing though4. Graphene is atomically thin layer of graphite.

42,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56498788-allan-olley,4,"This book is an engaging look at the world of materials science. Each chapter is an examination of a different material (including such materials as concrete and paper) that explains its physical and molecular structure and briefly summarizes the history of its manufacture and use. While the focus of the book is on building materials and other utilitarian substances there is a chapter devoted to chocolate and explaining how its material properties relate to its appeal.The book is not overly detailed, but does bring some up some interesting facts and trivia about the materials. It is also peppered with the author's enthusiasm for materials starting with his boyhood encounter with a mugger wielding a steel razor blade that first led him to marvel at the different stuff all around us. This enthusiasm can seem a bit over the top at times (as when he laments that aerogels might only be used for utilitarian insulative features and not their other remarkable properties), but its general effect is to inspire interest in the materials he explains and praises.The narrator's crisp neutral British accent is ideal for dealing the technical details of this book, doubly so because the other is a himself a Brit (although he has lived off and on in the USA and elsewhere). The narrator pronounces the English name of element 13 atomic number 13 as Aluminum and not Aluminium as one might expect."

The author did a good job of explaining his enthusiasm for why he decided to spend his life finding out about the stuff that matters and what makes our world work when a lot of people don't really take the time to even think about it. After a while, this book lost it's luster for me. It kind of had a textbook feel and it was hard to keep my interest. Don't get me wrong, the information he conveys is still very good, makes a lot of good points and is quite interesting the way he explains it, but for me, it just felt like it was time to read something else. Some of it I had already learned about in college, and then some of it was new. I'm glad to see someone like this author is so excited about things in the background, the chemistry behind it all, including the inventors and just the ""stuff that matters,""the things that shape our world, including man-made things (like steel items being made after they discovered how to make steel, etc), (what makes things happen, both in the past and today.) If you like those sorts of things, this might be a good book for you to read, as he communicates very well as a writer and you would probably enjoy it."

Extraordinarily clear, engaging, well written historic-scientific-engineering-social-aesthetic discussion of ten materials that surround us: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastics, glass, graphite, porcelain, and implants. How chocolate gets from a raw cocoa bean that ""tastes horrible"" and is ""fibrous, woody, bitter, and bland"" to a substance that has been scientifically demonstrated to be ""far more intense and longer lasting"" and all-around ""better"" than kissing. How a human can now hold a piece of sky in her hand, why the origin of plastic is, as the Music Man said: ""a pool table, don't you understand?"", how stainless steel heals itself like skin so that in fact we never actually have to taste it while eating from it every day. ""The possibility that whole objects might be wired up throughout, as if permeated by an entire nervous system, is now . . . conceivable. . . .

The tone is light and fluffy, without much substance, as Miodownik makes his point that micro and nano scale structures create the material properties of the macro world that we inhabit, skips through the history of the material, and how we find it pleasing today. The chapter on carbon, with a futuristic look towards the properties of graphene is the strongest. The chapter on plastic is a tragic waste, a fictionalized tale around late 19th celluloid, rather than any kind of thoughtful look at the most innovative, flexible, and environmentally dangerous of modern materials."

Stuff matters takes an interestingly scientific look at the materials that we use from day to day and adds emotional values to these seemingly mundane stuff. The most powerful quote from the book: ""We occupy multiple worlds: the material and immaterial - which is world of our thoughts and perception"". Moidownik does well to expand upon the immaterial/psychic world of materials and adds to the flavor of individual experiences.

How the world around us operate on different levels? Why metals are so different yet someone somewhere thought to categorise them as such? These kind of questions pop into my head on a daily basis. This fascinating book does little to satisfy my curiosity, instead, it enlarged it significantly! Instead of finding answers (which I have to admit that I did) an endless wave of new questions popped in about the Material world.

52,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34550725-alfred-haplo,4,"The title of the book, Stuff Matters, encapsulates the core message. From paper to porcelain, concrete to chocolate, we are engaged in a whirlwind tour to explore ten commonplace materials in its holistic entirety. On a macro-level, we learn about its discovery, evolution and application. On a micro-level, its atomic structure, nanostructure and microstructure. We are exposed to not just what matter is made of, but why it matters. The author connects the performance of a material to its performative qualities. That material is more than just form and function but a medium through which art and emotions are expressed. The study of material science is not just facts and observations, the garnering of scientific knowledge to learn about the physical world and how its components work. Society and science along with its derivative, technology, are not separate disciplines but are synergistic in shaping this world we live in. An example is the Dives in Misericordia, a beautiful and modern Roman church built with self-cleaning concrete. The titanium dioxide in this concrete will absorb UV light to create free radical ions, which breaks down dirt and reduce the level of nitrogen oxide in the air produced by cars. The author stated that this “opens up the possibility that in the future buildings and roads may not be purely passive; they may purify the air much like plants”. Beyond structural and aesthetics purposes, concrete is utilized to positively affect the environment and its inhabitants. In the finale chapter aptly titled “Synthesis”, the author reinforces the book’s message, “It is hard to overestimate the philosophical as well as the technological importance of this dictum of materials science: that knowing the basic chemical composition is not enough to understand materiality. It is, after all, what makes the modern world possible.””Because of this strong connection between the materials and their social role, the materials that we favor, the materials that we surround ourselves with, are significant to us. They mean something, they embody our ideals, they give us part of our identity.”But, ah. We are getting ahead of ourselves! Let us go back to the beginning. A materials scientist and engineer, Dr Mark Miodownik’s fascination with material science first began as an epiphany. His back had encountered a razor sharp material - specifically, a steel blade - held by someone with ill-intent. That accident left the author with an indelible impression of how materials can, and have, changed his life. It is on this premise that each chapter is written, and is populated with personal vignettes interspersed with scientific facts.At times, the author tries too hard with the creative presentations. The chapter on plastic was written in the format of a movie script which was… a valiant attempt. Each chapter is assigned an adjective to capture the essence of the material. Graphite is “Unbreakable”, steel is “Indomitable”, glass is ""Invisible"" and chocolate is “Delicious”, for example. It seems counter-intuitive to have any material attributes boxed in with just one word, clever as it may be. After all, has it not been expounded that matter is more than just a mass of atoms? That it has far-reaching philosophical implications that are not easily defined. No matter. There is something for everyone in this book. The author’s narrative style has the easy manner of a popular high school science teacher who brings cool back to geek. A non-science reader will appreciate the complexity of science broken down into layman terms, whereas a science reader will appreciate how the author has made complex science relatable for the general audience. Take paper, for example. The simplest of materials presented in the book. Paper is a product of chemical reactions (de-lignification, bleach, calcium carbonate) on physical matter (tree cellulose fibers) using a technique refined from 2,000 years ago. So? Paper is just paper until we write words on it and give it content. Long after the ink fades and the paper dissolves, the intent of the words remain forever immortalized in our hearts and minds. As exemplified by the author’s sharing of two important pieces of paper - the first, a letter written by his grandfather to the British Home Office to request the (successful) extraction of his son from Germany prior to WWI and the second, a lovely card from his then-girlfriend (now wife) thanking him for a memorable first date. Stuff Matters is not a serious science book by any measure. Those are called textbooks. To be studied. This book has the right spirit of fun and pop culture, with enough science information to make us more aware of the world we live in. Overall, a highly recommended read."
53,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23509975-b-rbara,5,I know for certain that I've acquired super powers and now I can recognize every bit of material and its properties in any room.

So if you have any inner nerd in you that can geek out to chemistry, nanostructures, the materials we use in everyday life, etc...you will enjoy this well written, thoughtful, often humorous book. The final chapter is philosophical gold. "
55,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20069551-davide-nole,5,"The ideal popular science book for me.Basically I can only say great things about this book:- It engages the reader from the very first page, due to the fact that it's basically a series of short stories about the author. So the reader is led in a journey hand in hand with Mark, and he feels like he's there with him, talking about materials and MM's relation with them- It goes in depth, scientifically speaking. That is awesome, for a book as short as this one (about 250 pages), the fact that the author was able to condense the required knowledge in those pages is quite remarkable, and I do want him to write again (please)- It is not repetitive, which is something I wasn't really expecting, since the structure of the book is basically divided by the materials the author is talking about. The fact that MM changes format every time helps the reader a lot and makes the book a fun read and a very interesting one.I could go on forever telling everything I liked of this book, but I feel like the three things I listed are the most important ones, as they probably are three main points that every prospicient reader may want to address, when talking about a popular science book."
56,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33585135-asma-almahdi,3,"i read this book for my university project, didn't thought that i would enjoy it this much, it has a whole chapter about chocolate XD"
57,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356453-anetq,5,"This is an awesome book for anyone who is interested in how the world is put together - literally! Through chapters on 10 different materials the book not only teach the history and properties of the different materials, but also a lesson in scales, some of the chemistry that hold it together and ultimately nanoscience (with a nod to quantum mechanics) - I can actually say, that I now understand what nanoscience is about, whereas before it was only odd science fictioney things I've seen but not understood the workings of (like the self-assembling materials from MIT and that atom-level movie.And this through reading stories about china making it to Europe, how chocolate melts in your mouth and the amazing powers of reinforced concrete through the chemical magic of cement. Very enlightening and a fun read! (Having mixed concrete and melted a lot of chocolate in my mouth only made it better off course.)Now the nit-picky comments: There were a few annoyances.When reading the chapter on paper I kept wondering if it was a ten year old book - because even if the 10 material stories are personal ones, I can hardly remember a time with all those paper materials. ""Back of the envelope"" is a concept I do remember, but bills have been electronic for years on end in Denmark, so I never have en envelope lying around and rarely see a printed newspaper - I do realize, I'm on the tech end of things, but I certainly don't see reading books as being an important tactile experience - actually I much prefer a light Kindle to a large classic (possibly musty smelling) tome. (Have recently been putting off Don Quixote as I only have an unbearable one-volume paper brick-version of it!) The Author is definitely much more of a paper romantic!Another thing: The British connection. It's fine with local flavor (like the odd relationship with tea in porcelain), but for most materials, the year of the technology's arrival to the british isles really is of no use whatsoever for us non-brits, when someone else invented, found or made it usefull, maybe just leave it there?"
58,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,5,"Material science is not really my topic. I had a brief stint as a chemistry enthusiast when I was 14 and that died out as soon as I hit high school. Plus it's not reaaaally the sexiest topic, is it?Mark Miodownik begs to differ. The book is structured into 10 chapters, each preceded by the same picture of the author drinking his coffee on the terrace and then exploring one of the materials you can see in the picture. A cute gimmick that sets the tone for the chapters themselves, each structured differently. My favorite was the chapter on paper, which sprinkled some emotional, autobiographical bits in with the explanations on different types of paper. My least favorite, the one on plastics, was supposed to be a play starring the main people involved in creating the family of materials, but read artificially and relied on lengthy footnotes where the good stuff was.Excepting this minor hiccup, however, Stuff Matters was one of the most enlightening books I've read in a good while. The best part about it is Miodownik's ability to explain pretty complex notions in very simple terms, requiring little to no previous knowledge and even managing to create a bit of intrigue. (Or, at least, what I interpreted as intrigue. When discussing glass, he mentions how atoms are mostly empty space; therefore, he argues, it's not surprising that glass is transparent, but rather than almost everything else isn't. I was literally on the edge of my seat there, and not only because it was an uncomfortable airport seat.)I strongly, warmly recommend it to anyone who's really just curious about stuff. Maybe not to material science majors, though."
59,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Mark Miodownik writes in a conversational style about materials, using history, personal anecdotes and concise science facts to explain what the everyday stuff we use to eat, sit on, read and work in is made of. Despite the easygoing explanations, he is a man who knows 'stuff'. Miodownik is a professor at University College in London, which has an extensive materials library.He has logically organized by chapter facts and stories of a particular material, such as paper, steel, cement, rubber, glass, foam, chocolate and denim. There are simple, but understandable hand-drawings as well as photos.One of the things I learned about cement is some cement is being experimentally infused with a type of bacteria which eats starch that has been embedded into the original cement; and soon the little buggers are defecating mineral calcite, a component of cement. Thus, 'self-healing' cement was invented, with bacteria reducing structural cement cracks which occur over time! While proven to work in the lab, I guess commercial versions are in the future. Still, cement excreting bacteria curing the problem of the deterioration of reinforced cement tickles my sense of the absurd! Scientists are wonderful.The level of science is the kind professors teach to art majors, so I suspect the book will not satisfy STEM readers. However, it is a cute little book with cute little stories about amazing materials we use everyday casually and thoughtlessly. Who knew knowing 'stuff' could be fascinating? Pun intended, gentle reader ; )"

63,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26517939-bouke,5,"This book will make you look at the physical world in a very different way. Our physical lives are enabled by the various materials that make up the things around us, and they are not much appreciated. Every chapter in this book is about a different material, its history and how it affects our day-to-day. You will learn a lot of random interesting facts, but also gain a new appreciation for the things around you.

He tells the stories of each element in regards to his own life, which is a nice personal touch in what would otherwise be dry subject matter. I didn't find every element nearly as compelling as the author made it out to be (despite his obvious enthusiasm for each one), but it was still an enjoyable short listen.Michael Page is one of the reasons I listened to this book. He's been the narrator of three other (fiction) books I've listened to, all of which I enjoyed. He has great range and I just enjoy his voice. Usually you don't see a narrator of this caliper for a nonfiction book.Final verdict: 4 star story, 5 star narration, 4 stars overall"
67,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16767917-sherri,4,"I'm not sure what made me decide to listen to this book. It's not like I was looking around hoping to find a book about concrete (or paper, or graphite or glass or any of the other materials covered in this book). But here's the thing, it was fascinating. No lie. My regard for Miodownik grew with every word. It didn't matter if he was taking about--concrete, glass, paper chocolate, lead, gels -- he made it all interesting and relatable. It made me so much more aware of the the materials around me and our physical and emotional relationship to them. This should be a must read for architects, engineers, artists, and designers of all kinds, and a great read for everyone else. Miodownik is sentimental and passionate about his subjects, sometimes to the extreme. He talks about chocolate like he is practically making love to it (and that's only a slight exaggeration). Even so, I didn't mind his self-indulgent high drama because it felt sincere (not contrived), and because it's hard not to admire someone who has so much enthusiasm for his subjects. "
68,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"Mark Miodownik presents the history and science behind everyday materials, including some edible ones. The author's style is conversational and light, yet hard science is presented in an understandable way. For example, there isn't a whole lot of difference between a diamond and graphite, other than the chemical bonding properties of four electrons in the outer shell of each carbon atom. (By the way a diamond isn't forever, which I believe is another fallacy of a certain ad campaign.) Hand drawn diagrams are included in many chapters, which I found to be helpful even though the illustrations are not fancy.Most of the ""stuff"" included in the book were all inspired by a single photo of the author, sitting at a table and reading a book while sipping (what I assume to be) tea. There were a few materials in the photo that weren't included, such as denim, but that is a trivial gripe. 4.5 stars and recommended to most everyone. Even if you don't care to read it for any other reason, borrow it from the library and enjoy the chapters about chocolate, paper and books."

71,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34979490-akshay,5,"I can not appreciate enough how analytical and curious Mark Miodownik is. He has real love for finding out how stuff is by design. This book is a love letter to various materials by a curious nerd.In this book he goes over several basic day to day elements such as paper, glass, plastic, concrete etc. But the details are not boring. The structure includes brief introduction via personal experiences with the material, brief anecdotal history, detailed physical/chemical properties of the material, it’s various types and practical applications.I specially enjoyed following chapters and found some information really interesting:a) Steel:1. Pyramids were built using copper chisels. They were required to be sharpened every 2-3 blows.2. Mr, Gillette democratized shaving by introducing use and throw blades.3. Metals are crystals and are sharpening blade is just rearranging of crystals.b) Paper: 1. is a merely 2000yr technology2. is made of Cellulose fibres.3. Why does it get yellow over time? a chemical exposed to sun oxidizes.4. scroll vs book. Romans created codex or book structure. Before that Chinese, who invented paper always used scrolls.5. Paper bends because cellulose fibre break where bent while others stay intact6. Thermal paper used so that cash registers never run out of ink.7. Money is most seductive in paper form. Literal manifestation of trust in economic system.c) Concrete1. Concrete is a living breathing thing.2. Takes any shape, mixes with steel in a as homogeneous body. 3. Concrete can crack. Water entering concrete can rusk the steel inside. The remedy is introduction of bacteria that in contact with air generates calcite, closing the gapsd) Chocolate.1. Material poem!2. Benefits, antioxidants. Mayan people discovered. They drank chocolate as it would melt otherwise.e) Aerogel: 1. Aerogels are Liquid trapped in solid. made from Collagen.2. Typically light gets scattered on entering atmosphere . Blue gets scattered more because of shorter wavelength hence sky is blue.3. Aerogels have Thermal insulation.4. Kisler formed Monsanto with a plan to use his patented Santogel commercially. Didn’t work- look what monsanto has become now!5. NASA had successful space mission to collect stardusk. They used giant tennis rackets and aerosols f) Plastic 1. Celluloid 2. Discovered when backyard scientists were finding replacement of ivory used in billiards game balls.3. Used films strips. Imagine world without plastic. Drag!g) glass1. Electrons repositioning and light entering makes it possible for glass to be transparent2. Romans invented windows. Before it was open air3. Colored glasses were status symbols. Explains why old churches have those.4. Pyrex- boro-silicate. It is immune to thermal shock5. Opaque materials were used for drinking, conducting chemical experiments etc6. before glass- drinks were served in opaque containers. Pilsner lager - is a light better looking beer done with Bottom fermenting . looked better in glass.7. Toughened glass- windscreen. atoms in high tension. laminated glass. toughened glass with plastic laminate.8. Bulletproof glass has several layers of plastic and glass. As bullet hits one layer, gets blunt, and repeats to next layer1 layer- protects from 0.22 mm3 layer - 0.378 layer - AK-47 bullet etch) Diamond/Carbon/ Graphite1. Pencil has graphite2. Carbon dating - age of fossils3. Diamond when burned in vacuum forms graphite. Diamond is not forever. Pretty good marketing though4. Graphene is atomically thin layer of graphite. Strongest material known to man."
72,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56498788-allan-olley,4,"This book is an engaging look at the world of materials science. Each chapter is an examination of a different material (including such materials as concrete and paper) that explains its physical and molecular structure and briefly summarizes the history of its manufacture and use. While the focus of the book is on building materials and other utilitarian substances there is a chapter devoted to chocolate and explaining how its material properties relate to its appeal.The book is not overly detailed, but does bring some up some interesting facts and trivia about the materials. It is also peppered with the author's enthusiasm for materials starting with his boyhood encounter with a mugger wielding a steel razor blade that first led him to marvel at the different stuff all around us. This enthusiasm can seem a bit over the top at times (as when he laments that aerogels might only be used for utilitarian insulative features and not their other remarkable properties), but its general effect is to inspire interest in the materials he explains and praises.The narrator's crisp neutral British accent is ideal for dealing the technical details of this book, doubly so because the other is a himself a Brit (although he has lived off and on in the USA and elsewhere). The narrator pronounces the English name of element 13 atomic number 13 as Aluminum and not Aluminium as one might expect."

The author did a good job of explaining his enthusiasm for why he decided to spend his life finding out about the stuff that matters and what makes our world work when a lot of people don't really take the time to even think about it. After a while, this book lost it's luster for me. It kind of had a textbook feel and it was hard to keep my interest. Don't get me wrong, the information he conveys is still very good, makes a lot of good points and is quite interesting the way he explains it, but for me, it just felt like it was time to read something else. Some of it I had already learned about in college, and then some of it was new. I'm glad to see someone like this author is so excited about things in the background, the chemistry behind it all, including the inventors and just the ""stuff that matters,""the things that shape our world, including man-made things (like steel items being made after they discovered how to make steel, etc), (what makes things happen, both in the past and today.) If you like those sorts of things, this might be a good book for you to read, as he communicates very well as a writer and you would probably enjoy it."

Extraordinarily clear, engaging, well written historic-scientific-engineering-social-aesthetic discussion of ten materials that surround us: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastics, glass, graphite, porcelain, and implants. How chocolate gets from a raw cocoa bean that ""tastes horrible"" and is ""fibrous, woody, bitter, and bland"" to a substance that has been scientifically demonstrated to be ""far more intense and longer lasting"" and all-around ""better"" than kissing. How a human can now hold a piece of sky in her hand, why the origin of plastic is, as the Music Man said: ""a pool table, don't you understand?"", how stainless steel heals itself like skin so that in fact we never actually have to taste it while eating from it every day. ""The possibility that whole objects might be wired up throughout, as if permeated by an entire nervous system, is now . . . conceivable. . . .

The tone is light and fluffy, without much substance, as Miodownik makes his point that micro and nano scale structures create the material properties of the macro world that we inhabit, skips through the history of the material, and how we find it pleasing today. The chapter on carbon, with a futuristic look towards the properties of graphene is the strongest. The chapter on plastic is a tragic waste, a fictionalized tale around late 19th celluloid, rather than any kind of thoughtful look at the most innovative, flexible, and environmentally dangerous of modern materials."

The most powerful quote from the book: ""We occupy multiple worlds: the material and immaterial - which is world of our thoughts and perception"". Moidownik does well to expand upon the immaterial/psychic world of materials and adds to the flavor of individual experiences.

In the finale chapter aptly titled “Synthesis”, the author reinforces the book’s message, “It is hard to overestimate the philosophical as well as the technological importance of this dictum of materials science: that knowing the basic chemical composition is not enough to understand materiality. It is, after all, what makes the modern world possible.””Because of this strong connection between the materials and their social role, the materials that we favor, the materials that we surround ourselves with, are significant to us. They mean something, they embody our ideals, they give us part of our identity.”But, ah. We are getting ahead of ourselves! Let us go back to the beginning. A materials scientist and engineer, Dr Mark Miodownik’s fascination with material science first began as an epiphany. His back had encountered a razor sharp material - specifically, a steel blade - held by someone with ill-intent. That accident left the author with an indelible impression of how materials can, and have, changed his life. It is on this premise that each chapter is written, and is populated with personal vignettes interspersed with scientific facts.At times, the author tries too hard with the creative presentations. The chapter on plastic was written in the format of a movie script which was… a valiant attempt. Each chapter is assigned an adjective to capture the essence of the material. Graphite is “Unbreakable”, steel is “Indomitable”, glass is ""Invisible"" and chocolate is “Delicious”, for example. It seems counter-intuitive to have any material attributes boxed in with just one word, clever as it may be. After all, has it not been expounded that matter is more than just a mass of atoms? That it has far-reaching philosophical implications that are not easily defined. No matter. There is something for everyone in this book. The author’s narrative style has the easy manner of a popular high school science teacher who brings cool back to geek. A non-science reader will appreciate the complexity of science broken down into layman terms, whereas a science reader will appreciate how the author has made complex science relatable for the general audience. Take paper, for example. The simplest of materials presented in the book. Paper is a product of chemical reactions (de-lignification, bleach, calcium carbonate) on physical matter (tree cellulose fibers) using a technique refined from 2,000 years ago. So? Paper is just paper until we write words on it and give it content. Long after the ink fades and the paper dissolves, the intent of the words remain forever immortalized in our hearts and minds. As exemplified by the author’s sharing of two important pieces of paper - the first, a letter written by his grandfather to the British Home Office to request the (successful) extraction of his son from Germany prior to WWI and the second, a lovely card from his then-girlfriend (now wife) thanking him for a memorable first date. Stuff Matters is not a serious science book by any measure. Those are called textbooks. To be studied. This book has the right spirit of fun and pop culture, with enough science information to make us more aware of the world we live in. Overall, a highly recommended read."

So if you have any inner nerd in you that can geek out to chemistry, nanostructures, the materials we use in everyday life, etc...you will enjoy this well written, thoughtful, often humorous book. The final chapter is philosophical gold. "
85,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20069551-davide-nole,5,"The ideal popular science book for me.Basically I can only say great things about this book:- It engages the reader from the very first page, due to the fact that it's basically a series of short stories about the author. So the reader is led in a journey hand in hand with Mark, and he feels like he's there with him, talking about materials and MM's relation with them- It goes in depth, scientifically speaking. That is awesome, for a book as short as this one (about 250 pages), the fact that the author was able to condense the required knowledge in those pages is quite remarkable, and I do want him to write again (please)- It is not repetitive, which is something I wasn't really expecting, since the structure of the book is basically divided by the materials the author is talking about. The fact that MM changes format every time helps the reader a lot and makes the book a fun read and a very interesting one.I could go on forever telling everything I liked of this book, but I feel like the three things I listed are the most important ones, as they probably are three main points that every prospicient reader may want to address, when talking about a popular science book."
86,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33585135-asma-almahdi,3,"i read this book for my university project, didn't thought that i would enjoy it this much, it has a whole chapter about chocolate XD"
87,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356453-anetq,5,"This is an awesome book for anyone who is interested in how the world is put together - literally! Through chapters on 10 different materials the book not only teach the history and properties of the different materials, but also a lesson in scales, some of the chemistry that hold it together and ultimately nanoscience (with a nod to quantum mechanics) - I can actually say, that I now understand what nanoscience is about, whereas before it was only odd science fictioney things I've seen but not understood the workings of (like the self-assembling materials from MIT and that atom-level movie.And this through reading stories about china making it to Europe, how chocolate melts in your mouth and the amazing powers of reinforced concrete through the chemical magic of cement. Very enlightening and a fun read! (Having mixed concrete and melted a lot of chocolate in my mouth only made it better off course.)Now the nit-picky comments: There were a few annoyances.When reading the chapter on paper I kept wondering if it was a ten year old book - because even if the 10 material stories are personal ones, I can hardly remember a time with all those paper materials. ""Back of the envelope"" is a concept I do remember, but bills have been electronic for years on end in Denmark, so I never have en envelope lying around and rarely see a printed newspaper - I do realize, I'm on the tech end of things, but I certainly don't see reading books as being an important tactile experience - actually I much prefer a light Kindle to a large classic (possibly musty smelling) tome. (Have recently been putting off Don Quixote as I only have an unbearable one-volume paper brick-version of it!) The Author is definitely much more of a paper romantic!Another thing: The British connection. It's fine with local flavor (like the odd relationship with tea in porcelain), but for most materials, the year of the technology's arrival to the british isles really is of no use whatsoever for us non-brits, when someone else invented, found or made it usefull, maybe just leave it there?"
88,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,5,"Material science is not really my topic. I had a brief stint as a chemistry enthusiast when I was 14 and that died out as soon as I hit high school. Plus it's not reaaaally the sexiest topic, is it?Mark Miodownik begs to differ. The book is structured into 10 chapters, each preceded by the same picture of the author drinking his coffee on the terrace and then exploring one of the materials you can see in the picture. A cute gimmick that sets the tone for the chapters themselves, each structured differently. My favorite was the chapter on paper, which sprinkled some emotional, autobiographical bits in with the explanations on different types of paper. My least favorite, the one on plastics, was supposed to be a play starring the main people involved in creating the family of materials, but read artificially and relied on lengthy footnotes where the good stuff was.Excepting this minor hiccup, however, Stuff Matters was one of the most enlightening books I've read in a good while. The best part about it is Miodownik's ability to explain pretty complex notions in very simple terms, requiring little to no previous knowledge and even managing to create a bit of intrigue. (Or, at least, what I interpreted as intrigue. When discussing glass, he mentions how atoms are mostly empty space; therefore, he argues, it's not surprising that glass is transparent, but rather than almost everything else isn't. I was literally on the edge of my seat there, and not only because it was an uncomfortable airport seat.)I strongly, warmly recommend it to anyone who's really just curious about stuff. Maybe not to material science majors, though."
89,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Mark Miodownik writes in a conversational style about materials, using history, personal anecdotes and concise science facts to explain what the everyday stuff we use to eat, sit on, read and work in is made of. Despite the easygoing explanations, he is a man who knows 'stuff'. Miodownik is a professor at University College in London, which has an extensive materials library.He has logically organized by chapter facts and stories of a particular material, such as paper, steel, cement, rubber, glass, foam, chocolate and denim. There are simple, but understandable hand-drawings as well as photos.One of the things I learned about cement is some cement is being experimentally infused with a type of bacteria which eats starch that has been embedded into the original cement; and soon the little buggers are defecating mineral calcite, a component of cement. Thus, 'self-healing' cement was invented, with bacteria reducing structural cement cracks which occur over time! While proven to work in the lab, I guess commercial versions are in the future. Still, cement excreting bacteria curing the problem of the deterioration of reinforced cement tickles my sense of the absurd! Scientists are wonderful.The level of science is the kind professors teach to art majors, so I suspect the book will not satisfy STEM readers. However, it is a cute little book with cute little stories about amazing materials we use everyday casually and thoughtlessly. Who knew knowing 'stuff' could be fascinating? Pun intended, gentle reader ; )"

Overall everything in this book absolutely blew my mind! All the things that we use in our day to day lives are most definitely being over looked. Stuff matters really opened my eyes to all the complexity that surrounds us. I wish that the writing was a little more clear and precise, but overall this book was very cool."

This is a science book - a book illuminating the fascinating scientific facts about everyday materials that surround us. However, it's at the same time poetic and anecdotal, as the author injects his life stories and creativity into the presentation of the materials. A very delightful read! "
93,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26517939-bouke,5,"This book will make you look at the physical world in a very different way. Our physical lives are enabled by the various materials that make up the things around us, and they are not much appreciated. Every chapter in this book is about a different material, its history and how it affects our day-to-day. You will learn a lot of random interesting facts, but also gain a new appreciation for the things around you. Whole empires were literally built on advancements in the material sciences, and it seems that there are still large leaps to be made in this field. "
94,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,4,"An interesting look at material science, although 4 stars might be too generous. Call it 3.5 but I’ll round up. Miodownik profiles a number of different materials that have prominent places in our lives, and bases it off a picture of himself having tea on a rooftop garden of his London flat. The specific materials are:SteelPaper (probably my least favorite chapter)ConcreteChocolateFoam (aerogels)PlasticGlassGraphitePorcelainImplanted materials like titanium"
95,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25115364-arunkrishnan,5,The author provides a concise explanation of the origins of materials that we come across on out daily lives. An intuitive understanding is gained about the reason behind the behavior of materials.
96,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29075798-adam,4,"Review of the audiobook narrated by Michael Page.There are some super interesting facts and details about materials (iron, cement, glass, etc) which we take for granted. He tells the stories of each element in regards to his own life, which is a nice personal touch in what would otherwise be dry subject matter. I didn't find every element nearly as compelling as the author made it out to be (despite his obvious enthusiasm for each one), but it was still an enjoyable short listen.Michael Page is one of the reasons I listened to this book. He's been the narrator of three other (fiction) books I've listened to, all of which I enjoyed. He has great range and I just enjoy his voice. Usually you don't see a narrator of this caliper for a nonfiction book.Final verdict: 4 star story, 5 star narration, 4 stars overall"
97,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16767917-sherri,4,"I'm not sure what made me decide to listen to this book. It's not like I was looking around hoping to find a book about concrete (or paper, or graphite or glass or any of the other materials covered in this book). But here's the thing, it was fascinating. No lie. My regard for Miodownik grew with every word. It didn't matter if he was taking about--concrete, glass, paper chocolate, lead, gels -- he made it all interesting and relatable. It made me so much more aware of the the materials around me and our physical and emotional relationship to them. This should be a must read for architects, engineers, artists, and designers of all kinds, and a great read for everyone else. Miodownik is sentimental and passionate about his subjects, sometimes to the extreme. He talks about chocolate like he is practically making love to it (and that's only a slight exaggeration). Even so, I didn't mind his self-indulgent high drama because it felt sincere (not contrived), and because it's hard not to admire someone who has so much enthusiasm for his subjects. "
98,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"Mark Miodownik presents the history and science behind everyday materials, including some edible ones. The author's style is conversational and light, yet hard science is presented in an understandable way. For example, there isn't a whole lot of difference between a diamond and graphite, other than the chemical bonding properties of four electrons in the outer shell of each carbon atom. (By the way a diamond isn't forever, which I believe is another fallacy of a certain ad campaign.) Hand drawn diagrams are included in many chapters, which I found to be helpful even though the illustrations are not fancy.Most of the ""stuff"" included in the book were all inspired by a single photo of the author, sitting at a table and reading a book while sipping (what I assume to be) tea. There were a few materials in the photo that weren't included, such as denim, but that is a trivial gripe. 4.5 stars and recommended to most everyone. Even if you don't care to read it for any other reason, borrow it from the library and enjoy the chapters about chocolate, paper and books."
99,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"I found this very irritating. The explanations were circular non-explanations: paper is like paper because it's made of the stuff that paper is made of and babies like to play with it, isn't that super!I much preferred the following book on similar themes:

The history of ""regular"" every day things such as plastic, glass, and even other things such as graphite were mind blowing and fascinating (who knew that graphene is poised to make the silicon chip obsolete?). Anybody with an interest in materials or quantum mechanics should check this book out. It is accessible and even funny and a very good read."
101,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34979490-akshay,5,"I can not appreciate enough how analytical and curious Mark Miodownik is. He has real love for finding out how stuff is by design. This book is a love letter to various materials by a curious nerd.In this book he goes over several basic day to day elements such as paper, glass, plastic, concrete etc. But the details are not boring. The structure includes brief introduction via personal experiences with the material, brief anecdotal history, detailed physical/chemical properties of the material, it’s various types and practical applications.I specially enjoyed following chapters and found some information really interesting:a) Steel:1. Pyramids were built using copper chisels. They were required to be sharpened every 2-3 blows.2. Mr, Gillette democratized shaving by introducing use and throw blades.3. Metals are crystals and are sharpening blade is just rearranging of crystals.b) Paper: 1. is a merely 2000yr technology2. is made of Cellulose fibres.3. Why does it get yellow over time? a chemical exposed to sun oxidizes.4. scroll vs book. Romans created codex or book structure. Before that Chinese, who invented paper always used scrolls.5. Paper bends because cellulose fibre break where bent while others stay intact6. Thermal paper used so that cash registers never run out of ink.7. Money is most seductive in paper form. Literal manifestation of trust in economic system.c) Concrete1. Concrete is a living breathing thing.2. Takes any shape, mixes with steel in a as homogeneous body. 3. Concrete can crack. Water entering concrete can rusk the steel inside. The remedy is introduction of bacteria that in contact with air generates calcite, closing the gapsd) Chocolate.1. Material poem!2. Benefits, antioxidants. Mayan people discovered. They drank chocolate as it would melt otherwise.e) Aerogel: 1. Aerogels are Liquid trapped in solid. made from Collagen.2. Typically light gets scattered on entering atmosphere . Blue gets scattered more because of shorter wavelength hence sky is blue.3. Aerogels have Thermal insulation.4. Kisler formed Monsanto with a plan to use his patented Santogel commercially. Didn’t work- look what monsanto has become now!5. NASA had successful space mission to collect stardusk. They used giant tennis rackets and aerosols f) Plastic 1. Celluloid 2. Discovered when backyard scientists were finding replacement of ivory used in billiards game balls.3. Used films strips. Imagine world without plastic. Drag!g) glass1. Electrons repositioning and light entering makes it possible for glass to be transparent2. Romans invented windows. Before it was open air3. Colored glasses were status symbols. Explains why old churches have those.4. Pyrex- boro-silicate. It is immune to thermal shock5. Opaque materials were used for drinking, conducting chemical experiments etc6. before glass- drinks were served in opaque containers. Pilsner lager - is a light better looking beer done with Bottom fermenting . looked better in glass.7. Toughened glass- windscreen. atoms in high tension. laminated glass. toughened glass with plastic laminate.8. Bulletproof glass has several layers of plastic and glass. As bullet hits one layer, gets blunt, and repeats to next layer1 layer- protects from 0.22 mm3 layer - 0.378 layer - AK-47 bullet etch) Diamond/Carbon/ Graphite1. Pencil has graphite2. Carbon dating - age of fossils3. Diamond when burned in vacuum forms graphite. Diamond is not forever. Pretty good marketing though4. Graphene is atomically thin layer of graphite. Strongest material known to man."
102,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56498788-allan-olley,4,"This book is an engaging look at the world of materials science. Each chapter is an examination of a different material (including such materials as concrete and paper) that explains its physical and molecular structure and briefly summarizes the history of its manufacture and use. While the focus of the book is on building materials and other utilitarian substances there is a chapter devoted to chocolate and explaining how its material properties relate to its appeal.The book is not overly detailed, but does bring some up some interesting facts and trivia about the materials. It is also peppered with the author's enthusiasm for materials starting with his boyhood encounter with a mugger wielding a steel razor blade that first led him to marvel at the different stuff all around us. This enthusiasm can seem a bit over the top at times (as when he laments that aerogels might only be used for utilitarian insulative features and not their other remarkable properties), but its general effect is to inspire interest in the materials he explains and praises.The narrator's crisp neutral British accent is ideal for dealing the technical details of this book, doubly so because the other is a himself a Brit (although he has lived off and on in the USA and elsewhere). The narrator pronounces the English name of element 13 atomic number 13 as Aluminum and not Aluminium as one might expect."
103,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25849610-deb,3,"3.5 Stars.This book started out grabbing my attention and had a lot of interesting information throughout. The author did a good job of explaining his enthusiasm for why he decided to spend his life finding out about the stuff that matters and what makes our world work when a lot of people don't really take the time to even think about it. After a while, this book lost it's luster for me. It kind of had a textbook feel and it was hard to keep my interest. Don't get me wrong, the information he conveys is still very good, makes a lot of good points and is quite interesting the way he explains it, but for me, it just felt like it was time to read something else. Some of it I had already learned about in college, and then some of it was new. I'm glad to see someone like this author is so excited about things in the background, the chemistry behind it all, including the inventors and just the ""stuff that matters,""the things that shape our world, including man-made things (like steel items being made after they discovered how to make steel, etc), (what makes things happen, both in the past and today.) If you like those sorts of things, this might be a good book for you to read, as he communicates very well as a writer and you would probably enjoy it."

Extraordinarily clear, engaging, well written historic-scientific-engineering-social-aesthetic discussion of ten materials that surround us: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastics, glass, graphite, porcelain, and implants. How chocolate gets from a raw cocoa bean that ""tastes horrible"" and is ""fibrous, woody, bitter, and bland"" to a substance that has been scientifically demonstrated to be ""far more intense and longer lasting"" and all-around ""better"" than kissing. How a human can now hold a piece of sky in her hand, why the origin of plastic is, as the Music Man said: ""a pool table, don't you understand?"", how stainless steel heals itself like skin so that in fact we never actually have to taste it while eating from it every day. ""The possibility that whole objects might be wired up throughout, as if permeated by an entire nervous system, is now . . . conceivable. . . . One day whole rooms, buildings, perhaps even bridges may generate their own energy, funnel it to where it is needed, detect damage, and self-heal. If this seems like science fiction, bear in mind that it is only what living materials do already.""And it contains a screen play and a love letter to the author from his wife.

The tone is light and fluffy, without much substance, as Miodownik makes his point that micro and nano scale structures create the material properties of the macro world that we inhabit, skips through the history of the material, and how we find it pleasing today. The chapter on carbon, with a futuristic look towards the properties of graphene is the strongest. The chapter on plastic is a tragic waste, a fictionalized tale around late 19th celluloid, rather than any kind of thoughtful look at the most innovative, flexible, and environmentally dangerous of modern materials."

Stuff matters takes an interestingly scientific look at the materials that we use from day to day and adds emotional values to these seemingly mundane stuff. The most powerful quote from the book: ""We occupy multiple worlds: the material and immaterial - which is world of our thoughts and perception"". Moidownik does well to expand upon the immaterial/psychic world of materials and adds to the flavor of individual experiences. Although the book can get very technical and texty, there are many interesting anecdotes and I am glad I have been able to power through it. "

How the world around us operate on different levels? Why metals are so different yet someone somewhere thought to categorise them as such? These kind of questions pop into my head on a daily basis. This fascinating book does little to satisfy my curiosity, instead, it enlarged it significantly! Instead of finding answers (which I have to admit that I did) an endless wave of new questions popped in about the Material world. I'm fascinated more than ever before about why materials have such interesting and mind boggling properties and characteristics.This book is absolutely worth the read and I deeply appreciated the nudge it gave to my curiosity."

I found this work quite informative and a surprisingly entertaining read!However, as much as I appreciate « science books » that don’t read very « serious » I found that, while this book accomplished that mission perfectly, it also lacked some fundamental information. The chapters about Steel and Plastic precisely were a huge disappointment to me.

From paper to porcelain, concrete to chocolate, we are engaged in a whirlwind tour to explore ten commonplace materials in its holistic entirety. On a macro-level, we learn about its discovery, evolution and application. On a micro-level, its atomic structure, nanostructure and microstructure. We are exposed to not just what matter is made of, but why it matters. The author connects the performance of a material to its performative qualities. That material is more than just form and function but a medium through which art and emotions are expressed. The study of material science is not just facts and observations, the garnering of scientific knowledge to learn about the physical world and how its components work. Society and science along with its derivative, technology, are not separate disciplines but are synergistic in shaping this world we live in. An example is the Dives in Misericordia, a beautiful and modern Roman church built with self-cleaning concrete. The titanium dioxide in this concrete will absorb UV light to create free radical ions, which breaks down dirt and reduce the level of nitrogen oxide in the air produced by cars. The author stated that this “opens up the possibility that in the future buildings and roads may not be purely passive; they may purify the air much like plants”. Beyond structural and aesthetics purposes, concrete is utilized to positively affect the environment and its inhabitants. In the finale chapter aptly titled “Synthesis”, the author reinforces the book’s message, “It is hard to overestimate the philosophical as well as the technological importance of this dictum of materials science: that knowing the basic chemical composition is not enough to understand materiality.

Graphite is “Unbreakable”, steel is “Indomitable”, glass is ""Invisible"" and chocolate is “Delicious”, for example. It seems counter-intuitive to have any material attributes boxed in with just one word, clever as it may be. After all, has it not been expounded that matter is more than just a mass of atoms? That it has far-reaching philosophical implications that are not easily defined. No matter. There is something for everyone in this book. The author’s narrative style has the easy manner of a popular high school science teacher who brings cool back to geek. A non-science reader will appreciate the complexity of science broken down into layman terms, whereas a science reader will appreciate how the author has made complex science relatable for the general audience. Take paper, for example. The simplest of materials presented in the book. Paper is a product of chemical reactions (de-lignification, bleach, calcium carbonate) on physical matter (tree cellulose fibers) using a technique refined from 2,000 years ago. So? Paper is just paper until we write words on it and give it content. Long after the ink fades and the paper dissolves, the intent of the words remain forever immortalized in our hearts and minds. As exemplified by the author’s sharing of two important pieces of paper - the first, a letter written by his grandfather to the British Home Office to request the (successful) extraction of his son from Germany prior to WWI and the second, a lovely card from his then-girlfriend (now wife) thanking him for a memorable first date. Stuff Matters is not a serious science book by any measure. Those are called textbooks. To be studied.

115,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20069551-davide-nole,5,"The ideal popular science book for me.Basically I can only say great things about this book:- It engages the reader from the very first page, due to the fact that it's basically a series of short stories about the author. So the reader is led in a journey hand in hand with Mark, and he feels like he's there with him, talking about materials and MM's relation with them- It goes in depth, scientifically speaking. That is awesome, for a book as short as this one (about 250 pages), the fact that the author was able to condense the required knowledge in those pages is quite remarkable, and I do want him to write again (please)- It is not repetitive, which is something I wasn't really expecting, since the structure of the book is basically divided by the materials the author is talking about. The fact that MM changes format every time helps the reader a lot and makes the book a fun read and a very interesting one.I could go on forever telling everything I liked of this book, but I feel like the three things I listed are the most important ones, as they probably are three main points that every prospicient reader may want to address, when talking about a popular science book."

117,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356453-anetq,5,"This is an awesome book for anyone who is interested in how the world is put together - literally! Through chapters on 10 different materials the book not only teach the history and properties of the different materials, but also a lesson in scales, some of the chemistry that hold it together and ultimately nanoscience (with a nod to quantum mechanics) - I can actually say, that I now understand what nanoscience is about, whereas before it was only odd science fictioney things I've seen but not understood the workings of (like the self-assembling materials from MIT and that atom-level movie.And this through reading stories about china making it to Europe, how chocolate melts in your mouth and the amazing powers of reinforced concrete through the chemical magic of cement. Very enlightening and a fun read! (Having mixed concrete and melted a lot of chocolate in my mouth only made it better off course.)Now the nit-picky comments: There were a few annoyances.When reading the chapter on paper I kept wondering if it was a ten year old book - because even if the 10 material stories are personal ones, I can hardly remember a time with all those paper materials. ""Back of the envelope"" is a concept I do remember, but bills have been electronic for years on end in Denmark, so I never have en envelope lying around and rarely see a printed newspaper - I do realize, I'm on the tech end of things, but I certainly don't see reading books as being an important tactile experience - actually I much prefer a light Kindle to a large classic (possibly musty smelling) tome. (Have recently been putting off Don Quixote as I only have an unbearable one-volume paper brick-version of it!) The Author is definitely much more of a paper romantic!Another thing: The British connection. It's fine with local flavor (like the odd relationship with tea in porcelain), but for most materials, the year of the technology's arrival to the british isles really is of no use whatsoever for us non-brits, when someone else invented, found or made it usefull, maybe just leave it there?"
118,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,5,"Material science is not really my topic. I had a brief stint as a chemistry enthusiast when I was 14 and that died out as soon as I hit high school. Plus it's not reaaaally the sexiest topic, is it?Mark Miodownik begs to differ. The book is structured into 10 chapters, each preceded by the same picture of the author drinking his coffee on the terrace and then exploring one of the materials you can see in the picture. A cute gimmick that sets the tone for the chapters themselves, each structured differently. My favorite was the chapter on paper, which sprinkled some emotional, autobiographical bits in with the explanations on different types of paper. My least favorite, the one on plastics, was supposed to be a play starring the main people involved in creating the family of materials, but read artificially and relied on lengthy footnotes where the good stuff was.Excepting this minor hiccup, however, Stuff Matters was one of the most enlightening books I've read in a good while. The best part about it is Miodownik's ability to explain pretty complex notions in very simple terms, requiring little to no previous knowledge and even managing to create a bit of intrigue. (Or, at least, what I interpreted as intrigue. When discussing glass, he mentions how atoms are mostly empty space; therefore, he argues, it's not surprising that glass is transparent, but rather than almost everything else isn't. I was literally on the edge of my seat there, and not only because it was an uncomfortable airport seat.)I strongly, warmly recommend it to anyone who's really just curious about stuff. Maybe not to material science majors, though."
119,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Mark Miodownik writes in a conversational style about materials, using history, personal anecdotes and concise science facts to explain what the everyday stuff we use to eat, sit on, read and work in is made of. Despite the easygoing explanations, he is a man who knows 'stuff'. Miodownik is a professor at University College in London, which has an extensive materials library.He has logically organized by chapter facts and stories of a particular material, such as paper, steel, cement, rubber, glass, foam, chocolate and denim. There are simple, but understandable hand-drawings as well as photos.One of the things I learned about cement is some cement is being experimentally infused with a type of bacteria which eats starch that has been embedded into the original cement; and soon the little buggers are defecating mineral calcite, a component of cement. Thus, 'self-healing' cement was invented, with bacteria reducing structural cement cracks which occur over time! While proven to work in the lab, I guess commercial versions are in the future. Still, cement excreting bacteria curing the problem of the deterioration of reinforced cement tickles my sense of the absurd! Scientists are wonderful.The level of science is the kind professors teach to art majors, so I suspect the book will not satisfy STEM readers. However, it is a cute little book with cute little stories about amazing materials we use everyday casually and thoughtlessly. Who knew knowing 'stuff' could be fascinating? Pun intended, gentle reader ; )"

Our physical lives are enabled by the various materials that make up the things around us, and they are not much appreciated. Every chapter in this book is about a different material, its history and how it affects our day-to-day. You will learn a lot of random interesting facts, but also gain a new appreciation for the things around you. Whole empires were literally built on advancements in the material sciences, and it seems that there are still large leaps to be made in this field. "

He tells the stories of each element in regards to his own life, which is a nice personal touch in what would otherwise be dry subject matter. I didn't find every element nearly as compelling as the author made it out to be (despite his obvious enthusiasm for each one), but it was still an enjoyable short listen.Michael Page is one of the reasons I listened to this book. He's been the narrator of three other (fiction) books I've listened to, all of which I enjoyed. He has great range and I just enjoy his voice. Usually you don't see a narrator of this caliper for a nonfiction book.Final verdict: 4 star story, 5 star narration, 4 stars overall"
127,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16767917-sherri,4,"I'm not sure what made me decide to listen to this book. It's not like I was looking around hoping to find a book about concrete (or paper, or graphite or glass or any of the other materials covered in this book). But here's the thing, it was fascinating. No lie. My regard for Miodownik grew with every word. It didn't matter if he was taking about--concrete, glass, paper chocolate, lead, gels -- he made it all interesting and relatable. It made me so much more aware of the the materials around me and our physical and emotional relationship to them. This should be a must read for architects, engineers, artists, and designers of all kinds, and a great read for everyone else. Miodownik is sentimental and passionate about his subjects, sometimes to the extreme. He talks about chocolate like he is practically making love to it (and that's only a slight exaggeration). Even so, I didn't mind his self-indulgent high drama because it felt sincere (not contrived), and because it's hard not to admire someone who has so much enthusiasm for his subjects. "
128,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"Mark Miodownik presents the history and science behind everyday materials, including some edible ones. The author's style is conversational and light, yet hard science is presented in an understandable way. For example, there isn't a whole lot of difference between a diamond and graphite, other than the chemical bonding properties of four electrons in the outer shell of each carbon atom. (By the way a diamond isn't forever, which I believe is another fallacy of a certain ad campaign.) Hand drawn diagrams are included in many chapters, which I found to be helpful even though the illustrations are not fancy.Most of the ""stuff"" included in the book were all inspired by a single photo of the author, sitting at a table and reading a book while sipping (what I assume to be) tea. There were a few materials in the photo that weren't included, such as denim, but that is a trivial gripe. 4.5 stars and recommended to most everyone. Even if you don't care to read it for any other reason, borrow it from the library and enjoy the chapters about chocolate, paper and books."
129,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"I found this very irritating.

131,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34979490-akshay,5,"I can not appreciate enough how analytical and curious Mark Miodownik is. He has real love for finding out how stuff is by design. This book is a love letter to various materials by a curious nerd.In this book he goes over several basic day to day elements such as paper, glass, plastic, concrete etc. But the details are not boring. The structure includes brief introduction via personal experiences with the material, brief anecdotal history, detailed physical/chemical properties of the material, it’s various types and practical applications.I specially enjoyed following chapters and found some information really interesting:a) Steel:1. Pyramids were built using copper chisels. They were required to be sharpened every 2-3 blows.2. Mr, Gillette democratized shaving by introducing use and throw blades.3. Metals are crystals and are sharpening blade is just rearranging of crystals.b) Paper: 1. is a merely 2000yr technology2. is made of Cellulose fibres.3. Why does it get yellow over time? a chemical exposed to sun oxidizes.4. scroll vs book. Romans created codex or book structure. Before that Chinese, who invented paper always used scrolls.5. Paper bends because cellulose fibre break where bent while others stay intact6. Thermal paper used so that cash registers never run out of ink.7. Money is most seductive in paper form. Literal manifestation of trust in economic system.c) Concrete1. Concrete is a living breathing thing.2. Takes any shape, mixes with steel in a as homogeneous body. 3. Concrete can crack. Water entering concrete can rusk the steel inside. The remedy is introduction of bacteria that in contact with air generates calcite, closing the gapsd) Chocolate.1. Material poem!2. Benefits, antioxidants. Mayan people discovered. They drank chocolate as it would melt otherwise.e) Aerogel: 1. Aerogels are Liquid trapped in solid. made from Collagen.2. Typically light gets scattered on entering atmosphere . Blue gets scattered more because of shorter wavelength hence sky is blue.3. Aerogels have Thermal insulation.4. Kisler formed Monsanto with a plan to use his patented Santogel commercially. Didn’t work- look what monsanto has become now!5. NASA had successful space mission to collect stardusk. They used giant tennis rackets and aerosols f) Plastic 1. Celluloid 2. Discovered when backyard scientists were finding replacement of ivory used in billiards game balls.3. Used films strips. Imagine world without plastic. Drag!g) glass1. Electrons repositioning and light entering makes it possible for glass to be transparent2. Romans invented windows. Before it was open air3. Colored glasses were status symbols. Explains why old churches have those.4. Pyrex- boro-silicate. It is immune to thermal shock5. Opaque materials were used for drinking, conducting chemical experiments etc6. before glass- drinks were served in opaque containers. Pilsner lager - is a light better looking beer done with Bottom fermenting . looked better in glass.7. Toughened glass- windscreen. atoms in high tension. laminated glass. toughened glass with plastic laminate.8. Bulletproof glass has several layers of plastic and glass. As bullet hits one layer, gets blunt, and repeats to next layer1 layer- protects from 0.22 mm3 layer - 0.378 layer - AK-47 bullet etch) Diamond/Carbon/ Graphite1. Pencil has graphite2. Carbon dating - age of fossils3. Diamond when burned in vacuum forms graphite. Diamond is not forever. Pretty good marketing though4. Graphene is atomically thin layer of graphite. Strongest material known to man."
132,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56498788-allan-olley,4,"This book is an engaging look at the world of materials science. Each chapter is an examination of a different material (including such materials as concrete and paper) that explains its physical and molecular structure and briefly summarizes the history of its manufacture and use. While the focus of the book is on building materials and other utilitarian substances there is a chapter devoted to chocolate and explaining how its material properties relate to its appeal.The book is not overly detailed, but does bring some up some interesting facts and trivia about the materials. It is also peppered with the author's enthusiasm for materials starting with his boyhood encounter with a mugger wielding a steel razor blade that first led him to marvel at the different stuff all around us. This enthusiasm can seem a bit over the top at times (as when he laments that aerogels might only be used for utilitarian insulative features and not their other remarkable properties), but its general effect is to inspire interest in the materials he explains and praises.The narrator's crisp neutral British accent is ideal for dealing the technical details of this book, doubly so because the other is a himself a Brit (although he has lived off and on in the USA and elsewhere). The narrator pronounces the English name of element 13 atomic number 13 as Aluminum and not Aluminium as one might expect."
133,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25849610-deb,3,"3.5 Stars.This book started out grabbing my attention and had a lot of interesting information throughout. The author did a good job of explaining his enthusiasm for why he decided to spend his life finding out about the stuff that matters and what makes our world work when a lot of people don't really take the time to even think about it. After a while, this book lost it's luster for me. It kind of had a textbook feel and it was hard to keep my interest. Don't get me wrong, the information he conveys is still very good, makes a lot of good points and is quite interesting the way he explains it, but for me, it just felt like it was time to read something else. Some of it I had already learned about in college, and then some of it was new. I'm glad to see someone like this author is so excited about things in the background, the chemistry behind it all, including the inventors and just the ""stuff that matters,""the things that shape our world, including man-made things (like steel items being made after they discovered how to make steel, etc), (what makes things happen, both in the past and today.) If you like those sorts of things, this might be a good book for you to read, as he communicates very well as a writer and you would probably enjoy it."

Extraordinarily clear, engaging, well written historic-scientific-engineering-social-aesthetic discussion of ten materials that surround us: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastics, glass, graphite, porcelain, and implants. How chocolate gets from a raw cocoa bean that ""tastes horrible"" and is ""fibrous, woody, bitter, and bland"" to a substance that has been scientifically demonstrated to be ""far more intense and longer lasting"" and all-around ""better"" than kissing. How a human can now hold a piece of sky in her hand, why the origin of plastic is, as the Music Man said: ""a pool table, don't you understand?"", how stainless steel heals itself like skin so that in fact we never actually have to taste it while eating from it every day. ""The possibility that whole objects might be wired up throughout, as if permeated by an entire nervous system, is now . . . conceivable. . . . One day whole rooms, buildings, perhaps even bridges may generate their own energy, funnel it to where it is needed, detect damage, and self-heal.

The tone is light and fluffy, without much substance, as Miodownik makes his point that micro and nano scale structures create the material properties of the macro world that we inhabit, skips through the history of the material, and how we find it pleasing today. The chapter on carbon, with a futuristic look towards the properties of graphene is the strongest. The chapter on plastic is a tragic waste, a fictionalized tale around late 19th celluloid, rather than any kind of thoughtful look at the most innovative, flexible, and environmentally dangerous of modern materials."

Stuff matters takes an interestingly scientific look at the materials that we use from day to day and adds emotional values to these seemingly mundane stuff. The most powerful quote from the book: ""We occupy multiple worlds: the material and immaterial - which is world of our thoughts and perception"". Moidownik does well to expand upon the immaterial/psychic world of materials and adds to the flavor of individual experiences. Although the book can get very technical and texty, there are many interesting anecdotes and I am glad I have been able to power through it. "

How the world around us operate on different levels? Why metals are so different yet someone somewhere thought to categorise them as such? These kind of questions pop into my head on a daily basis. This fascinating book does little to satisfy my curiosity, instead, it enlarged it significantly! Instead of finding answers (which I have to admit that I did) an endless wave of new questions popped in about the Material world. I'm fascinated more than ever before about why materials have such interesting and mind boggling properties and characteristics.This book is absolutely worth the read and I deeply appreciated the nudge it gave to my curiosity."

The chapters about Steel and Plastic precisely were a huge disappointment to me.

142,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34550725-alfred-haplo,4,"The title of the book, Stuff Matters, encapsulates the core message. From paper to porcelain, concrete to chocolate, we are engaged in a whirlwind tour to explore ten commonplace materials in its holistic entirety. On a macro-level, we learn about its discovery, evolution and application. On a micro-level, its atomic structure, nanostructure and microstructure. We are exposed to not just what matter is made of, but why it matters. The author connects the performance of a material to its performative qualities. That material is more than just form and function but a medium through which art and emotions are expressed. The study of material science is not just facts and observations, the garnering of scientific knowledge to learn about the physical world and how its components work. Society and science along with its derivative, technology, are not separate disciplines but are synergistic in shaping this world we live in. An example is the Dives in Misericordia, a beautiful and modern Roman church built with self-cleaning concrete. The titanium dioxide in this concrete will absorb UV light to create free radical ions, which breaks down dirt and reduce the level of nitrogen oxide in the air produced by cars. The author stated that this “opens up the possibility that in the future buildings and roads may not be purely passive; they may purify the air much like plants”. Beyond structural and aesthetics purposes, concrete is utilized to positively affect the environment and its inhabitants. In the finale chapter aptly titled “Synthesis”, the author reinforces the book’s message, “It is hard to overestimate the philosophical as well as the technological importance of this dictum of materials science: that knowing the basic chemical composition is not enough to understand materiality. It is, after all, what makes the modern world possible.””Because of this strong connection between the materials and their social role, the materials that we favor, the materials that we surround ourselves with, are significant to us. They mean something, they embody our ideals, they give us part of our identity.”But, ah. We are getting ahead of ourselves! Let us go back to the beginning. A materials scientist and engineer, Dr Mark Miodownik’s fascination with material science first began as an epiphany. His back had encountered a razor sharp material - specifically, a steel blade - held by someone with ill-intent. That accident left the author with an indelible impression of how materials can, and have, changed his life. It is on this premise that each chapter is written, and is populated with personal vignettes interspersed with scientific facts.At times, the author tries too hard with the creative presentations. The chapter on plastic was written in the format of a movie script which was… a valiant attempt. Each chapter is assigned an adjective to capture the essence of the material. Graphite is “Unbreakable”, steel is “Indomitable”, glass is ""Invisible"" and chocolate is “Delicious”, for example. It seems counter-intuitive to have any material attributes boxed in with just one word, clever as it may be. After all, has it not been expounded that matter is more than just a mass of atoms? That it has far-reaching philosophical implications that are not easily defined. No matter. There is something for everyone in this book. The author’s narrative style has the easy manner of a popular high school science teacher who brings cool back to geek. A non-science reader will appreciate the complexity of science broken down into layman terms, whereas a science reader will appreciate how the author has made complex science relatable for the general audience. Take paper, for example. The simplest of materials presented in the book. Paper is a product of chemical reactions (de-lignification, bleach, calcium carbonate) on physical matter (tree cellulose fibers) using a technique refined from 2,000 years ago. So? Paper is just paper until we write words on it and give it content. Long after the ink fades and the paper dissolves, the intent of the words remain forever immortalized in our hearts and minds. As exemplified by the author’s sharing of two important pieces of paper - the first, a letter written by his grandfather to the British Home Office to request the (successful) extraction of his son from Germany prior to WWI and the second, a lovely card from his then-girlfriend (now wife) thanking him for a memorable first date. Stuff Matters is not a serious science book by any measure. Those are called textbooks. To be studied. This book has the right spirit of fun and pop culture, with enough science information to make us more aware of the world we live in. Overall, a highly recommended read."

So the reader is led in a journey hand in hand with Mark, and he feels like he's there with him, talking about materials and MM's relation with them- It goes in depth, scientifically speaking. That is awesome, for a book as short as this one (about 250 pages), the fact that the author was able to condense the required knowledge in those pages is quite remarkable, and I do want him to write again (please)- It is not repetitive, which is something I wasn't really expecting, since the structure of the book is basically divided by the materials the author is talking about. The fact that MM changes format every time helps the reader a lot and makes the book a fun read and a very interesting one.I could go on forever telling everything I liked of this book, but I feel like the three things I listed are the most important ones, as they probably are three main points that every prospicient reader may want to address, when talking about a popular science book."

Through chapters on 10 different materials the book not only teach the history and properties of the different materials, but also a lesson in scales, some of the chemistry that hold it together and ultimately nanoscience (with a nod to quantum mechanics) - I can actually say, that I now understand what nanoscience is about, whereas before it was only odd science fictioney things I've seen but not understood the workings of (like the self-assembling materials from MIT and that atom-level movie.And this through reading stories about china making it to Europe, how chocolate melts in your mouth and the amazing powers of reinforced concrete through the chemical magic of cement. Very enlightening and a fun read! (Having mixed concrete and melted a lot of chocolate in my mouth only made it better off course.)Now the nit-picky comments: There were a few annoyances.When reading the chapter on paper I kept wondering if it was a ten year old book - because even if the 10 material stories are personal ones, I can hardly remember a time with all those paper materials. ""Back of the envelope"" is a concept I do remember, but bills have been electronic for years on end in Denmark, so I never have en envelope lying around and rarely see a printed newspaper - I do realize, I'm on the tech end of things, but I certainly don't see reading books as being an important tactile experience - actually I much prefer a light Kindle to a large classic (possibly musty smelling) tome. (Have recently been putting off Don Quixote as I only have an unbearable one-volume paper brick-version of it!) The Author is definitely much more of a paper romantic!Another thing: The British connection. It's fine with local flavor (like the odd relationship with tea in porcelain), but for most materials, the year of the technology's arrival to the british isles really is of no use whatsoever for us non-brits, when someone else invented, found or made it usefull, maybe just leave it there?"
148,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,5,"Material science is not really my topic. I had a brief stint as a chemistry enthusiast when I was 14 and that died out as soon as I hit high school. Plus it's not reaaaally the sexiest topic, is it?Mark Miodownik begs to differ. The book is structured into 10 chapters, each preceded by the same picture of the author drinking his coffee on the terrace and then exploring one of the materials you can see in the picture. A cute gimmick that sets the tone for the chapters themselves, each structured differently. My favorite was the chapter on paper, which sprinkled some emotional, autobiographical bits in with the explanations on different types of paper. My least favorite, the one on plastics, was supposed to be a play starring the main people involved in creating the family of materials, but read artificially and relied on lengthy footnotes where the good stuff was.Excepting this minor hiccup, however, Stuff Matters was one of the most enlightening books I've read in a good while. The best part about it is Miodownik's ability to explain pretty complex notions in very simple terms, requiring little to no previous knowledge and even managing to create a bit of intrigue. (Or, at least, what I interpreted as intrigue. When discussing glass, he mentions how atoms are mostly empty space; therefore, he argues, it's not surprising that glass is transparent, but rather than almost everything else isn't. I was literally on the edge of my seat there, and not only because it was an uncomfortable airport seat.)I strongly, warmly recommend it to anyone who's really just curious about stuff. Maybe not to material science majors, though."
149,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Mark Miodownik writes in a conversational style about materials, using history, personal anecdotes and concise science facts to explain what the everyday stuff we use to eat, sit on, read and work in is made of. Despite the easygoing explanations, he is a man who knows 'stuff'. Miodownik is a professor at University College in London, which has an extensive materials library.He has logically organized by chapter facts and stories of a particular material, such as paper, steel, cement, rubber, glass, foam, chocolate and denim. There are simple, but understandable hand-drawings as well as photos.One of the things I learned about cement is some cement is being experimentally infused with a type of bacteria which eats starch that has been embedded into the original cement; and soon the little buggers are defecating mineral calcite, a component of cement. Thus, 'self-healing' cement was invented, with bacteria reducing structural cement cracks which occur over time! While proven to work in the lab, I guess commercial versions are in the future. Still, cement excreting bacteria curing the problem of the deterioration of reinforced cement tickles my sense of the absurd! Scientists are wonderful.The level of science is the kind professors teach to art majors, so I suspect the book will not satisfy STEM readers. However, it is a cute little book with cute little stories about amazing materials we use everyday casually and thoughtlessly. Who knew knowing 'stuff' could be fascinating? Pun intended, gentle reader ; )"

Overall everything in this book absolutely blew my mind! All the things that we use in our day to day lives are most definitely being over looked. Stuff matters really opened my eyes to all the complexity that surrounds us. I wish that the writing was a little more clear and precise, but overall this book was very cool."

This is a science book - a book illuminating the fascinating scientific facts about everyday materials that surround us. However, it's at the same time poetic and anecdotal, as the author injects his life stories and creativity into the presentation of the materials. A very delightful read! "
153,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26517939-bouke,5,"This book will make you look at the physical world in a very different way. Our physical lives are enabled by the various materials that make up the things around us, and they are not much appreciated. Every chapter in this book is about a different material, its history and how it affects our day-to-day. You will learn a lot of random interesting facts, but also gain a new appreciation for the things around you. Whole empires were literally built on advancements in the material sciences, and it seems that there are still large leaps to be made in this field. "
154,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,4,"An interesting look at material science, although 4 stars might be too generous. Call it 3.5 but I’ll round up. Miodownik profiles a number of different materials that have prominent places in our lives, and bases it off a picture of himself having tea on a rooftop garden of his London flat. The specific materials are:SteelPaper (probably my least favorite chapter)ConcreteChocolateFoam (aerogels)PlasticGlassGraphitePorcelainImplanted materials like titanium"
155,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25115364-arunkrishnan,5,The author provides a concise explanation of the origins of materials that we come across on out daily lives. An intuitive understanding is gained about the reason behind the behavior of materials.
156,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29075798-adam,4,"Review of the audiobook narrated by Michael Page.There are some super interesting facts and details about materials (iron, cement, glass, etc) which we take for granted. He tells the stories of each element in regards to his own life, which is a nice personal touch in what would otherwise be dry subject matter. I didn't find every element nearly as compelling as the author made it out to be (despite his obvious enthusiasm for each one), but it was still an enjoyable short listen.Michael Page is one of the reasons I listened to this book. He's been the narrator of three other (fiction) books I've listened to, all of which I enjoyed. He has great range and I just enjoy his voice. Usually you don't see a narrator of this caliper for a nonfiction book.Final verdict: 4 star story, 5 star narration, 4 stars overall"
157,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16767917-sherri,4,"I'm not sure what made me decide to listen to this book. It's not like I was looking around hoping to find a book about concrete (or paper, or graphite or glass or any of the other materials covered in this book). But here's the thing, it was fascinating. No lie. My regard for Miodownik grew with every word. It didn't matter if he was taking about--concrete, glass, paper chocolate, lead, gels -- he made it all interesting and relatable. It made me so much more aware of the the materials around me and our physical and emotional relationship to them. This should be a must read for architects, engineers, artists, and designers of all kinds, and a great read for everyone else. Miodownik is sentimental and passionate about his subjects, sometimes to the extreme. He talks about chocolate like he is practically making love to it (and that's only a slight exaggeration). Even so, I didn't mind his self-indulgent high drama because it felt sincere (not contrived), and because it's hard not to admire someone who has so much enthusiasm for his subjects. "
158,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"Mark Miodownik presents the history and science behind everyday materials, including some edible ones. The author's style is conversational and light, yet hard science is presented in an understandable way. For example, there isn't a whole lot of difference between a diamond and graphite, other than the chemical bonding properties of four electrons in the outer shell of each carbon atom. (By the way a diamond isn't forever, which I believe is another fallacy of a certain ad campaign.) Hand drawn diagrams are included in many chapters, which I found to be helpful even though the illustrations are not fancy.Most of the ""stuff"" included in the book were all inspired by a single photo of the author, sitting at a table and reading a book while sipping (what I assume to be) tea. There were a few materials in the photo that weren't included, such as denim, but that is a trivial gripe. 4.5 stars and recommended to most everyone. Even if you don't care to read it for any other reason, borrow it from the library and enjoy the chapters about chocolate, paper and books."
159,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"I found this very irritating. The explanations were circular non-explanations: paper is like paper because it's made of the stuff that paper is made of and babies like to play with it, isn't that super!I much preferred the following book on similar themes:

The history of ""regular"" every day things such as plastic, glass, and even other things such as graphite were mind blowing and fascinating (who knew that graphene is poised to make the silicon chip obsolete?). Anybody with an interest in materials or quantum mechanics should check this book out. It is accessible and even funny and a very good read."
161,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34979490-akshay,5,"I can not appreciate enough how analytical and curious Mark Miodownik is. He has real love for finding out how stuff is by design. This book is a love letter to various materials by a curious nerd.In this book he goes over several basic day to day elements such as paper, glass, plastic, concrete etc. But the details are not boring. The structure includes brief introduction via personal experiences with the material, brief anecdotal history, detailed physical/chemical properties of the material, it’s various types and practical applications.I specially enjoyed following chapters and found some information really interesting:a) Steel:1. Pyramids were built using copper chisels. They were required to be sharpened every 2-3 blows.2. Mr, Gillette democratized shaving by introducing use and throw blades.3. Metals are crystals and are sharpening blade is just rearranging of crystals.b) Paper: 1. is a merely 2000yr technology2. is made of Cellulose fibres.3. Why does it get yellow over time? a chemical exposed to sun oxidizes.4. scroll vs book. Romans created codex or book structure. Before that Chinese, who invented paper always used scrolls.5. Paper bends because cellulose fibre break where bent while others stay intact6. Thermal paper used so that cash registers never run out of ink.7. Money is most seductive in paper form. Literal manifestation of trust in economic system.c) Concrete1. Concrete is a living breathing thing.2. Takes any shape, mixes with steel in a as homogeneous body. 3. Concrete can crack. Water entering concrete can rusk the steel inside. The remedy is introduction of bacteria that in contact with air generates calcite, closing the gapsd) Chocolate.1. Material poem!2. Benefits, antioxidants. Mayan people discovered. They drank chocolate as it would melt otherwise.e) Aerogel: 1. Aerogels are Liquid trapped in solid. made from Collagen.2. Typically light gets scattered on entering atmosphere . Blue gets scattered more because of shorter wavelength hence sky is blue.3. Aerogels have Thermal insulation.4. Kisler formed Monsanto with a plan to use his patented Santogel commercially. Didn’t work- look what monsanto has become now!5. NASA had successful space mission to collect stardusk. They used giant tennis rackets and aerosols f) Plastic 1. Celluloid 2. Discovered when backyard scientists were finding replacement of ivory used in billiards game balls.3. Used films strips. Imagine world without plastic. Drag!g) glass1. Electrons repositioning and light entering makes it possible for glass to be transparent2. Romans invented windows. Before it was open air3. Colored glasses were status symbols. Explains why old churches have those.4. Pyrex- boro-silicate. It is immune to thermal shock5. Opaque materials were used for drinking, conducting chemical experiments etc6. before glass- drinks were served in opaque containers. Pilsner lager - is a light better looking beer done with Bottom fermenting . looked better in glass.7. Toughened glass- windscreen. atoms in high tension. laminated glass. toughened glass with plastic laminate.8. Bulletproof glass has several layers of plastic and glass. As bullet hits one layer, gets blunt, and repeats to next layer1 layer- protects from 0.22 mm3 layer - 0.378 layer - AK-47 bullet etch) Diamond/Carbon/ Graphite1. Pencil has graphite2. Carbon dating - age of fossils3. Diamond when burned in vacuum forms graphite. Diamond is not forever. Pretty good marketing though4. Graphene is atomically thin layer of graphite. Strongest material known to man."
162,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56498788-allan-olley,4,"This book is an engaging look at the world of materials science. Each chapter is an examination of a different material (including such materials as concrete and paper) that explains its physical and molecular structure and briefly summarizes the history of its manufacture and use. While the focus of the book is on building materials and other utilitarian substances there is a chapter devoted to chocolate and explaining how its material properties relate to its appeal.The book is not overly detailed, but does bring some up some interesting facts and trivia about the materials. It is also peppered with the author's enthusiasm for materials starting with his boyhood encounter with a mugger wielding a steel razor blade that first led him to marvel at the different stuff all around us. This enthusiasm can seem a bit over the top at times (as when he laments that aerogels might only be used for utilitarian insulative features and not their other remarkable properties), but its general effect is to inspire interest in the materials he explains and praises.The narrator's crisp neutral British accent is ideal for dealing the technical details of this book, doubly so because the other is a himself a Brit (although he has lived off and on in the USA and elsewhere). The narrator pronounces the English name of element 13 atomic number 13 as Aluminum and not Aluminium as one might expect."
163,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25849610-deb,3,"3.5 Stars.This book started out grabbing my attention and had a lot of interesting information throughout. The author did a good job of explaining his enthusiasm for why he decided to spend his life finding out about the stuff that matters and what makes our world work when a lot of people don't really take the time to even think about it. After a while, this book lost it's luster for me. It kind of had a textbook feel and it was hard to keep my interest. Don't get me wrong, the information he conveys is still very good, makes a lot of good points and is quite interesting the way he explains it, but for me, it just felt like it was time to read something else. Some of it I had already learned about in college, and then some of it was new. I'm glad to see someone like this author is so excited about things in the background, the chemistry behind it all, including the inventors and just the ""stuff that matters,""the things that shape our world, including man-made things (like steel items being made after they discovered how to make steel, etc), (what makes things happen, both in the past and today.) If you like those sorts of things, this might be a good book for you to read, as he communicates very well as a writer and you would probably enjoy it."

Extraordinarily clear, engaging, well written historic-scientific-engineering-social-aesthetic discussion of ten materials that surround us: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastics, glass, graphite, porcelain, and implants. How chocolate gets from a raw cocoa bean that ""tastes horrible"" and is ""fibrous, woody, bitter, and bland"" to a substance that has been scientifically demonstrated to be ""far more intense and longer lasting"" and all-around ""better"" than kissing. How a human can now hold a piece of sky in her hand, why the origin of plastic is, as the Music Man said: ""a pool table, don't you understand?"", how stainless steel heals itself like skin so that in fact we never actually have to taste it while eating from it every day. ""The possibility that whole objects might be wired up throughout, as if permeated by an entire nervous system, is now . . . conceivable. . . . One day whole rooms, buildings, perhaps even bridges may generate their own energy, funnel it to where it is needed, detect damage, and self-heal. If this seems like science fiction, bear in mind that it is only what living materials do already.""And it contains a screen play and a love letter to the author from his wife.

The tone is light and fluffy, without much substance, as Miodownik makes his point that micro and nano scale structures create the material properties of the macro world that we inhabit, skips through the history of the material, and how we find it pleasing today. The chapter on carbon, with a futuristic look towards the properties of graphene is the strongest. The chapter on plastic is a tragic waste, a fictionalized tale around late 19th celluloid, rather than any kind of thoughtful look at the most innovative, flexible, and environmentally dangerous of modern materials."
166,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45592244-mehdi-hassan,4,"If the great Bill Gates had not mentioned this, I would have never touched this. Stuff matters takes an interestingly scientific look at the materials that we use from day to day and adds emotional values to these seemingly mundane stuff. The most powerful quote from the book: ""We occupy multiple worlds: the material and immaterial - which is world of our thoughts and perception"". Moidownik does well to expand upon the immaterial/psychic world of materials and adds to the flavor of individual experiences. Although the book can get very technical and texty, there are many interesting anecdotes and I am glad I have been able to power through it. "

How the world around us operate on different levels? Why metals are so different yet someone somewhere thought to categorise them as such? These kind of questions pop into my head on a daily basis. This fascinating book does little to satisfy my curiosity, instead, it enlarged it significantly! Instead of finding answers (which I have to admit that I did) an endless wave of new questions popped in about the Material world. I'm fascinated more than ever before about why materials have such interesting and mind boggling properties and characteristics.This book is absolutely worth the read and I deeply appreciated the nudge it gave to my curiosity."

I found this work quite informative and a surprisingly entertaining read!However, as much as I appreciate « science books » that don’t read very « serious » I found that, while this book accomplished that mission perfectly, it also lacked some fundamental information. The chapters about Steel and Plastic precisely were a huge disappointment to me. So I think this would provide a great   starting ground   for the curious about everyday materials and how they evolved through time. "

172,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34550725-alfred-haplo,4,"The title of the book, Stuff Matters, encapsulates the core message. From paper to porcelain, concrete to chocolate, we are engaged in a whirlwind tour to explore ten commonplace materials in its holistic entirety. On a macro-level, we learn about its discovery, evolution and application. On a micro-level, its atomic structure, nanostructure and microstructure. We are exposed to not just what matter is made of, but why it matters. The author connects the performance of a material to its performative qualities. That material is more than just form and function but a medium through which art and emotions are expressed. The study of material science is not just facts and observations, the garnering of scientific knowledge to learn about the physical world and how its components work. Society and science along with its derivative, technology, are not separate disciplines but are synergistic in shaping this world we live in. An example is the Dives in Misericordia, a beautiful and modern Roman church built with self-cleaning concrete. The titanium dioxide in this concrete will absorb UV light to create free radical ions, which breaks down dirt and reduce the level of nitrogen oxide in the air produced by cars. The author stated that this “opens up the possibility that in the future buildings and roads may not be purely passive; they may purify the air much like plants”. Beyond structural and aesthetics purposes, concrete is utilized to positively affect the environment and its inhabitants. In the finale chapter aptly titled “Synthesis”, the author reinforces the book’s message, “It is hard to overestimate the philosophical as well as the technological importance of this dictum of materials science: that knowing the basic chemical composition is not enough to understand materiality. It is, after all, what makes the modern world possible.””Because of this strong connection between the materials and their social role, the materials that we favor, the materials that we surround ourselves with, are significant to us. They mean something, they embody our ideals, they give us part of our identity.”But, ah. We are getting ahead of ourselves! Let us go back to the beginning. A materials scientist and engineer, Dr Mark Miodownik’s fascination with material science first began as an epiphany. His back had encountered a razor sharp material - specifically, a steel blade - held by someone with ill-intent. That accident left the author with an indelible impression of how materials can, and have, changed his life. It is on this premise that each chapter is written, and is populated with personal vignettes interspersed with scientific facts.At times, the author tries too hard with the creative presentations. The chapter on plastic was written in the format of a movie script which was… a valiant attempt. Each chapter is assigned an adjective to capture the essence of the material. Graphite is “Unbreakable”, steel is “Indomitable”, glass is ""Invisible"" and chocolate is “Delicious”, for example. It seems counter-intuitive to have any material attributes boxed in with just one word, clever as it may be. After all, has it not been expounded that matter is more than just a mass of atoms? That it has far-reaching philosophical implications that are not easily defined. No matter. There is something for everyone in this book. The author’s narrative style has the easy manner of a popular high school science teacher who brings cool back to geek. A non-science reader will appreciate the complexity of science broken down into layman terms, whereas a science reader will appreciate how the author has made complex science relatable for the general audience. Take paper, for example. The simplest of materials presented in the book. Paper is a product of chemical reactions (de-lignification, bleach, calcium carbonate) on physical matter (tree cellulose fibers) using a technique refined from 2,000 years ago. So? Paper is just paper until we write words on it and give it content. Long after the ink fades and the paper dissolves, the intent of the words remain forever immortalized in our hearts and minds. As exemplified by the author’s sharing of two important pieces of paper - the first, a letter written by his grandfather to the British Home Office to request the (successful) extraction of his son from Germany prior to WWI and the second, a lovely card from his then-girlfriend (now wife) thanking him for a memorable first date. Stuff Matters is not a serious science book by any measure. Those are called textbooks. To be studied. This book has the right spirit of fun and pop culture, with enough science information to make us more aware of the world we live in. Overall, a highly recommended read."
173,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23509975-b-rbara,5,I know for certain that I've acquired super powers and now I can recognize every bit of material and its properties in any room.

So if you have any inner nerd in you that can geek out to chemistry, nanostructures, the materials we use in everyday life, etc...you will enjoy this well written, thoughtful, often humorous book. The final chapter is philosophical gold. "
175,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20069551-davide-nole,5,"The ideal popular science book for me.Basically I can only say great things about this book:- It engages the reader from the very first page, due to the fact that it's basically a series of short stories about the author. So the reader is led in a journey hand in hand with Mark, and he feels like he's there with him, talking about materials and MM's relation with them- It goes in depth, scientifically speaking. That is awesome, for a book as short as this one (about 250 pages), the fact that the author was able to condense the required knowledge in those pages is quite remarkable, and I do want him to write again (please)- It is not repetitive, which is something I wasn't really expecting, since the structure of the book is basically divided by the materials the author is talking about. The fact that MM changes format every time helps the reader a lot and makes the book a fun read and a very interesting one.I could go on forever telling everything I liked of this book, but I feel like the three things I listed are the most important ones, as they probably are three main points that every prospicient reader may want to address, when talking about a popular science book."

177,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356453-anetq,5,"This is an awesome book for anyone who is interested in how the world is put together - literally! Through chapters on 10 different materials the book not only teach the history and properties of the different materials, but also a lesson in scales, some of the chemistry that hold it together and ultimately nanoscience (with a nod to quantum mechanics) - I can actually say, that I now understand what nanoscience is about, whereas before it was only odd science fictioney things I've seen but not understood the workings of (like the self-assembling materials from MIT and that atom-level movie.And this through reading stories about china making it to Europe, how chocolate melts in your mouth and the amazing powers of reinforced concrete through the chemical magic of cement. Very enlightening and a fun read! (Having mixed concrete and melted a lot of chocolate in my mouth only made it better off course.)Now the nit-picky comments: There were a few annoyances.When reading the chapter on paper I kept wondering if it was a ten year old book - because even if the 10 material stories are personal ones, I can hardly remember a time with all those paper materials. ""Back of the envelope"" is a concept I do remember, but bills have been electronic for years on end in Denmark, so I never have en envelope lying around and rarely see a printed newspaper - I do realize, I'm on the tech end of things, but I certainly don't see reading books as being an important tactile experience - actually I much prefer a light Kindle to a large classic (possibly musty smelling) tome. (Have recently been putting off Don Quixote as I only have an unbearable one-volume paper brick-version of it!) The Author is definitely much more of a paper romantic!Another thing: The British connection. It's fine with local flavor (like the odd relationship with tea in porcelain), but for most materials, the year of the technology's arrival to the british isles really is of no use whatsoever for us non-brits, when someone else invented, found or made it usefull, maybe just leave it there?"
178,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,5,"Material science is not really my topic. I had a brief stint as a chemistry enthusiast when I was 14 and that died out as soon as I hit high school. Plus it's not reaaaally the sexiest topic, is it?Mark Miodownik begs to differ. The book is structured into 10 chapters, each preceded by the same picture of the author drinking his coffee on the terrace and then exploring one of the materials you can see in the picture. A cute gimmick that sets the tone for the chapters themselves, each structured differently. My favorite was the chapter on paper, which sprinkled some emotional, autobiographical bits in with the explanations on different types of paper. My least favorite, the one on plastics, was supposed to be a play starring the main people involved in creating the family of materials, but read artificially and relied on lengthy footnotes where the good stuff was.Excepting this minor hiccup, however, Stuff Matters was one of the most enlightening books I've read in a good while. The best part about it is Miodownik's ability to explain pretty complex notions in very simple terms, requiring little to no previous knowledge and even managing to create a bit of intrigue. (Or, at least, what I interpreted as intrigue. When discussing glass, he mentions how atoms are mostly empty space; therefore, he argues, it's not surprising that glass is transparent, but rather than almost everything else isn't. I was literally on the edge of my seat there, and not only because it was an uncomfortable airport seat.)I strongly, warmly recommend it to anyone who's really just curious about stuff. Maybe not to material science majors, though."
179,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Mark Miodownik writes in a conversational style about materials, using history, personal anecdotes and concise science facts to explain what the everyday stuff we use to eat, sit on, read and work in is made of. Despite the easygoing explanations, he is a man who knows 'stuff'. Miodownik is a professor at University College in London, which has an extensive materials library.He has logically organized by chapter facts and stories of a particular material, such as paper, steel, cement, rubber, glass, foam, chocolate and denim. There are simple, but understandable hand-drawings as well as photos.One of the things I learned about cement is some cement is being experimentally infused with a type of bacteria which eats starch that has been embedded into the original cement; and soon the little buggers are defecating mineral calcite, a component of cement. Thus, 'self-healing' cement was invented, with bacteria reducing structural cement cracks which occur over time! While proven to work in the lab, I guess commercial versions are in the future. Still, cement excreting bacteria curing the problem of the deterioration of reinforced cement tickles my sense of the absurd! Scientists are wonderful.The level of science is the kind professors teach to art majors, so I suspect the book will not satisfy STEM readers. However, it is a cute little book with cute little stories about amazing materials we use everyday casually and thoughtlessly. Who knew knowing 'stuff' could be fascinating? Pun intended, gentle reader ; )"

Overall everything in this book absolutely blew my mind! All the things that we use in our day to day lives are most definitely being over looked. Stuff matters really opened my eyes to all the complexity that surrounds us. I wish that the writing was a little more clear and precise, but overall this book was very cool."

This is a science book - a book illuminating the fascinating scientific facts about everyday materials that surround us. However, it's at the same time poetic and anecdotal, as the author injects his life stories and creativity into the presentation of the materials. A very delightful read! "

Our physical lives are enabled by the various materials that make up the things around us, and they are not much appreciated. Every chapter in this book is about a different material, its history and how it affects our day-to-day. You will learn a lot of random interesting facts, but also gain a new appreciation for the things around you. Whole empires were literally built on advancements in the material sciences, and it seems that there are still large leaps to be made in this field. "

He tells the stories of each element in regards to his own life, which is a nice personal touch in what would otherwise be dry subject matter. I didn't find every element nearly as compelling as the author made it out to be (despite his obvious enthusiasm for each one), but it was still an enjoyable short listen.Michael Page is one of the reasons I listened to this book. He's been the narrator of three other (fiction) books I've listened to, all of which I enjoyed. He has great range and I just enjoy his voice. Usually you don't see a narrator of this caliper for a nonfiction book.Final verdict: 4 star story, 5 star narration, 4 stars overall"
187,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16767917-sherri,4,"I'm not sure what made me decide to listen to this book. It's not like I was looking around hoping to find a book about concrete (or paper, or graphite or glass or any of the other materials covered in this book). But here's the thing, it was fascinating. No lie. My regard for Miodownik grew with every word. It didn't matter if he was taking about--concrete, glass, paper chocolate, lead, gels -- he made it all interesting and relatable. It made me so much more aware of the the materials around me and our physical and emotional relationship to them. This should be a must read for architects, engineers, artists, and designers of all kinds, and a great read for everyone else. Miodownik is sentimental and passionate about his subjects, sometimes to the extreme. He talks about chocolate like he is practically making love to it (and that's only a slight exaggeration). Even so, I didn't mind his self-indulgent high drama because it felt sincere (not contrived), and because it's hard not to admire someone who has so much enthusiasm for his subjects. "
188,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"Mark Miodownik presents the history and science behind everyday materials, including some edible ones. The author's style is conversational and light, yet hard science is presented in an understandable way. For example, there isn't a whole lot of difference between a diamond and graphite, other than the chemical bonding properties of four electrons in the outer shell of each carbon atom. (By the way a diamond isn't forever, which I believe is another fallacy of a certain ad campaign.) Hand drawn diagrams are included in many chapters, which I found to be helpful even though the illustrations are not fancy.Most of the ""stuff"" included in the book were all inspired by a single photo of the author, sitting at a table and reading a book while sipping (what I assume to be) tea. There were a few materials in the photo that weren't included, such as denim, but that is a trivial gripe. 4.5 stars and recommended to most everyone. Even if you don't care to read it for any other reason, borrow it from the library and enjoy the chapters about chocolate, paper and books."
189,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"I found this very irritating. The explanations were circular non-explanations: paper is like paper because it's made of the stuff that paper is made of and babies like to play with it, isn't that super!I much preferred the following book on similar themes:

The history of ""regular"" every day things such as plastic, glass, and even other things such as graphite were mind blowing and fascinating (who knew that graphene is poised to make the silicon chip obsolete?). Anybody with an interest in materials or quantum mechanics should check this book out. It is accessible and even funny and a very good read."
191,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34979490-akshay,5,"I can not appreciate enough how analytical and curious Mark Miodownik is. He has real love for finding out how stuff is by design. This book is a love letter to various materials by a curious nerd.In this book he goes over several basic day to day elements such as paper, glass, plastic, concrete etc. But the details are not boring. The structure includes brief introduction via personal experiences with the material, brief anecdotal history, detailed physical/chemical properties of the material, it’s various types and practical applications.I specially enjoyed following chapters and found some information really interesting:a) Steel:1. Pyramids were built using copper chisels. They were required to be sharpened every 2-3 blows.2. Mr, Gillette democratized shaving by introducing use and throw blades.3. Metals are crystals and are sharpening blade is just rearranging of crystals.b) Paper: 1. is a merely 2000yr technology2. is made of Cellulose fibres.3. Why does it get yellow over time? a chemical exposed to sun oxidizes.4. scroll vs book. Romans created codex or book structure. Before that Chinese, who invented paper always used scrolls.5. Paper bends because cellulose fibre break where bent while others stay intact6. Thermal paper used so that cash registers never run out of ink.7. Money is most seductive in paper form. Literal manifestation of trust in economic system.c) Concrete1. Concrete is a living breathing thing.2. Takes any shape, mixes with steel in a as homogeneous body. 3. Concrete can crack. Water entering concrete can rusk the steel inside. The remedy is introduction of bacteria that in contact with air generates calcite, closing the gapsd) Chocolate.1. Material poem!2. Benefits, antioxidants. Mayan people discovered. They drank chocolate as it would melt otherwise.e) Aerogel: 1. Aerogels are Liquid trapped in solid. made from Collagen.2. Typically light gets scattered on entering atmosphere . Blue gets scattered more because of shorter wavelength hence sky is blue.3. Aerogels have Thermal insulation.4. Kisler formed Monsanto with a plan to use his patented Santogel commercially. Didn’t work- look what monsanto has become now!5. NASA had successful space mission to collect stardusk. They used giant tennis rackets and aerosols f) Plastic 1. Celluloid 2. Discovered when backyard scientists were finding replacement of ivory used in billiards game balls.3. Used films strips. Imagine world without plastic. Drag!g) glass1. Electrons repositioning and light entering makes it possible for glass to be transparent2. Romans invented windows. Before it was open air3. Colored glasses were status symbols. Explains why old churches have those.4. Pyrex- boro-silicate. It is immune to thermal shock5. Opaque materials were used for drinking, conducting chemical experiments etc6. before glass- drinks were served in opaque containers. Pilsner lager - is a light better looking beer done with Bottom fermenting . looked better in glass.7. Toughened glass- windscreen. atoms in high tension. laminated glass. toughened glass with plastic laminate.8. Bulletproof glass has several layers of plastic and glass. As bullet hits one layer, gets blunt, and repeats to next layer1 layer- protects from 0.22 mm3 layer - 0.378 layer - AK-47 bullet etch) Diamond/Carbon/ Graphite1. Pencil has graphite2. Carbon dating - age of fossils3. Diamond when burned in vacuum forms graphite. Diamond is not forever. Pretty good marketing though4. Graphene is atomically thin layer of graphite. Strongest material known to man."
192,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56498788-allan-olley,4,"This book is an engaging look at the world of materials science. Each chapter is an examination of a different material (including such materials as concrete and paper) that explains its physical and molecular structure and briefly summarizes the history of its manufacture and use. While the focus of the book is on building materials and other utilitarian substances there is a chapter devoted to chocolate and explaining how its material properties relate to its appeal.The book is not overly detailed, but does bring some up some interesting facts and trivia about the materials. It is also peppered with the author's enthusiasm for materials starting with his boyhood encounter with a mugger wielding a steel razor blade that first led him to marvel at the different stuff all around us. This enthusiasm can seem a bit over the top at times (as when he laments that aerogels might only be used for utilitarian insulative features and not their other remarkable properties), but its general effect is to inspire interest in the materials he explains and praises.The narrator's crisp neutral British accent is ideal for dealing the technical details of this book, doubly so because the other is a himself a Brit (although he has lived off and on in the USA and elsewhere). The narrator pronounces the English name of element 13 atomic number 13 as Aluminum and not Aluminium as one might expect."
193,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25849610-deb,3,"3.5 Stars.This book started out grabbing my attention and had a lot of interesting information throughout. The author did a good job of explaining his enthusiasm for why he decided to spend his life finding out about the stuff that matters and what makes our world work when a lot of people don't really take the time to even think about it. After a while, this book lost it's luster for me. It kind of had a textbook feel and it was hard to keep my interest. Don't get me wrong, the information he conveys is still very good, makes a lot of good points and is quite interesting the way he explains it, but for me, it just felt like it was time to read something else. Some of it I had already learned about in college, and then some of it was new. I'm glad to see someone like this author is so excited about things in the background, the chemistry behind it all, including the inventors and just the ""stuff that matters,""the things that shape our world, including man-made things (like steel items being made after they discovered how to make steel, etc), (what makes things happen, both in the past and today.) If you like those sorts of things, this might be a good book for you to read, as he communicates very well as a writer and you would probably enjoy it."

Extraordinarily clear, engaging, well written historic-scientific-engineering-social-aesthetic discussion of ten materials that surround us: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastics, glass, graphite, porcelain, and implants. How chocolate gets from a raw cocoa bean that ""tastes horrible"" and is ""fibrous, woody, bitter, and bland"" to a substance that has been scientifically demonstrated to be ""far more intense and longer lasting"" and all-around ""better"" than kissing. How a human can now hold a piece of sky in her hand, why the origin of plastic is, as the Music Man said: ""a pool table, don't you understand?"", how stainless steel heals itself like skin so that in fact we never actually have to taste it while eating from it every day. ""The possibility that whole objects might be wired up throughout, as if permeated by an entire nervous system, is now . . . conceivable. . . . One day whole rooms, buildings, perhaps even bridges may generate their own energy, funnel it to where it is needed, detect damage, and self-heal.

The tone is light and fluffy, without much substance, as Miodownik makes his point that micro and nano scale structures create the material properties of the macro world that we inhabit, skips through the history of the material, and how we find it pleasing today. The chapter on carbon, with a futuristic look towards the properties of graphene is the strongest. The chapter on plastic is a tragic waste, a fictionalized tale around late 19th celluloid, rather than any kind of thoughtful look at the most innovative, flexible, and environmentally dangerous of modern materials."
196,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45592244-mehdi-hassan,4,"If the great Bill Gates had not mentioned this, I would have never touched this. Stuff matters takes an interestingly scientific look at the materials that we use from day to day and adds emotional values to these seemingly mundane stuff. The most powerful quote from the book: ""We occupy multiple worlds: the material and immaterial - which is world of our thoughts and perception"". Moidownik does well to expand upon the immaterial/psychic world of materials and adds to the flavor of individual experiences. Although the book can get very technical and texty, there are many interesting anecdotes and I am glad I have been able to power through it. "

How the world around us operate on different levels? Why metals are so different yet someone somewhere thought to categorise them as such? These kind of questions pop into my head on a daily basis. This fascinating book does little to satisfy my curiosity, instead, it enlarged it significantly! Instead of finding answers (which I have to admit that I did) an endless wave of new questions popped in about the Material world. I'm fascinated more than ever before about why materials have such interesting and mind boggling properties and characteristics.This book is absolutely worth the read and I deeply appreciated the nudge it gave to my curiosity."

I found this work quite informative and a surprisingly entertaining read!However, as much as I appreciate « science books » that don’t read very « serious » I found that, while this book accomplished that mission perfectly, it also lacked some fundamental information. The chapters about Steel and Plastic precisely were a huge disappointment to me.

202,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34550725-alfred-haplo,4,"The title of the book, Stuff Matters, encapsulates the core message. From paper to porcelain, concrete to chocolate, we are engaged in a whirlwind tour to explore ten commonplace materials in its holistic entirety. On a macro-level, we learn about its discovery, evolution and application. On a micro-level, its atomic structure, nanostructure and microstructure. We are exposed to not just what matter is made of, but why it matters. The author connects the performance of a material to its performative qualities. That material is more than just form and function but a medium through which art and emotions are expressed. The study of material science is not just facts and observations, the garnering of scientific knowledge to learn about the physical world and how its components work. Society and science along with its derivative, technology, are not separate disciplines but are synergistic in shaping this world we live in. An example is the Dives in Misericordia, a beautiful and modern Roman church built with self-cleaning concrete. The titanium dioxide in this concrete will absorb UV light to create free radical ions, which breaks down dirt and reduce the level of nitrogen oxide in the air produced by cars. The author stated that this “opens up the possibility that in the future buildings and roads may not be purely passive; they may purify the air much like plants”. Beyond structural and aesthetics purposes, concrete is utilized to positively affect the environment and its inhabitants. In the finale chapter aptly titled “Synthesis”, the author reinforces the book’s message, “It is hard to overestimate the philosophical as well as the technological importance of this dictum of materials science: that knowing the basic chemical composition is not enough to understand materiality. It is, after all, what makes the modern world possible.””Because of this strong connection between the materials and their social role, the materials that we favor, the materials that we surround ourselves with, are significant to us. They mean something, they embody our ideals, they give us part of our identity.”But, ah. We are getting ahead of ourselves! Let us go back to the beginning. A materials scientist and engineer, Dr Mark Miodownik’s fascination with material science first began as an epiphany. His back had encountered a razor sharp material - specifically, a steel blade - held by someone with ill-intent. That accident left the author with an indelible impression of how materials can, and have, changed his life. It is on this premise that each chapter is written, and is populated with personal vignettes interspersed with scientific facts.At times, the author tries too hard with the creative presentations. The chapter on plastic was written in the format of a movie script which was… a valiant attempt. Each chapter is assigned an adjective to capture the essence of the material. Graphite is “Unbreakable”, steel is “Indomitable”, glass is ""Invisible"" and chocolate is “Delicious”, for example. It seems counter-intuitive to have any material attributes boxed in with just one word, clever as it may be. After all, has it not been expounded that matter is more than just a mass of atoms? That it has far-reaching philosophical implications that are not easily defined. No matter. There is something for everyone in this book. The author’s narrative style has the easy manner of a popular high school science teacher who brings cool back to geek. A non-science reader will appreciate the complexity of science broken down into layman terms, whereas a science reader will appreciate how the author has made complex science relatable for the general audience. Take paper, for example. The simplest of materials presented in the book. Paper is a product of chemical reactions (de-lignification, bleach, calcium carbonate) on physical matter (tree cellulose fibers) using a technique refined from 2,000 years ago. So? Paper is just paper until we write words on it and give it content. Long after the ink fades and the paper dissolves, the intent of the words remain forever immortalized in our hearts and minds. As exemplified by the author’s sharing of two important pieces of paper - the first, a letter written by his grandfather to the British Home Office to request the (successful) extraction of his son from Germany prior to WWI and the second, a lovely card from his then-girlfriend (now wife) thanking him for a memorable first date. Stuff Matters is not a serious science book by any measure. Those are called textbooks. To be studied. This book has the right spirit of fun and pop culture, with enough science information to make us more aware of the world we live in. Overall, a highly recommended read."
203,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23509975-b-rbara,5,I know for certain that I've acquired super powers and now I can recognize every bit of material and its properties in any room.

So if you have any inner nerd in you that can geek out to chemistry, nanostructures, the materials we use in everyday life, etc...you will enjoy this well written, thoughtful, often humorous book. The final chapter is philosophical gold. "
205,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20069551-davide-nole,5,"The ideal popular science book for me.Basically I can only say great things about this book:- It engages the reader from the very first page, due to the fact that it's basically a series of short stories about the author. So the reader is led in a journey hand in hand with Mark, and he feels like he's there with him, talking about materials and MM's relation with them- It goes in depth, scientifically speaking. That is awesome, for a book as short as this one (about 250 pages), the fact that the author was able to condense the required knowledge in those pages is quite remarkable, and I do want him to write again (please)- It is not repetitive, which is something I wasn't really expecting, since the structure of the book is basically divided by the materials the author is talking about. The fact that MM changes format every time helps the reader a lot and makes the book a fun read and a very interesting one.I could go on forever telling everything I liked of this book, but I feel like the three things I listed are the most important ones, as they probably are three main points that every prospicient reader may want to address, when talking about a popular science book."

207,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356453-anetq,5,"This is an awesome book for anyone who is interested in how the world is put together - literally! Through chapters on 10 different materials the book not only teach the history and properties of the different materials, but also a lesson in scales, some of the chemistry that hold it together and ultimately nanoscience (with a nod to quantum mechanics) - I can actually say, that I now understand what nanoscience is about, whereas before it was only odd science fictioney things I've seen but not understood the workings of (like the self-assembling materials from MIT and that atom-level movie.And this through reading stories about china making it to Europe, how chocolate melts in your mouth and the amazing powers of reinforced concrete through the chemical magic of cement. Very enlightening and a fun read! (Having mixed concrete and melted a lot of chocolate in my mouth only made it better off course.)Now the nit-picky comments: There were a few annoyances.When reading the chapter on paper I kept wondering if it was a ten year old book - because even if the 10 material stories are personal ones, I can hardly remember a time with all those paper materials. ""Back of the envelope"" is a concept I do remember, but bills have been electronic for years on end in Denmark, so I never have en envelope lying around and rarely see a printed newspaper - I do realize, I'm on the tech end of things, but I certainly don't see reading books as being an important tactile experience - actually I much prefer a light Kindle to a large classic (possibly musty smelling) tome. (Have recently been putting off Don Quixote as I only have an unbearable one-volume paper brick-version of it!) The Author is definitely much more of a paper romantic!Another thing: The British connection. It's fine with local flavor (like the odd relationship with tea in porcelain), but for most materials, the year of the technology's arrival to the british isles really is of no use whatsoever for us non-brits, when someone else invented, found or made it usefull, maybe just leave it there?"
208,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,5,"Material science is not really my topic. I had a brief stint as a chemistry enthusiast when I was 14 and that died out as soon as I hit high school. Plus it's not reaaaally the sexiest topic, is it?Mark Miodownik begs to differ. The book is structured into 10 chapters, each preceded by the same picture of the author drinking his coffee on the terrace and then exploring one of the materials you can see in the picture. A cute gimmick that sets the tone for the chapters themselves, each structured differently. My favorite was the chapter on paper, which sprinkled some emotional, autobiographical bits in with the explanations on different types of paper. My least favorite, the one on plastics, was supposed to be a play starring the main people involved in creating the family of materials, but read artificially and relied on lengthy footnotes where the good stuff was.Excepting this minor hiccup, however, Stuff Matters was one of the most enlightening books I've read in a good while. The best part about it is Miodownik's ability to explain pretty complex notions in very simple terms, requiring little to no previous knowledge and even managing to create a bit of intrigue. (Or, at least, what I interpreted as intrigue. When discussing glass, he mentions how atoms are mostly empty space; therefore, he argues, it's not surprising that glass is transparent, but rather than almost everything else isn't. I was literally on the edge of my seat there, and not only because it was an uncomfortable airport seat.)I strongly, warmly recommend it to anyone who's really just curious about stuff. Maybe not to material science majors, though."

Despite the easygoing explanations, he is a man who knows 'stuff'. Miodownik is a professor at University College in London, which has an extensive materials library.He has logically organized by chapter facts and stories of a particular material, such as paper, steel, cement, rubber, glass, foam, chocolate and denim. There are simple, but understandable hand-drawings as well as photos.One of the things I learned about cement is some cement is being experimentally infused with a type of bacteria which eats starch that has been embedded into the original cement; and soon the little buggers are defecating mineral calcite, a component of cement. Thus, 'self-healing' cement was invented, with bacteria reducing structural cement cracks which occur over time! While proven to work in the lab, I guess commercial versions are in the future. Still, cement excreting bacteria curing the problem of the deterioration of reinforced cement tickles my sense of the absurd! Scientists are wonderful.The level of science is the kind professors teach to art majors, so I suspect the book will not satisfy STEM readers. However, it is a cute little book with cute little stories about amazing materials we use everyday casually and thoughtlessly. Who knew knowing 'stuff' could be fascinating?

Overall everything in this book absolutely blew my mind! All the things that we use in our day to day lives are most definitely being over looked. Stuff matters really opened my eyes to all the complexity that surrounds us. I wish that the writing was a little more clear and precise, but overall this book was very cool."

This is a science book - a book illuminating the fascinating scientific facts about everyday materials that surround us. However, it's at the same time poetic and anecdotal, as the author injects his life stories and creativity into the presentation of the materials. A very delightful read! "
213,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26517939-bouke,5,"This book will make you look at the physical world in a very different way. Our physical lives are enabled by the various materials that make up the things around us, and they are not much appreciated. Every chapter in this book is about a different material, its history and how it affects our day-to-day. You will learn a lot of random interesting facts, but also gain a new appreciation for the things around you. Whole empires were literally built on advancements in the material sciences, and it seems that there are still large leaps to be made in this field. "

Miodownik profiles a number of different materials that have prominent places in our lives, and bases it off a picture of himself having tea on a rooftop garden of his London flat. The specific materials are:SteelPaper (probably my least favorite chapter)ConcreteChocolateFoam (aerogels)PlasticGlassGraphitePorcelainImplanted materials like titanium"

216,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29075798-adam,4,"Review of the audiobook narrated by Michael Page.There are some super interesting facts and details about materials (iron, cement, glass, etc) which we take for granted. He tells the stories of each element in regards to his own life, which is a nice personal touch in what would otherwise be dry subject matter. I didn't find every element nearly as compelling as the author made it out to be (despite his obvious enthusiasm for each one), but it was still an enjoyable short listen.Michael Page is one of the reasons I listened to this book. He's been the narrator of three other (fiction) books I've listened to, all of which I enjoyed. He has great range and I just enjoy his voice. Usually you don't see a narrator of this caliper for a nonfiction book.Final verdict: 4 star story, 5 star narration, 4 stars overall"
217,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16767917-sherri,4,"I'm not sure what made me decide to listen to this book. It's not like I was looking around hoping to find a book about concrete (or paper, or graphite or glass or any of the other materials covered in this book). But here's the thing, it was fascinating. No lie. My regard for Miodownik grew with every word. It didn't matter if he was taking about--concrete, glass, paper chocolate, lead, gels -- he made it all interesting and relatable. It made me so much more aware of the the materials around me and our physical and emotional relationship to them. This should be a must read for architects, engineers, artists, and designers of all kinds, and a great read for everyone else. Miodownik is sentimental and passionate about his subjects, sometimes to the extreme. He talks about chocolate like he is practically making love to it (and that's only a slight exaggeration). Even so, I didn't mind his self-indulgent high drama because it felt sincere (not contrived), and because it's hard not to admire someone who has so much enthusiasm for his subjects. "
218,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"Mark Miodownik presents the history and science behind everyday materials, including some edible ones. The author's style is conversational and light, yet hard science is presented in an understandable way. For example, there isn't a whole lot of difference between a diamond and graphite, other than the chemical bonding properties of four electrons in the outer shell of each carbon atom. (By the way a diamond isn't forever, which I believe is another fallacy of a certain ad campaign.) Hand drawn diagrams are included in many chapters, which I found to be helpful even though the illustrations are not fancy.Most of the ""stuff"" included in the book were all inspired by a single photo of the author, sitting at a table and reading a book while sipping (what I assume to be) tea. There were a few materials in the photo that weren't included, such as denim, but that is a trivial gripe. 4.5 stars and recommended to most everyone. Even if you don't care to read it for any other reason, borrow it from the library and enjoy the chapters about chocolate, paper and books."
219,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"I found this very irritating. The explanations were circular non-explanations: paper is like paper because it's made of the stuff that paper is made of and babies like to play with it, isn't that super!I much preferred the following book on similar themes:

The history of ""regular"" every day things such as plastic, glass, and even other things such as graphite were mind blowing and fascinating (who knew that graphene is poised to make the silicon chip obsolete?). Anybody with an interest in materials or quantum mechanics should check this book out. It is accessible and even funny and a very good read."
221,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34979490-akshay,5,"I can not appreciate enough how analytical and curious Mark Miodownik is. He has real love for finding out how stuff is by design. This book is a love letter to various materials by a curious nerd.In this book he goes over several basic day to day elements such as paper, glass, plastic, concrete etc. But the details are not boring. The structure includes brief introduction via personal experiences with the material, brief anecdotal history, detailed physical/chemical properties of the material, it’s various types and practical applications.I specially enjoyed following chapters and found some information really interesting:a) Steel:1. Pyramids were built using copper chisels. They were required to be sharpened every 2-3 blows.2. Mr, Gillette democratized shaving by introducing use and throw blades.3. Metals are crystals and are sharpening blade is just rearranging of crystals.b) Paper: 1. is a merely 2000yr technology2. is made of Cellulose fibres.3. Why does it get yellow over time? a chemical exposed to sun oxidizes.4. scroll vs book. Romans created codex or book structure. Before that Chinese, who invented paper always used scrolls.5. Paper bends because cellulose fibre break where bent while others stay intact6. Thermal paper used so that cash registers never run out of ink.7. Money is most seductive in paper form. Literal manifestation of trust in economic system.c) Concrete1. Concrete is a living breathing thing.2. Takes any shape, mixes with steel in a as homogeneous body. 3. Concrete can crack. Water entering concrete can rusk the steel inside. The remedy is introduction of bacteria that in contact with air generates calcite, closing the gapsd) Chocolate.1. Material poem!2. Benefits, antioxidants. Mayan people discovered. They drank chocolate as it would melt otherwise.e) Aerogel: 1. Aerogels are Liquid trapped in solid. made from Collagen.2. Typically light gets scattered on entering atmosphere . Blue gets scattered more because of shorter wavelength hence sky is blue.3. Aerogels have Thermal insulation.4. Kisler formed Monsanto with a plan to use his patented Santogel commercially. Didn’t work- look what monsanto has become now!5. NASA had successful space mission to collect stardusk. They used giant tennis rackets and aerosols f) Plastic 1. Celluloid 2. Discovered when backyard scientists were finding replacement of ivory used in billiards game balls.3. Used films strips. Imagine world without plastic. Drag!g) glass1. Electrons repositioning and light entering makes it possible for glass to be transparent2. Romans invented windows. Before it was open air3. Colored glasses were status symbols. Explains why old churches have those.4. Pyrex- boro-silicate. It is immune to thermal shock5. Opaque materials were used for drinking, conducting chemical experiments etc6. before glass- drinks were served in opaque containers. Pilsner lager - is a light better looking beer done with Bottom fermenting . looked better in glass.7. Toughened glass- windscreen. atoms in high tension. laminated glass. toughened glass with plastic laminate.8. Bulletproof glass has several layers of plastic and glass. As bullet hits one layer, gets blunt, and repeats to next layer1 layer- protects from 0.22 mm3 layer - 0.378 layer - AK-47 bullet etch) Diamond/Carbon/ Graphite1. Pencil has graphite2. Carbon dating - age of fossils3. Diamond when burned in vacuum forms graphite. Diamond is not forever. Pretty good marketing though4. Graphene is atomically thin layer of graphite. Strongest material known to man."
222,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56498788-allan-olley,4,"This book is an engaging look at the world of materials science. Each chapter is an examination of a different material (including such materials as concrete and paper) that explains its physical and molecular structure and briefly summarizes the history of its manufacture and use. While the focus of the book is on building materials and other utilitarian substances there is a chapter devoted to chocolate and explaining how its material properties relate to its appeal.The book is not overly detailed, but does bring some up some interesting facts and trivia about the materials. It is also peppered with the author's enthusiasm for materials starting with his boyhood encounter with a mugger wielding a steel razor blade that first led him to marvel at the different stuff all around us. This enthusiasm can seem a bit over the top at times (as when he laments that aerogels might only be used for utilitarian insulative features and not their other remarkable properties), but its general effect is to inspire interest in the materials he explains and praises.The narrator's crisp neutral British accent is ideal for dealing the technical details of this book, doubly so because the other is a himself a Brit (although he has lived off and on in the USA and elsewhere). The narrator pronounces the English name of element 13 atomic number 13 as Aluminum and not Aluminium as one might expect."
223,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25849610-deb,3,"3.5 Stars.This book started out grabbing my attention and had a lot of interesting information throughout. The author did a good job of explaining his enthusiasm for why he decided to spend his life finding out about the stuff that matters and what makes our world work when a lot of people don't really take the time to even think about it. After a while, this book lost it's luster for me. It kind of had a textbook feel and it was hard to keep my interest. Don't get me wrong, the information he conveys is still very good, makes a lot of good points and is quite interesting the way he explains it, but for me, it just felt like it was time to read something else. Some of it I had already learned about in college, and then some of it was new. I'm glad to see someone like this author is so excited about things in the background, the chemistry behind it all, including the inventors and just the ""stuff that matters,""the things that shape our world, including man-made things (like steel items being made after they discovered how to make steel, etc), (what makes things happen, both in the past and today.) If you like those sorts of things, this might be a good book for you to read, as he communicates very well as a writer and you would probably enjoy it."
224,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763879-martha,4,"Don't miss this. Extraordinarily clear, engaging, well written historic-scientific-engineering-social-aesthetic discussion of ten materials that surround us: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastics, glass, graphite, porcelain, and implants. How chocolate gets from a raw cocoa bean that ""tastes horrible"" and is ""fibrous, woody, bitter, and bland"" to a substance that has been scientifically demonstrated to be ""far more intense and longer lasting"" and all-around ""better"" than kissing. How a human can now hold a piece of sky in her hand, why the origin of plastic is, as the Music Man said: ""a pool table, don't you understand?"", how stainless steel heals itself like skin so that in fact we never actually have to taste it while eating from it every day. ""The possibility that whole objects might be wired up throughout, as if permeated by an entire nervous system, is now . . . conceivable. . . . One day whole rooms, buildings, perhaps even bridges may generate their own energy, funnel it to where it is needed, detect damage, and self-heal. If this seems like science fiction, bear in mind that it is only what living materials do already.""And it contains a screen play and a love letter to the author from his wife. It's really fun and fascinating."
225,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,3,"Stuff Matters is pop material science, organized around ten or so everyday materials visible in a photo of the author in his rooftop garden. The tone is light and fluffy, without much substance, as Miodownik makes his point that micro and nano scale structures create the material properties of the macro world that we inhabit, skips through the history of the material, and how we find it pleasing today. The chapter on carbon, with a futuristic look towards the properties of graphene is the strongest. The chapter on plastic is a tragic waste, a fictionalized tale around late 19th celluloid, rather than any kind of thoughtful look at the most innovative, flexible, and environmentally dangerous of modern materials."
226,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45592244-mehdi-hassan,4,"If the great Bill Gates had not mentioned this, I would have never touched this. Stuff matters takes an interestingly scientific look at the materials that we use from day to day and adds emotional values to these seemingly mundane stuff. The most powerful quote from the book: ""We occupy multiple worlds: the material and immaterial - which is world of our thoughts and perception"". Moidownik does well to expand upon the immaterial/psychic world of materials and adds to the flavor of individual experiences. Although the book can get very technical and texty, there are many interesting anecdotes and I am glad I have been able to power through it. "

How the world around us operate on different levels? Why metals are so different yet someone somewhere thought to categorise them as such? These kind of questions pop into my head on a daily basis. This fascinating book does little to satisfy my curiosity, instead, it enlarged it significantly! Instead of finding answers (which I have to admit that I did) an endless wave of new questions popped in about the Material world. I'm fascinated more than ever before about why materials have such interesting and mind boggling properties and characteristics.This book is absolutely worth the read and I deeply appreciated the nudge it gave to my curiosity."

I found this work quite informative and a surprisingly entertaining read!However, as much as I appreciate « science books » that don’t read very « serious » I found that, while this book accomplished that mission perfectly, it also lacked some fundamental information. The chapters about Steel and Plastic precisely were a huge disappointment to me. So I think this would provide a great   starting ground   for the curious about everyday materials and how they evolved through time. "

232,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34550725-alfred-haplo,4,"The title of the book, Stuff Matters, encapsulates the core message. From paper to porcelain, concrete to chocolate, we are engaged in a whirlwind tour to explore ten commonplace materials in its holistic entirety. On a macro-level, we learn about its discovery, evolution and application. On a micro-level, its atomic structure, nanostructure and microstructure. We are exposed to not just what matter is made of, but why it matters. The author connects the performance of a material to its performative qualities. That material is more than just form and function but a medium through which art and emotions are expressed. The study of material science is not just facts and observations, the garnering of scientific knowledge to learn about the physical world and how its components work. Society and science along with its derivative, technology, are not separate disciplines but are synergistic in shaping this world we live in. An example is the Dives in Misericordia, a beautiful and modern Roman church built with self-cleaning concrete. The titanium dioxide in this concrete will absorb UV light to create free radical ions, which breaks down dirt and reduce the level of nitrogen oxide in the air produced by cars. The author stated that this “opens up the possibility that in the future buildings and roads may not be purely passive; they may purify the air much like plants”. Beyond structural and aesthetics purposes, concrete is utilized to positively affect the environment and its inhabitants. In the finale chapter aptly titled “Synthesis”, the author reinforces the book’s message, “It is hard to overestimate the philosophical as well as the technological importance of this dictum of materials science: that knowing the basic chemical composition is not enough to understand materiality. It is, after all, what makes the modern world possible.””Because of this strong connection between the materials and their social role, the materials that we favor, the materials that we surround ourselves with, are significant to us. They mean something, they embody our ideals, they give us part of our identity.”But, ah. We are getting ahead of ourselves! Let us go back to the beginning. A materials scientist and engineer, Dr Mark Miodownik’s fascination with material science first began as an epiphany. His back had encountered a razor sharp material - specifically, a steel blade - held by someone with ill-intent. That accident left the author with an indelible impression of how materials can, and have, changed his life. It is on this premise that each chapter is written, and is populated with personal vignettes interspersed with scientific facts.At times, the author tries too hard with the creative presentations. The chapter on plastic was written in the format of a movie script which was… a valiant attempt. Each chapter is assigned an adjective to capture the essence of the material. Graphite is “Unbreakable”, steel is “Indomitable”, glass is ""Invisible"" and chocolate is “Delicious”, for example. It seems counter-intuitive to have any material attributes boxed in with just one word, clever as it may be. After all, has it not been expounded that matter is more than just a mass of atoms? That it has far-reaching philosophical implications that are not easily defined. No matter. There is something for everyone in this book. The author’s narrative style has the easy manner of a popular high school science teacher who brings cool back to geek. A non-science reader will appreciate the complexity of science broken down into layman terms, whereas a science reader will appreciate how the author has made complex science relatable for the general audience. Take paper, for example. The simplest of materials presented in the book. Paper is a product of chemical reactions (de-lignification, bleach, calcium carbonate) on physical matter (tree cellulose fibers) using a technique refined from 2,000 years ago. So? Paper is just paper until we write words on it and give it content. Long after the ink fades and the paper dissolves, the intent of the words remain forever immortalized in our hearts and minds. As exemplified by the author’s sharing of two important pieces of paper - the first, a letter written by his grandfather to the British Home Office to request the (successful) extraction of his son from Germany prior to WWI and the second, a lovely card from his then-girlfriend (now wife) thanking him for a memorable first date. Stuff Matters is not a serious science book by any measure. Those are called textbooks. To be studied. This book has the right spirit of fun and pop culture, with enough science information to make us more aware of the world we live in. Overall, a highly recommended read."
233,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23509975-b-rbara,5,I know for certain that I've acquired super powers and now I can recognize every bit of material and its properties in any room. 
234,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3173915-stharris,5,"After finishing this, I changed from 4 to 5 Stars. So if you have any inner nerd in you that can geek out to chemistry, nanostructures, the materials we use in everyday life, etc...you will enjoy this well written, thoughtful, often humorous book. The final chapter is philosophical gold. "
235,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20069551-davide-nole,5,"The ideal popular science book for me.Basically I can only say great things about this book:- It engages the reader from the very first page, due to the fact that it's basically a series of short stories about the author. So the reader is led in a journey hand in hand with Mark, and he feels like he's there with him, talking about materials and MM's relation with them- It goes in depth, scientifically speaking. That is awesome, for a book as short as this one (about 250 pages), the fact that the author was able to condense the required knowledge in those pages is quite remarkable, and I do want him to write again (please)- It is not repetitive, which is something I wasn't really expecting, since the structure of the book is basically divided by the materials the author is talking about. The fact that MM changes format every time helps the reader a lot and makes the book a fun read and a very interesting one.I could go on forever telling everything I liked of this book, but I feel like the three things I listed are the most important ones, as they probably are three main points that every prospicient reader may want to address, when talking about a popular science book."

237,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356453-anetq,5,"This is an awesome book for anyone who is interested in how the world is put together - literally! Through chapters on 10 different materials the book not only teach the history and properties of the different materials, but also a lesson in scales, some of the chemistry that hold it together and ultimately nanoscience (with a nod to quantum mechanics) - I can actually say, that I now understand what nanoscience is about, whereas before it was only odd science fictioney things I've seen but not understood the workings of (like the self-assembling materials from MIT and that atom-level movie.And this through reading stories about china making it to Europe, how chocolate melts in your mouth and the amazing powers of reinforced concrete through the chemical magic of cement. Very enlightening and a fun read! (Having mixed concrete and melted a lot of chocolate in my mouth only made it better off course.)Now the nit-picky comments: There were a few annoyances.When reading the chapter on paper I kept wondering if it was a ten year old book - because even if the 10 material stories are personal ones, I can hardly remember a time with all those paper materials. ""Back of the envelope"" is a concept I do remember, but bills have been electronic for years on end in Denmark, so I never have en envelope lying around and rarely see a printed newspaper - I do realize, I'm on the tech end of things, but I certainly don't see reading books as being an important tactile experience - actually I much prefer a light Kindle to a large classic (possibly musty smelling) tome. (Have recently been putting off Don Quixote as I only have an unbearable one-volume paper brick-version of it!) The Author is definitely much more of a paper romantic!Another thing: The British connection. It's fine with local flavor (like the odd relationship with tea in porcelain), but for most materials, the year of the technology's arrival to the british isles really is of no use whatsoever for us non-brits, when someone else invented, found or made it usefull, maybe just leave it there?"
238,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,5,"Material science is not really my topic. I had a brief stint as a chemistry enthusiast when I was 14 and that died out as soon as I hit high school. Plus it's not reaaaally the sexiest topic, is it?Mark Miodownik begs to differ. The book is structured into 10 chapters, each preceded by the same picture of the author drinking his coffee on the terrace and then exploring one of the materials you can see in the picture. A cute gimmick that sets the tone for the chapters themselves, each structured differently. My favorite was the chapter on paper, which sprinkled some emotional, autobiographical bits in with the explanations on different types of paper. My least favorite, the one on plastics, was supposed to be a play starring the main people involved in creating the family of materials, but read artificially and relied on lengthy footnotes where the good stuff was.Excepting this minor hiccup, however, Stuff Matters was one of the most enlightening books I've read in a good while. The best part about it is Miodownik's ability to explain pretty complex notions in very simple terms, requiring little to no previous knowledge and even managing to create a bit of intrigue. (Or, at least, what I interpreted as intrigue. When discussing glass, he mentions how atoms are mostly empty space; therefore, he argues, it's not surprising that glass is transparent, but rather than almost everything else isn't. I was literally on the edge of my seat there, and not only because it was an uncomfortable airport seat.)I strongly, warmly recommend it to anyone who's really just curious about stuff. Maybe not to material science majors, though."
239,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Mark Miodownik writes in a conversational style about materials, using history, personal anecdotes and concise science facts to explain what the everyday stuff we use to eat, sit on, read and work in is made of. Despite the easygoing explanations, he is a man who knows 'stuff'. Miodownik is a professor at University College in London, which has an extensive materials library.He has logically organized by chapter facts and stories of a particular material, such as paper, steel, cement, rubber, glass, foam, chocolate and denim. There are simple, but understandable hand-drawings as well as photos.One of the things I learned about cement is some cement is being experimentally infused with a type of bacteria which eats starch that has been embedded into the original cement; and soon the little buggers are defecating mineral calcite, a component of cement. Thus, 'self-healing' cement was invented, with bacteria reducing structural cement cracks which occur over time! While proven to work in the lab, I guess commercial versions are in the future. Still, cement excreting bacteria curing the problem of the deterioration of reinforced cement tickles my sense of the absurd! Scientists are wonderful.The level of science is the kind professors teach to art majors, so I suspect the book will not satisfy STEM readers. However, it is a cute little book with cute little stories about amazing materials we use everyday casually and thoughtlessly. Who knew knowing 'stuff' could be fascinating? Pun intended, gentle reader ; )"

He tells the stories of each element in regards to his own life, which is a nice personal touch in what would otherwise be dry subject matter. I didn't find every element nearly as compelling as the author made it out to be (despite his obvious enthusiasm for each one), but it was still an enjoyable short listen.Michael Page is one of the reasons I listened to this book. He's been the narrator of three other (fiction) books I've listened to, all of which I enjoyed. He has great range and I just enjoy his voice. Usually you don't see a narrator of this caliper for a nonfiction book.Final verdict: 4 star story, 5 star narration, 4 stars overall"
247,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16767917-sherri,4,"I'm not sure what made me decide to listen to this book. It's not like I was looking around hoping to find a book about concrete (or paper, or graphite or glass or any of the other materials covered in this book). But here's the thing, it was fascinating. No lie. My regard for Miodownik grew with every word. It didn't matter if he was taking about--concrete, glass, paper chocolate, lead, gels -- he made it all interesting and relatable. It made me so much more aware of the the materials around me and our physical and emotional relationship to them. This should be a must read for architects, engineers, artists, and designers of all kinds, and a great read for everyone else. Miodownik is sentimental and passionate about his subjects, sometimes to the extreme. He talks about chocolate like he is practically making love to it (and that's only a slight exaggeration). Even so, I didn't mind his self-indulgent high drama because it felt sincere (not contrived), and because it's hard not to admire someone who has so much enthusiasm for his subjects. "
248,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,4,"Mark Miodownik presents the history and science behind everyday materials, including some edible ones. The author's style is conversational and light, yet hard science is presented in an understandable way. For example, there isn't a whole lot of difference between a diamond and graphite, other than the chemical bonding properties of four electrons in the outer shell of each carbon atom. (By the way a diamond isn't forever, which I believe is another fallacy of a certain ad campaign.) Hand drawn diagrams are included in many chapters, which I found to be helpful even though the illustrations are not fancy.Most of the ""stuff"" included in the book were all inspired by a single photo of the author, sitting at a table and reading a book while sipping (what I assume to be) tea. There were a few materials in the photo that weren't included, such as denim, but that is a trivial gripe. 4.5 stars and recommended to most everyone. Even if you don't care to read it for any other reason, borrow it from the library and enjoy the chapters about chocolate, paper and books."
249,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"I found this very irritating. The explanations were circular non-explanations: paper is like paper because it's made of the stuff that paper is made of and babies like to play with it, isn't that super!I much preferred the following book on similar themes:

The history of ""regular"" every day things such as plastic, glass, and even other things such as graphite were mind blowing and fascinating (who knew that graphene is poised to make the silicon chip obsolete?). Anybody with an interest in materials or quantum mechanics should check this book out. It is accessible and even funny and a very good read."
251,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34979490-akshay,5,"I can not appreciate enough how analytical and curious Mark Miodownik is. He has real love for finding out how stuff is by design. This book is a love letter to various materials by a curious nerd.In this book he goes over several basic day to day elements such as paper, glass, plastic, concrete etc. But the details are not boring. The structure includes brief introduction via personal experiences with the material, brief anecdotal history, detailed physical/chemical properties of the material, it’s various types and practical applications.I specially enjoyed following chapters and found some information really interesting:a) Steel:1. Pyramids were built using copper chisels. They were required to be sharpened every 2-3 blows.2. Mr, Gillette democratized shaving by introducing use and throw blades.3. Metals are crystals and are sharpening blade is just rearranging of crystals.b) Paper: 1. is a merely 2000yr technology2. is made of Cellulose fibres.3. Why does it get yellow over time? a chemical exposed to sun oxidizes.4. scroll vs book. Romans created codex or book structure. Before that Chinese, who invented paper always used scrolls.5. Paper bends because cellulose fibre break where bent while others stay intact6. Thermal paper used so that cash registers never run out of ink.7. Money is most seductive in paper form. Literal manifestation of trust in economic system.c) Concrete1. Concrete is a living breathing thing.2. Takes any shape, mixes with steel in a as homogeneous body. 3. Concrete can crack. Water entering concrete can rusk the steel inside. The remedy is introduction of bacteria that in contact with air generates calcite, closing the gapsd) Chocolate.1. Material poem!2. Benefits, antioxidants. Mayan people discovered. They drank chocolate as it would melt otherwise.e) Aerogel: 1. Aerogels are Liquid trapped in solid. made from Collagen.2. Typically light gets scattered on entering atmosphere . Blue gets scattered more because of shorter wavelength hence sky is blue.3. Aerogels have Thermal insulation.4. Kisler formed Monsanto with a plan to use his patented Santogel commercially. Didn’t work- look what monsanto has become now!5. NASA had successful space mission to collect stardusk. They used giant tennis rackets and aerosols f) Plastic 1. Celluloid 2. Discovered when backyard scientists were finding replacement of ivory used in billiards game balls.3. Used films strips. Imagine world without plastic. Drag!g) glass1. Electrons repositioning and light entering makes it possible for glass to be transparent2. Romans invented windows. Before it was open air3. Colored glasses were status symbols. Explains why old churches have those.4. Pyrex- boro-silicate. It is immune to thermal shock5. Opaque materials were used for drinking, conducting chemical experiments etc6. before glass- drinks were served in opaque containers. Pilsner lager - is a light better looking beer done with Bottom fermenting . looked better in glass.7. Toughened glass- windscreen. atoms in high tension. laminated glass. toughened glass with plastic laminate.8. Bulletproof glass has several layers of plastic and glass. As bullet hits one layer, gets blunt, and repeats to next layer1 layer- protects from 0.22 mm3 layer - 0.378 layer - AK-47 bullet etch) Diamond/Carbon/ Graphite1. Pencil has graphite2. Carbon dating - age of fossils3. Diamond when burned in vacuum forms graphite. Diamond is not forever. Pretty good marketing though4. Graphene is atomically thin layer of graphite. Strongest material known to man."
252,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56498788-allan-olley,4,"This book is an engaging look at the world of materials science. Each chapter is an examination of a different material (including such materials as concrete and paper) that explains its physical and molecular structure and briefly summarizes the history of its manufacture and use. While the focus of the book is on building materials and other utilitarian substances there is a chapter devoted to chocolate and explaining how its material properties relate to its appeal.The book is not overly detailed, but does bring some up some interesting facts and trivia about the materials. It is also peppered with the author's enthusiasm for materials starting with his boyhood encounter with a mugger wielding a steel razor blade that first led him to marvel at the different stuff all around us. This enthusiasm can seem a bit over the top at times (as when he laments that aerogels might only be used for utilitarian insulative features and not their other remarkable properties), but its general effect is to inspire interest in the materials he explains and praises.The narrator's crisp neutral British accent is ideal for dealing the technical details of this book, doubly so because the other is a himself a Brit (although he has lived off and on in the USA and elsewhere). The narrator pronounces the English name of element 13 atomic number 13 as Aluminum and not Aluminium as one might expect."
253,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25849610-deb,3,"3.5 Stars.This book started out grabbing my attention and had a lot of interesting information throughout. The author did a good job of explaining his enthusiasm for why he decided to spend his life finding out about the stuff that matters and what makes our world work when a lot of people don't really take the time to even think about it. After a while, this book lost it's luster for me. It kind of had a textbook feel and it was hard to keep my interest. Don't get me wrong, the information he conveys is still very good, makes a lot of good points and is quite interesting the way he explains it, but for me, it just felt like it was time to read something else. Some of it I had already learned about in college, and then some of it was new. I'm glad to see someone like this author is so excited about things in the background, the chemistry behind it all, including the inventors and just the ""stuff that matters,""the things that shape our world, including man-made things (like steel items being made after they discovered how to make steel, etc), (what makes things happen, both in the past and today.) If you like those sorts of things, this might be a good book for you to read, as he communicates very well as a writer and you would probably enjoy it."

Extraordinarily clear, engaging, well written historic-scientific-engineering-social-aesthetic discussion of ten materials that surround us: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastics, glass, graphite, porcelain, and implants. How chocolate gets from a raw cocoa bean that ""tastes horrible"" and is ""fibrous, woody, bitter, and bland"" to a substance that has been scientifically demonstrated to be ""far more intense and longer lasting"" and all-around ""better"" than kissing. How a human can now hold a piece of sky in her hand, why the origin of plastic is, as the Music Man said: ""a pool table, don't you understand?"", how stainless steel heals itself like skin so that in fact we never actually have to taste it while eating from it every day. ""The possibility that whole objects might be wired up throughout, as if permeated by an entire nervous system, is now . . . conceivable. . . . One day whole rooms, buildings, perhaps even bridges may generate their own energy, funnel it to where it is needed, detect damage, and self-heal.

255,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,3,"Stuff Matters is pop material science, organized around ten or so everyday materials visible in a photo of the author in his rooftop garden. The tone is light and fluffy, without much substance, as Miodownik makes his point that micro and nano scale structures create the material properties of the macro world that we inhabit, skips through the history of the material, and how we find it pleasing today. The chapter on carbon, with a futuristic look towards the properties of graphene is the strongest. The chapter on plastic is a tragic waste, a fictionalized tale around late 19th celluloid, rather than any kind of thoughtful look at the most innovative, flexible, and environmentally dangerous of modern materials."
256,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45592244-mehdi-hassan,4,"If the great Bill Gates had not mentioned this, I would have never touched this. Stuff matters takes an interestingly scientific look at the materials that we use from day to day and adds emotional values to these seemingly mundane stuff. The most powerful quote from the book: ""We occupy multiple worlds: the material and immaterial - which is world of our thoughts and perception"". Moidownik does well to expand upon the immaterial/psychic world of materials and adds to the flavor of individual experiences. Although the book can get very technical and texty, there are many interesting anecdotes and I am glad I have been able to power through it. "

How the world around us operate on different levels? Why metals are so different yet someone somewhere thought to categorise them as such? These kind of questions pop into my head on a daily basis. This fascinating book does little to satisfy my curiosity, instead, it enlarged it significantly! Instead of finding answers (which I have to admit that I did) an endless wave of new questions popped in about the Material world. I'm fascinated more than ever before about why materials have such interesting and mind boggling properties and characteristics.This book is absolutely worth the read and I deeply appreciated the nudge it gave to my curiosity."

I found this work quite informative and a surprisingly entertaining read!However, as much as I appreciate « science books » that don’t read very « serious » I found that, while this book accomplished that mission perfectly, it also lacked some fundamental information. The chapters about Steel and Plastic precisely were a huge disappointment to me.

262,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34550725-alfred-haplo,4,"The title of the book, Stuff Matters, encapsulates the core message. From paper to porcelain, concrete to chocolate, we are engaged in a whirlwind tour to explore ten commonplace materials in its holistic entirety. On a macro-level, we learn about its discovery, evolution and application. On a micro-level, its atomic structure, nanostructure and microstructure. We are exposed to not just what matter is made of, but why it matters. The author connects the performance of a material to its performative qualities. That material is more than just form and function but a medium through which art and emotions are expressed. The study of material science is not just facts and observations, the garnering of scientific knowledge to learn about the physical world and how its components work. Society and science along with its derivative, technology, are not separate disciplines but are synergistic in shaping this world we live in. An example is the Dives in Misericordia, a beautiful and modern Roman church built with self-cleaning concrete. The titanium dioxide in this concrete will absorb UV light to create free radical ions, which breaks down dirt and reduce the level of nitrogen oxide in the air produced by cars. The author stated that this “opens up the possibility that in the future buildings and roads may not be purely passive; they may purify the air much like plants”. Beyond structural and aesthetics purposes, concrete is utilized to positively affect the environment and its inhabitants. In the finale chapter aptly titled “Synthesis”, the author reinforces the book’s message, “It is hard to overestimate the philosophical as well as the technological importance of this dictum of materials science: that knowing the basic chemical composition is not enough to understand materiality. It is, after all, what makes the modern world possible.””Because of this strong connection between the materials and their social role, the materials that we favor, the materials that we surround ourselves with, are significant to us. They mean something, they embody our ideals, they give us part of our identity.”But, ah. We are getting ahead of ourselves! Let us go back to the beginning. A materials scientist and engineer, Dr Mark Miodownik’s fascination with material science first began as an epiphany. His back had encountered a razor sharp material - specifically, a steel blade - held by someone with ill-intent. That accident left the author with an indelible impression of how materials can, and have, changed his life. It is on this premise that each chapter is written, and is populated with personal vignettes interspersed with scientific facts.At times, the author tries too hard with the creative presentations. The chapter on plastic was written in the format of a movie script which was… a valiant attempt. Each chapter is assigned an adjective to capture the essence of the material. Graphite is “Unbreakable”, steel is “Indomitable”, glass is ""Invisible"" and chocolate is “Delicious”, for example. It seems counter-intuitive to have any material attributes boxed in with just one word, clever as it may be. After all, has it not been expounded that matter is more than just a mass of atoms? That it has far-reaching philosophical implications that are not easily defined. No matter. There is something for everyone in this book. The author’s narrative style has the easy manner of a popular high school science teacher who brings cool back to geek. A non-science reader will appreciate the complexity of science broken down into layman terms, whereas a science reader will appreciate how the author has made complex science relatable for the general audience. Take paper, for example. The simplest of materials presented in the book. Paper is a product of chemical reactions (de-lignification, bleach, calcium carbonate) on physical matter (tree cellulose fibers) using a technique refined from 2,000 years ago. So? Paper is just paper until we write words on it and give it content. Long after the ink fades and the paper dissolves, the intent of the words remain forever immortalized in our hearts and minds. As exemplified by the author’s sharing of two important pieces of paper - the first, a letter written by his grandfather to the British Home Office to request the (successful) extraction of his son from Germany prior to WWI and the second, a lovely card from his then-girlfriend (now wife) thanking him for a memorable first date. Stuff Matters is not a serious science book by any measure. Those are called textbooks. To be studied. This book has the right spirit of fun and pop culture, with enough science information to make us more aware of the world we live in. Overall, a highly recommended read."
263,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23509975-b-rbara,5,I know for certain that I've acquired super powers and now I can recognize every bit of material and its properties in any room. 
264,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3173915-stharris,5,"After finishing this, I changed from 4 to 5 Stars. So if you have any inner nerd in you that can geek out to chemistry, nanostructures, the materials we use in everyday life, etc...you will enjoy this well written, thoughtful, often humorous book. The final chapter is philosophical gold. "
265,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20069551-davide-nole,5,"The ideal popular science book for me.Basically I can only say great things about this book:- It engages the reader from the very first page, due to the fact that it's basically a series of short stories about the author. So the reader is led in a journey hand in hand with Mark, and he feels like he's there with him, talking about materials and MM's relation with them- It goes in depth, scientifically speaking. That is awesome, for a book as short as this one (about 250 pages), the fact that the author was able to condense the required knowledge in those pages is quite remarkable, and I do want him to write again (please)- It is not repetitive, which is something I wasn't really expecting, since the structure of the book is basically divided by the materials the author is talking about. The fact that MM changes format every time helps the reader a lot and makes the book a fun read and a very interesting one.I could go on forever telling everything I liked of this book, but I feel like the three things I listed are the most important ones, as they probably are three main points that every prospicient reader may want to address, when talking about a popular science book."

267,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356453-anetq,5,"This is an awesome book for anyone who is interested in how the world is put together - literally! Through chapters on 10 different materials the book not only teach the history and properties of the different materials, but also a lesson in scales, some of the chemistry that hold it together and ultimately nanoscience (with a nod to quantum mechanics) - I can actually say, that I now understand what nanoscience is about, whereas before it was only odd science fictioney things I've seen but not understood the workings of (like the self-assembling materials from MIT and that atom-level movie.And this through reading stories about china making it to Europe, how chocolate melts in your mouth and the amazing powers of reinforced concrete through the chemical magic of cement. Very enlightening and a fun read! (Having mixed concrete and melted a lot of chocolate in my mouth only made it better off course.)Now the nit-picky comments: There were a few annoyances.When reading the chapter on paper I kept wondering if it was a ten year old book - because even if the 10 material stories are personal ones, I can hardly remember a time with all those paper materials. ""Back of the envelope"" is a concept I do remember, but bills have been electronic for years on end in Denmark, so I never have en envelope lying around and rarely see a printed newspaper - I do realize, I'm on the tech end of things, but I certainly don't see reading books as being an important tactile experience - actually I much prefer a light Kindle to a large classic (possibly musty smelling) tome. (Have recently been putting off Don Quixote as I only have an unbearable one-volume paper brick-version of it!) The Author is definitely much more of a paper romantic!Another thing: The British connection. It's fine with local flavor (like the odd relationship with tea in porcelain), but for most materials, the year of the technology's arrival to the british isles really is of no use whatsoever for us non-brits, when someone else invented, found or made it usefull, maybe just leave it there?"
268,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,5,"Material science is not really my topic. I had a brief stint as a chemistry enthusiast when I was 14 and that died out as soon as I hit high school. Plus it's not reaaaally the sexiest topic, is it?Mark Miodownik begs to differ. The book is structured into 10 chapters, each preceded by the same picture of the author drinking his coffee on the terrace and then exploring one of the materials you can see in the picture. A cute gimmick that sets the tone for the chapters themselves, each structured differently. My favorite was the chapter on paper, which sprinkled some emotional, autobiographical bits in with the explanations on different types of paper. My least favorite, the one on plastics, was supposed to be a play starring the main people involved in creating the family of materials, but read artificially and relied on lengthy footnotes where the good stuff was.Excepting this minor hiccup, however, Stuff Matters was one of the most enlightening books I've read in a good while. The best part about it is Miodownik's ability to explain pretty complex notions in very simple terms, requiring little to no previous knowledge and even managing to create a bit of intrigue. (Or, at least, what I interpreted as intrigue. When discussing glass, he mentions how atoms are mostly empty space; therefore, he argues, it's not surprising that glass is transparent, but rather than almost everything else isn't. I was literally on the edge of my seat there, and not only because it was an uncomfortable airport seat.)I strongly, warmly recommend it to anyone who's really just curious about stuff. Maybe not to material science majors, though."

Despite the easygoing explanations, he is a man who knows 'stuff'. Miodownik is a professor at University College in London, which has an extensive materials library.He has logically organized by chapter facts and stories of a particular material, such as paper, steel, cement, rubber, glass, foam, chocolate and denim. There are simple, but understandable hand-drawings as well as photos.One of the things I learned about cement is some cement is being experimentally infused with a type of bacteria which eats starch that has been embedded into the original cement; and soon the little buggers are defecating mineral calcite, a component of cement. Thus, 'self-healing' cement was invented, with bacteria reducing structural cement cracks which occur over time! While proven to work in the lab, I guess commercial versions are in the future. Still, cement excreting bacteria curing the problem of the deterioration of reinforced cement tickles my sense of the absurd! Scientists are wonderful.The level of science is the kind professors teach to art majors, so I suspect the book will not satisfy STEM readers. However, it is a cute little book with cute little stories about amazing materials we use everyday casually and thoughtlessly. Who knew knowing 'stuff' could be fascinating? Pun intended, gentle reader ; )"

He tells the stories of each element in regards to his own life, which is a nice personal touch in what would otherwise be dry subject matter. I didn't find every element nearly as compelling as the author made it out to be (despite his obvious enthusiasm for each one), but it was still an enjoyable short listen.Michael Page is one of the reasons I listened to this book. He's been the narrator of three other (fiction) books I've listened to, all of which I enjoyed. He has great range and I just enjoy his voice.

It's not like I was looking around hoping to find a book about concrete (or paper, or graphite or glass or any of the other materials covered in this book). But here's the thing, it was fascinating. No lie. My regard for Miodownik grew with every word. It didn't matter if he was taking about--concrete, glass, paper chocolate, lead, gels -- he made it all interesting and relatable. It made me so much more aware of the the materials around me and our physical and emotional relationship to them. This should be a must read for architects, engineers, artists, and designers of all kinds, and a great read for everyone else. Miodownik is sentimental and passionate about his subjects, sometimes to the extreme. He talks about chocolate like he is practically making love to it (and that's only a slight exaggeration). Even so, I didn't mind his self-indulgent high drama because it felt sincere (not contrived), and because it's hard not to admire someone who has so much enthusiasm for his subjects. "

The author's style is conversational and light, yet hard science is presented in an understandable way. For example, there isn't a whole lot of difference between a diamond and graphite, other than the chemical bonding properties of four electrons in the outer shell of each carbon atom. (By the way a diamond isn't forever, which I believe is another fallacy of a certain ad campaign.) Hand drawn diagrams are included in many chapters, which I found to be helpful even though the illustrations are not fancy.Most of the ""stuff"" included in the book were all inspired by a single photo of the author, sitting at a table and reading a book while sipping (what I assume to be) tea. There were a few materials in the photo that weren't included, such as denim, but that is a trivial gripe. 4.5 stars and recommended to most everyone. Even if you don't care to read it for any other reason, borrow it from the library and enjoy the chapters about chocolate, paper and books."

The explanations were circular non-explanations: paper is like paper because it's made of the stuff that paper is made of and babies like to play with it, isn't that super!I much preferred the following book on similar themes:

The history of ""regular"" every day things such as plastic, glass, and even other things such as graphite were mind blowing and fascinating (who knew that graphene is poised to make the silicon chip obsolete?). Anybody with an interest in materials or quantum mechanics should check this book out. It is accessible and even funny and a very good read."
281,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34979490-akshay,5,"I can not appreciate enough how analytical and curious Mark Miodownik is. He has real love for finding out how stuff is by design. This book is a love letter to various materials by a curious nerd.In this book he goes over several basic day to day elements such as paper, glass, plastic, concrete etc. But the details are not boring. The structure includes brief introduction via personal experiences with the material, brief anecdotal history, detailed physical/chemical properties of the material, it’s various types and practical applications.I specially enjoyed following chapters and found some information really interesting:a) Steel:1. Pyramids were built using copper chisels. They were required to be sharpened every 2-3 blows.2. Mr, Gillette democratized shaving by introducing use and throw blades.3. Metals are crystals and are sharpening blade is just rearranging of crystals.b) Paper: 1. is a merely 2000yr technology2. is made of Cellulose fibres.3. Why does it get yellow over time? a chemical exposed to sun oxidizes.4. scroll vs book. Romans created codex or book structure. Before that Chinese, who invented paper always used scrolls.5. Paper bends because cellulose fibre break where bent while others stay intact6. Thermal paper used so that cash registers never run out of ink.7. Money is most seductive in paper form. Literal manifestation of trust in economic system.c) Concrete1. Concrete is a living breathing thing.2. Takes any shape, mixes with steel in a as homogeneous body. 3. Concrete can crack. Water entering concrete can rusk the steel inside. The remedy is introduction of bacteria that in contact with air generates calcite, closing the gapsd) Chocolate.1. Material poem!2. Benefits, antioxidants. Mayan people discovered. They drank chocolate as it would melt otherwise.e) Aerogel: 1. Aerogels are Liquid trapped in solid. made from Collagen.2. Typically light gets scattered on entering atmosphere . Blue gets scattered more because of shorter wavelength hence sky is blue.3. Aerogels have Thermal insulation.4. Kisler formed Monsanto with a plan to use his patented Santogel commercially. Didn’t work- look what monsanto has become now!5. NASA had successful space mission to collect stardusk. They used giant tennis rackets and aerosols f) Plastic 1. Celluloid 2. Discovered when backyard scientists were finding replacement of ivory used in billiards game balls.3. Used films strips. Imagine world without plastic. Drag!g) glass1. Electrons repositioning and light entering makes it possible for glass to be transparent2. Romans invented windows. Before it was open air3. Colored glasses were status symbols. Explains why old churches have those.4. Pyrex- boro-silicate. It is immune to thermal shock5. Opaque materials were used for drinking, conducting chemical experiments etc6. before glass- drinks were served in opaque containers. Pilsner lager - is a light better looking beer done with Bottom fermenting . looked better in glass.7. Toughened glass- windscreen. atoms in high tension. laminated glass. toughened glass with plastic laminate.8. Bulletproof glass has several layers of plastic and glass. As bullet hits one layer, gets blunt, and repeats to next layer1 layer- protects from 0.22 mm3 layer - 0.378 layer - AK-47 bullet etch) Diamond/Carbon/ Graphite1. Pencil has graphite2. Carbon dating - age of fossils3. Diamond when burned in vacuum forms graphite. Diamond is not forever. Pretty good marketing though4. Graphene is atomically thin layer of graphite. Strongest material known to man."
282,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56498788-allan-olley,4,"This book is an engaging look at the world of materials science. Each chapter is an examination of a different material (including such materials as concrete and paper) that explains its physical and molecular structure and briefly summarizes the history of its manufacture and use. While the focus of the book is on building materials and other utilitarian substances there is a chapter devoted to chocolate and explaining how its material properties relate to its appeal.The book is not overly detailed, but does bring some up some interesting facts and trivia about the materials. It is also peppered with the author's enthusiasm for materials starting with his boyhood encounter with a mugger wielding a steel razor blade that first led him to marvel at the different stuff all around us. This enthusiasm can seem a bit over the top at times (as when he laments that aerogels might only be used for utilitarian insulative features and not their other remarkable properties), but its general effect is to inspire interest in the materials he explains and praises.The narrator's crisp neutral British accent is ideal for dealing the technical details of this book, doubly so because the other is a himself a Brit (although he has lived off and on in the USA and elsewhere). The narrator pronounces the English name of element 13 atomic number 13 as Aluminum and not Aluminium as one might expect."
283,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25849610-deb,3,"3.5 Stars.This book started out grabbing my attention and had a lot of interesting information throughout. The author did a good job of explaining his enthusiasm for why he decided to spend his life finding out about the stuff that matters and what makes our world work when a lot of people don't really take the time to even think about it. After a while, this book lost it's luster for me. It kind of had a textbook feel and it was hard to keep my interest. Don't get me wrong, the information he conveys is still very good, makes a lot of good points and is quite interesting the way he explains it, but for me, it just felt like it was time to read something else. Some of it I had already learned about in college, and then some of it was new. I'm glad to see someone like this author is so excited about things in the background, the chemistry behind it all, including the inventors and just the ""stuff that matters,""the things that shape our world, including man-made things (like steel items being made after they discovered how to make steel, etc), (what makes things happen, both in the past and today.) If you like those sorts of things, this might be a good book for you to read, as he communicates very well as a writer and you would probably enjoy it."
284,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763879-martha,4,"Don't miss this. Extraordinarily clear, engaging, well written historic-scientific-engineering-social-aesthetic discussion of ten materials that surround us: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastics, glass, graphite, porcelain, and implants. How chocolate gets from a raw cocoa bean that ""tastes horrible"" and is ""fibrous, woody, bitter, and bland"" to a substance that has been scientifically demonstrated to be ""far more intense and longer lasting"" and all-around ""better"" than kissing. How a human can now hold a piece of sky in her hand, why the origin of plastic is, as the Music Man said: ""a pool table, don't you understand?"", how stainless steel heals itself like skin so that in fact we never actually have to taste it while eating from it every day. ""The possibility that whole objects might be wired up throughout, as if permeated by an entire nervous system, is now . . . conceivable. . . . One day whole rooms, buildings, perhaps even bridges may generate their own energy, funnel it to where it is needed, detect damage, and self-heal. If this seems like science fiction, bear in mind that it is only what living materials do already.""And it contains a screen play and a love letter to the author from his wife. It's really fun and fascinating."
285,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,3,"Stuff Matters is pop material science, organized around ten or so everyday materials visible in a photo of the author in his rooftop garden. The tone is light and fluffy, without much substance, as Miodownik makes his point that micro and nano scale structures create the material properties of the macro world that we inhabit, skips through the history of the material, and how we find it pleasing today. The chapter on carbon, with a futuristic look towards the properties of graphene is the strongest. The chapter on plastic is a tragic waste, a fictionalized tale around late 19th celluloid, rather than any kind of thoughtful look at the most innovative, flexible, and environmentally dangerous of modern materials."
286,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45592244-mehdi-hassan,4,"If the great Bill Gates had not mentioned this, I would have never touched this. Stuff matters takes an interestingly scientific look at the materials that we use from day to day and adds emotional values to these seemingly mundane stuff. The most powerful quote from the book: ""We occupy multiple worlds: the material and immaterial - which is world of our thoughts and perception"". Moidownik does well to expand upon the immaterial/psychic world of materials and adds to the flavor of individual experiences. Although the book can get very technical and texty, there are many interesting anecdotes and I am glad I have been able to power through it. "

How the world around us operate on different levels? Why metals are so different yet someone somewhere thought to categorise them as such? These kind of questions pop into my head on a daily basis. This fascinating book does little to satisfy my curiosity, instead, it enlarged it significantly! Instead of finding answers (which I have to admit that I did) an endless wave of new questions popped in about the Material world. I'm fascinated more than ever before about why materials have such interesting and mind boggling properties and characteristics.This book is absolutely worth the read and I deeply appreciated the nudge it gave to my curiosity."

I found this work quite informative and a surprisingly entertaining read!However, as much as I appreciate « science books » that don’t read very « serious » I found that, while this book accomplished that mission perfectly, it also lacked some fundamental information. The chapters about Steel and Plastic precisely were a huge disappointment to me. So I think this would provide a great   starting ground   for the curious about everyday materials and how they evolved through time. "
291,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929230-kirsten,4,"Fascinating to listen to.  Though I'd probably get way more out of reading it, this was sufficient for my interest level.  I quite enjoyed paper, as I'm sure many readers did."
292,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34550725-alfred-haplo,4,"The title of the book, Stuff Matters, encapsulates the core message. From paper to porcelain, concrete to chocolate, we are engaged in a whirlwind tour to explore ten commonplace materials in its holistic entirety. On a macro-level, we learn about its discovery, evolution and application. On a micro-level, its atomic structure, nanostructure and microstructure. We are exposed to not just what matter is made of, but why it matters. The author connects the performance of a material to its performative qualities. That material is more than just form and function but a medium through which art and emotions are expressed. The study of material science is not just facts and observations, the garnering of scientific knowledge to learn about the physical world and how its components work. Society and science along with its derivative, technology, are not separate disciplines but are synergistic in shaping this world we live in. An example is the Dives in Misericordia, a beautiful and modern Roman church built with self-cleaning concrete. The titanium dioxide in this concrete will absorb UV light to create free radical ions, which breaks down dirt and reduce the level of nitrogen oxide in the air produced by cars. The author stated that this “opens up the possibility that in the future buildings and roads may not be purely passive; they may purify the air much like plants”. Beyond structural and aesthetics purposes, concrete is utilized to positively affect the environment and its inhabitants. In the finale chapter aptly titled “Synthesis”, the author reinforces the book’s message, “It is hard to overestimate the philosophical as well as the technological importance of this dictum of materials science: that knowing the basic chemical composition is not enough to understand materiality. It is, after all, what makes the modern world possible.””Because of this strong connection between the materials and their social role, the materials that we favor, the materials that we surround ourselves with, are significant to us. They mean something, they embody our ideals, they give us part of our identity.”But, ah. We are getting ahead of ourselves! Let us go back to the beginning. A materials scientist and engineer, Dr Mark Miodownik’s fascination with material science first began as an epiphany. His back had encountered a razor sharp material - specifically, a steel blade - held by someone with ill-intent. That accident left the author with an indelible impression of how materials can, and have, changed his life. It is on this premise that each chapter is written, and is populated with personal vignettes interspersed with scientific facts.At times, the author tries too hard with the creative presentations. The chapter on plastic was written in the format of a movie script which was… a valiant attempt. Each chapter is assigned an adjective to capture the essence of the material. Graphite is “Unbreakable”, steel is “Indomitable”, glass is ""Invisible"" and chocolate is “Delicious”, for example. It seems counter-intuitive to have any material attributes boxed in with just one word, clever as it may be. After all, has it not been expounded that matter is more than just a mass of atoms? That it has far-reaching philosophical implications that are not easily defined. No matter. There is something for everyone in this book. The author’s narrative style has the easy manner of a popular high school science teacher who brings cool back to geek. A non-science reader will appreciate the complexity of science broken down into layman terms, whereas a science reader will appreciate how the author has made complex science relatable for the general audience. Take paper, for example. The simplest of materials presented in the book. Paper is a product of chemical reactions (de-lignification, bleach, calcium carbonate) on physical matter (tree cellulose fibers) using a technique refined from 2,000 years ago. So? Paper is just paper until we write words on it and give it content. Long after the ink fades and the paper dissolves, the intent of the words remain forever immortalized in our hearts and minds. As exemplified by the author’s sharing of two important pieces of paper - the first, a letter written by his grandfather to the British Home Office to request the (successful) extraction of his son from Germany prior to WWI and the second, a lovely card from his then-girlfriend (now wife) thanking him for a memorable first date. Stuff Matters is not a serious science book by any measure. Those are called textbooks. To be studied. This book has the right spirit of fun and pop culture, with enough science information to make us more aware of the world we live in. Overall, a highly recommended read."
293,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23509975-b-rbara,5,I know for certain that I've acquired super powers and now I can recognize every bit of material and its properties in any room. 
294,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3173915-stharris,5,"After finishing this, I changed from 4 to 5 Stars. So if you have any inner nerd in you that can geek out to chemistry, nanostructures, the materials we use in everyday life, etc...you will enjoy this well written, thoughtful, often humorous book. The final chapter is philosophical gold. "
295,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20069551-davide-nole,5,"The ideal popular science book for me.Basically I can only say great things about this book:- It engages the reader from the very first page, due to the fact that it's basically a series of short stories about the author. So the reader is led in a journey hand in hand with Mark, and he feels like he's there with him, talking about materials and MM's relation with them- It goes in depth, scientifically speaking. That is awesome, for a book as short as this one (about 250 pages), the fact that the author was able to condense the required knowledge in those pages is quite remarkable, and I do want him to write again (please)- It is not repetitive, which is something I wasn't really expecting, since the structure of the book is basically divided by the materials the author is talking about. The fact that MM changes format every time helps the reader a lot and makes the book a fun read and a very interesting one.I could go on forever telling everything I liked of this book, but I feel like the three things I listed are the most important ones, as they probably are three main points that every prospicient reader may want to address, when talking about a popular science book."

297,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356453-anetq,5,"This is an awesome book for anyone who is interested in how the world is put together - literally! Through chapters on 10 different materials the book not only teach the history and properties of the different materials, but also a lesson in scales, some of the chemistry that hold it together and ultimately nanoscience (with a nod to quantum mechanics) - I can actually say, that I now understand what nanoscience is about, whereas before it was only odd science fictioney things I've seen but not understood the workings of (like the self-assembling materials from MIT and that atom-level movie.And this through reading stories about china making it to Europe, how chocolate melts in your mouth and the amazing powers of reinforced concrete through the chemical magic of cement. Very enlightening and a fun read! (Having mixed concrete and melted a lot of chocolate in my mouth only made it better off course.)Now the nit-picky comments: There were a few annoyances.When reading the chapter on paper I kept wondering if it was a ten year old book - because even if the 10 material stories are personal ones, I can hardly remember a time with all those paper materials. ""Back of the envelope"" is a concept I do remember, but bills have been electronic for years on end in Denmark, so I never have en envelope lying around and rarely see a printed newspaper - I do realize, I'm on the tech end of things, but I certainly don't see reading books as being an important tactile experience - actually I much prefer a light Kindle to a large classic (possibly musty smelling) tome. (Have recently been putting off Don Quixote as I only have an unbearable one-volume paper brick-version of it!) The Author is definitely much more of a paper romantic!Another thing: The British connection. It's fine with local flavor (like the odd relationship with tea in porcelain), but for most materials, the year of the technology's arrival to the british isles really is of no use whatsoever for us non-brits, when someone else invented, found or made it usefull, maybe just leave it there?"
298,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,5,"Material science is not really my topic. I had a brief stint as a chemistry enthusiast when I was 14 and that died out as soon as I hit high school. Plus it's not reaaaally the sexiest topic, is it?Mark Miodownik begs to differ. The book is structured into 10 chapters, each preceded by the same picture of the author drinking his coffee on the terrace and then exploring one of the materials you can see in the picture. A cute gimmick that sets the tone for the chapters themselves, each structured differently. My favorite was the chapter on paper, which sprinkled some emotional, autobiographical bits in with the explanations on different types of paper. My least favorite, the one on plastics, was supposed to be a play starring the main people involved in creating the family of materials, but read artificially and relied on lengthy footnotes where the good stuff was.Excepting this minor hiccup, however, Stuff Matters was one of the most enlightening books I've read in a good while. The best part about it is Miodownik's ability to explain pretty complex notions in very simple terms, requiring little to no previous knowledge and even managing to create a bit of intrigue. (Or, at least, what I interpreted as intrigue. When discussing glass, he mentions how atoms are mostly empty space; therefore, he argues, it's not surprising that glass is transparent, but rather than almost everything else isn't. I was literally on the edge of my seat there, and not only because it was an uncomfortable airport seat.)I strongly, warmly recommend it to anyone who's really just curious about stuff. Maybe not to material science majors, though."
299,0544236041,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Mark Miodownik writes in a conversational style about materials, using history, personal anecdotes and concise science facts to explain what the everyday stuff we use to eat, sit on, read and work in is made of. Despite the easygoing explanations, he is a man who knows 'stuff'. Miodownik is a professor at University College in London, which has an extensive materials library.He has logically organized by chapter facts and stories of a particular material, such as paper, steel, cement, rubber, glass, foam, chocolate and denim. There are simple, but understandable hand-drawings as well as photos.One of the things I learned about cement is some cement is being experimentally infused with a type of bacteria which eats starch that has been embedded into the original cement; and soon the little buggers are defecating mineral calcite, a component of cement. Thus, 'self-healing' cement was invented, with bacteria reducing structural cement cracks which occur over time! While proven to work in the lab, I guess commercial versions are in the future. Still, cement excreting bacteria curing the problem of the deterioration of reinforced cement tickles my sense of the absurd! Scientists are wonderful.The level of science is the kind professors teach to art majors, so I suspect the book will not satisfy STEM readers. However, it is a cute little book with cute little stories about amazing materials we use everyday casually and thoughtlessly. Who knew knowing 'stuff' could be fascinating? Pun intended, gentle reader ; )"
