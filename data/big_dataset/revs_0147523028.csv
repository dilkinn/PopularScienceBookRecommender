On December 5, 2008, the front page of the New York Times included an unusual item:  H. M., Whose Loss of Memory Made Him Unforgettable, Dies. It was hardly the first time that an obit piece had appeared on the front page, but it is unlikely that many with quite so little public recognition had ever appeared there. The “H.M.” in question was one Henry Gustave Molaison. He has been the inspiration for many books, at least one play and a major motion picture. Mostly, though, while he had never studied medicine, or practiced in any medical field, Molaison had made a huge contribution to our understanding of the human brain. Luke Dittrich -From PRHSpeakers.com Young Henry was seriously concussed in a biking accident when he was a kid. As a teenager he began having grand mal seizures. His symptoms increased and seriously affected his ability to function in the world. Drug treatments had proved unsuccessful. It was a new thing for such a procedure to be done for someone who was not considered mentally ill, but in 1953, when he was 27 years old, Henry was given a lobotomy. From that day on, he would no longer be able to form new memories. He would also be unable to fend for himself. But he was perfectly lucid, and able to have a life, albeit a restricted one. Because of his unusual condition, Henry became the primary neurological test subject of his time. He was examined, interviewed, and studied by untold numbers of researchers until his death. He was the subject of countless professional papers, in which he was always referred to in professional literature by his initials, in order to protect his privacy. Anyone working in the field would know well the initials HM. William Beecher Scoville was the doctor who had performed the risky surgery. He was Luke Dittrich’s grandfather. Dr William Beecher - from Dittrich’s Esquire article Patient H.M is both a medical and personal history, as Dittrich looks at the scientific advances that took place over a 60 year period, the history of his grandfather, and the life of Henry. It is perfectly accessible for the average reader, with a minimum of technical jargon. You will definitely learn some things, like the difference between episodic and semantic memory. Memory scientists often speak of the important difference between knowing that a certain fact is true and knowing how you came to learn it. For example, here’s a simple question: What’s the capital of France? The answer probably leapt to your mind in an instant. Now, here’s another question: When did you learn that Paris is the capital of France? If you’re like most people, you have no idea. That particular fact twinkles in your mind amid an enormous constellation of other facts, most of them forever disconnected from the moment they first sprang to life. The store of mostly disconnected facts is known as your semantic memory.Your semantic memory is contrasted with your episodic memory, which is your memory of fleshed-out narratives rather than merely facts. When you engage your episodic memory, you engage in a form of mental time travel, bringing yourself back to a particular place and time, reimagining a scene you’ve already lived. When you engage your semantic memory you are doing the mental equivalent of flipping through an encyclopedia or photo album, plucking out bits of information whose origins might be unclear.This gives you a taste of how fluidly Dittrich writes of a subject that, in lesser hands, could easily have become dense. Gramps was not exactly mister nice guy. He had a reputation for fast living and was very successful and ambitious, maybe to the point of excessive risk-taking. The state of mental health understanding and care in the 1950s is fascinating, and the stuff of nightmares. Nurse Ratched would have been right at home. Part of this tale is the fumbling from step to step that took place in trying to understand how the brain works. It makes one very thankful that we have technology today that can look at the brain with non-invasive machines instead of scalpels. It was news, for instance, that there were at least two kinds of memory, as noted above, and that they might reside in different parts of the brain. We learn how Henry came to be afflicted in his special way, how he lived, and how he was treated, both as a human being and a test subject. Henry as a young man - from The TelegraphThere are significant human rights issues here. Henry was and remained a human being, yet he was regarded by some researchers in a very proprietary way, in one instance being referred to in a legal document as “An MIT research project entitled “The Amnesic Patient H.M.” Not exactly warm and fuzzy. Academic turf-guarding comes in for a look. One researcher, in particular, goes so far as to destroy original data that might have jeopardized her career-long published findings. Access to Henry was guarded as energetically as the formula for real Coke, and not always for the purpose of looking after Henry’s best interests. Dittrich raises ethical issues, noting similarities between what was considered respectable medicine in the 20th century and barbaric behavior of the then recent past in how people had been used as test subjects for medical research.And there is a particularly existential question that comes into play. If we are our memories, who and what are we if we can no longer make any? And it makes one wonder about new science that may offer us a way to erase traumatic memories, in the vein of the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Dittrich had an in, of course, but sometimes the family connection gets in the way. He tends to wax nostalgic about his grandfather, and wanders off topic for stretches. Some may enjoy these, and they were ok, I guess, but I found myself getting irritated at what seemed an excessive levels of detail, particularly in imagined scenarios. Thankfully, the eye-rolling portions of the book do not detract too much from the rest. Suzanne Corkin doggedly guarded her access to HMThere are clear similarities to be found between this book and two others that deal with medical history. The obvious comparison is to Rebecca Skloot’s best-seller The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. In that cells that had been taken from a patient, and found to have remarkable qualities, were subsequently used, without permission, to support vast amounts of research. Ethical considerations raised in the book are considerable. But the much less well known Open Wound: The Tragic Obsession of Dr. William Beaumont, by Jason Karlawish, is the book that seems the most directly comparable. In that one, Dr. Beaumont of the title takes advantage of an unusual medical condition to keep a patient available for his research for a prolonged period. It raises similar ethical issues to the ones raised in Patient H.M..Bottom line is that Luke Dittrich has given us a fascinating look at an obscure figure, bringing to life what medical progress actually looks like, and how much like sausage-making it really can be. He raises some very important ethical concerns not only about how Henry was treated as a person, but how access to Henry was handled, and how the information gleaned by researchers was guarded, and in at least one instance, destroyed. If you are at all interested in the brain and in the history of advances in medical knowledge, and do not take a look at Patient H.M. you should probably have your head examined.Review Posted – 8/5/16Publication date - 8/9/16=============================EXTRA STUFFMore Material From Luke Dittrich -----All Dittrich’s writings for Esquire, including a piece that takes aim at a neurosurgeon who claims he had gone to heaven. -----A short version of Henry’s Story-----Dittrich’s original Esquire article, The Brain that Changed Everyting-----The Brain That Couldn’t Remember- NY Times Magazine – August 7, 2016Jacopo Annese, oversaw the slicing of Henry’s brain post-mortem and digitizing of every bit into an image database.

1,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10001905-lynn,2,"This is a story about H. M., the world's most famous neuroscience case study. Henry had debilitating epilepsy. In his 20s he had a medial temporal lobectomy to reduce his symptoms. The surgery was a success but H. M., was left with catastrophic amnesia. H. M. could meet you ten different times and never remember the interlude. Henry was studied for decades and the data he produced would revolutionize our understanding of memory. Interestingly, the grandson of the man who did the psychosurgery wrote this book.The book had tons of interesting information but on the whole it was disjointed, repetitive, and often lost its own train of thought. My diagnosis is that the author could not decide what the book was about: himself, his ancestor, H. M., or neuroscience as a whole, I was hoping this was a good book to assign to my students but alas it is not."
2,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,0,"Curiosity. Patient H.M. may in fact be the most famous amnesia patient in history but frankly I knew nothing about him. After reading a few reviews regarding the book of same name, I became curious to know more, not only due to the nature of Patient H.M.’s illness but also because much of the story takes place in institutions in Connecticut that I have visited and have familiarity. I was also curious about H.M himself, and what motivated the author, the grandson of Dr. William Scoville, a noted psychosurgeon who performed some of the first controversial lobotomies in the world, to write this book. It seemed to me a risk for the author, Luke Dittrich, a journalist, to open this can of worms. Not only does the word lobotomy strike a chord in the medical science world but to delve into and then print the best and worst of your family’s history seems to hit so close to the heart. As is often the case a seemingly minor event can change a person’s life. In the case of Patient H.M., once known as Henry Molaison, a seven or eight year old boy, a fall, while walking home on July 3, either in 1933 or 1934, changed his life forever. No one quite knew what exactly happened but a bicyclist, coasting down the hill in Colt Park, didn’t see Henry and hit him causing Henry to fall suffering a bang to his head. Dittrich orchestrates the opening chapters with expertise, grabbing our attention, as he takes us into Henry’s skull and describes the trauma of this fall to Henry’s brain. As with many accidents of this nature all seems well for a time until the seizures begin. It is not possible to prove that Henry’s epilepsy is caused by the fall but many believe it was. So how does Henry Molaison lose his identity and become Patient H.M.? How does a boy suffering epileptic seizures become an experimental patient of lobotomy?To get to this answer we take a labyrinth of a route. If the story Dittrich tells were only in relation to his grandfather, Dr. William Beecher Scoville and his most famous patient, it might a little easier to follow and not the complicated multi-layered outing it becomes. But Dittrich had many questions and a great deal to explore to come to answers, if not only for himself but for his family and his readers. There were times when my head spun.Sidetracking a bit, as the book does, I was very interested in the structure of the first asylums in Connecticut. Dittrich goes into great detail about The Hartford Retreat for the Insane. One of the in depth sidebars that Dittrich researches is the treatment of his grandmother who suffers from some mental state, never quite given a name. It is this asylum, one hundred years after it’s beginning, renamed, where his grandfather brings his wife. At first it seems a welcoming place. ” Its first superintendent, in a report stated “It aspired to be “the reverse of everything which usually enters into our conceptions of a madhouse.” Instead of just being a sort of jail where “the unfortunate maniacs are confined, “ his asylum would be dedicated to the “moral management” of the inmates.  ”it was beautiful, that much remained the same” but it was not the same place/ The Institute of Living. The name and the game were new. On the surface it seemed lovely, ”When my grandmother flipped through the pages of The Chatterbox, she would have found pictures of a place that looked more like a country club than anything else. There was an outdoor swimming pool, a small putting green next to the Golf House, a volleyball court, even an indoor ten-pin bowling alley. She’d see advertisements for some of the goods available at Vauxhall Rox, the asylum’s own shopping mall: She could buy artisanal Ajell candles and Easter greeting card at the Here-It-Is shop, purchase a variety of different corsages—starting a at ninety cents apiece—at the Vauxhall Row Flower Shop, or browse a selection of newly arrived bestsellers at Ye Roayle Booke. She would find photographs of the guest-created handicrafts on display at “our little arts and crafts salon in Center Building,” a collection of “avocational shops”—Ye Glaziery, Ye Silver Smith, Ye Bindery, and Costume à la Main----known collectively as Pomander Walk.” Yet the creed of the institution was to keep your troubles to yourself and only discuss your mental state with the doctors and nurses, in an effort to maintain a normal appearance. Dittrich’s grandmother on the first evening became a problem patient, removing her clothes, pounding on her locked door and ranting in a loud voice. She was taken to another building, South One, which like a scary movie about asylums, contained five large tubs. One was waiting for his grandmother. Filled with cold water, she was stripped, her body coated with oil, then forcefully placed in the tub, where a large sheet of heavy fabric was strapped over the tub, only her head visible, for hypothermia therapy. She could have remained here for a few hours or many days. This is the woman that grew up in Manchester, CT in a privileged upbringing. Her family owned The Cheney Brothers Silk Manufacturing Company that once was the largest producer of silk outside of China. Women rarely had much to do with the business and by the time his grandmother met Bill Scoville, the mills were in decline.Dittrich is never able to determine whether his grandmother had a lobotomy under the hands of her husband. She eventually divorces the doctor, moves to NY and starts over.By page 102 we are at last in attendance at Dr. Scoville’s first lobotomy. In 1946 Dr. Scoville arrives at Connecticut State Hospital – similar in appearance to his wife’s asylum. Dittrich states ”Both made good first impressions, and although the grounds of the asylum in Middletown weren’t designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, they too were beautiful.” I would agree as I lived near this hospital as a young girl and used to play on its grounds. It was here that a vote was taken, and passed, and the Connecticut Cooperative Lobotomy Study was born. The next day, the Hartford Courant heralded the event, declaring, “Connecticut thus becomes the first state to undertake a scientific, controlled study and practice of the brain operation know as prefrontal lobotomy.”Again, why does Henry have a lobotomy if he is not mentally ill?We do find out but it takes until pgs. 208-216 to get to the description of Henry Molaison’s lobotomy beginning with consultation with his parents, and eventual permission of Henry and his parents to have the operation. “The surgery was scheduled for August 25, 1953.” In testing before the lobotomy Henry’s IQ score was 104, surprisingly lower than after his surgery. Though Henry was experiencing severe seizures, which were greatly interfering with his life, no one, knew what the outcome of this elimination of the matter in the temporal lobes would cause. He retained some of his mental competency but lost much of his memory, particularly short-term. Six weeks after the operation Dr. Scoville sent off a paper to the Journal of Neurosurgery. Partially it stated:  ”resulted in no marked physiologic or behavioral changes, with the one exception, a very grave, recent memory loss, so severe as to prevent the patient from remembering the locations of the rooms in which he lives, the names of his close associates, or even the way to toilet or urinal.”.Dittrich sums this up with these words:“It was the birth announcement of Patient H.M.It was the obituary of Henry Molaison.”Patient H.M. and his brain were studied over sixty years and even after his death in 2008, his brain was harvested and became a pawn in a bitter legal battle over its ownership. Sad. At book’s end I felt drained, sad and forlorn for Henry Molasion and those like him, the experiments of medicine and what in the end is gained. I question this.Where are we today in the treatment of the mentally ill? Lobotomy and shock treatment are out of favor, yet not totally non-existent. Has therapy and medication truly “cured” anyone? Certainly we have come along way from an ancient Egyptian physician who chanted these words over his patient at the beginning of treatment:  “Repelled is the enemy that is in the wound / Cast out the evil that is in the blood/ The adversary of Horus, on every side of the mouth of Isis/ This temple does not fall down / There is no enemy of the vessel therein / I am the protection the Isis / My rescue is the son of Osiris!”The Hippocratic Oath cautions ”abstain from doing harm” and yet I continue to wonder just what good have we done for our mentally ill? Or for the boy hit by a bicyclist who fell?You could say Henry’s fall sealed his fate. His brain was already broken but the question remains, was more harm done by the intentional operation, which left Henry as the amnesiac Patient H.M? Was the contribution of the understanding of the brain worth what Henry Molaison lost? "
3,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2073488-joy-clark,5,"I was on my predoctoral internship when H.M. died, and I remember watching the brain cutting as it streamed live over the internet. H.M. was one of the first case studies I learned about in graduate school, and I use him frequently in my own teaching to illustrate basic neuroscience concepts. In my mind, he is a legend, almost mythical in status. Dittrich's book provides another layer to the story of H.M. and the many neuroscientists and neurosurgeons that worked with him. H.M.'s is not the only life chronicled in this fascinating book. We also learn about the work of Dittrich's grandfather - Bill Scoville - who performed H.M.'s surgery but who also served as a controversial figure in the realm of psychosurgery (e.g. lobotomies, etc. used to treat mental illness) and Suzanne Corkin - the MIT professor who spent decades studying H.M. Sadly, Dr. Corkin died as I was reading the book that merely touched on her life's work. While I went into my reading knowing neuroanatomy and the basics of H.M.'s case, Dittrich's book provided such rich details that I felt I was learning anew. My only criticism is that the narrative does jump around, jarringly at times, and it is obvious that the author's knowledge of neuropsychology is occasionally lacking. Otherwise, a wonderful read. I'm even considering making it required reading for my undergraduate neuropsychology class!"
4,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38530619-britta-b-hler,5,"Absolutely fantastic read. If you are interested in the story of modern brain/memory research, this book is a must-read. Excellent (the research, the writing), riveting (the story), heartbreaking (H.M. and all the other patients mentioned, including the author's grandmother), sickening (most of the doctors and researchers mentioned). "
5,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb-martens,4,"""Lobotomy."" This psycho- surgical term is one which has returned to the public's consciousness very recently, with a spotlight on the famous Kennedy family. A book, newspaper accounts, magazine features such as the one in People's Weekly described Rosemary Kennedy and her perceived unmanageable ""flaw"" which led the parents to lobotomy. This has reignited interest in a procedure that was controversial in its merits when practiced through the 1930’s to the 1970’s; the opportunity to learn more is now here with the newly published ""Patient H.M."" by Luke Dittrich.  Henry Gustave Molaison, born in 1926, was never a member of any famous family. He was the only son of poor hardworking parents and at fourteen had a run-in with a vehicle with his bicycle. The accident left him with head injuries that caused epileptic seizures, where he blanked out for minutes or severely convulsed frequently every day. In 1953, he became the patient of author Luke Dittrich's grandfather, Dr. Bill Beecher Scofield who was a ground- breaking neurosurgeon using experimental techniques on his patients. In an effort to alleviate the then untreatable symptoms of many mental illnesses, Scofield expanded the brain research of those prior, created his own surgical tools, drilled into the skulls and removed parts of the brain theoretically linked to volatility, psychoses and disrupted mood. Henry was a unique case because he was ""normal"", aside from the seizures. Very little was known about how the brain functioned, aside from wounded soldiers who returned with diminished function but no certainty where in the brain the damage lay. If other functions were affected by Henry's surgery, it was theorized, that his ""normal"" brain could lead to the physical location of their purpose. Even though he was unable to locate a focal area, which could be found through technology, Dr. Scofield went ahead with the surgery. The seizures did not stop. In 1953 Patient H.M. was ""born"". The surgery had grossly impaired Henry's memory, classifying him as amnesiac. Patient H.M. was the most highly studied medical case ever recorded. No one knew his identity. The concepts of memory and its the variations became a new field of study created by the research done on Patient H.M. The biographical contents about H.M. are prolific with summaries of extensive research, the findings which then generated more intensive probing into other areas, accounts of experiments and data done by former scientists somehow linked and the ongoing exploration with lobotomy by Dr. Bill Scofield and other neurosurgeons like him. Author Dittrich alluded to a ""darkness"" in his own family history, early in this medical history and a certain grimness shadows much of the writing, with reason. He writes about his single-minded surgeon grandfather logically and carefully, yet tinges of disrespect for the man's narcissistic thought process concerning the mentally ill patients so casually used in his lobotomy surgeries show that Dittrich is conflicted about his famous relative. His mother remembers her father fondly, the bedtime storyteller and family man on wonderful vacations. The ugly side of medical research, on living things - the chimpanzees with partial brains, the little monkeys operated on time and again, the memory tasks shaped, then more bits of brain dug out - saddened even as they illuminated. Scofield's surgeries graphically recalled with bone dust flying and brain tissue suctioned left me squeamish as the author detailed the now-understood brain functions that had been so cavalierly removed - just to see how the patient would recover. Underlying everything was the knowledge that his very dear grandmother had been institutionalized a number of times and subjected to the brutal hyperthermic, hypothermic and violent electric shock treatments of the era for psychosis, eventually a muted version of herself returned to her family. And more...the darkness of loss... A few drawbacks- there were times that I found myself skimming through the many, many of Patient H. M.'s recorded conversations, which changed little from their first presentation. The administrative politics by possessive university researchers around H.M.'s data are diplomatically reported, but overlong in relation to the important substance of this story. Just a note, not a negative- The quantity of scientific information is substantial; you must have some interest in this area to appreciate it.""Patient H.M"" is a serious, accomplished history of the zealous doctor who believed that his refined brain corrective surgery technique- the Lobotomy- would bring emotional peace to his era's deeply disturbed mentally ill patients. It is an unflinching record of the man, Patient H.M. and the amnesia created by that surgery, his personal loss and the unprecedented human test case which was his life for nearly six decades. It is a reflection on medical ethics, compassion and in author Luke Dittrich's case, a weighty personal legacy that he has shared intimately.I received this book as an ARC from NetGalley for an honest opinion. Think you to Random House Publishers and author Luke Dittrich as well."
6,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"This book is much more than the title suggests. Yes, a biography of Henry Molaison ""Patient H.M."", the most studied brain in documented history, but also a history of neuroscience and neurosurgery in the mid-twentieth century, a personal family history of the author, a psychiatric case study of amnesia, and finally a bitter legal/ professional feud that cost careers and reputations. Luke Dittrich is a journalist, but he is also the grandson of William Scoville, one of the preeminent neurosurgeons of the 20th century. Scoville performed hundreds of lobotomies on patients, including one on a severely epileptic young man, Henry. Patient H.M. is the theme in this book, but he comes in an out of focus. Introduced early on, Dittrich then veers into his own family's history, his grandmother's schizophrenia and institutionalizations, his grandfather's development of surgical tools, and his practice of lobotomizing patients. I was critical of this family section at first, thinking we would get this personal veneer. However, Dittrich does not deify his larger than life family member. While realizing his skill and immense knowledge, he also portrays Scoville as brash, sometimes reckless, and even shares some of the accidents that happened on his operating table. The book again shifts course, delving into a medical and scientific history, referring back to Patient H.M. and Scoville throughout. We learn about the developments in this burgeoning field of neuroscience and mental health, and the things that lead to what we now know about the brain - including the atrocities of medical experimentation on living subjects, vivisections, and all sorts of other procedures through history performed on slaves, the disabled in mind and body, and people in various detainment camps. This is a hard section to read, but one that can't be ignored. Dittrich turns back to Patient H.M., now a middle-aged man living with debilitating amnesia due to Scoville's procedure on his brain. He is the most studied patient case at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Here Dittrich looks at the unique case of consent, and what that means with a patient with amnesia, and the loose ethics of the researchers who claimed to have Henry Molaison's best intentions in mind.Molaison died in 2008 at the age of 82. Dittrich writes about his life with empathy and curiosity, imagining what an intelligent man (who scored high in IQ tests) lived with everyday, with this profound amnesia. Along with some of the descriptions of the medical atrocities, this was a very unsettling chapter. There were gross professional and scientific ethics violations on the part of several researchers after his death. Dittrich doesn't gloss over this fact, and it is upsetting to read, especially realizing that Molaison was taken advantage of in this way. This controversy continued through 2016 between Dittrich and Suzanne Corkin, the neuroscientist who had worked with Molaison for 40 years. This is a book that I will think about for a long time. So much of what we know about how the brain works - specifically how memories are formed and recalled - are thanks to Henry Molaison."
7,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"Interesting and full of historical progression to the study and surgery of the brain during the last century USA. How in and out of institutional care or hospital settings, the occasion and purpose of the surgical interventions to mental health or emotive issues lead to mapping for function brain knowledge.All of this is in minutia detail to place, time frame, historical precedents too, in most cases. It is not an easy read book, and takes tangents barely related, or clearly off subject through the familial Dittrich ancestor history. Again and again.The way it is told is never linear. Quite beyond that, it circumvents the globe to most groupings to subject in particular, or continuity. This is immersed within the author's Grandfather's life story. Dr. Scoville of lobotomy fame. The same.H.M. is the patient of more than 50 year amnesic testing who featured so strongly within the territories of his particular deficits after his Scoville surgery. His case is legend and his answers after surgery pushed the study of MEMORY in humans. It's instructive. Some of the various histories are horrific. And former ""ethics"" of other ages as quoted and recorded, hard to equate within the ""eyes"" of this current time's medical morals and legal perimeters. The life history of his Grandmother, and her many and different institutional stays, and various therapeutic ""cures"" was enthralling. It was memorable to think all of that occurred less than 100 years ago. And most less than 50 years ago.But on the whole, the quality for the tracts of direction for the wider scientific information (re H.M's life and others) was obscured by the writing style, organizational pattern, and opinions (almost all anecdotal and not clinical count supported) by the author. Still, I'm glad that I read it.None of it surprised me at all. Surgeons are still treading on unknown ground for 100's of reasons and are often entirely less honest than Dr. Scoville about the mistakes, on top of it. But I don't think they venture quite so often, and not for these levels of wider reasons deemed acceptable as ""surgeon's choice"" then.It seems epilepsy, OCD, any obstructive to normal behaviors condition as deemed objectionable, was reason to incur this kind of drastic lottery for a ""change"". It seems some post-voids were actually ""happier"". There was a scale of zero to 4 for interpretations of change to ""better"" afterwards. In most cases, but not all, ""better"" equates to ""passive"". The definitions have changed, as well.H.M. experienced life outside of any mainstream or individual ""choices"" before his surgery because of his medical condition. Yet, it is a rationalization if he was better or happier afterwards. Regardless, his case for decades, did illuminate and display what occurs when entire brain locations are siphoned away. "
8,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,4,"""Have you been here before?"" These words are a kind of elegy that end Patient H.M.: A Story of Memory, Madness & Family Secrets by Luke Dittrich, a most remarkable tale that represents a search that is at times clinical, anatomical and genealogical, an investigation into the nature of memory but also the life of the author's grandfather, Dr. William Beecher Scoville and his most famous patient, Henry Molaison. The book examines the nature of various attempts to deal with mental illness through lobotomy, labelled ""Psychosurgery"" by those who specialized in it, chief among them being Dr. Scoville, an accomplished surgeon with credentials from Yale, Penn Medical School, Bellevue & Johns Hopkins. However, there were other medical practitioners who lacked any background in surgery but who also practiced lobotomy without much insight into what the end result might be for the patient. Patient H.M. is best viewed as a mystery story and not an extended case study of mental illness with lobotomy as an attempted cure. The author initially searches for details about his grandmother, Lisa Scoville Dittrich, the wife of Dr. Scoville and oddly enough also treated for behavior viewed as abnormal by Wm. Scoville after being incarcerated at an asylum called ""The Institute for Living"". Luke Dittrich's pathway involves a series of personal excavations that include his grandparents but also distinguished researchers at McGill & MIT who studied the after-effects of lobotomy, particularly the one performed on Henry Molaison, whose life was altered when struck on his bicycle and who was prone to epileptic seizures. It is this case that takes precedence over all others in this book because H.M. was not suffering from mental illness when the lobotomy was performed by Dr. Scoville. One of the odd coincidences is that Scoville himself lost a brother who died after a bike accident. Another is that the author's grandmother Lisa (Dr. Scoville's wife) & a close friend named Suzanne Corkin who becomes the primary researcher at MIT on the impact of the lobotomy on H.M., went to the same private high school in West Hartford & they attended Smith College together. Patient H.M. gradually becomes an exploration into the nature of memory and it is this that fascinated me as various clues unfold about Luke Dittrich's family connections and the work of Dr. Scoville & others. A colleague and non-surgeon, Dr. Walter Freeman, conducts ""trans-orbital"" lobotomies inserting an ice pick just below the eye in another attempt to deal with mental illness. There was a feeling by Freeman & others that any psychiatrist could perform a lobotomy, even without any surgical training. At one point, the author asks: ""Were the men in charge of asylums as mad as the inmates?"" His conclusion is that so long after the lobotomies, one can't put ghosts on the couch or the witness stand, as the main lobotomy practitioners have passed away at the time when Dittrich is conducting his ""postmortem"" into the long-term impact of lobotomy, once considered a possible cure for homosexuality as well. It was not that long ago that the procedure was seen by some as a panacea but our comprehension of the many sub-regions of the brain and their interrelation with memory and other aspects of life was at a rather primitive early stage at that point. The unfolding scientific research that ultimately caused a much fuller understanding into H.M.'s post-lobotomy amnesia causes Dittrich's book to resemble a detective story. In reading Patient H.M, I was reminded of some of the neurological case studies done by the late Dr. Oliver Sachs but it also prompted me to recall an excellent documentary film, My Architect where the film's director, Nathaniel Kahn, pieces together a string of details that help him to better understand who his father, distinguished architect Louis Kahn, really was. (During the architect's lifetime, Nathaniel was kept in the shadows because his father had a primary, recognized family, while he was the child of Louis Kahn's mistress.) I suspect that in reading a few of the reviews, some readers became impatient with Patient H.M.. However, if one regards the book as a mystery story about the frontiers of memory, the linkage between brain & behavior, as well as the unraveling of clues about Luke Dittrich's colorful family, it seems easier to remain focused with a tale that ends up being quite non-linear. After all, with a mystery story, one doesn't require that the solution be revealed early on, long before the clues have been assembled.Here is just one of the aspects of Patient H.M. that I found compelling:Prior to 1950, memory was not associated with a particular structure of the brain but was thought to be distributed equally or equipotentially across the cerebral landscape. According to this early view, attempting to locate the seat of memory was the neurological equivalent of a snipe hunt: it simply did not exist. Eventually, it was discovered not only that this was a false conclusion but that whenever a normal person is paying conscious attention to something, he is simultaneously recording it in the temporal cortex of each hemisphere. Every conscious aspect of the experience seems to be included in these records. It was as Wilder Penfield would later describe it, as though there were a ""tape recorder"" in the brain, activated at the moment of birth & stopping only at death. Each event in a person's life is stored away as a distinct ""nuerone pathway."" Even later events that people might later have no ability to recall of their own volition, the ephemera of everyday life, were all carefully preserved. It would appear, Penfield said, that the memory record continues intact even after the subject's ability to recall it disappears.Much of the book is of course about post-lobotomy Henry Molaison, on whom the operation was performed by Dr. Scoville not to deal with mental illness but as an experiment to treat his epilepsy, making him just by chance, a ""pure subject"". There are some who treat H.M. almost as a commodity but Brenda Milner, educated at the University of Cambridge & working at McGill University in Montreal, is easily the heroine of this tale, someone who while conducting meticulous research on Henry, always treated him as a person rather than merely as a ""subject"". It is said that the most compelling moments were those when Henry, ""the most studied human research subject in history"" would attempt to explain what it was like to be him. Some aspects of the study seem ghoulish at times, such as when there is a legal fight over the access to dissected images of Henry's brain after he dies, causing the author to comment: ""My grandfather had cut a hole in Henry's memory & now one of the many people who had profited from that was cutting another hole, this one in our memory of Henry."" But there are also wonderful touches such as when the author examines some of the personal debris left behind in a box by his grandfather, Dr. Wm. Scoville, including a pair of specialized glasses he used when performing lobotomies, concluding that the spectacles were symptomatic of a special myopia that may have been analogous with the surgeon's worldview or his perspective with regard to patients, H.M. & his own wife among them.The ending is eloquent & almost resembles a dialogue in a Harold Pinter play at times, when an esteemed scientist named Dr. Karl Pribram comes to visit Henry Molaison. Pribram is 92, weakened by chemotherapy for cancer & suffering from memory loss himself. At a point during the visit Karl Pribram & Henry Molaison are left alone & Pribram reflects:And I was left with H.M. And I remember vividly. What happened was. Something like. Whatever was going on. Someone was called out of the room. Came back in. And H.M. said, ""Have you been in here before?""There are some aspects of Patient H.M. that could have used additional support. Among them, I think a brief diagram of the brain regions would have been enormously helpful, as would a glossary of some of the many anatomical terms that the author tosses about within the book. However, while this book is probably not of interest to everyone, I found it quite enthralling, in spite of the listed minor misgivings.*Within my review are photos of the author, Luke Dittrich, Dr. Wm. Beecher Scoville & lastly the image of H.M's brain as compared with a normally functioning brain."

As a scientist and secondary to the supposed fame of the main character of the book, I was mildly surprised to find out I'd never heard of him. So the story overall was fascinating. The author's personal connection to the story was gripping. And ultimately the book finished on a whole side piece which revolved around scientific research, intrigue, and ethics that was extremely engaging. There were definitely some devious characters who dealt with the research on this individual. Really calls into question their results. Overall, I imagine it sheds doubt on tons of research that was performed on this man. And if it doesn't...it should. Great read."
10,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8142338-jenni-ogden,4,"Luke Dittrich, the author, and a prize-winning journalist, has written a fascinating, well-researched, and brave book about patient H.M. and Dittrich’s own grandfather, William Beecher Scoville, the neurosurgeon who performed the bilateral hippocampectomy that resulted in H.M’s dramatic and global amnesia, and precipitated him into his future as the most famous and studied medical case of all time. Of course, H.M. was never aware of his fame, although his comments sometimes hinted that he had a fleeting knowledge of his role as a experimental participant in thousands of memory experiments, mostly carried out at MIT in Cambridge, Boston. Dittrich delves into the ethics of psychological research (and indeed the much more controversial ‘experimental’ neurosurgical procedure performed by his grandfather), as well as the historic memory findings of the small number of researchers allowed access to H.M. The neurosurgical procedure, even viewed through a historical lens, was probably unethical, but the 50 + years of research following the discovery of H.M.’s amnesia, was not. Consent , as far as this was possible given H.M.’s amnesia, was sought, as were psychiatrist’s assessments of H.M.’s willingness to participate. Basically, once H.M. became amnesic, if he had not become an experimental participant he would probably have had a much more terrible life, forgotten and possibly neglected or abused in a back ward of a nursing home or a psychiatric institution somewhere. As Dittrich implies, he could have been treated more generously by MIT, especially in terms of money for his everyday needs, but anyone who knew H.M. would realise that perhaps his everyday needs were catered for in spite of these being very modest. For a man with no memory it is difficult to conceive of what else to supply to improve his existence. Again, for those who knew him, he did seem, almost always, in the moment, content. The occasional displays of brief annoyance are somewhat over-emphasised, and in the short but intense periods I worked with him, I certainly never saw one. It is hard to be angry when one can’t remember what one is being angry about. Would a patient like H.M. be treated differently today? I suspect not, except in the sense of a more careful and thoughtful consideration of who should make decisions regarding his treatment, both as an experimental participant and regarding his medical treatment. There is no evidence that he had anything other than the best medical treatment in any case, but perhaps these decisions today would be overseen by an independent ethical committee, rather than the scientists and medical practitioners associated with MIT and one good friend of the family who became his trustee. From the testimony of many patients who are unambiguously able to give fully informed consent to participating in all manner of experiments, medical or psychological, knowing full well that the results will not benefit them, they willingly participate because they hope the experiment will benefit others, and often it also prevents boredom, or at least takes their minds off their own problems for a while. There is every reason to believe this is how H.M. felt as well, if only in the moment each time he was asked. This is certainly something he expressed. In today’s world there would of course be a much more formal and probably repeated written consent process to go through, but in the 1950s and 60s, informed consent was very much up to individual researchers, and medical ethics and patient rights not well understood. In H.M.’s case, one might even speculate that for someone else, or some trust, to have made a decision on his behalf that he should NOT contribute in this way could also have been seen as unethical. And of course, participants in these experiments tend to get the very best medical care, simply because they are part of a carefully controlled and well-funded study. So the tragedy of H.M. was that he had intractible epilepsy, and that he was a guinea pig in a neurosurgical procedure that should never have been conducted, even given the knowledge at the time. Removing both hippocampi rather than just one (as is done today) is a neurosurgical decision difficult to comprehend, and suggests that Scoville was treating H.M. in a way that was unethical and disrespectful. The triumph of H.M. was the research that occurred later; its immense importance to neurosciences and thousands of patients since at the very least made the terrible sacrifice of his memory and independence less horrifying. This is how I believe the H.M. I knew would want to be remembered, not as a victim of a cowboy neurosurgeon. To give Scoville his due, he did campaign widely after he realised what damage his surgery had done, to ensure that this operation would never be done again. The protection of H.M. throughout his research life is given considerable space in the book, and probably to the reader this protection seems extreme, and more for the benefit of the scientists than H.M. However, it is always considered ethical to ensure that experimental participants remain anonymous (and if they do not, they must give fully informed consent to this). So H.M. had to be protected during his life. It is amazing that, in spite of his many caregivers and 100 researchers knowing who he was and where he lived, no-one, including Dittrich, who tried very hard to track him down, ever found him! Professor Suzanne Corkin should be commended rather than blamed for this incredible feat. As H.M.’s importance to neuroscience grew, so did the likelihood that he would be exploited and tested constantly (rather than two or three periods of a few weeks each year on his visits to MIT) if his identity had been known and his access to researchers poorly monitored. The final chapter in the H.M. story, at least as told in this book, concerns the acrimonious disagreements about the “ownership” of his brain following the sectioning of it. It is a story I hadn’t heard before, and it certainly raises questions about the ethics of science. However, Dittrich’s book presents only one side in detail, that of the outstanding neuroanatomist who sectioned the brain. It wasn’t for lack of effort on Dittrich’s part; he persistently tried to also hear and report the side of the scientists and administrators at MIT and MGH. But scientists and universities are wary of journalists, and protecting their own policies, and this is not especially surprising. Of course this is a brain that was given by H.M. (or his ‘trustee’ —whether or not we think this trustee was properly selected for the job and had H.M.’s best interests at heart) to science, and where it resides, or whether it is scattered between different institutions and for whose benefit, is a difficult issue. It perhaps will never be an issue the public will be able to debate as it has been kept close to the universities involved. Let us hope that this squabble between scientists does not detract from the amazing science they have all done, and future discoveries that continue to rely on the thousands of peer-reviewed scientific articles already published about H.M’s working brain, and the new findings still hidden in that hard-working sectioned and only partly studied dead brain. Only in that way can H.M.’s incredible and willing contribution (if his own comments can be believed) be maximised and H.M.'s sacrifice be respected. Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for providing me an advanced reader copy of this elegantly written book."

The attempts to weave together Henry M.'s story and the history of the surgeon who performed his lobotomy was not entirely successful. There were too many other patients and other surgeons muddled the story and made it hard to follow.(Thank you to NetGalley and Random House for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.)"
12,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32379875-marjorie,4,"This is a non-fiction book about Patient H.M., whose name was Henry Molaison. It’s a tragic story of a man used as a human guinea pig for decades. He was only 27 years old when he received a radical new lobectomy to cure him of epilepsy, which left him with short-term amnesia. He then became a live research study for the rest of his life, until his death at age 82. Interestingly, the author of this book is the grandson of William Beecher Scoville, the man who performed the lobectomy on Henry. Dr. Scoville went on to perform surgery on thousands of other patients. As the author delves into the work of his grandfather, he learns of his own family’s dark secrets of madness. And last but not least, there’s even a battle for poor dead Henry’s brain and who it belongs to.This non-fiction book reads like a horror story. It not only covers the story of Henry Molaison but it also tells of the beginnings of studies on the human brain in ancient times, takes you into insane asylums when they were at their worst with patients being tortured in the name of a cure and tells of the horrendous experiments done by the Nazis. It’s an interesting book but tough to read. The author doesn’t hold back anything and explicitly details the experiments and surgeries performed.Luke Dittrich has written a very brave and personal book. He has turned Patient H.M. from a research object into a human being. He bares the ruthlessness of the scientific world in this well-researched and humane study of medical research.This book was given to me by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."
13,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2219555-andreea,5,"Even if this book had already two attributes that appealed to me (medical book and memory) I was hooked right from the start. I immediately admired the style, the rhythm, the structure. I could say this is the perfect nonfiction for my taste: biography, medicine, history, reportage, personal opinion. The fact that the book is written by the grandson of the neurosurgeon who performed ‘that’ surgery on Henry Molaison was even more enticing for me.What I learned from it? The most surprising thing: you can live without a part of your brain. Damaged, but alive. I really didn’t know that. Then I learned about how people experimented on people (not that I didn’t know that, but everytime I read about it, it makes me sick). How many doctors operated without knowing how the brain worked, how they tried things and which discoveries they made. (Here and there fine sarcasm and irony can be depicted, but we have to remember that even if what those doctors did back then was indeed experimental and immoral, a God play, how could the medicine evolve the way it did without these trials and errors?) I learned about the Nuremberg Code which was set up after the attrocities that the Nazis inflicted on people during WW2. And I also learned about other bad guy in the story, who acted out of ego, of recognition desire and who destroyed a lot of evidence of the experiments and trials H.M. was subject to.Jason’s story was the answer to my questions: how far did the medicine and research get to? How would Henry be treated today, with all the new technology and knowledge? Even if it wasn’t human mistake that made Jason similar to Patient H.M., even if Jason was more independent and aided by the sci-fi world we live in, both of them are the same: they live(d) in a present blink of an eye, without a future.This book taught me so much, I read it with Google Images and Wikipedia next to me and also read a lot of articles about the main characters. It’s definitely a win for me."
14,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8488828-olivia,5,"""Patient H.M."" is a beautifully and lyrically written work of nonfiction about H.M., the history of medicine and neuroscience, the doctors who treated H.M. and the author's own life (the author is the grandson of the doctor who treated H.M.). All medical, science, and psychology students know the immortal patient H.M. whose experiences taught us so much about the brain and memory. As a doctoral student, I remember hearing about the death of H.M. and learning his identity in awe of this individual who had given so much to science despite his unfortunate circumstances. Later, as researchers began preserving and slicing his brain, we were able to view over webcam the careful process. This book is a necessary accompaniment to the textbook description of H.M. The respect for patient H.M. is enormous as we would not be where we are today without the knowledge he has kindly helped us to attain. Dittrich writes about H.M. in depth, discussing his past and his conversations with researchers, as well as information about the brain and history of what we know to compete the story. Indeed, I believe this book will become a staple for anyone who wishes to learn about memory and a necessary book in many college courses.The inclusion of stories about Dittrich and his grandfather flesh out the book to keep readers engaged and interested in all aspects of the story of H.M. including the doctors and scientists who worked with him.This book is written in an approachable and understandable way. I think even non-science majors will find it interesting and educational.

I remember thinking if I had been listening to the audiobook I would have thought for sure the file was messed up. Despite being an unconventional method of storytelling, I can't imagine the story being told any other way. The author makes it work.The story itself is horrifying and brings into question the ethics of medical research. Is it ok to use psychiatric patients to perform experimental brain surgery? I would think the obvious answer is no. The author's grandfather was a neurosurgeon who performed lobotomies and who over the years perfected his unique technique on countless psychiatric patients. Patient H.M. was an epileptic and his first 'normal' patient to receive a lobotomy. The damage this surgery caused to Patient H.M.'s brain and memory was a major turning point in H.M.'s life and for memory science. He became the most studied human research subject in history. Most of what we know about how memory works is based on studies done with H.M.The big question: was it worth it?

20,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5776367-donna,4,"As a psychology student coming across H.M. and his story for the first time, one might be hit by the overwhelming tragedy of his case. Briefly, Patient H.M. is one of the most famous and well-studied individuals in the field of psychology, due to a lobotomy that was supposed to reduce or eradicate his epileptic seizures, and that instead took away his ability to form new memories. That wallop of heartbreak begins to fade as you come across his initials in the literature time and time again. He becomes a study subject, and you become numb to his humanity. This book makes that tragedy real again.The author Luke Dittrich, a working journalist, is the grandson of the man who performed that fateful ""psychosurgery"" on Henry Molaison more than half a century ago, and this book is a unique blend of medical history (of the brain, mental illness, and memory), biography (an attempt, at least, at making Henry more than just his test results), and family discovery, as the author's research leads him to uncomfortable revelations about his grandfather, William B. Scoville.This book is not sensationalist, but neither is it completely unbiased (though it doesn't pretend to be). Dittrich does make his opinions fairly clear, and the reader is free to agree or disagree (it is difficult, though, for me to come up with a charitable interpretation of Sue Corkin's behaviour), so full marks for information and story. It loses a little bit of a star because of his over-reliance on certain literary tricks. Around 85% of the chapters begin like this:""The [noun] was in the [room] on [place and or time].""After a paragraph of scene-setting, an informative historical detour, and a personal anecdote, we then finally get to the meat of the chapter. This is fine once or twice, but there are THIRTY-ONE CHAPTERS IN THIS BOOK. Enough is enough. This constant back-and-forth also makes it difficult to keep track of the historical timeline, and as Dittrick refuses to hold the reader's hand as the time/place/story changes multiple times in a given chapter, it can also be tricky to remember who we were originally reading about when, near the end of the chapter, we finally return to the scene set in the beginning.So 4 stars, HIGHLY recommended, has some problems, and I don't even care.""Maybe the human brain is an object beyond the reach of metaphor, for the simple reason that it is the only object capable of creating metaphors to describe itself. There really is nothing else like it. The human brain creates the human mind, and then the human mind tries to understand the human brain, however long it takes and whatever the cost."""

25,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33478353-lew-button,5,"Patient H.M. by Luke Dittrich; Random HouseI heard about a scientist who was doing experiments on frogs. One day he cut the leg off of a frog and said, “Jump” and the frog jumped. He cut off two legs and said, “Jump” and once again the frog jumped. He had the same result when he cut off a third leg. The he finally cut off the fourth leg and said, “Jump”. This time the frog didn’t move and the scientist wrote in his journal, “When you cut off a frog’s legs it goes deaf”.I know that is a dumb story and a scientist would never jump to conclusions, or would he/she? If you think a scientist never makes such stupid observations you need to read this book, Patient H.M. In the opening pages the author is interviewing a neuroanatomist who is working on the brain of H.M. and he says to the author, “See how much work I have to do to clean up the mess your grandfather made?” The author’s grandfather was Dr. William Beecher Scoville who is one of the main characters in this book about the brain and those who study it.Patient H.M. is another of the principal characters and he is the main focus of much of the work on the brain. His brain is so important that grown men and women fought for it. For those who never heard of Patient H.M. he is well known among neuroscientists. When I told a neuropsychologist with whom I work that I was reviewing a book called Patient H.M. he said’ “Everybody knows Patient H.M”. Not everybody. I had never heard of him until I saw the blurb about this book. This book was difficult reading but not because it wasn’t well written. It is well written and well researched, quite accessible to those who do not have a scientific background. I highly recommend it for that.The book is a difficult read because it shows what scientists are willing to do in the name of science without accountability or clear boundaries. E.E. Slosson was honest enough to admit, “…the aim of science is the advancement of human knowledge at any sacrifice of human life.” (Kindle Location 1759)An early President of the American Medical Association apparently espoused this view also when he operated on 14 black slave women, some of whom he bought for research, to perfect a procedure he would use later on white women. And how was this dealt with? He got a statue in Central Park.Luke Dittrich portrays honestly the hubris of many in the scientific community, especially those associated with the most famous brain, that of Henry Molaison. Until he died, he was known only as H.M. ( I find it interesting that with all the other ways Henry was invaded that doctors chose not to invade his privacy by revealing his name.)The author is also enough honest to say that his grandfather actually messed up H.M.’s brain and this was discovered when the brain was dissected and each slice made into a block face image. Those images became a battle ground between two or three scientific communities. I guess the scientists had never heard the expression, “It is amazing what can be accomplished when you don’t care who gets the credit.”Back to my opening lines for this review. I am amazed that a scientist is willing to mess with a part of the brain without knowing the end result. Dr. Scoville was prolific in performing lobotomies but it wasn’t until after he performed hundreds that he began to ask what really happened. It seems he, and other  lobotomizers, were only looking at one result—calming down the behavior of those in asylums without thinking about all the other things that happened when the frontal lobes were removed.I will think twice before I give a doctor permission to work on my brain. And if my wife is reading this review let me add that if I become incompetent to make decisions please do let anyone with the name of Scoville touch my brain.Dr. Scoville was willing to operate on the brain of his own wife after she was committed to a psych ward but I don’t want him or any other doctor in this book to fool around with my brain. I am doing just fine, thank you.This book is a fascinating read, well written, thoroughly researched using archived letters and going back to the original sources. I highly recommend it.I was given a galley of this book by netgalley.com solely with the understanding that I would read it and write a review."
26,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502678-gail,4,"It's the 1940s. You're depressed. Maybe you hear voices, maybe not. You're anxious and increasingly unable to get through the day. You're sexually obsessed. You're aggressive sometimes. You're a woman. You're married. You have money for the best care. Welcome to the insane asylum, euphemistically called The Institute of Living. They'll start out with conservative treatment: freezing cold packs, high temperature treatment designed to ""burn"" out the demons that haunt you, and the ever helpful shock therapy. Nothing much works. But lucky you, psychosurgery will swoop in to save the day, right there on your home ""campus"", in an O.R. down the hall. Your very own ace neurosurgeon can lobotomize you and figure out if it will help, because of course there is no way to know. The cowboy surgeon just thinks it might .. and you'll make a lovely experiment. For one thing, you can talk, and all those monkeys who've had the procedure were not especially helpful. While you won't likely die, you also won't necessarily improve, though you'll be more docile. And docile, especially in a woman, is a good thing. With an almost unlimited supply of patients, the procedure becomes common. Eventually, it moves out of the asylum and into the world of epileptics, a population of ""normal"" people with intractable symptoms. Another opportunity to make your name in the rising world of psychosurgery-- brain surgery for non-injuries. In 1953, the leading lobotomist and the most innovative (read: willing to try anything), meets Henry Molaison, who will become Patient H.M., the most famous patient in neurosurgical history. The surgeon, William Scoville, M.D., decides to try out a never-bef0re-done radical, bilateral removal of a significant hunk of Henry's brain. The results are just as radically terrible. His epilepsy isn't resolved. Worse, he is unable to recall anything for longer than about a minute or two; he lives ""in the moment"", all the time. He recalls some details of his past, but nothing that would resemble real memories. And, he can't form new ones at all. He is profoundly amnesic, the worst case recorded. And so the journey begins, trying to figure out what the surgeon dug out that created this mess. Can we finally learn where memory resides? For the next sixty years, Henry will be tested, drilled, examined and studied as the mystery to discover what makes him who he is, progresses. Woven into the book is another story (or two). The author is the grandson of the surgeon who performed the surgery. His grandmother was a patient at The Institute for Living off and on for years. Her limited medical records become part of the story, as we learn how mental illness was managed by psychiatrists of the time. Integral to the story is the person of William Scoville. What compelled Dr. Scoville to take so many chances in the surgical suite? Who were his peers and what did they think of his work? How were Scoville and others able to commit what in retrospect were such unsupervised, untested, and brutal surgeries on so many people, mostly women? And who were the psychologists who made a career and lifetime studying Henry? Several, both women, have starring roles in the narrative. This is a sobering and at times almost gruesome tale. Very well-written, the narrative takes you all over the country and back into history, exploring the origins of brain surgery and the men who established their reputations on a willingness to try anything with little thought about the abuse entailed in what they did. The professional rivalries are a tale unto themselves. MIT has already complained about the book (they do not come out of this looking like the good guy -- or gal, in the case of the lead researcher). While at times it is hard to follow the divergent narrative threads -- the author's family story, Henry, lobotomy researches, and others -- they eventually come together. This is an important read that will give you pause on many levels. "
27,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4592109-lori-l-she-treads-softly,5,"Patient H.M.: A Story of Memory, Madness, and Family Secrets by Luke Dittrich is a very highly recommended account of his grandfather, Dr. William Beecher Scoville, an early brain surgeon, and his most famous patient, Henry Molaison. If you were mesmerized by The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot, you won't want to miss Patient H.M.: A Story of Memory, Madness, and Family Secrets by Luke Dittrich.Investigative journalist Luke Dittrich covers not only the story of Henry Molaison, an epileptic man who is considered one of the most important neuroscience human research subjects; he also explores the history of neurosurgery and lobotomies, and his own family history. Along the way ethical questions are raised regarding the treatment of Henry, famously only known as Patient H.M. for years, and how proprietorial researchers are on sharing information.Henry and his family agreed to brain surgery in order to stop the debilitating epileptic seizures he was having. While it did stop the seizures, it also causes short term amnesia. Henry could no longer remember any new information or form any new long term memories. After this he became Patient H.M., one of the most studied individuals over a span of decades, but also one whose identity was closely guarded.Dittrich takes the facts of Patient H. M. and early neurosurgery and makes the story personal. His grandfather was a pioneer in the field and the one to perform the surgery on Henry, but Dittrich also tells of his mentally-ill grandmother, and a family secret. In Patient H.M. the author takes an extremely interesting piece of history and makes it even more compelling because of the personal connection Dittrich has to it, while describing the limbo Henry found himself in, with no ties to recent memories. The writing is very good and this nonfiction account reads like a novel. I was immersed in Dittrick's family history, as well as the story of Henry himself and the history of neurosurgery. The legal fights over Henry's body and the ending was, well, stunning. You have to read this book which is sure to be in the top nonfiction of the year.Disclosure: My advanced reading copy was courtesy of the publisher for review purposes."
28,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112117-christina-dudley,4,"Fans of brain books will be familiar with the cast of characters and a lot of the how-the-brain-works and history of science material in PATIENT H.M., but the author covers new ground in detailing Henry Molaison's life and tying it to the author's own grandfather, who was a famous neurosurgeon.Henry Molaison suffered from severe epilepsy after an accident in his childhood. After years on increasing (and not very helpful) anti-epileptic drugs, he and his parents turned to lobotomy surgery as a possible solution. The good news: the epilepsy improved. The bad news: Henry could no longer form memories--or could he? The rest of H.M.'s life was spent in an eternal present, being studied to death by academics who sometimes worked together and sometimes fought over access to him.If you're interested in learning about memory, I would also recommend THE GUARDIAN OF ALL THINGS. For more on lobotomies nowadays, I loved OPENING SKINNER'S BOX. For general brain-damaged-folks-and-what-we-learned-from-them, try THE DUELING NEUROSURGEONS.If you like a little family memoir mixed with your history of science, this is a great read. Molaison's story is heartbreaking, and the book even has a surprise villain! Ah, those academics...My thanks to the publisher for the opportunity to review this fascinating book."

It's not what you'd call cheerful or ""happy-ending-ish"", right? But finally, I decided to bite the bullet and crack open the book. Wow! This has become more of a page-turner than most of the so-called ones I've read recently. Very well-written; perfectly staged to move from one aspect of the story to another and back again. The true story is amazingly fresh and insightful with regard to the field of neurosurgery and neuro-research. I would recommend this book, and will look forward to any future writings of this author. Many thanks to the publisher, Random House, and to Netgalley.com for allowing me the opportunity to review this book."

I find the author to be a show-off and a braggart. I wish we had learnt more about Henry himself and less about Scoville and all the neurosurgeon drama. "
32,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4939550-amantha,3,"I remember learning a little bit about Patient HM in my psychology classes in college. I don't think I learned a whole lot, other than a few basic facts. I recall seeing a video clip of a profoundly amnesic patient, but it wasn't HM. For one thing, the man I saw had a wife. For another, apparently the lead researcher in HM's case did not allow him to be video recorded. Either way, I saw an ARC for this book a few years ago when it was just published and I had to snag it due to the subject matter.The book itself was really fascinating at first. The only issue I had was that it jumped around in chronology. There was something of a cohesive narrative, but all the back-and-forth between times and settings and people (Henry and his family; Scoville and his family and career; other famous psychologists, brain patients, and historical figures) was a little dizzying. Still, it kept me fascinated until the last hundred pages or so.The last quarter or so of the book was dedicated to all the legal battles that followed the end of HM's life and into his postmortem existence. The author, Luke Dittrich, was originally denied access to HM while he was still alive. He describes how closely the lead researcher, Susan Corkin, restricted access to her famous patient. Dittrich goes on to show some really heated legal battles that arose from ownership questions over HM's brain. Corkin is not painted in the best of light at all. Is it deserved? Maybe. But all I felt was sadness that HM never had any control over himself and was not granted even basic dignity in death. I know the story would be incomplete if Dittrich left that part out. He would be just like Corkin herself, editing the story to make it fit a narrative. Nevertheless, I'm disgusted with the ""professionals"" involved in this case. Corkin in particular came off in a bad light. Her motives are made clear to an extent, but the narrative doesn't give any credence to her perspective. Did HM contribute invaluable data and resources to our understanding of memory? Well, even that is debatable given the final revelations Dittrich uncovers. It's a rather unsatisfactory end to an unfortunate story and an unfortunate life."

I mean, how can one not be after learning about them?Also, I must mention a few things that irked me. One I found the subheading quite a bit misleading. The family secrets aren't abundant and have hardly a mention, though there is much mention about relevant families in the story, including the author's. Second, I found the book was sometimes oddly structured. There was a lot of ""but first to understand this, we must go back to this"", and this phrase was repeated many times in the exact same way throughout the book. Luckily, this didn't make understand the information confusing really, I just think some of the transitions could have been done in a better.Overall though, I'm giving this book the great rating it deserves because it was truly fascinating, and a great way of learning the scientific history of the famous patient H.M."

37,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51152697-kate,4,"This is the story of Dr. William Beecher Scoville who was the primary supporter of lobotomy as a treatment. His grandson is the narrator and challenges us to confront some of the strangest rationalizations for the surgical destruction of the brains of people who rarely gave consent. That most of this aggressive surgical intrusion happened to come into vogue after the Nuremberg 'Doctors' Trials, where medical doctors who used concentration camp inmates for medical experiments were sentenced to death, and the judges set out a clear restriction on the meaning of informed consent.While it is true that medicine makes advances because ""the broken always illuminated the unbroken like patients Gago and Tan (who suffered brain injuries)but they had been broken by accident. But in the middle of the 20th century the breaking of human brains was intentional, premeditated, clinical.""Due to lack of knowledge about the brain, and gross overcrowding of asylums especially post-war the leading universities, psychologists and neurosurgeons worked with State and privately run asylums who offered up their patients for interventions that were at best the latest best guess procedures regardless if any studies had been done for the efficacy for improvement. The old medical philosophy "" first do no harm"" seemed to have been swept aside.All of this came after wholesale use of shock treatments both electrical and chemical were applied to pacify patients regardless of efficacy, the wholesale sterilization of people considered degenerate, who exhibited alcoholism, or lax morals, or birth defects, or epilepsy. And prisoners and black citizens who came to hospitals for treatment were denied treatment so their could be a defined control group. One can see that the line was very thin between the Doctors who were tried at Nuremberg and the practices of researchers and medical professions in this country, and the line was often crossed.An intriguing look at how medicine advances and about the internecine battles between researchers and universities to control data and the personhood of subjects like 'Patient H.M."" Patient H, M was surgically treated by the author's Grandfather who cut a little too deep and Henry lost all of his short term memory and became the subject of a life of tests by researchers.That lobotomies were applied as a treatment for shell shocked soldiers from WWII was tragic, that this incursion into the brain was mostly applied to females to keep them 'tractable' was beyond sad.That those interned in mental health institutions were offered up as guinea pigs without a thought says things about the ethics of many.An important read.

38,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,5,"This book was terrifying and emotional. Never have I ever read a science book that was so multi-faceted. There was science bits, family drama, court fights and whatnot.I salute Luke Dittrich for writing this book. It was really brave of him to write about his grandfather the way he did. His writing style is another thing that is praiseworthy. This book read like a mystery/thriller book. It switched back and forth between different timelines, there was drama, there were plot twists, it had great use analogies and myths to relate with the events of the book. Every person who was part of Henry's story was given a limelight. Luke, not only told us how these people were involved in Henry's story but also told us their story, their thought process, their background, which created this great gray area where no one was right and no one was entirely wrong. On one side there were doctors who were trying to do what they thought was right and on the other side there was Henry who lost everything because of one overly ambitious doctor. A well written terrifying tale of human greed, ambition, ego and thirst for fame. It's one of the best science non-fiction books I have read. A. must read."

He became amnesic and this man was then followed for researchers for almost 60 years. The neurosurgeon was obsessed with the brain and its function and his own wife was mentally ill.As a science nerd and an individual who has had neurosurgery myself I was engrossed with the story and with how little is still known about the human brain.Hundreds of patients in mental health asylums were subjected to lobotomies as treatment and as research on what the various areas of the brain were affecting the patients mental health.The story of H.M. begins before informed consent and HIPA privacy laws, yet the researchers protected his privacy throughout his long life.This was about the theory, practice and passion the psychiatrists, neurosurgeons and researchers as well as showing how there is risk in allowing surgeons access to patients bodies and lives."

I thought this would be about the doctor who worked with H.M. and their relationship, and the procedures they did. Instead, this seemed to be partially about that, but also about other doctors who performed procedures on other patients with issues similar to H.M.I would have enjoyed it more if the book didn't go off on so many tangents about other doctors and other patients. I did enjoy reading about other patients, and the history of lobotomies, but I thought I would be reading about H.M. more than I had. There was also a lot of background and stories about Scofield, the author's grandfather who operated on H.M., that had nothing to do with H.M. or medical procedures. It was a decent read, I was just hoping for more about H.M., and less about other patients. "

Its a fascinating look at neuroscience and what we know about the brain then and now - but more than that, its a fascinating look at the culture of doctors and scientists then and now. Doctors in the 60s had so much authority that people rarely questioned their decisions. Many of the patients in this book, including H.M. were treated as scientific experiments. Now the stigma around mental illness was a factor as well - these patients were ""lesser than"". Highly recommended. Enough science to keep my happy, but not so much to be dense.

Perhaps, this just isn't the time for me to be reading this, or I set my expectations too high, but I have lost interest in this book and the desire to finish reading it. More information as to why will follow.------------------ Updated Review--------------------I gave this one a good try, I did or at least feel like I did. At the 40% mark, I threw in the towel. Maybe my expectations were too high or maybe, this isn't a good time for me to be reading this (sometimes it's about timing books right), but I reached a point where I was no longer enjoying reading this, so this one is a DNF for me.There was a lot of good writing in here, but I think what failed me is that at almost the halfway point, I knew zip about Henry Molaison. The little bit I knew could have been gathered from the synopsis.What I did know was the author's grandmother had a history of mental illness and was institutionalized. I learned about mental asylums and the ""therapies"" they employed in an attempt to cure people. The history of neuropsychology was fascinating, but it isn't why I picked up the book.I felt the same with The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. There was a lot of interesting information and well-written to not come across as a medical textbook. Everything was explained clearly and understandable to the average reader with little to no medical knowledge, but who was Henry Molaison?I kept reading hoping the next chapter would have more about him, but would only find more information about the lobotomy's crude beginnings and the advances made over time. When I did finally get another glimpse at H.M., it was brief. Then back to more history lessons on mental asylums.At almost the halfway point, I have learned little to nothing about the man who was the reason I picked up the book. I expected to have some history lessons thrown in there, especially because the lobotomy that caused H.M.'s amnesia was not a rarity. I knew that a lot of the therapies experienced by patients during H.M.'s time were commonplace, but we now know did more harm than good. I was really interested in the fact that the author, Dittrich, was the grandson of the man who performed the lobotomy that changed H.M.'s life.The writing is not poor, in fact, it is interesting. I struggled with whether or not to give this book 1 star or 2 because I didn't absolutely hate it. I just didn't finish it. With all of the other books I'm currently reading and want/need to read, this fell to the back-burner and I started to lack the desire to pick it back up.Ultimately, I changed my rating to 2 stars because it is interesting, has finess to it that many medical-related books lack, and has a very interesting premise. It was just not the book for me. I think if I gave it another try in the future, I might be able to finish it without effort. Maybe not, but it was not constructed poorly and I didn't hate it. I just wanted more about Henry Molaison and less on the history of Dittrich's grandfather's rise to fame and neuropsychology/psychosurgeons."
47,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5216946-jill-elizabeth,4,"[This review originally appeared on my blog, www.Jill-Elizabeth.com.]Today we’re taking a trip inside the brain – quite literally – of the most famous brain surgery patient in history. My review copy of Patient H.M. was graciously provided by the publisher through NetGalley. If you don’t know NetGalley, it’s a very cool site that brings new books and authors to bloggers and reviewers (among others).“The broken have always illuminated the unbroken, and throughout history that breaking was often intentional.”Wow. Honestly, wow. That’s pretty much the reaction I had when I finished this one. There are so many points in the story – non-fiction at its finest, believe me – when that was the only thought I had. The quote sums it up nicely – this is the story of how one broken brain informed the actions of generations of doctors and patients, a brain that was broken with deliberation and intent. I was vaguely familiar with lobotomy as the historical treatment of choice for many mental – and physical – health issues ranging from “hysteria” (often defined as women behaving badly, according to the men in their lives) to epilepsy to homosexuality. I’ve seen and read Girl, Interrupted and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, was familiar with the story of Rosemary Kennedy. I find brain and identity science fascinating – stories like those of Phineas Gage raise extraordinary questions about who we are and what, exactly, makes us, well, us. If you find the tale of Phineas Gage and his personality changes interesting, you have got to read up on Patient H.M. – otherwise known as Henry Molaison.To make a very complex story very short (and vastly over-simplified), Molaison received what would today be called a traumatic brain injury in childhood (age 7); after the injury he suffered from multiple types of seizures over the course of years, rendering him incapable of living what most would consider a normal life. After years of therapy and treatment, he winds up in the hands of Dr. William Scoville and in the snip of a scalpel (actually, more like “with several scrapes of a spatula”), he is transformed from Henry Molaison into Patient H.M. From there, his “story” becomes world-renowned – the procedure effectively rendered him incapable of generating memories. Why the quotation marks around story, you ask? Simple: the word really no longer applies to Henry after his lobotomy, since his inability to create memories basically removes the concept of story from his life.“There is in fact only one way we tell stories about other people, and it’s the only way we’ve ever told stories about other people. We find the connections between us and them, and then we use those connections as a bridge.”“In the end, this is the difference between Henry and us: Henry could no longer hold on to the present, could no longer make new memories, which meant that he could no longer tell or even understand stories, at least ones that lasted more than a few moments.”Imagine that – a life without story, without narrative. No connections, past to present; no “aha!” moments because everything you encountered was always new, always all you knew. You can imagine it. Henry couldn’t.Dittrich’s descriptions of the origins of the lobotomy, of the variations and developments in the procedure over time, are written in crisp, clear prose. There are no flowers or flourishes; the words are as sharp and spare as the cuts that they describe. But they are incredibly chilling nevertheless… Dispassionate language aside, the facts remain startling and, to modern sensibilities, pretty unbelievable: asylum patients were freely given lobotomies and viewed as a nearly unlimited research resource for the physicians seeking to perfect the procedure; a disproportionate number of women underwent the procedures, many of whom were treated because they were seen as “intractable” or “difficult” – in other words, because they didn’t conform to the behavior society (and the men in their lives) deemed appropriate. Children were treated with lobotomies; cuts were made without any idea what was being cut into or what might be lost in the process. The procedures that often seem to have been adjusted on the fly, with the patient’s brain literally open to whatever the surgeon felt like trying. If one cut didn’t seem to be making a significant improvement, the next procedure made two; if removing one section of the brain wasn’t enough, more and more were removed until the doctors found different outcomes.Until Henry. (Sort of.)After post-operative studies of Henry revealed his “memory disorder” (a euphemistic description if ever there was one), things changed (sort of). Prior to Henry, post-op studies about memory and the role of particular brain lobes and regions were seen as somewhat limited in their descriptive capabilities. Asylum patients, after all, were (at least commonly understood to be) mentally ill. Henry was not; he received a lobotomy in an attempt to resolve his seizures – he was “normal” for all other intellectual, mental, and emotional purposes. So when his surgery resulted in outcomes vastly different than those noted in previous patients, the medical community took notice. The resolution of most of the seizure activity meant that the procedure was viewed as a success; the changes in Henry’s life were fascinating to doctors, psychologists and medical researchers, and the scientific theories and studies that derived from his decades-long immersion in research science still underpin much of what is understood about the brain today. The transcripts of Henry’s interviews and tests throughout the years are often painful to read. His struggles with memory and cognition continued unabated year after year – in inverse proportion to the successes of his surgeon, Dr. Scoville, and his long-term (largely self-appointed) psychologist-gatekeeper Suzanne Corkin. There is no shortage of irony in this story, I assure you, and the battles over Henry’s body and legacy are astonishing from legal and ethical standpoints to say the least…But Dittrich’s book isn’t just a history of Henry and the lobotomy, it’s also a story about stories. “Sometimes just a few words can change everything you thought you knew about the story you thought you were telling.” So the author comes to realize as his study of the intertwining tale of Henry and Dr. Scoville – Dittrich’s own grandfather. Throughout, Dittrich maintains a level of objectivity that I imagine must have been personally challenging. This is, after all, the story of people he not only knows, but is related to. He demonstrates an unflinching ability to present what are often cold, unvarnished facts and difficult, severe truths, yet to somehow imbue the overall story with compassion and warmth. His grandfather may have needed to maintain a level of distance from his patients; Dittrich does not. He never lets us forget that this is, ultimately, a tale of broken people – broken by chance or biology, by nature or society – and their quest to become unbroken. Or that both the broken and those who sought to fix them were human – and that to be human means we are all fallible, even when we (or society, or family, or our peers) seem to be telling us otherwise. The book is as much Scoville’s story as it is Henry’s, and the delicate maneuvering between past and present and between doctor and patient provides a marvelous tale – and one with a mind-altering (pun intended) realization served up deftly at the end. This is, to me, the hallmark of successful non-fiction writing – there are moments when it is all too easy to forget that this is a tale of scientific and medical history, when the stories overwhelm the science and you find yourself hoping for a nice, tidy, fiction ending. What you get is a lot messier, but exceedingly satisfying."

Henry Molaison was epileptic. He came to see renowned neurosurgeon William Scoville. Scoville removed his medial temporal lobes, transforming him into one of the great paradoxes of medical science: patient H.M. Patient H.M. was forever stuck in the present, unable to either remember much of his past and to form new memories. He was studied extensively over the next 50 years of his life, and the studies shaped our understanding of how memory works and how the different parts of the brain function and interact. At the same time, he was a jealously guarded secret of the research community, shrouded in confidentiality until his death. Scoville might also have lobotomized his wife. Aaand he was Dittrich's grandfather.I expected this to be a captivating and troubling book - and it was. I hoped that Dittrich would manage to walk the line between honesty and compassion, neither glorifying nor demonizing Scoville or any of the other surgeons and researchers involved in the story - and he did.What I didn't expect was the painful poetry of Dittrich's account. I didn't expect his razor-sharp yet kind account of the lives linked and inescapably changed in the search for healing and medical understanding. I expected this book to hit my brain (awful, awful pun not intended), but I didn't expect it to hit my heart.(PopSugar Reading Challenge 2020, ""A medical thriller"" - I'm stretching this one, but it's my party and I get to)"
49,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11614802-joshua,2,"On the cover, this book seems to be about the ""most famous patient in neuroscience history"". Unfortunately, the author takes so many tangents that for the first half of the book, H.M., the patient in question, barely makes an appearance. Once I realized that the author also wanted to tell the story of the author's grandfather--the surgeon who operated on H.M.--I shifted my expectations. However, had it merely been the twined biographies of the two men, that would have been narratively acceptable. What we get instead are long ramblings by the author about things that have very little to nothing to do with either man. The reader is treated to stories about the author's trip to the Great Pyramids at Giza and an in-depth look at the Nuremberg Trials of the late 1940s. Although contextualization is important, these stories (and, sadly, many others) are introduced jarringly; explanations come at the end, so if you are wondering what the Great Pyramids have to do with anything, you'll just have to plow through most of a chapter about them before the author makes an extremely tenuous correlation between that and something in the doctor's life.The author also excessively speculates on information that is not contained in any historical records. While discussing the pre-operative appointment between H.M. and the doctor, nearly every sentence has the word ""if"" because he is attempting to paint a picture, rather than stick to established fact. The author is a journalist (something he repeatedly reminds the reader of) and used to these kinds of embellishments. However, as a social scientist interested in the social and scientific histories contained in books like this, I found these tangents and embellishments to be extremely distracting and detracting from the overall purpose and message of the book.

One of his grandfather’s most famous patients was Patient H.M., a man whose childhood injuries lead to epilepsy and later to a lobotomy that affected his short term memory for the rest of his life. Interspersed with his grandfather’s life, his grandmother’s mental illness and the case of H.M. is a complex history of the field of neurosurgery and the lobotomy. I can see why this was all thrown together but it did make for a disjointed and somewhat repetitive book. The sections with detailed descriptions of the brain surgeries all started to sound the same (besides being fairly gruesome), however, I did enjoy the family history and felt that these were the stronger portions of the writing. Even though I do think that portions could have been culled, I did find the history of the lobotomy equally fascinating and horrifying. I received a digital ARC of this book through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."
51,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6732556-joe-silber,4,"Author Luke Dittrich examines the history of psychosurgery in general and the lobotomy in particular, through the history of two men: his grandfather William Beecher Scoville, who was a prominent brain surgeon, and ""Patient H.M."", his most famous patient. Patient H.M. lost his ability to form new memories following a lobotomy performed by Scoville and became one of the most famous experimental subjects in neuroscience. Dittrich is a skilled writer and kept the story fast-paced and fascinating, although his nonlinear chronology was sometimes a little frustrating. At times, I could have used a cast of characters listing to help keep straight the various people and locations who appear and disappear throughout the book as Dittrich jumps back and forth through time. Admirably, Dittrich strikes a delicate balance between objectivity and subjectivity as he opens up about his personal connection to the story and his mixed feelings about his larger than life grandfather."
52,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13417219-emily,5,"Part memoir, part biography, part science, I found this book fascinating, but I know it will only appeal to a narrow readership. There is a lot of technical information and history of neuroscience and psychology, especially of psychosurgery -- surgery on the brain that attempts to cure mental illness, epilepsy, and other disorders. As a psychology major way back when, by the time I became cognizant of what a lobotomy was, they had fallen out of favor, but I didn't realize until reading this book just how recently they had been performed extensively -- into the 1950s and 1960s even! The author's grandfather, a well-known neurosurgeon, performed the surgery on ""Patient H.M."", which although it proved devastating to his memory, advanced brain science and understanding of human memory. Intriguing stuff for those who are into such things. Well-written and engaging, especially since it is nonfiction."
53,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26826242-julia,3,"At the age of seven young Henry Molaison stepped into the street and collided with a bicyclist. Following the accident he began suffering from increasingly frequent and severe epileptic seizures, leading ultimately to an experimental brain surgery performed by neurosurgeon William Beecher Scoville. Unfortunately, the surgery was only partially successful with respect to his seizures and, tragically, the procedure left him unable to form any new memories for the remainder of his life. The author, journalist Luke Dittrich, just happens to be Scoville's grandson, and this is the story of the surprising number of ways his family intersects with that of the most famous patient in the history of neuroscience, as well as a primer on the history of the science itself.This was an enlightening read, though it was far from a page-turner. The overall number of intersectionalities among the family, the patient, the neighborhood, and even President Lincoln, was pretty astonishing. Recommended for readers with an interest in science and medicine."
54,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric,4,"I would add to the subtitle, ""A Story of Memory, Self, Madness, and..."" This is almost an amazing story and I withhold the fifth star only because I had the distinct impression that the author was less than fully committed to the distinction between science and the pseudoscience of the Nazi regime with its emphasis on subjecting human beings to unspeakable acts in the name of that pseudoscience. That said, ""Patient H.M."" takes us into the fascination realm of mind and brain. Keep in mind that most of what we have come to learn by necessity comes from what is discovered after the subject, the brain, has been removed from the body, and we all know what that means for the carrier of the subject.

55,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856588-robin-boggs,4,There are so many things I could write about that made this a fantastic read including the fact my grandmother struggled with a mental illness her entire life . This was a fascinating story of patient H.M. who was followed and studied for just over 5 decades . I was intrigued by how little doctors know about the human brain but at the same time how much progress had been made in the last 50 years. This particular study was on memory and where it is stored in the brain . Also surprising is how much experimentation on human subjects was performed especially the lobotomy back in the day . There were always crazy methods used to cure epilepsy before doctors discovered that epilepsy originated in the brain . I'm not going to tell you what they are though . Read the book yourself !!!
56,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930548-misty,3,"A fascinating, but meandering book. I am glad I listened, rather than read. If you liked the Henrietta Lacks story, you may like this book. It goes on tangents a bit more, which are interesting but make the prose less efficient. It touches on similar controversial themes regarding patient privacy and consent. I appreciate the more honest character sketches of the scientists and other professionals involved in and around the history of Patient HM. And this book delves into the less determined ethics of physiologically altering the organ we call the brain."

Perhaps the most striking thing about it is the revelation that some of the scientists associated with H.M. or studying him wanted to make their own narratives about him and his brain, regardless of what the data actually said. I was particularly worried by every description of Suzanne Corkin and her work with H.M. "
58,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5308937-sarah,4,"Whoa, I learned some crazy stuff in this book. From the horrific scientific experiments during the holocaust to the treatment of mentally ill people in the 1900's to the ice pick lobotomy, this book was eye opening. I skimmed here and there when it got repetitive or the author got off on tangents, but overall this was a great read."
59,0147523028,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4540420-carolyn-klassen,4,"While it took me forever to finish this and I thought it ended on a weak note (discussing university and legal politics of Henry's postmortem brain ownership) the book as a whole was fascinating, heartbreaking, eyeopening, and well researched. The unique connection of Luke Dittrich to Patient H.M. through his grandfather made it a personal as well as intellectual journey to discover the secrets behind the famous case."
