0,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219253-amanda,4,"Seemed a good time to float this bad mama-jama (spoiler alert: we're screwed):Looking for a good horror novel that will keep you up late at night? One that features the most remorseless, inventive, and successful serial killer to ever stumble into the written word? One whose body count grows exponentially as his appetite becomes more ravenous, never sated? One who is so adept at killing that he does so without even seeming to try? Well, I have just the ticket: The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert. This is as frightening as it gets, people, and the villain here is us: me, you, and everyone else inhabiting this little blue marble called Earth. Throughout history, there have been five mass extinction events: the Cretaceous-Paleogene, the Triassic-Jurassic, the Permian-Triassic, the Late Devonian, and the Ordovician-Silurian. All of these involve a cataclysmic shift in environmental conditions, some the result of an external impact. And now Kolbert reports that there may be a sixth extinction: the Anthropocene, caused by the impact of humanity on the environment. Many may believe that this is a byproduct of the Industrial Age, but Kolbert shows us how humans have always had a knack for wreaking wide scale environmental havoc. Always needing and wanting more from our natural resources, we, like kudzu, multiply rapidly, take over every inch of land available to us, and choke out the life that surrounds us.Kolbert makes the case for recognizing the Anthropocene as a mass extinction event by exploring its casualties and its future victims. As she relates the extinction of the American mastodon, the great auk, and the Neanderthal, as well as the near extinction of the Panamanian golden frog, Hawaiian crow, Sumatran rhino, and several types of bats, one truth becomes increasingly clear: most of these extinctions began to take place when humans entered the environment. Despite the disheartening nature of the topic, Kolbert writes with dry wit and gallows humor which (for me) always made an appearance at just the right time before things became too depressing. While there is a lot of science here, Kolbert keeps it accessible for those of us who don't while away our days reading scientific journals (you know, while our basic needs and consumer choices destroy everything around us), and her first person narrative keeps it from veering into textbook territory.There's a lot here that I enjoyed, but three highlights stand out:1) Kolbert's early chapters about men like Cuvier, Lyell, and Darwin, who were among the first to speculate on extinction and evolution. From our modern perspective, it's easy to forget that extinction, in particular, is a relatively new idea. There was a time when many scientists believed that nothing could become extinct over the natural progression of time; the discovery of fossils began to shift human understanding of the world and of creation. Reading as these men stumble in their understanding of the world, shifting and revising hypotheses, and ultimately discovering that there was a world that existed before mankind is fascinating.2) The chapters on the sea and corals (which may eventually become extinct, taking with them several organisms that live symbiotically with corals) is particularly interesting for someone like myself who is happily landlocked. For those who don't live near or have a relationship with our seas and oceans, it's easy to see it as a vast nothingness and forget about the world teeming below our waters. The rate of ocean acidification is frightening.3) The concept of a new Pangaea is an intriguing one. The ease with which we travel to other states, countries, and continents has, in a sense, reconstituted Pangaea in that we knowingly (and unknowingly) introduce new and often invasive plant and animal species into new environments. In doing so, these new host environments haven't developed nature's evolutionary safeguards to keep the balance between predator and prey, often with disastrous results.While Kolbert makes all of this lucid and entertaining, as well as terrifying, I must admit to some fatigue when I got to the final chapters. Reading about mass extinction can really take a toll on someone whose worldview can basically be summed up as ""people suck."" Reading such incontrovertible evidence, and knowing that I myself cannot escape the guilt of this accusation, is, in the words of Kolbert on The Daily Show, ""kind of a downer."" However, we need more downers. We need to be more educated about what we're doing to our environment. Early man deserves a pass: you come into a place and think, ""Damn. Look at all these mastodons. We can feast like kings!"" So you settle in, live a life filled with mastodon hunts and mastodon meat, have several children, dress them in mastodon onesies, kill more mastodons, always assuming there will be more. After all, you've found the great all-you-can-eat mastodon buffet! You have no concept of the impact your consumption is having on the environment. You haven't seen Disney's The Lion King and therefore don't know of the majestic power of the circle of life (nor of the comedic gold of pairing a warthog with a meerkat). Such days of ignorance should be behind us. We know better, so we should do better.Although, many of us are 4% Neanderthal because apparently early homo sapiens just couldn't resist the seductive power of a ridged brow. So maybe we're not so smart after all. Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder"

Archaeologists of the future in millions of years would wonder what has happened, how such devastation could be done in such a short time. They compare volcanic eruptions, climate change, meteorites, changes in the earth's magnetic field, solar storms, gamma ray bursts, etc. with the unique event or people find the ruins of a vanished high culture in the course of the colonization of space. And wonder what might have led to their downfall.In the retrospective, they are most astounded by how they could notice and know everything about such fatal developments and continue whistling cheerfully, saw on the branch they are sitting, poison themselves comprehensively by contaminating the environment, bite the hand that feeds them, and play Russian Roulette with an automatic weapon. To murder the mother, who has lovingly raised them, secretly and viciously for profit or neglect and let her languish in front of them until she dies as a result of negligence.The extrapolated development illustrates the explosiveness. In 100 or 250 years, humanity will have eradicated almost all species and only a few adaptable wild species and parasites will represent the remaining fauna and flora.Everyone else will vegetate in zoos if they are lucky or be stuffed out to be gazed at in extensive areas of natural history museums for extinct species. Since the addition out of the education and culture budget for millions of extinct species will be too expensive, one will probably give away the excess exhibits or throw the stuffed last specimens of the species in the trash, burn them, or give them to the stores of the companies who helped to exterminate for decoration purposes in shop windows or for kids to play with while the parents are shopping. It would be a consistent continuation of the treatment of nature by humans to spit on the grave too after the total annihilation.The homogenization and massive reduction of biodiversity is in two ways more subtle than direct extinction through habitat destruction. By breeding fewer, more productive species, non-lucrative farm animals and the economical completely worthless wild species are driven to the brink of extinction. The spread of invasive species destroys helpless, natural ecosystems and few very aggressive expanding species and the spread breed, genetically enhanced varieties remain. Globally, habitats are becoming more and more similar, the physical equivalent of the, in the cultural and sociological area, much-criticized Americanization.The lack of empathy is limited to animals and plants. Genocide is, for just about a century, the most outrageous and disturbing thing that people can be confronted with. Before that, humankind was acting consistently, and with equal rights for every group of victims, so far as that he/she eradicated her/his equals too. Now destruction in unprecedented dimensions is accepted as the inevitable collateral damage of human development and the stupid, endless, exponential economic growth of a self destructive system of madness. ""It's just ecocide, that's not so bad. They have no soul or something like that, so calm down, tree hugging hippie leftist.""The conviction that everything can be restored with technology is naive and shortsighted. Human-made machines and infrastructures can be built, maintained and modified, removing a mountain is already a more complicated task, but to bring back to life a sea that only consists of death zones or a desert that once was a forest, borders to an impossibility on the momentary state of the art.In the very long term, the damage to the natural infrastructure needed for biodiversity can be compensated with the corresponding financial, technological, and material resources using robots, gene- and nanotechnology to remove toxicity and build new habitats, etc. But this is like making a lovely house for a dead person with extreme expenses and an interior decorator in the morbid hope that would bring the person back to life. And extinct is even more definitive than dead, it´s not as if there was indirect immortality with grandkids or something, we are talking about truly forever gone. Furthermore, ecosystems have evolved over millions of years in circumstances that we do not understand and aren´t interested in investing money to learn more about. Even now there are more open than answered questions and factors and often an element was changed with good intention and had fatal effects instead. At the moment it´s impossible to rebuild a complex ecosystem from an empty, human-made pseudo natural space, just the microbiological part with the right soil conditions is far too tricky. A habitat is needed that not only preserves itself but also stands in a complex and balanced interplay with climate, weather, landforms, and adjacent, other ecosystems, and adapts to evolutionary and climate changes.Fresh, by humans, decontaminated and reforested habitats will be empty because one will not have genetic samples like the ones from mammoths and dinosaurs because nobody takes them, because the animals die out without it even being noticed and because it´s seen as too expensive to freeze probes from the last survivors in zoos before they die in many places, especially if it´s no cuddly panda, but a nasty snake, critter, or ugly fish, yuk. Surely one will be able to create chimeras, cheap wannabe replicas or classic fantasy creatures. Just the biodiversity, the breadth of variation, and the ingenuity of nature in millions of expressions, which has developed in billions of years, will be lost forever.Homo Sapiens will not be severely affected or interested in the results anyway. People will not die out, no matter how poisoned and hostile the planet will become because the same technology that allows the destruction of nature will save the destroyers and bring them longer and healthier lives. It will merely make more economic sense to turn the planet back into a habitable and not immediately deadly state when leaving the secure zones or underground bunkers.It will be a pretty empty planet. The limited creative power of humankind will conjure bad copies of the former biodiversity, but nothing will come close to the original range of variation and diversity of natural evolution some of us are still privileged to see when going outside.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrop...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocen...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecocidehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodive...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct..."

One moment during the book she writes about how she tried to visit a certain location and asked the lady working at the gift shop to give her a tour. The employee obviously told her she was busy and I couldn't help but resent the author for being salty about it as she wrote that ""as far as she could tell they were the only ones there"".

3,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,4," Better Dead Than Read In the Book of Genesis, God creates mankind last, as if anticipating the theory of Darwinian evolution. But the text is somewhat ambivalent about his accomplishment. Whereas all his other creations - time, space, light, plants, sentient creatures - are explicitly deemed ‘good,’ human beings are merely lumped in with everything else as God surveys the world. The biblical author seems to be hedging the blessing (mitzvah: both a command and a favour) of human ‘rule’ over everything. If so, his caution has turned out to be justified. Putting the inmates in charge of the asylum has turned out to be a profound design flaw.But perhaps not for much longer. The species Homo sapiens seems to have run its course. It has overwhelmed the creative matrix which produced it. And it has done so in an evolutionary blink of an eye. Its facility for communication through complex language, as Emil Cioran has said, has filled creation with a glut of consciousness, an intellectual burden which it cannot sustain. The threat is not mankind’s greed, or hostility, or sexual urges but thought itself. Thought, which is language in action, produces cooperative effort, which produces technology, which removes all impediments to the spread of the species.Except, of course, one impediment: the success of the species itself. It is a species which consumes everything it encounters. This it calls ‘finding a use for,’ or sometimes ‘making life better.’ This is an expected consequence of language-use. As Yuval Harari observes, it is gossip which propelled the species into poll position in the evolutionary race. Members of the species gin each other up to want more of everything: more children, more food, more air, water, minerals... well just more of everything. Isn’t this what ruling is all about? Making things better? Enhancing existence? Realising one’s full potential, as well as that of the species? Isn’t that the practical definition of salvation? Striving for perfection?One of Stanislaw Lem’s stories turns the tables on the evolutionary story we tell ourselves about being the most developed species, the top of the food chain, the acme of known existence. For Lem all this striving, this wanting to be better, bigger, stronger, more secure, to be something other than what we already are, is an obvious evolutionary defect, a dead end genetic branch that will wither as creation moves on. And what it will move on to is the inertia of what the species now sees dismissively as ‘dead matter.’ This is, of course, obviously the case. Look in any grave yard for confirmation; or in the fossil record; or for that matter into the maw of the nearest astronomical black hole. Entropy, that is to say, that silent, peaceful equality is the heaven that awaits us, the omega point of Teilhard de Chardin.Meanwhile we are effectively trapped in this bubble of language. We can’t resist it, or dispose of it, or in any way mitigate its profoundly destructive consequences - for us as well as for the other species with which we live. We are doomed to destroy them, as in a Ted Chiang story, simply by perceiving them. Even by naming them, we endanger their existence because it means we have become aware of them as a potential resource. We are prisoners of ourselves. Stories about future threats to human existence through developments in Artificial Intelligence are actually distractions from current reality. Language already controls us.In this light, it helps to look at the record. The Ordovician extinction occurred over a period of a million years as global temperatures dropped, and was caused by silicate rocks sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. 86% of all species perished. The Devonian extinction, triggered by the development of plant life on land releasing nutrients into the oceans, thus wiping out 75% of marine animals. The Permian extinction was the big one, the proximate cause being methane-producing bacteria. 96% of life on each disappeared. The Triassic extinction has no agreed upon cause; but it wiped out 80% of contemporary species. The Cretaceous extinction, the one with the asteroid impact in the Gulf of Mexico as its final coup, was relatively mild; only three quarters of known species were eliminated. It too seems like the revenge of dead matter.Isn’t it interesting that each of these events was precipitated by material, both living and dead, rather far down the purported evolutionary ladder than the most ‘advanced’ organisms then in existence. Evolutionary development carries with it inherent vulnerability to changes in the environment. The less developed, that is the closer to dead matter, the more likely the chances of survival. And dead matter probably only goes extinct in some sort of cosmic singularity like a black hole. Language simultaneously makes us aware and insulates us from this reality. Inside the bubble of language we can rationalise our inevitable fate - science will save us; God has another world waiting for us; the mathematical probabilities for another similar event is low, etc. We know deep down that language is deceiving us but we act like it’s just part of reality.The implications are obvious. Neither God nor human beings created language, thus contradicting our fundamental language-based conceit. Language evolved from us but is independent of us. And we are addicted to it. We resent the power of language, even as we pretend to use it to further our own. We are at its mercy and we intend, unconsciously but deliberately, to stop its hegemony. Like every other extinction event, this one too is being executed by an ‘inferior’ species upon one which has emanated from it. We are determined to wipe out language, or at least to scramble it so profoundly that its meanings are irrecoverable. The elimination of so many other species along the way is merely collateral damage, unfortunate but necessary. This perhaps is the true significance of the story in Genesis chapter 11 of the Tower of Babel. And it certainly explains Donald Trump’s appeal to the mass of Deplorables.Kolbert has the trajectory correct but the mechanism wrong. Nothing about the Sixth Extinction is accidental or unwanted. It was inevitable from the moment an idea and a sound or gesture popped into some primitive head and were linked. That was the start of the rot. And there are plenty of folk out there who are willing to go to the wall in order to stop it. Better Dead Than Read is their motto. Heed them; they are serious and dedicated. And they are winning."

Dial M for Murder
This is a dark and deeply depressing book, trying hard to be hopeful — on the lines of Douglas Adams' Last Chance to See.Kolbert's book reminds us that we could be the last couple of generations to witness true diversity, maybe the last to see such magnificent and delicate creatures as the amphibians.The story of the Sixth Extinction, at least as Kolbert has chosen to tell it, comes in thirteen chapters. Each tracks a species that’s in some way emblematic — the American mastodon, the great auk, an ammonite that disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous alongside the dinosaurs.The creatures in the early chapters are already gone, and this part of the book is mostly concerned with the great extinctions of the past and the twisting history of their discovery, starting with the work of the French naturalist Georges Cuvier.The second part of the book takes place very much in the present—in the increasingly fragmented Amazon rainforest, on a fast-warming slope in the Andes, on the outer reaches of the Great Barrier Reef.Martyrs to Awareness?Kolbert’s book also spends much ink tracking the history of humanity’s (well, western at least) awareness of extinction and then the science of studying it. It starts from the biblical conception of all creatures as eternal and changeless to the gradual awareness that some animals might be rare or extinct and eventually to the awareness of Natural selection and the importance of change for life on Earth.Thomas Kuhn, the twentieth century’s most influential historian of science, has much to say about such paradigmatic revelations: about how people process disruptive information — Their first impulse is to force it into a familiar framework: hearts, spades, clubs. Signs of mismatch are disregarded for as long as possible—the red spade looks “brown” or “rusty.” At the point the anomaly becomes simply too glaring, a crisis ensues—what the psychologists dubbed the “’My God!’ reaction.”This pattern was, Kuhn argued in his seminal work, 
The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
, so basic that it shaped not only individual perceptions but entire fields of inquiry. Data that did not fit the commonly accepted assumptions of a discipline would either be discounted or explained away for as long as possible. The more contradictions accumulated, the more convoluted the rationalizations became. “In science, as in the playing card experiment, novelty emerges only with difficulty,” Kuhn wrote.But then, finally, someone came along who was willing to call a red spade a red spade. Crisis led to insight, and the old framework gave way to a new one. This is how great scientific discoveries or, to use the term Kuhn made so popular, “paradigm shifts” took place.The history of the science of extinction can be told as a series of paradigm shifts. Until the end of the eighteenth century, the very category of extinction didn’t exist. The more strange bones were unearthed—mammoths, Megatherium, mosasaurs—the harder naturalists had to squint to fit them into a familiar framework. And squint they did. The giant bones belonged to elephants that had been washed north, or hippos that had wandered west, or whales with malevolent grins. When Cuvier arrived in Paris, he saw that the mastodon’s molars could not be fit into the established framework, a “My God” moment that led to him to propose a whole new way of seeing them. Life, Cuvier recognized, had a history. This history was marked by loss and punctuated by events too terrible for human imagining. “Though the world does not change with a change of paradigm, the scientist afterward works in a different world” is how Kuhn put it.Are the early participants of Humanity’s ‘Mega Kill’, the ‘Sixth Extinction’, if you will, martyrs to humanity’s self-awareness as immoral killers -- required to make us finally think through to the consequences of our actions?Anthropocene & MoralityHumanity might finally be capable of perceiving the change that has been wrought, and moving into the most crucial understanding of all — that our survival depends on preserving Earth as close to how we inherited it as possible!The emblematic extinctions are valuable because they serve as blazing sign posts. The eco-system might be too slow in its actions to warn us in time, but our aesthetic sensibility might be capable of warning us in advance when we are too far off the tracks. That might in turn finally engage our moral responsibility for creating an Anthropocene in which most of our co-inheritors of the planet cannot survive. ‘Love thy neighbor’? Can we? Or will we continue to shy away from any moral colorings to the argument? Even as we commit to and associate ourselves with blatant Ecocide?Our biggest threat is ecological, human-induced change and, to be more specific, rate of change:When the world changes faster than species can adapt, many fall out. This is the case whether the agent drops from the sky in a fiery streak or drives to work in a Honda."
5,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is a very engaging examination of extinctions of animal species through the ages. Elizabeth Kolbert adds a wonderfully personal touch to many of the chapters, as she describes her visits to the habitats where various species are dying out. She accompanies scientists and ecologists as they delve into extinctions, past and present. Some biologists are gathering up endangered species, putting them into special reserves and zoo-like habitats where they might be able to survive.There is no single cause for the various massive extinctions. Some were due to sudden changes in climate, some due to catastrophes like meteors, some due to disease, and some are due to humans. For example, the mastodon's extinction coincides with the spread of humans. The original penguin--the auk--became extinct due to a combination of factors, including volcanoes and human hunters in the nineteenth century. Coral reefs are dying off because of increasing acidification; much of the excessive carbon dioxide produced by humans is absorbed by the ocean, where the ph level is become less base.Homo sapiens lived at the same time as other hominid species, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. Visually, Neanderthals were not so different from us. If you gave one a shave and a suit, a Neanderthal might look like this: So, the question comes up why did these other nearly-human species go extinct, while humans survived? The question is especially appropriate, as there is DNA evidence that humans interbred with some of these other species. The answer is very possibly that humans killed them off.What makes this book so special, is Kolbert's writing style. She makes me feel like I'm ""right there"" with the biologists and ecologists. She personally visits the habitats, and goes into some depth talking with the specialists. Each chapter becomes an adventure. Sometimes the subject matter becomes depressing, as it is about the dying (or killing) off of species. But the writing is so engaging, that I highly recommend this book!"

The Sixth Extinction is told in a part textbook, part narrative style; the author gives readers hard facts mixed into detailed personal accounts of her research trips. In 13 chapters, she tells the stories of several species, some long extinct, some still teetering on the brink of extinction, all with one common enemy - us. The best part of the book is that Kolbert isn't trying to blame the human race or make her readers feel guilty. She only explains the effect we have on our earth and where this could lead (possibly to world domination by giant tool-making rats.) The message is simply, ""Here is the information; you decide what to do with it.""Would recommend highly. "

8,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"In this well-researched book, science writer Elizabeth Kolbert casts a strong light on the damage humans are doing to planet Earth. In one example Kolbert describes declining populations of the golden frog, which is rapidly disappearing from all its native habitats. Turns out humans have inadvertently spread a type of fungus that infects the skin of amphibians and kills them.Golden FrogIn another example, almost six million North American bats have (so far) died from a skin infection caused by a different fungus, also accidentally spread by people.North American BatsPerhaps less ecologically-minded people might think ""who cares about frogs and bats?"" But all species on Earth are part of an interactive ecosystem, and the disappearance of any one organism might set off a domino effect that has unseen consequences down the line.EcosystemMoreover, these sad occurrences are just the teeny tip of a humongous iceberg when it comes to changes wrought by human activity.Species extinction is not a recent phenomenon on Earth. In fact there have been five documented instances of mass extinctions (the disappearance of a large number of species in a short time) in the course of the planet's history. These are:• The Ordovician-Silurian extinction, about 440 million years ago, thought to be caused by cycles of glaciation and melting.Life at the Ordovician-Silurian Extinction• The Late Devonian extinction, about 360-375 million years ago. The cause is unknown but some experts suggest periods of global cooling and glaciation.Life at the Late Devonian Extinction• The Permian-Triassic extinction, about 250 million years ago, which may have resulted from an asteroid impact or massive volcanic eruptions (or both). This was the largest extinction event in Earth's history, wiping out 95 percent of species living at the time.Life at the Permian-Triassic Extinction• The Triassic-Jurassic extinction, about 200-215 million years ago, apparently caused by colossal lava floods - and perhaps global warming - related to the breakup of Pangaea (a supercontinent made of all Earth's landmasses).Life at the Triassic-Jurassic Extinction• The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction, about 66 million years ago, thought to be due to an asteroid impact. Evidence for this is the Chicxulub crater in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. This extinction is well known in popular culture because it wiped out the dinosaurs.Life at the Cretaceous-Paleogene ExtinctionEach extinction event left vacant ecological niches and - over time - these were filled by the expansion of remaining species and the evolution of new organisms. Taking into account all the cycles of extinction and speciation in the planet's history, scientists speculate that 99.9 percent of species that lived on Earth are gone. Unfortunately, humans - by causing profound changes in Earth's ecosystems - may now be causing the sixth mass extinction. Examples of what humans are doing to Earth include:• Burning fossil fuels, which adds CO2 to the atmosphere. This has a dual effect. It causes global warming, which affects the distribution (and survival) of plants and animals; and it acidifies the oceans, causing calcite to dissolve. Thus, coral reefs are being destroyed and molluscs are getting holes in their shells. • Destroying habitats to accommodate expanding human populations. This includes cutting down forests, constructing roads and buildings, and cultivating monoculture farms - all of which demolishes the homes of native organisms.• Transferring organisms to new habitats. When people started moving from place to place they - purposely or not - took other organisms with them. For instance, brown rats - which seem to be indestructible - rode ships to almost every corner of the world, ravaging native species; rabbits brought to Australia as food animals became one of the biggest pests on the continent; brown snakes, introduced to Guam, wiped out nearly all the native birds; and kudzu vines - introduced to the U.S. from Asia - cover and smother all vegetation in their path.Kudzu smothers native vegetationIt's estimated that people are moving 10,000 species around the world every day, mostly in supertanker ship ballast. The consequences of this are potentially disastrous for indigenous plants and animals everywhere.• Overharvesting and hunting animals to extinction. In the North Sea, Grand Banks of Newfoundland, and East China Sea, overfishing has severely depleted fish stocks.In addition, many animals have been completely wiped out by humans, including the dodo, Tasmanian tiger, passenger pigeon, Steller's sea cow, and great auk (a flightless bird). In a sad anecdote Kolbert describes how - on July 3, 1844 - a hunter named Sigurður Ísleifsson strangled the world's last two great auks on Eldey Island, near Iceland. Great AuksIn ""The Sixth Extinction"" Kolbert sounds the alarm about humans wreaking changes on Earth in the current era - dubbed the ""Anthropocene.""With luck, Kolbert's book might help persuade concerned people to stop damaging the environment, curtail global warming, and save threatened species. Some measures are already in place: the U.S. has an ""Endangered Species Act"" designed to protect imperiled organisms; international agreements have been made to alleviate global warming; and ""frozen zoos"" store DNA from thousands of plants and animals, in hopes of resurrecting them if they disappear. Still, it may be too little too late.As far as the Earth is concerned, a ""sixth extinction"" could be just another cataclysmic event from which the planet will gradually recover. For humans though...well...we might just wipe ourselves out in such a catastrophe. If so, something will inevitably take our place. Elizabeth Kolbert (half jokingly) suggests it might be giant intelligent rats (ha ha ha). Some people think humans can counteract the harm we've done to the Earth. One ""solution"" for global warming, for example, involves spraying salt water into low-lying clouds, to enhance their ability to reflect sunlight. Even if this worked, though, it would solve only one problem of many. In the extreme case of irreparable harm to Earth, some optimists(?) believe the human race will survive by colonizing other planets. Only time will tell. Kolbert's book is well-written, engaging, and personal - with anecdotes based on her own observations as well as interviews with scientists she accompanied on their research trips. I'd recommend this enlightening and interesting book to everyone interested in the Earth's future.FYI: If you like the 'move to other planets' scenario you might enjoy the novel Seveneves by Neal Stephenson...which has a related theme.You can read my book reviews at: http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/"

Every shining pine needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every meadow, every humming insect. All are holy in the memory and experience of my people.~~Chief SeattleWhen I was a child my favorite books were the Golden Nature Guides about insects, birds, sea shells, and so on. I learned many insect names, as well as those of the butterflies and other animals. I also remember seeing so many different varieties of wildlife back then. Little did I know then that in later years I would look for the birds, butterflies and insects of my youth and not see many of them. I jump for joy when I see a praying mantis, an inch worm, or a walking stick. We are losing our bees, and I seldom see those either. If we lose them all we lose our fruits and other plants that need pollinated. China has to hand pollinate now. The only butterfly I see here are black swallowtails. What happened to the buckeye, the yellow swallowtail, and all the others?This year I learned that black swallowtails love fennel, so I was given some fennel to plant in hope that it would draw more of them to my garden. One day I saw two caterpillars on it, and they had eaten all the fennel, As I was watching them, they crawled off to look for more food. Not finding any, they crawled back onto the fennel. I called a friend who asked me to bring the caterpillars over to her house. She put them in a jar with fennel where she could keep them safe from the birds. They made cocoons, hatched and flew off. Why do we even have to do this? What happened? Little did I know back in my youth that we would be losing wild life. There is so much we didn’t know back then, but then I remember my 8th grade teacher, Mr. Bailey, telling us about the book ""Silent Spring"" by Rachel Carson, about a time when we would not be hearing song birds and other sounds of nature. No one listened then; they still don't listen. When it is silent they will listen and not hear a thing.Like ""Silent Spring"" this book was written as another warning, and it won the Pulitzer Prize. It is easy to understand and at times it is enjoyable, that is, if you like reading about nature.Did you know that there is a flower that ants live inside of, and that the flower allows them to live there because the ants kill other insects that may try to harm it? Did you know that there are such things as antbutterflies that swarm around army ants, and that they live off the droppings of the antbirds that also swarm around the flower? I love reading that kind of information, but then again, we are that sixth extinction that she writes about. It is sad to see what we are doing to this planet and to learn that many species are dying daily. My brother once said, ""We don't deserve this planet."" How true. The author said some things that made me feel a little better but not by much. She mentioned that during the last extinctions new life forms evolved. New life forms sound encouraging, but who wants to lose what we have now?I often think of how much we have Junked out this earth. I wonder if it will die, or if something will happen that will save it. When I read this next paragraph I thought of how nice it would be to have all of our Junk reduced to the size of a cigarette paper. The author mentioned a scientist, Professor Jan Zalasiewicz, who ""is convinced that even a moderately competent stratigrapher will, at the distance of a hundred million years or so, be able to tell that something extraordinary happened at the moment in time that counts for us as today. This is the case even though a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man—the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories—will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper.”Other quotes: “Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.”“Under business as usual, by mid-century things are looking rather grim,” he told me a few hours after I had arrived at One Tree. We were sitting at a beat-up picnic table, looking out over the heartbreaking blue of the Coral Sea. The island’s large and boisterous population of terns was screaming in the background. Atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira paused: “I mean, they’re looking grim already.”“Having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth’s biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems—cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans—we’re putting our own survival in danger.”“Ninety percent of all species on earth had been eliminated.”“According to the UN Environment Programme, the Earth is in the midst of a mass extinction of life. Scientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird and mammal become extinct every 24 hours. This is nearly 1,000 times the ""natural"" or ""background"" rate and, say many biologists, is greater than anything the world has experienced since the vanishing of the dinosaurs nearly 65m years ago. Around 15% of mammal species and 11% of bird species are classified as threatened with extinction.” ~~John Vidal, environment editor "
10,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"I've read a lot of non-fiction books that are dry and sometimes gets bogged down in details and others that are very engaging but rather light on the meat. And then sometimes, you get a very cogent work with a very rich sampling of science from all different quarters laid out in such a way that it is impossible to believe anything BUT the final summation.This is one of those works. We are in the middle of the sixth extinction event on Earth. The final result of the dieoff, as of just how many millions of species will succumb to the tipped balance of the biosphere, is yet to be known. But let's put it this way: if you were just informed that there were no jobs in your town and that everyone else was just told that 1/3 of the jobs would remain for the next six months, and then after that, they would leave as well, you'd decide to move away. Right? So, you try to, only you find out that someone has just destroyed all the roads in or out of your town and there's no supply line for foods or services. Imagine the chaos. How would you survive? How would anyone? Now assume you slow that process down just enough that no one or very few people living there have a clue as to the reality of this situation. Belts tighten, poverty increases, some may try to move away but get crushed under the wheels of a much larger machine.Now extrapolate that situation to every other town in the world.And then overlay the problem to every other species in the world. Dice up ecospheres, destroy the homes and habitats there, and only the fleet of foot can survive... but where do they go? They're an invasive species now. They take on and live or die in someone else's backward. If it's a human's backyard, it'll get killed. Rinse, repeat. Add disease, and predatory species filling in stressed niches, and you've got a pandemic. Across all species. Now, remember, a few hundred years or even a few thousand is just a flash in the pan for extinctions. Not all come from meteorites or volcanoes. We probably didn't kill off the Neanderthals by hunting. Economics works just as well. And even if a tribe hunts down a wooly mammoth every ten years, the gestation is slow enough that it would still bring a downward pressure on the species until it's gone in several thousand years. Period. And this isn't even accounting for the widespread death in rainforests now.Add global warming, acidification of the ocean, the deaths of the coral reefs, the disappearance of the frogs, the bees, and from there, the tipping point that will eradicate larger species as they begin to wipe out other species because their food is disappearing, too, and we've got a major dieback.In hundreds of years, or even 50, our world might become a bonefield. An optimistic outlook is 25%-50% of everything dead.THANOS, ANYONE?Truly a sobering book. One of the very best I've read on extinction events. Only, this one might be ours."
11,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma,5,"“Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did”—Elizabeth Kohlbert https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...I finally slow listened to this award-winning and depressing book written by a journalist who helps translate for scientists the truth of our current Anthropocene era:The Anthropocene is a proposed epoch dating from the commencement of significant human impact on Earth's ecosystems including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change. It roughly dates back 12-15 K years when humans began to really impact the environment. Some folks refer to 1945 as beginning The Great Acceleration during which the socioeconomic and earth system trends are increasing dramatically, especially after WWII. What trends? The opposite of slow and small.I know the basic facts of this book, that we are very much well under way in the sixth mass extinction in half a billion years. If this has always sounded a little distant and possibly comforting to us (oh, well, it’s happened before! It can happen again!), we miss the point:""In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches""—Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich""Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it. To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly.""In other words, it’s not just a lonely polar bear on a chunk of ice, very far away; it is about us and not decades later, but now or never. Which is to say, we lose species every day, not every year, and when most of the planet species are gone by mid-century, as we now expect, we have to take very seriously the possibility of humankind’s extinction. And Rachel Carson, in Silent Spring (1962), told us but we didn’t really listen.“We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost’s familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road—the one ‘less traveled by’—offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of our earth.” —Carson“To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more and were willing to make more sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn’t much matter whether people care or don’t care. What matters is that people change the world. This capacity predates modernity”—Kohlbert"
12,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This book both awed and depressed me. From page one, Kolbert writes an impressive survey of how destructive mankind has been to the planet. She gives a brief history of the five mass extinctions that have happened, and travels around the world to report on species that are currently going extinct. But the big problem now isn't a giant asteroid -- it's humans. We are such a lethal force that we can unwittingly (or just greedily) wipe out entire species at alarming rates.There are a lot of good stories in this book, including the efforts of researchers who are desperately trying to save various species. I don't regularly read science books, but I'm glad I picked up this one. It's a good reminder of how important our environment is to our survival -- we need to do better of taking care of our planet. A lot better, if we want to survive another mass extinction.Highly recommended for readers wanting a good overview of the subject. Opening Passage(This intro is so great I had trouble deciding where to end it.) Beginnings, it's said, are apt to be shadowy. So it is with this story, which starts with the emergence of a new species maybe two hundred thousand years ago. The species does not yet have a name -- nothing does -- but it has the capacity to name things.As with any young species, this one's position is precarious. Its numbers are small, and its range restricted to a slice of eastern Africa. Slowly its population grows, but quite possibly then it contracts again -- some would claim nearly fatally -- to just a few thousand pairs.The members of the species are not particularly swift or strong or fertile. They are, however, singularly resourceful. Gradually they push into regions with different climates, different predators, and different prey. None of the usual constraints of habitat or geography seem to check them. They cross rivers, plateaus, mountain ranges. In coastal regions, they gather shellfish; farther inland, they hunt mammals. Everywhere they settle, they adapt and innovate. On reaching Europe, they encounter creatures very much like themselves, but stockier and probably brawnier, who have been living on the continent far longer. They interbreed with these creatures and then, by one means or another, kill them off.The end of this affair will turn out to be exemplary. As the species expands its range, it crosses paths with animals twice, ten, and even twenty times its size: huge cats, towering bears, turtles as big as elephants, sloths that stand fifteen feet tall. These species are more powerful and often fiercer. But they are slow to breed and are wiped out.Although a land animal, our species -- ever inventive -- crosses the sea. It reaches islands inhabited by evolution's outliers: birds that lay foot-long eggs, pig-sized hippos, giant skinks. Accustomed to isolation, these creatures are ill-equipped to deal with the newcomers or their fellow travelers (mostly rats). Many of them, too, succumb.The process continues, in fits and starts, for thousands of years, until the species, no longer so new, has spread to practically every corner of the globe. At this point, several things happen more or less at once that allow Homo sapiens, as it has come to call itself, to reproduce at an unprecedented rate. In a single century the population doubles; then it doubles again, and then again. Vast forests are razed. Humans do this deliberately, in order to feed themselves. Less deliberately, they shift organisms from one continent to another, reassembling the biosphere.Meanwhile, an even stranger and more radical transformation is under way. Having discovered subterranean reserves of energy, humans begin to change the composition of the atmosphere. This, in turn, alters the climate and the chemistry of the oceans. Some plants and animals adjust by moving. They climb mountains and migrate toward the poles. But a great many - at first hundreds, then thousands, and finally perhaps millions -- find themselves marooned. Extinction rates soar, and the texture of life changes.No creature has ever altered life on the planet in this way before, and yet other, comparable events have occurred. Very, very occasionally in the distant past, the planet has undergone change so wrenching that the diversity of life has plummeted. Five of these ancient events were catastrophic enough that they're put in their own category: the so-called Big Five. In what seems like a fantastic coincidence, but is probably no coincidence at all, the history of these events is recovered just as people come to realize that they are causing another one. When it is still too early to say whether it will reach the proportions of the Big Five, it becomes known as the Sixth Extinction.(Rereading this intro gave me chills again. Kolbert is such a good writer. She's able to take complex scientific ideas and explain them to a layperson like me. That is an admirable skill.)"
13,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,4,"A well balanced tour of apparent causes for five past massive extinctions and for the current epoch of the human-caused “Sixth Extinction”. The relatively sudden acceleration of extinctions has a lot of consensus among scientists as defining a new age, the “Anthropocene”.The author is a journalist who demonstrates a sound knowledge about how science works and its slow and contentious process of reaching consensus conclusions. She travels around the world to visit scientists and sites that are significant in the history of discovery about extinctions, giving focus to specific species that illustrate themes and current issues. For some, putting herself into the picture represents a distraction, but I found the approach an engaging way to put the reader into the picture and humanizing the ecological scientists on the job.I think all of us are a bit punch drunk over revelations in pieces. One decade we hear of coral dying, and as I recall I could drive on in life thinking that in remote ocean atolls, far from pollution, they will thrive. Another decade you will have heard about disappearing frogs. Sad, but not really bowled over, thinking maybe acid rain, which is getting better; then it was some kind of fungus—then, okay, nothing to feel guilty about and maybe they will come back. In more recent years, the decimation of bats is one more blow, any human cause of the mystery obscure. Years later another weird fungus is identified as a cause. And over the long haul we have grown up with the background threats to survival among top predators like tigers, exotics like rhinos, and all the great apes, a progression obviously tied to human development and deforestation, and illegal hunting. All that leaves me praying sufficient reserves and parks (and zoos) can put their end on pause. All this bad news sits heavy in a jumble. Why Kolbert is a boon with this is by accommodating lots of individual cases in the frame of a big picture. And then she gives emerging themes some life through stories from the work of current and historical scientists. The first inferences of extinctions by Cuvier, the geological gradualism of Lyell linked by Darwin to the slow succession of species outcompeting others. Geological epochs on the order of 100 million years get tied to massive changes in the fossil record, which eventually are recognized as mass extinction events and not an ordinary process of natural selection. Major environmental changes of varying types are being applied to the five major mass extinctions. For the last big transition, there was nothing gradual about it. The history of the father and son team, Luis and Walter Alvarez, pursuing against great resistance the asteroid theory for the disappearance the dinosaurs is nicely told by Kolbert.  An older idea for demise of the dinosaurs And now if you begin add up all the extinctions in our current epoch, it begins to approximate the scale of some of these ancient patterns. The background rate of vertebrate extinctions has been estimated as on the order of one per several hundred years, but these days we’re talking about thousands of times faster.Here is a short summary of the major conclusionsThere have been very long uneventful stretches and very occasionally revolution on the surface of the earth. To the extent we can identify the causes of these revolutions, they’re highly varies: glaciation in the case of the end-Ordovician extinction, global warming and changes in ocean chemistry at the end of the Permian, an asteroid impact in the final seconds of the Cretaceous. The current extinction has its own novel cause: not an asteroid or a massive volcanic eruption, but “one weedy species.” She catches me in a relatively ignorant state about the impact of global warming on the acceleration of species extinctions. Like many of us, the threat of global warming on a limited number of arctic mammals dominated my conception of impact (the image of the polar bear on the melting ice is iconic). I missed out on climate change impact in the tropical latitudes. For example, the loss of corals, and all the species that depend on their reefs, is global due to ocean acidification tied directly to the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere (a small rise in pH is enough to hinders the metabolic precipitation of calcium into calcium carbonate). It’s happening too fast for the coral to adapt and evolve in step with the changes. I also never conceived that modest temperature changes could change the balance of competition in the local environment of tropical ecologies and cause extinctions. Tropical areas are hit harder in terms of species loss, partly because that is where the lion’s share (so to speak) of species reside. While there are only 5,550 mammals, there are zillions of invertebrates and plants, and they are incredibly specialized in the tropics (and the vast majority remain unidentified). My picture of warm climate species just advancing en masse to higher latitudes as the earth warms does not conform to reality. A long-term research site in the Peruvian Amazon shows how many species just don’t make the translocation (especially trees and species that depend on them). And studies at isolated plots of wilderness in Brazil reveal the adverse effects of fragmentation of ecologies, Part of the big picture that this book helps me with arises from moving the camera back on the time scale for the Anthropocene epoch. If you just consider the industrial age and global warming, you are led to think in terms of the last century or two. But from the time of Darwin, there were already reasoned arguments that man was likely responsible for the global loss of the so-called megafauna, i.e. critters like mastodons, mammoths, cave bears, giant elk, saber-tooth tigers, ground sloths (and a whole weird set in Australia). Thus, it is fair to put the boundary of the new age as far back as the middle of the last ice age. On the same scale, it seems likely that Homo sapiens did away with the Neanderthals (though some hybridizing through interbreeding modifies that picture a bit). A brilliant Swede working in Germany was able from DNA analysis of bones to identify two other humanoids that lost out in the final race to the future (hobbit sized Homo florsiensis and the Denisovans).Another man-caused impact on species loss is tied to the “Columbian Exchange”, which since 1492 involves worldwide transportation of species. The invasive species cause extinctions when in the new environment they no longer have their usual predators. Kolbert explains how this “New Pangaea” results in loss of biodiversity. Creatures like rats turn out to be the big winners. It’s nice that the New World got earthworms for the first time from Europe, but who knows what they displaced. When a fungus out of the blue takes out frogs worldwide and bats in a fast spreading wave, invasive species linked to human activity rises to the fore in theories of likely cause.Somehow I will have to digest her grim summary points:It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all fresh water mollusks, a third of all sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion...What matters is that people change the world.This capacity predates modernity, though, of course, modernity is its fulfilled expression. Indeed, this capacity is probably indistinguishable from the qualities that make us human to begin with: our restlessness, our creativity, our ability to cooperate to solve problems and complete complicated tasks.If you want to grieve over lost species, I recommend Cokinos’ Hope Is the Thing with Feathers: A Personal Chronicle of Vanished Birds. If you want to travel with a writer to visit and glory in what of endangered species can still be experienced in natural environments, I hope you try Safina’s The View from Lazy Point: A Natural Year in an Unnatural World. If you are ready to face up to the pickle we are in, try learning more of the inconvenient truths through this book.  "

15,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"One of the most important science books written in the past five years. Kolbert synthesizes science and history effortlessly here. I kind of view this as Guns Germs and Steel v2, with the focus on the mess we humans have caused and the lengths scientists are going to in order to both understand and hopefully minimize the damage. Excellent individual chapters on the different species of flora and fauna that we have lost recently or are in the process of losing due to the anthropocene era, that is the era dominated by us, humankind. All of the chapters resonated with me, but there is a poignant chapter called Islands on Dry Land. The study centered on small acreage, less than a square mile in some cases, at isolated research stations in the Amazon rainforest that are now surrounded by clearcuts and farming. The news after twenty years of study isn’t good. These oases lost the diversity of flora, birds, mammals and insects at precipitous rates although it took a few years for the effects to multiply. In the early years the fauna flocked to these unspoiled areas as sanctuaries but there was not enough contiguous wilderness to support much of any diversity long term. I bring this up because I grew up on a farm in Michigan with wetlands and forests nearby but all of these small acreage plots, similar to most of the lower peninsula, are disconnected patches. You are hard pressed to find any wilderness more than a mile from a road there. I could observe even at a young age that despite the adaptability of white tailed deer, foxes, raccoons, skunks, and opossums to this patchwork environment they do not make it healthy and diverse. Admittedly the birds do better especially with Michigan’s wetland laws. The introduction of more alpha predators like wolves would help the diversity but with so much livestock around this is a hard sell. This lack of fauna and to a large degree flora diversity has been a problem for more than one hundred and fifty years so not sure the genie can be put back in the bottle but re-wilding the land in contiguous areas would go a long ways.5 stars. Enjoyed immensely."
16,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,5,"Kolbert’s premise, that we are likely in the midst of the Sixth Period of a great extinction in the world’s history, is “a most awful yet interesting” idea, to quote Darwin out of context. Kolbert shares recent (in the past forty years) scientific discoveries, theories, and test results which many of us may not have had a chance to follow with the diligence of a scientist. She is not a scientist but a journalist who has interviewed scientists, and her wonderful easy style makes it simple for us to understand.What Kolbert has done here is to overlay a timeline transparency of extinctions over the history of the earth’s geologic record and mankind’s progress with which we are more commonly familiar. Kolbert is merely reporting in this book, not advocating, though the reader comes away with an awakened sense of attention and sense of the irony that man himself may be the instrument of his own destruction. Kolbert is what could be called a “neocatastrophist.” She believes that the scientific record shows that conditions on earth change only very slowly, except when they don’t---“long periods of boredom interrupted by occasionally by panic. Though rare, these moments of panic are disproportionately important.” Her reportage brings her to the conclusion that we are in the midst of a great extinction and that in the future…far into the future, the geologic record will clearly show something extraordinary happened in the hundreds of thousands of years of human habitation. But it may be visible only to giant rats, the one species she concludes may be likely to survive and thrive. While at first Kolbert shares current examples of species extinction happening right now, gradually she comes to zero in on probable cause: habitat modification caused by humans. She takes us through a riveting series of investigations scientists around the world are conducting to test how species adapt to changes in environment like carbon dioxide levels, for instance. Since continents are so well-travelled now, there are fewer areas uncontaminated by introduced species which may or may not be invasive or destructive to native species. Kolbert argues that man’s unparalleled and insatiable need to discover, innovate, and change his environment was like “bringing a gun to a knife fight.” ”To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more and were willing to make more sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn’t much matter whether people care or don’t care. What matters is that people change the world.”That is not to say that we couldn’t slow the event down a little, at least for humans, if we began to pay attention at this point. “As soon as humans started using signs and symbols to represent the natural world, they pushed beyond the limits of that world.” We are just witnessing the outcomes now. Kolbert writes “Though it may be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.” Perhaps American Indians with their roaming, nomadic habits, no fixed abode, and principles including commune with nature and not taking more than they needed to survive, may have been the last great environmentalists. They had a light footprint, didn’t they? Or am I completely wrong about that?In the last couple of paragraphs, Kolbert points out that some scientists are seriously considering reengineering the atmosphere by scattering sulfates in the stratosphere to reflect sunlight back to space, or alternatively, to decamp to other planets. That, so far, is their best work. Perhaps if we just cut back on consumption, and left fossil fuels in the ground, we’d live long enough to figure out a better option. Kolbert’s thesis ought to spark discussion, if nothing else. But we may also be witnessing the real-time devolution of our own species…no talk, no compromise. Get my gun."
17,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,5,"Non-fiction about the previous five mass extinctions of world history and the probability of a sixth extinction being precipitated by humans. Kolbert investigates biological and environmental factors contributing to this phenomenon. She analyzes the current research being conducted by scientists across the globe as well as evidence of past mass extinctions. She travels to these locations and describes her experiences. She reports on a variety of species, some of which are already extinct and others on the verge of being wiped out. She analyzes the reasons behind the extinctions, many of which can be traced to the actions of humans. This book covers a wide breadth of scientific disciplines, such as paleontology, anthropology, meteorology, geology, oceanography, and ecology. In addition to the expected analysis of climate change and deforestation, she covers the acidification of the oceans (something I had not heard before). Each chapter focuses on a different extinct or endangered species. I found myself rapidly turning to pages to learn more. Highlights include the decline of the Neanderthal, ravages of invasive species, decreasing biodiversity, and perilous position of large mammals such as elephants, bears, and the big cats. It combines elements of scientific explanation, history, travelogue, and personal reflections. It is an intelligent and lively commentary that illuminates current issues and provides a warning. It requires a keen interest in science and history, and if you are so inclined, this book is riveting. The historic ages of the earth are explained and what is known about the five previous extinctions. The history of scientific thought is traced, including Darwin’s (and Lyell’s and Wallace’s) theories and subsequent elaborations. It is a treasure trove of information and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Well, as much as one can “enjoy” a book about extinction. "
18,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"As most will have realized by now, I declared this March nature/science month. Thus, I'm reading (mostly) only non-fiction books. Many of these are about what was originally known as ""natural history"", which later became several scientific fields. There are a lot of books about this subject, of course, but I decided to finally catch up on the classics (Darwin, Wallace, Humboldt) and take it from there. Humboldt was the father of what we nowadays consider environmentalism and it was therefore only a small step from this incredible man's biography (who's 250th birthday we celebrate on 14 September incidentally) to books about the Big Five, the five mass extinctions that have shaped our planet and the 6th that we might be living in right now.While yesterday's book wasn't very gripping, this one was wonderful. Elizabeth Kolbert introduces us to a few extinct or almost extinct animals:The Golden Frog (extinct in the wild)as well as the Great Auk (extinct)The former was attacked by a fungus (much like the bats she later introduced/presented). Some biologists saw what was happening (at first not knowing what killed off the amphibians) and saved as many as they could find, taking them to a hotel (no, I'm not kidding) where they built a habitat in several rooms.The latter was killed off by fishermen and for the clothing industry as it was fashionable to wear their feathers in times past. Much like with shark finning nowadays, people plucked the birds, leaving them naked and with partially ripped-off skin in the cold to die horribly. Either we humans therefore caused their extinction directly or the population was decimated to a point where they could no longer survive some other factor.The author then also describes older epochs where dinosaurs and other creatures roamed and ruled on Earth.She tells about research, how we came up with considering extra-terrestrial factors such as meteor strikes for an extinction event, digging up fossils, how original theories were established, disbelieved, proven or disproven, amended etc.And we follow her to various places around the globe to witness nature's might and beauty as well as its destruction. Like when she swims and dives through various reefs (the Great Barrier Reef amongst others), thus showing us sharks and fish, corals and the rest of the incredible diversity these ""jungles of the sea"" have to offer. Or when she hikes through the Amazonian rain forest (reserve 12-0-2). Or when she crawls through caves in the US in the endeavor to count the last remaining bats that have not yet been killed by the afore-mentioned fungus (white-nose). She's thus also telling the reader about invasive species either introduced deliberately (like the famous poisonous toad in Australia or a certain snail on Hawaii) or by accident via ships and planes (like a snake on Guam or the Japanese bark fungus that has killed off the American chestnut).What I didn't know and learned here, for example, was that almost all grass in the US is NOT native. Like one third(!) of all plants (dandelions for example) or earthworms, it arrived from Europe. It's called the Columbus Exchange. (There are no American earthworms whatsoever, in fact, since they all died out during the last ice age.) Basically, humans are running plate tectonics backwards, breaking the evolutionary chain by bringing American species to Africa, African ones to Europe, European ones to Antarctica and so on. This ""going back to what it was like when there was still the super-continent Pangea"" is dangerous however as it means the elimination of species variety.Moreover, through the author's travels we meet a number of paleontologists, geologists, ecologists and biologists explaining these phenomena and what they mean (now and in the future). Thus, she gives a 360° view on the subject, even including etymological and historical details that were fascinating to read about (like where the word ""science"" came from, who coined it and when - since it had a direct influence on the research itself). Or what contribution the different naturalists and explorers (such as James Cook, too) made that still influence our understanding of nature today.Monocultures, ocean acidification, poaching, CO2-outputs, ... there is more than enough proof for the devastating effects we humans have already had in addition to natural factors and this book provides a very nice summary / overview with enough examples from around the world.The writing style is fluent and coherent and the combination of the topics to give a holistic view before the tragic conclusion was suspenseful (yes, although it is non-fiction) and very well done. By the way, she also mentions efforts that give hope seeing as how far we've come and what we've done already to protect certain species and get them back from the brink. We could at least prevent ultimate disaster if only we got our collective butt in gear and actively changed the world (for the better this time).Naturally, this is more than a science book. It's also a cautionary tale. It's bringing context to what we've done to the world so far and what we'll probably continue doing to it and what the outcome will likely be. It therefore already also provides the answer for an alternative.The easily accessible writing might thus be the perfect way of conveying accurate scientific details even to laymen (who are usually rather reluctant to pick up such a book). A very important book that I wish more people would read."
19,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"on the dedication page of her landmark 1962 book, silent spring, rachel carson quoted humanitarian, biocentrist, and nobel peace prize winner albert schweitzer thus, “man has lost the capacity to foresee and to forestall. he will end by destroying the earth.” in the ensuing half century since carson’s watershed work first saw print, evidence aplenty has proven the prescience of schweitzer’s sentiment with distressing rapidity. in a new book as incisive and imperative as the late ms. carson’s, new yorker staff writer elizabeth kolbert confronts what may well be the most compelling, portentous, and defining characteristic of our modernity: the nearly inconceivable and irretrievable loss of earth’s biodiversity at the hands of our own species.as with her acclaimed 2006 book, field notes from a catastrophe, kolbert’s the sixth extinction: an unnatural history considers the rapacious effects of humanity’s unmitigated conquest of our planet and its biota – and the harrowing legacy our actions (and inactions) have ultimately wrought. although there have been five mass extinctions over the last half billion years – during which “the planet has undergone change so wrenching that the diversity of life has plummeted” – we now have the distinct and dubious honor of not only “witnessing one of the rarest events in life’s history, [but] also causing it.” in her preparatory research for the sixth extinction, kolbert visited four continents over as many years, witnessing first-hand the evidence of previous extinctions, as well as those that are currently unfolding around the globe. within each of the book’s thirteen chapters, kolbert focuses upon a single species: many facing the imminent threat of extinction and others long relegated to scientific annals. kolbert’s shrewd reporting, while always engaging, often reveals data that is simply staggering in scope. amphibians, for example, have became the world’s most endangered class of animals, with a group extinction rate as high as 45,000 times the background (or normal) rate. “it is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all fresh-water mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.” coral reefs, sumatran rhinos, and little brown bats are but a few of the innumerable species currently vulnerable or otherwise imperiled.it has been suggested that the holocene, a geological epoch that began some 12,000 years ago, has transitioned into what may more aptly be termed the “anthropocene,” on account of humanity’s dominance and the myriad “geologic scale changes people have effected.” amongst the many pernicious man-made forces contributing to our “transformation of the ecological landscape” are fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, ocean acidification, habitat fragmentation and loss, overfishing, the introduction of invasive species, and pollution.much as she did in her earlier book about climate change, kolbert forgoes an alarmist approach in favor of a measured, well-reasoned style that relies on the facts of her remarkable reporting. with beautiful, luminous prose (well familiar to readers of her new yorker articles), kolbert accessibly reveals the extent of the mass extinction we are currently in the midst of. whether recounting the history of extinction as an accepted concept, chronicling the efforts of scientists to assuage its worsening consequences, or regarding mankind’s role in this unprecedented era, she does precisely what she sets out to do: “convey both sides: the excitement of what’s being learned as well as the horror of it.” the sixth extinction is assuredly a most significant and substantial work - one that foresees the calamity of our future, and aims to forestall the most ignominious bequest imaginable."
20,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Kolbert makes a compelling case that we are in the throes of a mass extinction citing example after example of our destruction of the environment and its inhabitants. Fortunately she is a gifted writer, so despite the bleak message we don’t just put down this important book in despair. Reporting on scientists investigating threatened species, she identifies the many ways that we are putting all life at risk. Sometimes our unrestrained native instincts are responsible, others the shortsighted and reckless way we use modern industry and technology.The increase in world population combined with our penchant to explore and settle new territories is one cause. We not only pose a direct threat as super-efficient hunters, habitat disruptors and destroyers; but we bring along a myriad of pests from rats to fleas to fungi to viruses. In the age of jet planes filling the skies and cargo ships filling the sea lanes, just about any organism can end up anywhere. The author describes this as the new Pangaea. Far flung lands might as well be directly connected as we spread invasive species to every corner of the globe. So on top of the many species we have hunted to extinction from the great auk in Iceland to the moa in New Zealand; we have carried in snakes and rats that have eliminated everything from bird populations in Guam to palm trees on Easter Island and more recently spread fungi that have decimated amphibians and bats, to list just a few examples. Within this new Pangaea humanity’s expansion has fragmented wild and natural areas into smaller and smaller enclaves. Species die off as these eco-islands become too small to support the vibrant diversity that existed before. Compounding the problem is climate change. Kolbert profiles past extinctions in which climate was a factor, but there is a major difference in the current situation – the rate of change. Our climate is changing in decades, not thousands of years giving species little time to adapt. Some species can change latitude or elevation but many are trapped in their remaining “island” habitats, unable to migrate from patches of forest or isolated sanctuaries. Climate change puts ocean life at risk as well. As the burning of fossil fuels loads up our atmosphere with carbon much of it ends up in the sea. Again the speed with which this is happening is the telling factor. The extreme rate of change affords sea creatures little time to adjust to increased ocean acidification and resultant decreased pH and calcium saturation levels. While devastating to calcifiers such as coral this change could favor organisms which pump sulfur into the atmosphere. Then there is the problem of chain reactions. Flora and fauna are intricately interdependent, as one vulnerable species is eliminated; many others go with it. Kolbert points out that a wide variety of species will perish as the coral reefs die out. Similarly the elimination of rainforests means the highly diversified ecosystems they support will fail. Every species lost puts another in a precarious position. And of course we too are a part of this chain of life. Kolbert has done a superb job of presenting this crisis in a way that has resonated with many. Hopefully it will help more of us to realize how serious our situation is before it is too late. "
21,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb-martens,4,"Most depressing book that I've ever read. The physical science of man's injury to Earth began since he emerged as a species, and now is at its zenith. In spite of the evidence, not much is being done to reduce the damage. I felt sicker and sicker as I read on, and I hated picking the book up once I'd put it down. As a species, humanity is self-serving and aggressive. I've watched Trump pooh-pooh climate change, knowing that our oceans are becoming acidic which is going to kill off microscope marine food for salmon, whales etc., kill reefs - which has nothing to do with temperature and everything to do with CO2 levels. Who will the last survivors be? Like everything related to extinction, will they look at each other and say, ""Oh, I guess we should have paid attention sooner.""? Read it and weep. "
22,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76202320-henk,4,"Urgent, important and sobering. How we impact biodiversity, already since the stone age, and not for the better.Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear if he ever did.Elizabeth Kolbert shows a love and awe for nature and biodiversity. She goes far and wide, from Iceland, to the South American rainforests, the fossil sites of North America and Paris museums, in the impressive journey recorded in The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. Not just physically but also the path of thinking about species, and our influence on them, is something she minutely traces. The book is well written and engaging, making the threshold to dive into the concept of speciation and extinction low.The revolutionary moment of evolution theory and archeology coinciding in the figures of Cuvier and Darwin is where the book starts of with in chapter 2. These scientists are pitted against an ancient believe that nature was unchangeable and perfect. And even the recent discovery in 1980 of the iridium layer around the world, marking the end of the age of dinosaurs, was still a necessary support for the idea that mass extinction of species could be real.Kolbert dives in a lot of interesting concepts, I never knew for instance that Anthropocene was a term popularized by a Dutch scientist! Another important one is the background extinction rate, estimated at maybe a species per 700-1.000 years going extinct normally. It is very clear that the current extinction rate of species which we are seeing, from massive dying of frogs, to coral bleaching and imported fungi killing bats, is far above this rate. We follow this story of human influence on biodiversity from a well known vantage point, the Industrial Revolution. The mass scale carelessness and cruelty of the destruction of the great auks, who from previously being protected by far of nesting grounds went to European ship food, feather supply and fuel because of their fat, is disheartening.In modern times we see that oceans are 30% more acidic than in 1800 and at current trajectory are expected to be at 150% at the end of the century. All captured in the deviously logaritmic pH scale change between 8 and 7.8. And with 7.8 being a tipping point that would wipe out over 30% of all marine life, ranging from mussels, oysters to clownfish.Even without the climate change, scientists show that the shredding of living environment of animals leads to a reduction in biodiversity, and especially that human intercontinental trade creates a new Pangea of interconnected ecosystems. Which invariably leads to niche species taking a hit or going extinct. And even before agriculture there are compelling indications that humanity started killing off megafauna: He found that even a very small initial population of humans - a hundred or so individuals- could, over the course of a millennium or two, multiply sufficiently to account for pretty much all of the extinction in the record.Not to mention the coincidental timing of the demise of our brethren the Neanderthals and the rise of homo sapiens. Not just murder would be the crime, but also rape: 2% to be 4% of modern day Asian and European DNA is traceable to Neanderthals.The Sixth Extinction is a sobering story of how the rise of humanity invariable seems to lead to a reduction of biodiversity through multi pronged influences of reduction of living environment, exploitation, climate change and import of new species. Warning us, Kolbert ends with a quote from Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich, that I can only repeat: in pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches."
23,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,5,"This one should be required reading in highschool. It will teach one more about the world and humanity than The Scarlet Letter or its ilk ever could. It's a book about wonder at the natural world and evolution, and a walk through of why most humans suck at sharing the globe. My initial reaction:Then I had a good cry. "
24,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,4,"I often find that engineers (who sometimes believe they are demigods), go berserk at the mention of Greta Thunberg. How dare this child who does not know anything about science, make such statements about climate change? How dare she tell the world to make a paradigm shift and stop using fossil fuels? And - this is the most heinous crime of all - how dare so many people follow her? If there is a problem because of carbon emission (and they are sure there isn't) engineers would find a way out of it. Because engineers are qualified. Stupid laymen please shut up.I must say that I am a bit amused at this. Humans are so sure about their capability to control nature, of being ""monarchs of all they survey"", that even to suggest that they may be a wee bit not in control of their own destiny is to arouse fiery passions. (And this is especially true with us engineers because we are fed with the conceit that we ""build"" the nation.) But if you look at the evolutionary history of earth, homo sapiens has been present only for a tiny fraction of the time period. We are just a blip in the cosmic ocean of time......a blip that may wink out at any moment.The older view evolution is that it was a slow, laborious process, proceeding at its own leisurely pace, with no jerks and bumps, one species morphing into another and the dead ends of evolution getting slowly weeded out. But we now know it's not so humdrum as that. Once in a while, there are massive upheavals which wipe out almost all the species on earth. We have had five of them so far (the most famous being the asteroid collision which wiped out the dinosaurs and made mammals the dominant species) and - this is the punchline - we may be living through the sixth.Elizabeth Kolbert has addressed the topic brilliantly in this book. In thirteen chapters, she takes us through the history of evolutionary theory and its development to the present form over the years: how Georges Cuvier discovered the concept of catastrophic extinction; how Charles Lyell disowned the concept but through his fossil research laid the springboard for Charles Darwin to launch his revolutionary theory of evolution; how the father-son pair of scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez convinced a reluctant scientific world about the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs and reshaped the earth. Then she goes on to talk about habitat destruction, ocean acidification, global warming and all those distressing subjects - about how humankind is slowly committing seppukku.What makes the book fascinating is its structure. Each of the thirteen chapters is a lesson in biology and the environment, a lesson in the history of the evolutionary theory, and an extremely entertaining account of a field trip she took with environmentalists/ scientists. These three strands are twined together so intricately and engagingly that the book just flows. You wouldn't for one second think that this is a book which discusses a matter which is - literally - life and death. And that is its greatest strength.(In Chapter V, Kolbert talks about Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. In it, the author argues that any data which threatens to upset the commonly held assumptions are always explained away or discounted until the crisis becomes so acute that someone finally has to call a spade a spade. It is called a ""paradigm shift"". That is what happened with extinction theory. And this is what is happening with climate change deniers, as I mentioned at the beginning of the review.)After painting a rather bleak picture for humankind's future, Kolbert gives us a ray of hope by saying that the same cognitive revolution which changed man into a such a destructive force also gave him the power to understand and tackle the consequences of his actions. So, even though we are in the middle of the sixth extinction, and we are largely responsible for it, we may be able to pull back from the precipice just in time.And if we aren't - well, it was an exciting time to live in."

The first half of the book covers how we came to understand the history of mass extinction. The second half probes the human role in the current sudden rise in animal and plant extinctions- especially through our role in driving global warming and ocean acidification. While Kolbert's information here is frightening, her presentation is understated and she studiously avoids politics. This is a work of science journalism, not environmental advocacy. The reader, however, may acquire a melancholy perspective on the state of nature in another hundred years- as a fascinating book that will have many missing pages. Will the ""humans"" page ultimately be ripped out as well? Kolbert's raises the question, but does not attempt to answer. "

It was a lucky pick because I hadn’t heard of the book or the author before that, but the subject matter was right up my alley.This book is about the extinction crisis that’s currently ongoing and that is caused by humans. In Earth’s history, there have been five major extinction events, wherein mass die-offs of species occurred within a concentrated time frame, sharply reducing the planet’s biodiversity. We are currently in the middle of the sixth major extinction event and it kicked off practically when humans became humans.This book chronicles the evidence that the sixth extinction is happening and it’s happening because of us. That’s the big difference in this extinction event versus all the ones in the past. This isn’t a cheery book. It’s sad and depressing, and it’s the truth.Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world's most endangered class of animals; it's been calculated that the group's extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion. The losses are occurring all over: in the South Pacific and in the North Atlantic, in the Arctic and the Sahel, in lakes and on islands, on mountaintops and in valleys. If you know how to look, you can probably find signs of the current extinction event in your own backyard. (p17)Kolbert takes us around the world, exploring the crisis in a sincere and sober way, but not without bits of subtle (and sometimes dark) humor strewn throughout. (You want to cry, but you try to laugh instead.)Neanderthals were extremely similar to modern humans; probably they were our very closest relatives. And yet clearly they were not humans. Somewhere in our DNA must lie the key mutation (or, more probably, mutations) that set us apart — the mutations that make us the sort of creature that could wipe out its nearest relative, then dig up its bones and reassemble its genome. (p240)I absolutely love the amount of information packed into this book. And it’s not just the subject that Kolbert is talking about at that moment, but even things that are mentioned somewhat in passing, like the fact that a real-life Jurassic Park can never happen.Five hundred thousand years ago, the dinosaurs had been dead for about sixty-five million years, so the whole ""Jurassic Park"" fantasy is, sadly, just that. (p245)Other things are covered in much more detail, of course, and I learned so much. And it’s never boring. She weaves it all together with her own experiences as she meets the scientists and goes on trips and expeditions with them. For example, I loved her vivid descriptions as she was crawling through the rainforest as night or especially her experience on One Tree Island at the tip of the Great Barrier Reef:I glanced back in what I thought was the direction of the island, but there was no island, or land of any sort, to be seen. We rinsed out the sampling bottles, filled them, and started back. The darkness was, if anything, even more complete. The stars were so bright they appear to be straining out of the sky. For a brief moment I felt I understood what it must have been like for an explorer like Cook to arrive at such a place, at the edge of the known world. (p134)She also manages to get in some (well-deserved) barbs at our species:The way corals change the world – with huge construction projects spanning multiple generations — might be likened to the way that humans do, with this crucial difference. Instead of displacing other creatures, corals support them. (p130)One of my favorite things about these kinds of books is learning about and getting to know the various scientists and researchers doing work around the world. This book is chockfull of them, and many are quite colorful characters.Back on the trail, Silman hacked away with his machete, pausing every now and then to point out a new botanical oddity, like a shrub that steals water from its neighbors by sticking out needlelike roots. Silman talks about plants the way other people talk about movie stars. One tree he described to me as ""charismatic."" Others were ""hilarious,"" ""crazy,"" ""neat,"" ""clever,"" and ""amazing."" (p163)They also help to highlight the issues facing many species around the world. For example, Zoo Atlanta herpetologist Joseph Mendelson has written, “…I sought a career in herpetology because I enjoy working with animals. I did not anticipate that it would come to resemble paleontology. (p17)Womp womp. And if you’d like to be even more depressed:The sun was out, but it had recently rained, and clusters of black and red and blue butterflies hovered over the puddles. Occasionally, a truck rumbled by, loaded down with logs. The butterflies couldn't scatter fast enough, so the road was littered with severed wings. (p170)Is it all doom and gloom though? I would argue yes. And I think Kolbert agrees. She quotes the director of a conservation group in Alaska who told her, “People have to have hope. I have to have hope. It’s what keeps us going.” But, as Kolbert herself says:To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more and were willing to make more sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter whether people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world. (p266)Note: I received a review copy of this book from LibraryThing. Quotes may be subject to change in the final version."

28,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,2,"***NO SPOILERS***(Full disclosure: book abandoned at page 173 [out of 269 pages].)This book isn’t bad, and it’s definitely important--everyone should learn about the topic--but Kolbert isn’t an engaging writer, and engaging writing is crucial for such an involved topic. I was deceived because The Sixth Extinction starts out promising and my interest was piqued immediately; however, subsequent chapters go downhill. The first chapters discuss species now extinct, specifically the Panamanian golden frog, the mastodon, and the great auk. When Kolbert deviated from her academic style and injected some feeling into her writing, as she did most successfully in the great auk chapter, I was instantly invested. The turn for the worse comes at about ⅓ of the way through, when Kolbert detailed how scientists grappled with explaining the dinosaur extinction. Specifically, she delved into the nitty-gritty of the controversy surrounding the asteroid-impact theory. This isn’t really so dull, but it doesn’t seem entirely relevant to the book’s premise, which is straightforward. (Straightforward enough that some quality articles on the sixth extinction can probably educate just as well, for much less time investment.) I consider The Sixth Extinction pretty science heavy mainly because Kolbert spent too much time on the finer points of geology (for instance, how much iridium is contained in certain rock) and fossils and chemical reactions; the list goes on. I wondered whether breaking down information as intricately as she did was truly necessary to see the larger picture, especially because she wrote this book to appeal to a wide range of readers, not just science geeks. Given how very important it is to get people to not just understand but care about what’s happening to the planet right now, it’s imperative that writers present pertinent information accessibly. There are ways to make science-writing appealing to the lay reader while still being thorough (see: author Sam Kean). The more of this book I read, though, the more I realized Kolbert doesn’t really have that knack, and I felt she forgot who her readers really are. Curiously, the book’s photos are in black-and-white (and are surprisingly boring photos at that). I consider the lack of color a drawback. If a lesser book such as Aquarium can feature color photos, surely this important book can. This is a smaller quibble, obviously, but I think top-notch, color photos could have bolstered Kolbert’s points or at least made the book more memorable. An endorsement on the back of the hardcover edition claims The Sixth Extinction “reads like a scientific thriller.” I find that amusing because a “scientific thriller” would be The Hot Zone: The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus, and Kolbert’s style isn’t remotely like Preston’s. It would have been much better if it were, though. If any subject needs to be made exciting, it’s science (and perhaps history). I don’t suggest potential readers necessarily avoid this book, so this review is instead a forewarning. The Sixth Extinction isn’t a science book for the masses."
29,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“Time is the essential ingredient, but in the modern world there is no time.”- Elizabeth Kolbert, The Sixth ExtinctionProbably a more important book than a great book. It seemed to capture some much needed attention to the state of the living world and the impact MAN is having on his environment. Spoiler Alert: Man is the 6th Extinction. We are metaphorical (well, not really metaphorical) asteroid about to undo what it took the Earth millions of years to produce. And, we've been doing it almost since we've shown up. In someways it reads like a horror novel. You KNOW how it is going to end. You know the damn clown is going to jump out of THAT room, and yet it still scares the bejesus out of you. When I read this book, I think of a couple books. First, it is kinda like The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World in that it is a very empathetic approach to its subject matter.It also reminds me a bit of Richard Preston's The Hot Zone: The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus in that it uses science to scare the shit out of the reader. But instead of detailing a superbug from Africa that might get us, it is US that will eventually get us (after we have destroyed the limb we've been standing on). Another parallel to Preston's Hot Zone is also the cultural impact the book made. I remember in 1994 when the Hot Zone came out, it was maybe not a cultural moment, but it made a big enough impression that movies were made. The Sixth Extinction, 20-years-later, in 2014 produced a similar cultural impact.Finally, it also reminded me a bit of John McPhee. Kolbert writes in a style similar to McPhee's just not at his level. And this is the main reason I gave it only 4-stars. McPhee could take a subject (geology, bark canoes, Alaska, etc.) and with history, science, and a relevant personality, tease out a sweet literary line. Kolbert does a good job, it just doesn't ring or flow in the same way. To be fair, I'm comparing a very good science writer with perhaps the greatest new journalist ever. So, there is that."
30,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45632570-tim,4,"I realised today I'll be sad when the lockdown ends. There's something very magical about it, as if the planet is getting a good spring cleaning and all its inhabitants an urgently needed recalibrating of priorities. I love how people who do important jobs are suddenly getting all the love instead of narcissistic moronic reality TV celebrities and the like who had the limelight before. And the absence of cars, especially at night, is wonderful. The shot of the Himalayas visible from New Delhi for the first time in decades was especially poignant. And, on the whole, people are more friendly. There's a lot more generosity towards the poor. And so many health workers over here in the UK are of ethnic minority backgrounds that racism more than ever has been highlighted as the outlandish unforgivable expression of brute stupidity it is. The virus has made a nonsense of militant nationalism too. Takes a pandemic for most to understand that every border is in essence illusory; that we're all in this together. And how pettily absurd Brexit now seems. I hope this new generation will take on board this rejigging of social and ethical priorities and as a result be much more committed to looking after the planet.   Anyway, Elizabeth Kolbert in this book visits a series of research centres all over the globe, all with their own specialised subject, all charting and trying to prevent the sudden alarming demise of various species of mammal, bird, reptile and insect. She intersperses these individual and local sagas with an overview of how extinctions have occurred in the planet's history. Meticulously and convincingly she helps us to understand how quickly and carelessly we're heading towards the next big extinction, the first caused by humans. I liked this more than The Uninhabitable Earth because it's completely cleansed of the hellfire indignation which for me marred David Wallace-Wells' book."

You won’t be after you read this.Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it. To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly. Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.Harboring some hubris about your place in the world? Here’s a tonic:a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man—the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories—will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper.What else can I say about this book? The picture Kolbert paints of our situation is every bit as depressing as you might expect. I already knew the facts about climate change and animal extinction, but according to Kolbert the prognosis is even worse than I was aware, given that ocean acidification – “global warming’s ‘equally evil twin’” – is one contributor I hadn’t ever considered. Likewise, though I’d heard about the crisis with the world’s amphibians, I was entirely ignorant of the bat cataclysm (white-nose syndrome).As a longtime New Yorker journalist, Kolbert writes at a good level for laymen: not talking down, but not assuming any specialist knowledge either. I was somewhat unconvinced by her thematic, species-by-species approach here; it makes each chapter more like an individual essay than a part of a larger argument. Winging her way around the world (what carbon footprint?!), she considers auks and ammonites, mastodons and endangered zoo animals in captive breeding programs, dying coral reefs, and pockets of Amazonian rainforest. By the end, you’ll be in no doubt that we are in the middle of a major extinction event, and that our era will be known as the “Anthropocene” – the age of the influence of man.Luckily, there are spots of humor to lighten the tone, such as “The reason this book is being written by a hairy biped, rather than a scaly one, has more to do with dinosaurian misfortune than with any particular mammalian virtue.”As Caspar Henderson writes in his Guardian review, “The extinction crisis is so vast and complex that it almost repels thought. We need a lot more imaginative thinking about the choices we can make and what comes next.” Now that this has won a Pulitzer, one hopes it will get people talking and doing some of that imaginative thinking. Unfortunately, it’s so much easier to bury heads in the sand and keep going as we have been. Time will tell whether we heed the lessons of this book."

To the extent that we can identify the causes of these revolutions, they're highly varied: glaciation in the case of the ordovician extinction, global warming and chances in chemistry at the end of the Permian, an asteroid impact in the final seconds of the Cretaceous. The current extinction has its own novel cause: not an asteroid or a massive volcanic eruption but ""one weedy species. As Walter Alvarez put it to me, ""We're seeing right now that a mass extinction can be cause by human beings."" (265-266) ""With the capacity to represent the world in signs and symbols comes the capacity to change it, which as it happens, is also the capacity to destroy it. A ting set of genetic variations divides us from the Neanderthals, but that has made all the difference. (258)It isn't unique to note that humanity has dangerously altered the planet in a way that no other species before it has done as conclusively demonstrated by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. What makes this book not only important but a must-read is the case by case basis which she follows through with each chapter of extinct or near-to-extinct case studies of populations of animals, from the American Mastodon to the frogs of central Panama to the Sumatran Rhino. Because of the subject matter and the grand question of purpose among our own species, the ones before us, and the ones that will come after we're gone, this book is something that stays with the reader afterwards, pondering the grand invention of creation, evolution, and eventual disarray. The book provides a great overview of the subject matter that newcomers will find informative and enjoyable, and despite the information presented, does offer glimpses of hope and even humour. What is so fascinating about the subject matter is the concept of how life has survived and altered itself time after time on our bountiful rock, and how little we as a species really understand the world we have seemingly (or rather forcibly) inherited. It was only roughly 300 years ago that palaeontology began to take it's first steps as a major science with the discovery of mastodon bones in North America, and that whole different worlds existed before ours. It was only in 1831 that Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle and made his way around the world, specifically to the Galapagos, giving us terms in his ""On the Origins of Species"" that now represent mainstream science. Neanderthals only were discovered shorted after Darwin's voyage, and it was only in 2004 that a hobbit like humanoid species was discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia. How freaking amazing and unbelievable is that?It was interested to see Kolbert's travels around the globe, diving into the globalisation aspects of humanity that give us terms like ""New Pangaea,"" how bat populations in the Northeastern part of the US have dropped off significantly do to factors that bats elsewhere in the world are immune to, the investigation into rainforest populations in South America, and the incredible efforts scientists are doing to protect endangered species, like giving rhinos ultrasounds and crows handjobs. It's a tale of our grim actions, but the hopeful aspects of our understanding of the world that can add it. The choice is up to us as a species."

34,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"It's absolutely, extremely, utterly, incredibly important for the general reader to remember that the real story of science is written in the language of mathematics. When authors put the story of scientific disciplines like physics, or chemistry or even biology into words and stories, they are translating something hard and complex and precise into a soft, fuzzy medium.It's analogous to knitting a replica of Michelangelo's David. Even if you are a genius knitter, the end result will only be (at best) a flabby simulacrum of the authentic object.If you experienced the knitted David (let's call him Dave) you would have a general, vague sense of what the real David was like. But you would be a long way away from really understanding the awe inspiring experience of the real deal.Let's take the analogy one step further. Imagine you're an alien, and you discovered the knitted Dave. But you had never seen the real David sculpture, or (more importantly) an actual human specimen. How much would you really understand about people, based on you're observations of the knitted Dave. You would have a very general sense. Enough to pick a hominid out of a crowd of donkeys. But that's about it. Better than nothing, but far from expertise. I love evolutionary biology and ecology and sociology. But I'm not trained in any of these disciplines. My understanding of them is via popularizations like this. Even within my discipline of clinical psychology, I'm barely educated. But outside of my discipline, I am essentially an enthusiastic dilettante. That's not a dis. That's just another way of saying, I haven't spent 4 years of undergraduate training to prepare for another 4 years of doctoral training to prepare for another 3-5 years of post doctoral training to prepare for another 10-20 years of professional research in any of those fields.Humans specialize. None of us could possibly be specialists in more than one or maybe two of these domains. There just isn't enough time in a human life span.I have a laypersons education of ecology and biology. That's nothing to scoff at. It took (literally) hundreds of hours of hard work, reading a bunch of books, taking classes, talking to experts etc. to gain my laypersons understanding of evolutionary biology. But honestly, I wouldn't know an actual darwinian algorithm from a hole in the ground, let alone be able to accurately interpret the findings of the mathematical models experts develop and use to understand complex systems like species population dynamics and ecosystems.So I have to rely on experts and science journalists to tell me the story in English. I need these dedicated, talented individuals to ""knit me a Dave"". That's exactly what Elizabeth Kolbert did. She knitted us a Dave. The Sixth Extinction is a soft, cuddly, children's storybook version of the hard, awful reality the actual experts in the field of biology and ecology are bearing witness to.If she had delivered us a harder version. It would have been (a) unintelligible to us mere mortals, and (b) so unspeakably awful, that most of us would have never, ever willingly subjected ourselves to this horrible, terrifying (much more than inconvenient) truth. Even the ""soft"" Dave version is pretty fucking tragic and demoralizing. If I were to give you a quick sketch analogy of what the knitted Dave of mass extinction looks like. Imagine a plush toy bat (flying mammal), stuffed with dead, decomposing frogs, with an invasive fungus choking his nostrils, literally starving to death, drooling acrid barren sea water and sputtering a creepy recorded (five nights at Freddie's) robot voice looping the phrase, ""we're all going to die a horrible, slow death, we're all going to suffocate in a giant cesspool of our own feces, and it's way too late to do anything about it"".Not exactly Tickle Me Elmo, but still, a very soft version of the reality.One can only imagine the horror that experts feel when they see entire species evaporate, or when they crunch the numbers and the results look like an ASCII skull and bones. You can imagine these nerdy bookworm types, realizing the awful reality and trying desperately to communicate the immense gravity of the situation to the stoners, jocks and rednecks who used to beat and torture them in high school, only to receive responses like ""The Bible says we can despoil the earth however we see fit"" or ""it's only a theory"" or ""not all scientists agree"" or ""it was cold for a few days this summer, so that proves global warming is a scam"".Even the most charismatic of the nerds, Think Neil Degrassi Tyson, Carl Sagan or Al Gore still only managed to capture the hearts and minds of ""egg head PBS types"", even when they limit their messages to what can be communicated via entertaining, schticky soundbites, Hollywood style computer animated visualizations and 30 minute PowerPoint slideshows.The Sixth Extinction goes at explaining the issue of the ecological disaster we currently find ourselves in by giving a brief history of the previous five mass extinction events that science has identified. Apparently global species population and diversity levels expand and contract regularly, but have dropped to next to nothing for various reasons thorough out the history of life on earth. The previous 5 mass extinction events are:1: the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event (occurring about 66 Ma) in which about 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. 2: the Triassic–Jurassic extinction (occurring about 201.3 Ma) in which about 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species went extinct.3: the Permian-Triassic transition. (occurring about 252 Ma). Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects).4: the Devonian Period (occurring 375–360 Ma), a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species.5: the Ordovician–Silurian extinction (occurring 450–440 Ma) killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.At one point, around 70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens almost went extinct. About 90% of us died. We got down to an estimated 40 breeding pairs. That's really close to extinction. But we showed em our bounce back stuff and boy look at us now!Now we're officially in the Holocene period (and have been for more than 10,000 years), but many scientists are pushing the point that we have officially exited the Holocene and entered an altogether new epoch that they are calling the Anthropocene. They argue that humans are having such a pronounced impact on the enviornment that we should be the titular species of this particular cene (hence the Anthro at the beginning of the word).They also argue that there is a new mass extinction event currently under way that may be the worst one yet. They are calling it the.... You guessed it....6: the Anthropocene extinction.That's awesome right? It's exciting to be a part of history. Even if it's potentially the end of it.Bad Boundaries:One of the salient points in the book is that global climate instability is not the only source of extinction. Another big problem happens when an ecosystems square footage is reduced or its boundaries are violated. Obviously deforestation is a huge problem. By making the rain forests land coverage smaller, it shrinks the biodiversity exponentially (there's that math stuff again). Apparently there's a formula for it that calculates the extinction rates as you down scale an environment. It's like the E=Mc2 of the apocalypse.But globalization is also a huge problem in that it introduces invasive species like rats into sensitive environments. Apparently rats have been hitching rides on boats for as long as people of been sailing.Invasive species can literally crash an ecology. In the book, Kolbert discusses a species of gray snake that was introduced to an island echo system that basically ate everything. It reduced to a tropical island full of pretty birds, lizards and bugs to pretty much just only snakes.Kolbert makes the gorgeous point that it's easy to vilify the little grey snake. But the snake isn't mean or immoral, it's amoral, meaning it's It's simply doing what it's hardwired to do. It's just trying to survive and reproduce. The Ultimate Invasive Species:In case you're wondering where this is going, the ultimate invasive species is us. Humans go just about everywhere And everywhere that humans go, almost everything else dies. It's not that were mean or immoral, were actually amoral in the same way the grey snake is. We're simply doing we're all hardwired to do. Survive and reproduce (with obvious exceptions, but not enough to make a critical difference).We like to hold ourselves to moral standards, and vilify some bad guys e.g. Dick Cheney (I'm not saying he's not, but just hear me out).The fact of the matter is, the Anthropocene extinction isn't happening because we're immoral. It's happening because we're amoral.It may seem like I'm splitting hairs but the distinction is important.Perhaps viewing ourselves as moral, and holding ourselves and others to standards of morality is part of the problem. Perhaps framing this ecological crisis as a moral issue is creating a fatal blind spot. Perhaps experimental psychology can be of assistance in explaining my point.Don't Diss Me:Cognitive dissonance is the very reliably observed psychological phenomena, whereby people (including you me and everybody we know) confabulate anxiety reducing fictions when confronted with our own amoral behavior.So in other words, when people realize that their behavior is incongruent with their values, they feel bad, but rather than change the behavior, they make up a story (no matter how absurd) that relieves them of the pain of their own hypocrisy. For example, consider a situation in which someone who places a value on being environmentally responsible just purchased a cool new chick magnet car that he later discovers is a gas guzzler.The conflict:It is important for the man to be (at least viewed as) a good steward of the environment. But he is now driving a babe getting machine that also happens to double as an earth warmer.As you can imagine, he's feeling rather conflicted about now. Drive a Prius and die a childless and alone, or drive the Maserati and repopulate Brentwood. In order to reduce the dissonance between his values and his behavior, he can (a) utilize public transportation more frequently (which is probably not going to happen, maybe in Seattle, not in L.A.), or he could (b) sell the car and purchase another one that gets better gas mileage (which, again, not hugely probable), or he could (c) convince himself that maybe all the global warming stuff is a little overblown, and one little Maserati aint gona kill nobody (which is a whole lot easier than option (a) or (b), and therefore pretty fucking likely).I know what you're thinking, ""other people do that, but I don't do that"". But you do, we all do, we just don't realize it. That's why they call it a blind spot.It sounds far fetched but cognitive dissonance has been observed in tightly controlled experiments again and again. Everyone does it. Even (no particularly) if you're a trained mental health professional,So maybe if we stop viewing the ecology issue moralistically, and start viewing it more pragmatically, than perhaps we can all stop pointing fingers and except the fact that we're all totally fucked and were going to die and there's noting we can do about it.No no. Of course there's something we can do about it. But we really need to accept that it's happening. Accept that were all complicit (even if you recycle), and then....I actually don't know what. But something I hope. Additionally, all of us regular people need to trust the experts. We may get a cold day in August and think we're all good. But that's not how this shit works. You have to do math and stuff. And odds are great that you don't. So trust the people that do and just do what they tell you. Even if you love Jesus. Which you probably don't if you're still reading this.Lastly, it occurred to me that I'm not going to face the worst of this, and my kid won't either, but her kids (should she ignore reason and reproduce) will. I'll just be honest here. Part of me has a hard time worrying past next week. And that same part of me kind of thinks, what ever, I'll be dead by then, and I know I'm not alone in this particular brand of denial. Cognitive dissonance ladies and gentlemen, don't let it win."

The first half is solid, inasmuch as it has some information about the history, and historiography, of extinction. The second half gets a little head-banging-against-a-wall, with example after example of currently endangered or recently extinct species, all told in the same palatable way. So, beware reader, that if you are like me, you might want to skip this book. It goes to great lengths to be entertaining, but entertaining in a very New Yorker kind of way. We learn more, I would guess, about the appearance and dress of the scientists Kolbert meets than we do about the extinctions she describes. We hear a lot about how people feel. We get a lot of novelistic realism about animal's rumps. And I just don't care. So frustrated was I by Kolbert's presentation of genuinely disturbing events that I started to think what a counter-argument might look like. Here are a couple: i) Kolbert pushes the 'anthropocene' (i.e., the 'geological' epoch determined by the existence of humanity and our destruction of other species) into the *very* distant past, roughly, when the indigenous peoples of Australia first killed off the continent's mega-fauna. But it is utterly ridiculous to liken prehistoric, and 20th and 21st century, human impact on the environment. Not to put too fine a point on it, back then we were just another species, though a successful one. Today, we run the planet. Eliding that difference makes it impossible to recognize what has caused the vast majority of extinctions over the last two centuries, viz., uncontrolled economic development. That's an argument I believe. The next one I'm not so sure about, but I do think there's a case to be answered: ii) Extinction is a natural occurrence. Granted that it's greatly accelerated over the last couple of centuries, but really, why worry so much? What moral obligation do we have towards *species*, as opposed to *living individuals*? If you have to kill a hundred foxes to reintroduce a threatened species into their previously natural environment, is that really a moral thing to do? What about the foxes' lives, after all? And so on. This book doesn't deal with such problems, but then, it wasn't meant to. It is entertaining propaganda, and good on Kolbert for bringing the issues up in the first place. "

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human. (watch here"

""To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more or were willing to make sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter when lather people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.""Does it mean that any conservation effort is for naught?

I have not been this disappointed in a book in a long while. More than a quarter of the length of the book was dedicated to notes. She touched on history as archeology has helped define it with reference to the past extinctions. I think, because she was being a writer, she needed to tell me things I didn't care to know, like what she and her research mates had for breakfast before they set out to discover whether or not a particular bug was or was not extinct.So here's the big spoiler alert.....she said humans were well on the way to an extinction and we were bringing it on ourselves. The sixth extinction is us. The one high point of the book for me was that she did not....to my memory....suggest that we could change things before it's too late.

40,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,4,"Elizabeth Kolbert knows how to put things together. She managed to create a very thoroughly documented book and to raise awareness about the extinction of species.The five extinctions known in the history of Earth decimated the species up to 96% (a brief summary can be read here: https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontol...)The sixth extinction here in question is named so because of the rate at which species are disappearing now:
“Calculating the background extinction rate is a laborious task that entails combing through whole databases’ worth of fossils. For what’s probably the best-studied group, which is mammals, it’s been reckoned to be roughly .25 per million species-years. This means that, since there are about fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around today, at the background extinction rate you’d expect—once again, very roughly—one species to disappear every seven hundred years.A rigorous calculation of the background extinction rate for amphibians has not been performed, in part because amphibian fossils are so rare. Almost certainly, though, the rate is lower than it is for mammals. Probably, one amphibian species should go extinct every thousand years or so.Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world’s most endangered class of animals; it’s been calculated that the group’s extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.”
And we, humans, are to blame here. The book has plenty of examples in which we exterminated a lot of species: the one concerning the great auk is so heart-breaking depicted. I do hope this book to be read by as many people as possible and maybe something in our collective mentality will change. We are just one species among so many other and just because we are more intelligent than the others (debatable from my point of view) does not make us owners of this planet and its life forms.
”In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us? One possibility—the possibility implied by the Hall of Biodiversity—is that we, too, will eventually be undone by our “transformation of the ecological landscape.” The logic behind this way of thinking runs as follows: having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth’s biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems—cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans—we’re putting our own survival in danger.”
It is not an easy book but it is definitely worth reading."
41,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches. - Stanford ecologist Paul EhrlichAs far as science has been able to determine, there have been five mass extinctions of life on Earth in the history of our planet. The first of these occurred at the end of the Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era about 450 million years ago. The second occurred less than 100 million years later in the late Devonian period. There followed the End-Permian extinction of some 250 million years ago, the Late Triassic extinction of 200 million years ago, and finally, the last one and the one we are most familiar with, the End-Cretaceous extinction which occurred about 65 million years ago. That's the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. (Well, almost - except for the ancestors of birds.)The best evidence seems to indicate that all of these extinctions except for the last one were the result of climatological events, often relatively sudden events to which plants and animals did not have time to adapt. The cause of the fifth one was also a change in climate but it was brought about by a collision with an asteroid. That cataclysmic event so altered the climate of the planet for a time that many, many species died out either suddenly or over a period of years.Scientists believe that we are now in the midst of the sixth extinction which Earth has endured and that this extinction is entirely human-caused. Elizabeth Kolbert writes in this book about how our species has altered life on the planet as no other species has before. It's not just that we are changing the climate for the worse, although that certainly is a big part of it, but we also have altered the face of Earth and the chemistry of the oceans to the detriment of very many species.One of the biggest problems that we have created for other species is simply the fact that we move everything around and wherever we go on Earth, it seems that some species hitch a ride with us. So a species from Asia that would never under normal circumstances make it to the Americas is brought here either wittingly or unwittingly and it wreaks havoc. Kolbert points out that the most endangered family of animals on Earth today are the amphibians. They are being wiped out by a fungus that has been spread around the world by humans. Kolbert writes about a dozen species, some of them already irrevocably lost and others on their way out. Through these very personal stories of that wonderful bird the Great Auk, the Panamanian golden frog, staghorn coral, the Sumatran rhino and others, the reader is moved to begin to understand the enormity of what is happening. What we are causing to happen to our world. It is somewhat surprising to learn that the concept of extinction is not a very old one. Kolbert points out that it was first articulated by Georges Cuvier in the revolutionary Paris of the 18th century. As always it seems, with any new scientific idea or concept, it took a while for it to be accepted, but later work by paleontologists has confirmed Cuvier's findings.This is a well-written book which can popularize scientific concepts and principles for a mass audience. It is an easy read and a fairly short one at less than 300 pages. Kolbert includes extensive notes and bibliography for those who wish to read more on the subject."
42,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17061542-zoe-s-human,4,"I learned many new things and I laughed a few times as well. That's pretty much a win for non-fiction. Humanity's impact on the environment tends to either be presented in a deliberately polarizing manner for political reasons or presented with assumptions of scientific knowledge which most lack. The author did an amazing job of explaining the science behind the impact in layman's terms without omitting details that frequently don't make ""news"" stories on the topic. She even took the time to explain how mistakes and theory discrepancies happen in science. Even better, she did all of this calmly by presenting facts and logic without resorting to emotional manipulation.I loved the inclusion of small personal notes about the assorted scientists featured. While such asides don't contribute to the main premise of the book, they do make it much more engaging. Between that and her wonderful descriptive style, I found myself able to visualize her experiences and environments with a fullness usually only found in fiction.There are two things which would have greatly enhanced my pleasure in this book. An insert of color photos of the assorted plants and animals discussed would be awesome. I did Google quite a bit while reading this and it would have been preferable to have photos right in the book.Additionally, a chart/timeline depicting the assorted eras and epochs mentioned in chronological order with dates and maybe a few sample organisms listed for each section would have been great. Perhaps with the mass extinctions and suggested range for the anthropocene marked as well? As clear as her explanations were, some information processes better in images than text.Things I think should be changed before the final release:The graph on page 16 is hella blurry.On page 46 at the end of chapter 2, she first mentions that the megafauna extinction is becoming understood as being the result of the spread of modern humans. No specifics are gone into on this until page 230. This left me wary that she was going to start making assertions without any kind of backup in the beginning of the book and I felt a bit weirded out all the way through the book by that hanging thread even when it became clear that she was validating her beliefs with facts. As a reader, it would have been better for that statement to have been omitted in chapter 2 if it wasn't going to be developed for almost 200 pages. At the very least, it should be noted that it will be expanded upon later in the book.Page 86, line 19, the paragraph that starts with ""The bolide arrived from the southeast..."" I'm assuming that ""doe to its trajectory"" (later in that paragraph) should read due ""to its trajectory.""The last sentence on 113 going over to page 114 reads ""Change the atmosphere's composition atmosphere..."" Is that right? It seems like the second atmosphere is superfluous or at least awkward.I would omit the bit about the gift shop cashier not showing Ms. Kolbert around from page 226. It comes across petty and unflattering to the author. Even if there were no other customers, it's a given in *any* clerking job that you don't leave the shop unattended. You can get fired for that.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway. Many thanks to all involved in providing me with this opportunity."

In the pages that follow, I try to convey both sides: the excitement of what's being learned as well as the horror of it."" (3)Mission accomplished. I learned something, and I felt something.Kolbert writes scientific journalism with the best of them and here she distills a lot of contemporary findings into easily conveyed factoids for the layperson. She tells a dynamic story but with very little pearl-clutching. She's largely neutral in her presentation, though she doesn't shy away from the (well-supported and widely accepted) thesis that it's human activity that's effected the climate change resulting in subsequent extinctions and a vast reduction to Earth's biodiversity. Maybe it's too late for us to halt the sweeping global change humankind has generated, but like it or not it's inexcusable to not pay attention and not learn about it. And those skeptical or uninterested in hearing anyone try to cram environmentalism down their throat with a lot of moralizing needn't fear. There are many chapters that focus on other, nonhuman catastrophes and extinction events, how they were discovered and how they shaped modern scientific thought and theory.And stylistically, her prose is entertaining and never dull. Just one example:When I visited Reserve 1202, I ran into a graduate student from Portugal who was surveying bats. At noon he had just recently woken up and was eating pasta in a shed that served as a research station-cum-kitchen. While we were talking, a very skinny cowboy rode up on an only slightly less skinny horse. He had a rifle slung over one shoulder. I wasn't sure whether he'd come because he'd heard the truck I'd arrived on and wanted to protect the student from possible intruders, or because he sensed that there was pasta. (174)5 stars out of 5. Informative and entertaining. A big win for popular science fans."

Exploring the other five extinctions in the past and comparing them to the current destruction of the biosphere is sobering. It is unclear whether the sixth will surpass the other five (each extinction had its own pathology) or if we will survive the catastrophe we created but it is not pleasant to read about. This is one of those books that reminds the reader that it is worse than you think by far. I am not sure how to read the forensics of armageddon being shielded from nature by modern life, one will put this book down and pick up another at least until the resources run out. What books like this usually elicit are deer in the headlights paralysis or ostrich-like behavior or a shrug of the shoulders. Kind of strange the way we respond selectively to threats. If species extinction flew a plane into a building may be the human race would respond."

Depressing as heck, but if you want a good overview of the challenges facing our planet in regards to humans and how we are changing the earth and its ecosystems I recommend this. There is no doubt in my mind that we have started a cascade of environmental collapses that is going to be hard to curtail. We have to try and minimize the damage, the challenge will be beyond difficult, but it is a noble goal. "

I want to not feel that the earth is so doomed by our simply negligent hand. I want to write a series of children’s stories teaching them about the Frozen Zoo, and the drones that leads new flocks of birds in the wild to repopulate and make sure they land on safe ground, and apes that are domesticating dogs, that make tools, that every day we learn they are just a bit smarter than we thought. This is a horror story through and through about the changes going on in this world because of how we live our lives, because of how homo sapiens have ALWAYS lived their lives even before we started burning fossil fuels and putting pesticide on everything. I want to go on a tour and shake the hand of everyone working desperately to create safety arks for animals that we are abandoning by our own callousness. I want to visit these refuges and revel in them, and then leave, hopefully, with no trace of ever having been there.And now, I’ll just let the book speak for itself. The only thing I could have asked for it is that for it to be longer. “One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is that the world is changing in ways that compel species to move, and another is that it’s changing in ways that create barriers—roads, clear-cuts, cities—that prevent them from doing so.”“By burning through coal and oil deposits, humans are putting carbon back into the air that has been sequestered for tens—in most cases hundreds—of millions of years. In the process, we are running geologic history not only in reverse but at warp speed.” The anthropologist Richard Leakey has warned that “Homo sapiens might not only be the agent of the sixth extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.” A sign in the Hall of Biodiversity offers a quote from the Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich: IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” “coral cover in the Caribbean has in recent decades declined by close to eighty percent.”“Asian elephants have declined by fifty percent over the last three generations.” “some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere.” “WHY is ocean acidification so dangerous? The question is tough to answer only because the list of reasons is so long. Depending on how tightly organisms are able to regulate their internal chemistry, acidification may affect such basic processes as metabolism, enzyme activity, and protein function. Because it will” "

In South America they're all succumbing to an introduced disease. One of the problems with the global world we live in is mobility - we bring species that would normally never had a chance of contact together. Diseases can spread world-wide in a manner that was unthinkable just a few hundred years ago. It's not just the frogs. In North America, the bat population has dropped to next to nothing due to a fungi from Europe, with which European bats live quite happily, but which kill their American counterparts by the millions.""In times of extreme stress, the whole concept of fitness, at least in a Darwinian sense, loses its meaning: how could a creature be adapter, either well or ill, for conditions it has never before encountered in its entire evolutionary history?"" Then theres's the human induced global warming caused by billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere and into the oceans. There is also the impact of habitat loss due to human population explosion. Habitat loss, introduction of alien species and diseases, pouching, changing of living conditions to climate change - all of this means that we are living in a time when the extinction rate far surpasses the background rate. ""Right now, in the amazing mment that to us counts as the present, we are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will forever be closed.""Quite possibly, we are sawing off the branch we sit on. It's likely that our ""weedy species"" will be its own undoing. Life is resilient, but within limits. Life would also surely bound back eventually, long after the last descendant of bipedal, hairless apes have vanished.This is a highly informative, well-written and captivating book. It explains the earlier big exctinctions and why there is one caused by us, happening now. It is a complex topic and this journalist does a job of presenting the facts in an understandable manner. I happened to read in a newspaper while reading this book, that just in England, 421 species have been lost in 200 years. This isn't propaganda - this is really happening. Highly recommended."

Unfortunately, I struggled with finishing it and walked away from it several times before I finally finished. Despite my statements, I want to make it clear that my failure to enjoy this book had nothing to do with the quality of the writing. It was clear that Ms. Kolbert spent a great deal of time researching.. traveling to various habitats for a first hand observation of the species which have already disappeared and the ones who are on the brink. She obtained an enormous amount of information from various scientists and even provided photographs. I simply found that the book could not hold my attention. Perhaps if I had more of a knowledge base in animal biology, botany and environmental science, I could have enjoyed this book more than I did. Or perhaps if I had just put it aside to come back to it at a later time, I would have gotten more out of it… regardless, the book just did not hold my interest. That said, I would not discourage anyone else from reading the book. The failure to enjoy was mine. "

The book covers a lot of ground, from Georges Cuvier, Darwin, to modern day ecology and conservations, from arctic to tropical rain forests, from national parks to zoos. I've learned lot of about extinctions in the earth history and the current ongoing extinction—the sixth extinction that is solely humans' doing. Perhaps the reason that we, homo sapiens, have become the dominate species of the world, is the same reason that will cause our own eventual extinction."
51,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-shakespeareandspice,4,I read this all in one go because I knew multiple pauses would likely just extend the misery. It’s particularly hard to read a book such as this knowing things will likely only get worse with the donkey that is our President leading one of the world’s most powerful nations. We’re talking billions of lives. And millions of species. Including us.

It’s a riveting topic, the history of our world and our species, and Elizabeth Kolbert has the knack of writing about science so it retains all its natural fascination while still being accessible to laypeople. She takes the reader with her back in time and around the world as she accompanies researchers in places ranging from the Andes mountains to the Great Barrier Reef. One particular fact has really stuck with me--as human activity increasingly homogenizes the global environment by transporting plants and animals all over the planet biodiversity is increasing on the small scale, so that where you live is likely to have more species than it did formerly, but because invasive flora and fauna can wipe out native plants and animals global biodiversity is rapidly shrinking as the total number of species on the Earth continues to dwindle. And that’s the point of the title, The Sixth Extinction. There have been five periods of mass extinction on our planet and some scientists are finding evidence indicating that we may be on the cusp of or even in the midst of a sixth wave of mass die offs, this one caused by the activities of humans, a chilling realization."
53,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'The Sixth Extinction' is written like a magazine article for a general reader, yet it tells intelligently an engaging true science story about several various geological locations important to the history of the scientific discoveries about evolution and extinction. The author personally visits and describes sites around the world - islands, forests, oceans, caves, museums - some of which take a lot of effort and discomfort to reach. These particular locations have a huge importance because each site is where an 'eureka!' moment occurred for a scientist who was often there for a different reason, but then he discovered something else instead; something which ended in clearing up everything confusing or wrong about our understanding of how the earth's climate changed in the past and is changing now. The discovery that the macro-climate can change on earth, and has apparently changed five times previously, and that these macro-climate changes also appear to be linked to changes in local animals and plants as well. It took time before everyone accepted the evidence presented that the earth and its environment has changed dramatically several times, and even longer for scientists to agree what the evidence signified. Early scientists had to not only accept the evidence of their own eyes and discoveries, they had to overcome biblical teachings which had told them the earth cannot change because it must be as perfect as the god who created it 6,000 years previously. These early struggles with the Church in interpreting physical clues are what led to the 'scientific method' of proving beyond doubt the conclusions reached from actually studying physical discoveries and not relying on religious beliefs from ancient scriptures. (One of the Church's precepts was everything on earth was unchanging and perfect. The fact that animals could die off as a species and disappear permanently from the face of the earth, or even worse, evolve, was not a possibility if the Church or the bible was correct. In time, the preponderance of the physical evidence overwhelmed the bible's myths. The author hints at the scientific disarray in accepting the facts of living creatures changing and disappearing because of the rigid philosophical belief in an unchanging world, but she does not dive into the religious elements which delayed the conclusions from scientific discoveries.)I found the book easy to read and understand. The facts and history of the concepts of evolution and climate change are conversationally and logically introduced. It deepened my understanding of how the scientists know climate changed billions of years ago and is changing now, and how they know the current change is already affecting life dramatically. Instead of jargon, you'll be able to speak it in plain English.The three issues the author gently exposes, after unobtrusively teaching us history, is how Humanity is involved, perhaps primarily responsible, in the current sixth ongoing climate change because: one, of our restless traveling around the world transporting, mostly unwisely, other life forms; as well as two, the CO2 we are pumping into the air from our gasoline-fueled cars and coal burning for electrical energy, which is changing (killing) the seas, trees/forests and wildlife the world over; and our extermination of animals in hunting for food, fun and profit (animals affect the type and quantity/quality of plants in their environment through their activities and nutritional needs, and by the symbiotic or otherwise interested neighbor animals who want to live close to their prey food). Your grandkids may not grow up with the trees, insects or local neighborhood wild animals and birds you did, or have cheap water to drink or cheap electricity to run their devices. The air certainly will be different.After finishing this book, you might want to look at a fiction novel, The Road. Warning: it's an extremely terrifying look at living in a world utterly wrecked environmentally, and it had me in tears.The following opinions are all me, and not in this science book. I think we will be the first species in earth's history that had the power to destroy AND save the earth, as well as ourselves, but we couldn't focus. Instead, we chose to party on: 1. hunt and kill off the last mega fauna like rhinoceroses and sharks to eat their horns/fins for that important personal 15-minute sexual erection; 2. cut down the annoying mega-flora for more houses and cheap furniture and better views; 3. put personal mega-billions of capital to work as investments in dozens of mansions/property around the world (plus living in one or three mansions isn't enough of an exercise of personal power, which is why the addition of environmentally controlled garages to house the yachts, the hundreds of 'antique' cars that will never be driven, to possess shoes, dresses and purses purchased for thousands of dollars each, etc. - conspicuous consumption being a tried-and-true method of relieving the boredom of wealth); 4. become socially powerful enough to manipulate/buy political votes to benefit/protect individual sources of capital; 5. use valuable resources to make war murder mayhem because of displaced aggression and blood lust; 6. make more babies because a priest/minister/Imam says god hates contraception (more mouths to feed, house and poop);7. For every facility which finally reduces their air/water/soil pollutants after decades of extended court fights, nine other facilities continue to pollute excessively around the world.8. and pray fruitlessly in religious rituals for a god to tell us our marching orders (which will never occur). We REALLY should be more environmentally responsible for our own self and the others who depend on us, but honestly? I don't think it's gonna happen. Anyone else notice, for example, how the local waters are too polluted for your kids to fish and swim in today, but you remember happily doing both safely? Anyone else notice how more flooding occurs in your neighborhood today? Anyone else notice how the local birds, bees and animal life have disappeared around your house? Anyone else notice the mountains of trash everywhere? Or the fouled beaches because the sewage treatment facility, overwhelmed again, had a spill? For the record, I believe we are doomed as a viable species. We don't seem to be able to overcome our DNA inheritance or be able to reprogram our animal brain desires for immediate emotional rush satisfactions. Our lusts for sex, social/tribal affiliation, personal power and self-aggrandizement, chocolate, drama, speed, explosions and killing things overwhelm our strengths in planning ahead, memory, intelligence, education, math and spatial skills, creativity, building tools, feelings that a single sacrifice for the many is worthy, love, affection, empathy, sharing the abundance and living in moderation. Our archaeological record, when it is dug up and discovered by the next species to rise to intelligence and tool-building a million years from now, after Homo sapiens has disappeared, will be condensed down to 'we coulda and we shoulda, but we didna'."

It's quite a topic - what we are doing to the world, and what we have done and what we are likely going to do. This mostly wasn't new information to me - but the acidification of the oceans was new. I mean I see the headlines and I know it's a issue, but I didn't understand the nature of it, or make the connection to shells and reefs.What I like about the book is, first of all, that it's getting read. The more people who read this the better. It's good information. Even well informed people don't generally grasp the scope and extent of what we are doing to our planet. She mixes in the dire future predictions, and the uncertainties of these, with lots of interesting historical details on science coming to terms with extinction, and other related topics. She covers in some detail three of the five major extinction events (why only three?) The problem with ocean acidification, in brief, is how it affects animals that secrete shells or any hard carbonate-mineral parts, especially in the common form of aragonite. This stuff dissolves in acid. The extra CO2 in the air leads to more of it getting absorbed into the ocean, and this makes the oceans more acidic. The acidity makes these hard parts more soluble, as in closer to actually dissolving, and therefore they become harder to make and animals make less of them. So, as the acidity increases, our corals start making less exoskeleton and eventually will just stop, meaning our coral reefs will die. We have made the oceans 40% more acidic then they were before the industrial revolution. My one complaint is that the book seems to target our emotions more than I'm comfortable with. It's really a borderline issue - unless you listen on audio. The reader, Anne Twomey, insanely over-dramatizes the book, weakening it the severely. It sounds like a bad psuedo-science show on a coming UFO invasion. (I did listen to sample before I purchased. There was a very passionate and professional reader. Only after I purchased did I learn that the sample was Kolbert herself, reading the prologue. Wish she had read the whole book.)We have all read plenty of everyone-should-read-this-book comments on important nonfiction books, and that does add a bit of discouragement into the encouragement. I hope the later overpowers the former. Everyone should be reading books like this."

Apart from the stereotypical acts of human depravity, there is also the passive damage inflicted on the natural world by our very existence. In Elizabeth Kolbert's outstanding The Sixth Extinction, the author writes in exceptionally readable and compelling language on a subject that is essential reading for members of our species.  Eschewing one particular approach to the depiction of extinction, Kolbert alternates the subjects of her chapters between multiple disciplines. History, geology, biology, ecology, and many other disciplines all make for a varied and hard-hitting treatise on the demise of the world's organisms. What's more, Kolbert breaks up her exposition with her experiences at the various places around earth on which she writes. These sections ground what can be very esoteric subject matter as the effects of these theories are seen through Kolbert's eyes. In a similar vein, Kolbert's aim with the book is not to accuse and depress, rather she seeks to educate the populace on the changes occurring on Earth. I have read many reviews that called this book depressing and guilt-inducing, however it was my feeling that the book maintains an upbeat, yet objective, tone throughout.  I am more likely to be found reading fiction than nonfiction; stories and characters have always interested me more than fact and figures. Perhaps it is that my professional days are filled with fact that I seek escape on my personal time. Despite this predilection for fiction, I am occasionally taken in by a nonfiction book and revel in the fashion the author arrives at their conclusion. The Sixth Extinction not only has the benefit of being one such book, it also has the prestige of being a book of great importance. If you're overwhelmed and unaffected by the media's liberal use of global warming, climate change, ocean acidification, and extinction events then this is exactly the book you should be reading. Its appeal is visceral as well as intellectual, and should be read by as many humans as possible. After all, we just happen to be the book's primary villains."

This non-fiction science book briefly covers the major and minor extinction cycles that have occured over the life of the planet, as well as current theories as to what caused them. The book is divided into 13 chapters, and each chapter deals with a specific current extinction, or near extinction, event. I loved the dots that this book connected for me. I loved that this current extinction cycle (clearly caused by Sapiens) is discussed in the context of the very long history of the planet. I loved learning about things I had no idea about, annual coral reef sex orgies comes to mind, and was saddened to learn about some of the species that have gone the way of the Dodo in my lifetime. I loved the science and learning about some scientists I knew nothing about. There is so much covered here, but all in a very accessible, easy to read manner. I am surprised that I was left with a feeling of hope at the end of this book. Not because I think that Humans will halt or reverse the processes we have put into play, but rather because after we become extinct, life will continue to find a way. Context is everything. I highly recommend this one."

So yeah, it felt like a timely choice!Fortunately for me, Adam, with his scientist mind, is more reserved in his judgment and optimistic in his outlook than I am.

There's something very magical about it, as if the planet is getting a good spring cleaning and all its inhabitants an urgently needed recalibrating of priorities. I love how people who do important jobs are suddenly getting all the love instead of narcissistic moronic reality TV celebrities and the like who had the limelight before. And the absence of cars, especially at night, is wonderful. The shot of the Himalayas visible from New Delhi for the first time in decades was especially poignant. And, on the whole, people are more friendly. There's a lot more generosity towards the poor. And so many health workers over here in the UK are of ethnic minority backgrounds that racism more than ever has been highlighted as the outlandish unforgivable expression of brute stupidity it is. The virus has made a nonsense of militant nationalism too. Takes a pandemic for most to understand that every border is in essence illusory; that we're all in this together. And how pettily absurd Brexit now seems. I hope this new generation will take on board this rejigging of social and ethical priorities and as a result be much more committed to looking after the planet.   Anyway, Elizabeth Kolbert in this book visits a series of research centres all over the globe, all with their own specialised subject, all charting and trying to prevent the sudden alarming demise of various species of mammal, bird, reptile and insect. She intersperses these individual and local sagas with an overview of how extinctions have occurred in the planet's history. Meticulously and convincingly she helps us to understand how quickly and carelessly we're heading towards the next big extinction, the first caused by humans. I liked this more than The Uninhabitable Earth because it's completely cleansed of the hellfire indignation which for me marred David Wallace-Wells' book."

You won’t be after you read this.Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it. To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly. Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.Harboring some hubris about your place in the world? Here’s a tonic:a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man—the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories—will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper.What else can I say about this book? The picture Kolbert paints of our situation is every bit as depressing as you might expect. I already knew the facts about climate change and animal extinction, but according to Kolbert the prognosis is even worse than I was aware, given that ocean acidification – “global warming’s ‘equally evil twin’” – is one contributor I hadn’t ever considered. Likewise, though I’d heard about the crisis with the world’s amphibians, I was entirely ignorant of the bat cataclysm (white-nose syndrome).As a longtime New Yorker journalist, Kolbert writes at a good level for laymen: not talking down, but not assuming any specialist knowledge either. I was somewhat unconvinced by her thematic, species-by-species approach here; it makes each chapter more like an individual essay than a part of a larger argument. Winging her way around the world (what carbon footprint?!), she considers auks and ammonites, mastodons and endangered zoo animals in captive breeding programs, dying coral reefs, and pockets of Amazonian rainforest. By the end, you’ll be in no doubt that we are in the middle of a major extinction event, and that our era will be known as the “Anthropocene” – the age of the influence of man.Luckily, there are spots of humor to lighten the tone, such as “The reason this book is being written by a hairy biped, rather than a scaly one, has more to do with dinosaurian misfortune than with any particular mammalian virtue.”As Caspar Henderson writes in his Guardian review, “The extinction crisis is so vast and complex that it almost repels thought. We need a lot more imaginative thinking about the choices we can make and what comes next.” Now that this has won a Pulitzer, one hopes it will get people talking and doing some of that imaginative thinking. Unfortunately, it’s so much easier to bury heads in the sand and keep going as we have been. Time will tell whether we heed the lessons of this book."

To the extent that we can identify the causes of these revolutions, they're highly varied: glaciation in the case of the ordovician extinction, global warming and chances in chemistry at the end of the Permian, an asteroid impact in the final seconds of the Cretaceous. The current extinction has its own novel cause: not an asteroid or a massive volcanic eruption but ""one weedy species. As Walter Alvarez put it to me, ""We're seeing right now that a mass extinction can be cause by human beings."" (265-266) ""With the capacity to represent the world in signs and symbols comes the capacity to change it, which as it happens, is also the capacity to destroy it. A ting set of genetic variations divides us from the Neanderthals, but that has made all the difference. (258)It isn't unique to note that humanity has dangerously altered the planet in a way that no other species before it has done as conclusively demonstrated by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. What makes this book not only important but a must-read is the case by case basis which she follows through with each chapter of extinct or near-to-extinct case studies of populations of animals, from the American Mastodon to the frogs of central Panama to the Sumatran Rhino. Because of the subject matter and the grand question of purpose among our own species, the ones before us, and the ones that will come after we're gone, this book is something that stays with the reader afterwards, pondering the grand invention of creation, evolution, and eventual disarray. The book provides a great overview of the subject matter that newcomers will find informative and enjoyable, and despite the information presented, does offer glimpses of hope and even humour. What is so fascinating about the subject matter is the concept of how life has survived and altered itself time after time on our bountiful rock, and how little we as a species really understand the world we have seemingly (or rather forcibly) inherited. It was only roughly 300 years ago that palaeontology began to take it's first steps as a major science with the discovery of mastodon bones in North America, and that whole different worlds existed before ours. It was only in 1831 that Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle and made his way around the world, specifically to the Galapagos, giving us terms in his ""On the Origins of Species"" that now represent mainstream science. Neanderthals only were discovered shorted after Darwin's voyage, and it was only in 2004 that a hobbit like humanoid species was discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia. How freaking amazing and unbelievable is that?It was interested to see Kolbert's travels around the globe, diving into the globalisation aspects of humanity that give us terms like ""New Pangaea,"" how bat populations in the Northeastern part of the US have dropped off significantly do to factors that bats elsewhere in the world are immune to, the investigation into rainforest populations in South America, and the incredible efforts scientists are doing to protect endangered species, like giving rhinos ultrasounds and crows handjobs. It's a tale of our grim actions, but the hopeful aspects of our understanding of the world that can add it. The choice is up to us as a species."

When authors put the story of scientific disciplines like physics, or chemistry or even biology into words and stories, they are translating something hard and complex and precise into a soft, fuzzy medium.It's analogous to knitting a replica of Michelangelo's David. Even if you are a genius knitter, the end result will only be (at best) a flabby simulacrum of the authentic object.If you experienced the knitted David (let's call him Dave) you would have a general, vague sense of what the real David was like. But you would be a long way away from really understanding the awe inspiring experience of the real deal.Let's take the analogy one step further. Imagine you're an alien, and you discovered the knitted Dave. But you had never seen the real David sculpture, or (more importantly) an actual human specimen. How much would you really understand about people, based on you're observations of the knitted Dave. You would have a very general sense. Enough to pick a hominid out of a crowd of donkeys. But that's about it. Better than nothing, but far from expertise. I love evolutionary biology and ecology and sociology. But I'm not trained in any of these disciplines. My understanding of them is via popularizations like this. Even within my discipline of clinical psychology, I'm barely educated. But outside of my discipline, I am essentially an enthusiastic dilettante. That's not a dis. That's just another way of saying, I haven't spent 4 years of undergraduate training to prepare for another 4 years of doctoral training to prepare for another 3-5 years of post doctoral training to prepare for another 10-20 years of professional research in any of those fields.Humans specialize. None of us could possibly be specialists in more than one or maybe two of these domains. There just isn't enough time in a human life span.I have a laypersons education of ecology and biology. That's nothing to scoff at. It took (literally) hundreds of hours of hard work, reading a bunch of books, taking classes, talking to experts etc. to gain my laypersons understanding of evolutionary biology. But honestly, I wouldn't know an actual darwinian algorithm from a hole in the ground, let alone be able to accurately interpret the findings of the mathematical models experts develop and use to understand complex systems like species population dynamics and ecosystems.So I have to rely on experts and science journalists to tell me the story in English. I need these dedicated, talented individuals to ""knit me a Dave"". That's exactly what Elizabeth Kolbert did. She knitted us a Dave. The Sixth Extinction is a soft, cuddly, children's storybook version of the hard, awful reality the actual experts in the field of biology and ecology are bearing witness to.If she had delivered us a harder version. It would have been (a) unintelligible to us mere mortals, and (b) so unspeakably awful, that most of us would have never, ever willingly subjected ourselves to this horrible, terrifying (much more than inconvenient) truth. Even the ""soft"" Dave version is pretty fucking tragic and demoralizing. If I were to give you a quick sketch analogy of what the knitted Dave of mass extinction looks like. Imagine a plush toy bat (flying mammal), stuffed with dead, decomposing frogs, with an invasive fungus choking his nostrils, literally starving to death, drooling acrid barren sea water and sputtering a creepy recorded (five nights at Freddie's) robot voice looping the phrase, ""we're all going to die a horrible, slow death, we're all going to suffocate in a giant cesspool of our own feces, and it's way too late to do anything about it"".Not exactly Tickle Me Elmo, but still, a very soft version of the reality.One can only imagine the horror that experts feel when they see entire species evaporate, or when they crunch the numbers and the results look like an ASCII skull and bones. You can imagine these nerdy bookworm types, realizing the awful reality and trying desperately to communicate the immense gravity of the situation to the stoners, jocks and rednecks who used to beat and torture them in high school, only to receive responses like ""The Bible says we can despoil the earth however we see fit"" or ""it's only a theory"" or ""not all scientists agree"" or ""it was cold for a few days this summer, so that proves global warming is a scam"".Even the most charismatic of the nerds, Think Neil Degrassi Tyson, Carl Sagan or Al Gore still only managed to capture the hearts and minds of ""egg head PBS types"", even when they limit their messages to what can be communicated via entertaining, schticky soundbites, Hollywood style computer animated visualizations and 30 minute PowerPoint slideshows.The Sixth Extinction goes at explaining the issue of the ecological disaster we currently find ourselves in by giving a brief history of the previous five mass extinction events that science has identified. Apparently global species population and diversity levels expand and contract regularly, but have dropped to next to nothing for various reasons thorough out the history of life on earth. The previous 5 mass extinction events are:1: the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event (occurring about 66 Ma) in which about 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. 2: the Triassic–Jurassic extinction (occurring about 201.3 Ma) in which about 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species went extinct.3: the Permian-Triassic transition. (occurring about 252 Ma). Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects).4: the Devonian Period (occurring 375–360 Ma), a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species.5: the Ordovician–Silurian extinction (occurring 450–440 Ma) killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.At one point, around 70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens almost went extinct. About 90% of us died. We got down to an estimated 40 breeding pairs. That's really close to extinction. But we showed em our bounce back stuff and boy look at us now!Now we're officially in the Holocene period (and have been for more than 10,000 years), but many scientists are pushing the point that we have officially exited the Holocene and entered an altogether new epoch that they are calling the Anthropocene. They argue that humans are having such a pronounced impact on the enviornment that we should be the titular species of this particular cene (hence the Anthro at the beginning of the word).They also argue that there is a new mass extinction event currently under way that may be the worst one yet. They are calling it the.... You guessed it....6: the Anthropocene extinction.That's awesome right? It's exciting to be a part of history. Even if it's potentially the end of it.Bad Boundaries:One of the salient points in the book is that global climate instability is not the only source of extinction. Another big problem happens when an ecosystems square footage is reduced or its boundaries are violated. Obviously deforestation is a huge problem. By making the rain forests land coverage smaller, it shrinks the biodiversity exponentially (there's that math stuff again). Apparently there's a formula for it that calculates the extinction rates as you down scale an environment. It's like the E=Mc2 of the apocalypse.But globalization is also a huge problem in that it introduces invasive species like rats into sensitive environments. Apparently rats have been hitching rides on boats for as long as people of been sailing.Invasive species can literally crash an ecology. In the book, Kolbert discusses a species of gray snake that was introduced to an island echo system that basically ate everything. It reduced to a tropical island full of pretty birds, lizards and bugs to pretty much just only snakes.Kolbert makes the gorgeous point that it's easy to vilify the little grey snake. But the snake isn't mean or immoral, it's amoral, meaning it's It's simply doing what it's hardwired to do. It's just trying to survive and reproduce. The Ultimate Invasive Species:In case you're wondering where this is going, the ultimate invasive species is us. Humans go just about everywhere And everywhere that humans go, almost everything else dies. It's not that were mean or immoral, were actually amoral in the same way the grey snake is. We're simply doing we're all hardwired to do. Survive and reproduce (with obvious exceptions, but not enough to make a critical difference).We like to hold ourselves to moral standards, and vilify some bad guys e.g. Dick Cheney (I'm not saying he's not, but just hear me out).The fact of the matter is, the Anthropocene extinction isn't happening because we're immoral. It's happening because we're amoral.It may seem like I'm splitting hairs but the distinction is important.Perhaps viewing ourselves as moral, and holding ourselves and others to standards of morality is part of the problem. Perhaps framing this ecological crisis as a moral issue is creating a fatal blind spot. Perhaps experimental psychology can be of assistance in explaining my point.Don't Diss Me:Cognitive dissonance is the very reliably observed psychological phenomena, whereby people (including you me and everybody we know) confabulate anxiety reducing fictions when confronted with our own amoral behavior.So in other words, when people realize that their behavior is incongruent with their values, they feel bad, but rather than change the behavior, they make up a story (no matter how absurd) that relieves them of the pain of their own hypocrisy. For example, consider a situation in which someone who places a value on being environmentally responsible just purchased a cool new chick magnet car that he later discovers is a gas guzzler.The conflict:It is important for the man to be (at least viewed as) a good steward of the environment. But he is now driving a babe getting machine that also happens to double as an earth warmer.As you can imagine, he's feeling rather conflicted about now. Drive a Prius and die a childless and alone, or drive the Maserati and repopulate Brentwood. In order to reduce the dissonance between his values and his behavior, he can (a) utilize public transportation more frequently (which is probably not going to happen, maybe in Seattle, not in L.A.), or he could (b) sell the car and purchase another one that gets better gas mileage (which, again, not hugely probable), or he could (c) convince himself that maybe all the global warming stuff is a little overblown, and one little Maserati aint gona kill nobody (which is a whole lot easier than option (a) or (b), and therefore pretty fucking likely).I know what you're thinking, ""other people do that, but I don't do that"". But you do, we all do, we just don't realize it. That's why they call it a blind spot.It sounds far fetched but cognitive dissonance has been observed in tightly controlled experiments again and again. Everyone does it. Even (no particularly) if you're a trained mental health professional,So maybe if we stop viewing the ecology issue moralistically, and start viewing it more pragmatically, than perhaps we can all stop pointing fingers and except the fact that we're all totally fucked and were going to die and there's noting we can do about it.No no. Of course there's something we can do about it. But we really need to accept that it's happening. Accept that were all complicit (even if you recycle), and then....I actually don't know what. But something I hope. Additionally, all of us regular people need to trust the experts. We may get a cold day in August and think we're all good. But that's not how this shit works. You have to do math and stuff. And odds are great that you don't. So trust the people that do and just do what they tell you. Even if you love Jesus. Which you probably don't if you're still reading this.Lastly, it occurred to me that I'm not going to face the worst of this, and my kid won't either, but her kids (should she ignore reason and reproduce) will. I'll just be honest here. Part of me has a hard time worrying past next week. And that same part of me kind of thinks, what ever, I'll be dead by then, and I know I'm not alone in this particular brand of denial. Cognitive dissonance ladies and gentlemen, don't let it win."
65,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2184529-justin-evans,3,"I'm glad this book was published, and glad it got so much attention. On the other hand, I wish it had been much better. The first half is solid, inasmuch as it has some information about the history, and historiography, of extinction. The second half gets a little head-banging-against-a-wall, with example after example of currently endangered or recently extinct species, all told in the same palatable way. So, beware reader, that if you are like me, you might want to skip this book. It goes to great lengths to be entertaining, but entertaining in a very New Yorker kind of way. We learn more, I would guess, about the appearance and dress of the scientists Kolbert meets than we do about the extinctions she describes. We hear a lot about how people feel. We get a lot of novelistic realism about animal's rumps. And I just don't care. So frustrated was I by Kolbert's presentation of genuinely disturbing events that I started to think what a counter-argument might look like. Here are a couple: i) Kolbert pushes the 'anthropocene' (i.e., the 'geological' epoch determined by the existence of humanity and our destruction of other species) into the *very* distant past, roughly, when the indigenous peoples of Australia first killed off the continent's mega-fauna. But it is utterly ridiculous to liken prehistoric, and 20th and 21st century, human impact on the environment. Not to put too fine a point on it, back then we were just another species, though a successful one. Today, we run the planet. Eliding that difference makes it impossible to recognize what has caused the vast majority of extinctions over the last two centuries, viz., uncontrolled economic development. That's an argument I believe. The next one I'm not so sure about, but I do think there's a case to be answered: ii) Extinction is a natural occurrence. Granted that it's greatly accelerated over the last couple of centuries, but really, why worry so much? What moral obligation do we have towards *species*, as opposed to *living individuals*? If you have to kill a hundred foxes to reintroduce a threatened species into their previously natural environment, is that really a moral thing to do? What about the foxes' lives, after all? And so on. This book doesn't deal with such problems, but then, it wasn't meant to. It is entertaining propaganda, and good on Kolbert for bringing the issues up in the first place. "

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human. (watch here"

""To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more or were willing to make sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter when lather people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.""Does it mean that any conservation effort is for naught? Have we crossed a threshold that we cannot uncross? Not sure. Very likely you won't be either after reading it.Lots to chew on here - not all that pleasant either. This book had me googling left and right to find more information and learn more. This is one I will be thinking about for a long time to come."

I have not been this disappointed in a book in a long while. More than a quarter of the length of the book was dedicated to notes. She touched on history as archeology has helped define it with reference to the past extinctions. I think, because she was being a writer, she needed to tell me things I didn't care to know, like what she and her research mates had for breakfast before they set out to discover whether or not a particular bug was or was not extinct.So here's the big spoiler alert.....she said humans were well on the way to an extinction and we were bringing it on ourselves. The sixth extinction is us. The one high point of the book for me was that she did not....to my memory....suggest that we could change things before it's too late. It seems to me she's saying it is already too late. There are just too many of us shitting in our own nest.....Michael"

70,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,4,"Elizabeth Kolbert knows how to put things together. She managed to create a very thoroughly documented book and to raise awareness about the extinction of species.The five extinctions known in the history of Earth decimated the species up to 96% (a brief summary can be read here: https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontol...)The sixth extinction here in question is named so because of the rate at which species are disappearing now:
“Calculating the background extinction rate is a laborious task that entails combing through whole databases’ worth of fossils. For what’s probably the best-studied group, which is mammals, it’s been reckoned to be roughly .25 per million species-years. This means that, since there are about fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around today, at the background extinction rate you’d expect—once again, very roughly—one species to disappear every seven hundred years.A rigorous calculation of the background extinction rate for amphibians has not been performed, in part because amphibian fossils are so rare. Almost certainly, though, the rate is lower than it is for mammals. Probably, one amphibian species should go extinct every thousand years or so.Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world’s most endangered class of animals; it’s been calculated that the group’s extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.”
And we, humans, are to blame here. The book has plenty of examples in which we exterminated a lot of species: the one concerning the great auk is so heart-breaking depicted. I do hope this book to be read by as many people as possible and maybe something in our collective mentality will change. We are just one species among so many other and just because we are more intelligent than the others (debatable from my point of view) does not make us owners of this planet and its life forms.
”In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us? One possibility—the possibility implied by the Hall of Biodiversity—is that we, too, will eventually be undone by our “transformation of the ecological landscape.” The logic behind this way of thinking runs as follows: having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth’s biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems—cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans—we’re putting our own survival in danger.”
It is not an easy book but it is definitely worth reading."
71,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches. - Stanford ecologist Paul EhrlichAs far as science has been able to determine, there have been five mass extinctions of life on Earth in the history of our planet. The first of these occurred at the end of the Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era about 450 million years ago. The second occurred less than 100 million years later in the late Devonian period. There followed the End-Permian extinction of some 250 million years ago, the Late Triassic extinction of 200 million years ago, and finally, the last one and the one we are most familiar with, the End-Cretaceous extinction which occurred about 65 million years ago. That's the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. (Well, almost - except for the ancestors of birds.)The best evidence seems to indicate that all of these extinctions except for the last one were the result of climatological events, often relatively sudden events to which plants and animals did not have time to adapt. The cause of the fifth one was also a change in climate but it was brought about by a collision with an asteroid. That cataclysmic event so altered the climate of the planet for a time that many, many species died out either suddenly or over a period of years.Scientists believe that we are now in the midst of the sixth extinction which Earth has endured and that this extinction is entirely human-caused. Elizabeth Kolbert writes in this book about how our species has altered life on the planet as no other species has before. It's not just that we are changing the climate for the worse, although that certainly is a big part of it, but we also have altered the face of Earth and the chemistry of the oceans to the detriment of very many species.One of the biggest problems that we have created for other species is simply the fact that we move everything around and wherever we go on Earth, it seems that some species hitch a ride with us. So a species from Asia that would never under normal circumstances make it to the Americas is brought here either wittingly or unwittingly and it wreaks havoc. Kolbert points out that the most endangered family of animals on Earth today are the amphibians. They are being wiped out by a fungus that has been spread around the world by humans. Kolbert writes about a dozen species, some of them already irrevocably lost and others on their way out. Through these very personal stories of that wonderful bird the Great Auk, the Panamanian golden frog, staghorn coral, the Sumatran rhino and others, the reader is moved to begin to understand the enormity of what is happening. What we are causing to happen to our world. It is somewhat surprising to learn that the concept of extinction is not a very old one. Kolbert points out that it was first articulated by Georges Cuvier in the revolutionary Paris of the 18th century. As always it seems, with any new scientific idea or concept, it took a while for it to be accepted, but later work by paleontologists has confirmed Cuvier's findings.This is a well-written book which can popularize scientific concepts and principles for a mass audience. It is an easy read and a fairly short one at less than 300 pages. Kolbert includes extensive notes and bibliography for those who wish to read more on the subject."
72,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17061542-zoe-s-human,4,"I learned many new things and I laughed a few times as well. That's pretty much a win for non-fiction. Humanity's impact on the environment tends to either be presented in a deliberately polarizing manner for political reasons or presented with assumptions of scientific knowledge which most lack. The author did an amazing job of explaining the science behind the impact in layman's terms without omitting details that frequently don't make ""news"" stories on the topic. She even took the time to explain how mistakes and theory discrepancies happen in science. Even better, she did all of this calmly by presenting facts and logic without resorting to emotional manipulation.I loved the inclusion of small personal notes about the assorted scientists featured. While such asides don't contribute to the main premise of the book, they do make it much more engaging. Between that and her wonderful descriptive style, I found myself able to visualize her experiences and environments with a fullness usually only found in fiction.There are two things which would have greatly enhanced my pleasure in this book. An insert of color photos of the assorted plants and animals discussed would be awesome. I did Google quite a bit while reading this and it would have been preferable to have photos right in the book.Additionally, a chart/timeline depicting the assorted eras and epochs mentioned in chronological order with dates and maybe a few sample organisms listed for each section would have been great. Perhaps with the mass extinctions and suggested range for the anthropocene marked as well? As clear as her explanations were, some information processes better in images than text.Things I think should be changed before the final release:The graph on page 16 is hella blurry.On page 46 at the end of chapter 2, she first mentions that the megafauna extinction is becoming understood as being the result of the spread of modern humans. No specifics are gone into on this until page 230. This left me wary that she was going to start making assertions without any kind of backup in the beginning of the book and I felt a bit weirded out all the way through the book by that hanging thread even when it became clear that she was validating her beliefs with facts. As a reader, it would have been better for that statement to have been omitted in chapter 2 if it wasn't going to be developed for almost 200 pages. At the very least, it should be noted that it will be expanded upon later in the book.Page 86, line 19, the paragraph that starts with ""The bolide arrived from the southeast..."" I'm assuming that ""doe to its trajectory"" (later in that paragraph) should read due ""to its trajectory.""The last sentence on 113 going over to page 114 reads ""Change the atmosphere's composition atmosphere..."" Is that right? It seems like the second atmosphere is superfluous or at least awkward.I would omit the bit about the gift shop cashier not showing Ms. Kolbert around from page 226. It comes across petty and unflattering to the author. Even if there were no other customers, it's a given in *any* clerking job that you don't leave the shop unattended. You can get fired for that.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway. Many thanks to all involved in providing me with this opportunity."

In the pages that follow, I try to convey both sides: the excitement of what's being learned as well as the horror of it."" (3)Mission accomplished. I learned something, and I felt something.Kolbert writes scientific journalism with the best of them and here she distills a lot of contemporary findings into easily conveyed factoids for the layperson. She tells a dynamic story but with very little pearl-clutching. She's largely neutral in her presentation, though she doesn't shy away from the (well-supported and widely accepted) thesis that it's human activity that's effected the climate change resulting in subsequent extinctions and a vast reduction to Earth's biodiversity. Maybe it's too late for us to halt the sweeping global change humankind has generated, but like it or not it's inexcusable to not pay attention and not learn about it. And those skeptical or uninterested in hearing anyone try to cram environmentalism down their throat with a lot of moralizing needn't fear. There are many chapters that focus on other, nonhuman catastrophes and extinction events, how they were discovered and how they shaped modern scientific thought and theory.And stylistically, her prose is entertaining and never dull. Just one example:When I visited Reserve 1202, I ran into a graduate student from Portugal who was surveying bats. At noon he had just recently woken up and was eating pasta in a shed that served as a research station-cum-kitchen. While we were talking, a very skinny cowboy rode up on an only slightly less skinny horse. He had a rifle slung over one shoulder. I wasn't sure whether he'd come because he'd heard the truck I'd arrived on and wanted to protect the student from possible intruders, or because he sensed that there was pasta. (174)5 stars out of 5. Informative and entertaining. A big win for popular science fans."

Exploring the other five extinctions in the past and comparing them to the current destruction of the biosphere is sobering. It is unclear whether the sixth will surpass the other five (each extinction had its own pathology) or if we will survive the catastrophe we created but it is not pleasant to read about. This is one of those books that reminds the reader that it is worse than you think by far. I am not sure how to read the forensics of armageddon being shielded from nature by modern life, one will put this book down and pick up another at least until the resources run out. What books like this usually elicit are deer in the headlights paralysis or ostrich-like behavior or a shrug of the shoulders. Kind of strange the way we respond selectively to threats.

We have to try and minimize the damage, the challenge will be beyond difficult, but it is a noble goal. "

I want to not feel that the earth is so doomed by our simply negligent hand. I want to write a series of children’s stories teaching them about the Frozen Zoo, and the drones that leads new flocks of birds in the wild to repopulate and make sure they land on safe ground, and apes that are domesticating dogs, that make tools, that every day we learn they are just a bit smarter than we thought. This is a horror story through and through about the changes going on in this world because of how we live our lives, because of how homo sapiens have ALWAYS lived their lives even before we started burning fossil fuels and putting pesticide on everything. I want to go on a tour and shake the hand of everyone working desperately to create safety arks for animals that we are abandoning by our own callousness. I want to visit these refuges and revel in them, and then leave, hopefully, with no trace of ever having been there.And now, I’ll just let the book speak for itself. The only thing I could have asked for it is that for it to be longer. “One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is that the world is changing in ways that compel species to move, and another is that it’s changing in ways that create barriers—roads, clear-cuts, cities—that prevent them from doing so.”“By burning through coal and oil deposits, humans are putting carbon back into the air that has been sequestered for tens—in most cases hundreds—of millions of years. In the process, we are running geologic history not only in reverse but at warp speed.” The anthropologist Richard Leakey has warned that “Homo sapiens might not only be the agent of the sixth extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.” A sign in the Hall of Biodiversity offers a quote from the Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich: IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” “coral cover in the Caribbean has in recent decades declined by close to eighty percent.”“Asian elephants have declined by fifty percent over the last three generations.” “some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere.” “WHY is ocean acidification so dangerous? The question is tough to answer only because the list of reasons is so long. Depending on how tightly organisms are able to regulate their internal chemistry, acidification may affect such basic processes as metabolism, enzyme activity, and protein function. Because it will” "

Interesting book to give you some facts on the previous mass extinctions on Earth, as well as information about the one we are currently in and of which we (more than) seem to be responsible."

In South America they're all succumbing to an introduced disease. One of the problems with the global world we live in is mobility - we bring species that would normally never had a chance of contact together. Diseases can spread world-wide in a manner that was unthinkable just a few hundred years ago. It's not just the frogs. In North America, the bat population has dropped to next to nothing due to a fungi from Europe, with which European bats live quite happily, but which kill their American counterparts by the millions.""In times of extreme stress, the whole concept of fitness, at least in a Darwinian sense, loses its meaning: how could a creature be adapter, either well or ill, for conditions it has never before encountered in its entire evolutionary history?"" Then theres's the human induced global warming caused by billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere and into the oceans. There is also the impact of habitat loss due to human population explosion. Habitat loss, introduction of alien species and diseases, pouching, changing of living conditions to climate change - all of this means that we are living in a time when the extinction rate far surpasses the background rate. ""Right now, in the amazing mment that to us counts as the present, we are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will forever be closed.""Quite possibly, we are sawing off the branch we sit on. It's likely that our ""weedy species"" will be its own undoing. Life is resilient, but within limits. Life would also surely bound back eventually, long after the last descendant of bipedal, hairless apes have vanished.This is a highly informative, well-written and captivating book. It explains the earlier big exctinctions and why there is one caused by us, happening now. It is a complex topic and this journalist does a job of presenting the facts in an understandable manner. I happened to read in a newspaper while reading this book, that just in England, 421 species have been lost in 200 years. This isn't propaganda - this is really happening. Highly recommended."
79,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene,3," This book was recommended on many lists last year and I had such high hopes when I started reading it. Unfortunately, I struggled with finishing it and walked away from it several times before I finally finished. Despite my statements, I want to make it clear that my failure to enjoy this book had nothing to do with the quality of the writing. It was clear that Ms. Kolbert spent a great deal of time researching.. traveling to various habitats for a first hand observation of the species which have already disappeared and the ones who are on the brink. She obtained an enormous amount of information from various scientists and even provided photographs. I simply found that the book could not hold my attention. Perhaps if I had more of a knowledge base in animal biology, botany and environmental science, I could have enjoyed this book more than I did. Or perhaps if I had just put it aside to come back to it at a later time, I would have gotten more out of it… regardless, the book just did not hold my interest. That said, I would not discourage anyone else from reading the book. The failure to enjoy was mine. "

The book covers a lot of ground, from Georges Cuvier, Darwin, to modern day ecology and conservations, from arctic to tropical rain forests, from national parks to zoos. I've learned lot of about extinctions in the earth history and the current ongoing extinction—the sixth extinction that is solely humans' doing. Perhaps the reason that we, homo sapiens, have become the dominate species of the world, is the same reason that will cause our own eventual extinction."
81,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-shakespeareandspice,4,I read this all in one go because I knew multiple pauses would likely just extend the misery. It’s particularly hard to read a book such as this knowing things will likely only get worse with the donkey that is our President leading one of the world’s most powerful nations. We’re talking billions of lives. And millions of species. Including us.
82,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"It sounds strange to say I enjoyed reading this book about the increasingly profound and potentially devastating impact humans are having on our home planet, with an especial focus on the animals and plants who share Earth with us, but enjoy it I did. It’s a riveting topic, the history of our world and our species, and Elizabeth Kolbert has the knack of writing about science so it retains all its natural fascination while still being accessible to laypeople. She takes the reader with her back in time and around the world as she accompanies researchers in places ranging from the Andes mountains to the Great Barrier Reef. One particular fact has really stuck with me--as human activity increasingly homogenizes the global environment by transporting plants and animals all over the planet biodiversity is increasing on the small scale, so that where you live is likely to have more species than it did formerly, but because invasive flora and fauna can wipe out native plants and animals global biodiversity is rapidly shrinking as the total number of species on the Earth continues to dwindle. And that’s the point of the title, The Sixth Extinction. There have been five periods of mass extinction on our planet and some scientists are finding evidence indicating that we may be on the cusp of or even in the midst of a sixth wave of mass die offs, this one caused by the activities of humans, a chilling realization."
83,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'The Sixth Extinction' is written like a magazine article for a general reader, yet it tells intelligently an engaging true science story about several various geological locations important to the history of the scientific discoveries about evolution and extinction. The author personally visits and describes sites around the world - islands, forests, oceans, caves, museums - some of which take a lot of effort and discomfort to reach. These particular locations have a huge importance because each site is where an 'eureka!' moment occurred for a scientist who was often there for a different reason, but then he discovered something else instead; something which ended in clearing up everything confusing or wrong about our understanding of how the earth's climate changed in the past and is changing now. The discovery that the macro-climate can change on earth, and has apparently changed five times previously, and that these macro-climate changes also appear to be linked to changes in local animals and plants as well. It took time before everyone accepted the evidence presented that the earth and its environment has changed dramatically several times, and even longer for scientists to agree what the evidence signified. Early scientists had to not only accept the evidence of their own eyes and discoveries, they had to overcome biblical teachings which had told them the earth cannot change because it must be as perfect as the god who created it 6,000 years previously. These early struggles with the Church in interpreting physical clues are what led to the 'scientific method' of proving beyond doubt the conclusions reached from actually studying physical discoveries and not relying on religious beliefs from ancient scriptures. (One of the Church's precepts was everything on earth was unchanging and perfect. The fact that animals could die off as a species and disappear permanently from the face of the earth, or even worse, evolve, was not a possibility if the Church or the bible was correct. In time, the preponderance of the physical evidence overwhelmed the bible's myths. The author hints at the scientific disarray in accepting the facts of living creatures changing and disappearing because of the rigid philosophical belief in an unchanging world, but she does not dive into the religious elements which delayed the conclusions from scientific discoveries.)I found the book easy to read and understand. The facts and history of the concepts of evolution and climate change are conversationally and logically introduced. It deepened my understanding of how the scientists know climate changed billions of years ago and is changing now, and how they know the current change is already affecting life dramatically. Instead of jargon, you'll be able to speak it in plain English.The three issues the author gently exposes, after unobtrusively teaching us history, is how Humanity is involved, perhaps primarily responsible, in the current sixth ongoing climate change because: one, of our restless traveling around the world transporting, mostly unwisely, other life forms; as well as two, the CO2 we are pumping into the air from our gasoline-fueled cars and coal burning for electrical energy, which is changing (killing) the seas, trees/forests and wildlife the world over; and our extermination of animals in hunting for food, fun and profit (animals affect the type and quantity/quality of plants in their environment through their activities and nutritional needs, and by the symbiotic or otherwise interested neighbor animals who want to live close to their prey food). Your grandkids may not grow up with the trees, insects or local neighborhood wild animals and birds you did, or have cheap water to drink or cheap electricity to run their devices. The air certainly will be different.After finishing this book, you might want to look at a fiction novel, The Road. Warning: it's an extremely terrifying look at living in a world utterly wrecked environmentally, and it had me in tears.The following opinions are all me, and not in this science book. I think we will be the first species in earth's history that had the power to destroy AND save the earth, as well as ourselves, but we couldn't focus. Instead, we chose to party on: 1. hunt and kill off the last mega fauna like rhinoceroses and sharks to eat their horns/fins for that important personal 15-minute sexual erection; 2. cut down the annoying mega-flora for more houses and cheap furniture and better views; 3. put personal mega-billions of capital to work as investments in dozens of mansions/property around the world (plus living in one or three mansions isn't enough of an exercise of personal power, which is why the addition of environmentally controlled garages to house the yachts, the hundreds of 'antique' cars that will never be driven, to possess shoes, dresses and purses purchased for thousands of dollars each, etc. - conspicuous consumption being a tried-and-true method of relieving the boredom of wealth); 4. become socially powerful enough to manipulate/buy political votes to benefit/protect individual sources of capital; 5. use valuable resources to make war murder mayhem because of displaced aggression and blood lust; 6. make more babies because a priest/minister/Imam says god hates contraception (more mouths to feed, house and poop);7. For every facility which finally reduces their air/water/soil pollutants after decades of extended court fights, nine other facilities continue to pollute excessively around the world.8. and pray fruitlessly in religious rituals for a god to tell us our marching orders (which will never occur). We REALLY should be more environmentally responsible for our own self and the others who depend on us, but honestly? I don't think it's gonna happen. Anyone else notice, for example, how the local waters are too polluted for your kids to fish and swim in today, but you remember happily doing both safely? Anyone else notice how more flooding occurs in your neighborhood today? Anyone else notice how the local birds, bees and animal life have disappeared around your house? Anyone else notice the mountains of trash everywhere? Or the fouled beaches because the sewage treatment facility, overwhelmed again, had a spill? For the record, I believe we are doomed as a viable species. We don't seem to be able to overcome our DNA inheritance or be able to reprogram our animal brain desires for immediate emotional rush satisfactions. Our lusts for sex, social/tribal affiliation, personal power and self-aggrandizement, chocolate, drama, speed, explosions and killing things overwhelm our strengths in planning ahead, memory, intelligence, education, math and spatial skills, creativity, building tools, feelings that a single sacrifice for the many is worthy, love, affection, empathy, sharing the abundance and living in moderation. Our archaeological record, when it is dug up and discovered by the next species to rise to intelligence and tool-building a million years from now, after Homo sapiens has disappeared, will be condensed down to 'we coulda and we shoulda, but we didna'."

It's quite a topic - what we are doing to the world, and what we have done and what we are likely going to do. This mostly wasn't new information to me - but the acidification of the oceans was new. I mean I see the headlines and I know it's a issue, but I didn't understand the nature of it, or make the connection to shells and reefs.What I like about the book is, first of all, that it's getting read. The more people who read this the better. It's good information. Even well informed people don't generally grasp the scope and extent of what we are doing to our planet. She mixes in the dire future predictions, and the uncertainties of these, with lots of interesting historical details on science coming to terms with extinction, and other related topics. She covers in some detail three of the five major extinction events (why only three?) The problem with ocean acidification, in brief, is how it affects animals that secrete shells or any hard carbonate-mineral parts, especially in the common form of aragonite. This stuff dissolves in acid. The extra CO2 in the air leads to more of it getting absorbed into the ocean, and this makes the oceans more acidic. The acidity makes these hard parts more soluble, as in closer to actually dissolving, and therefore they become harder to make and animals make less of them. So, as the acidity increases, our corals start making less exoskeleton and eventually will just stop, meaning our coral reefs will die. We have made the oceans 40% more acidic then they were before the industrial revolution. My one complaint is that the book seems to target our emotions more than I'm comfortable with. It's really a borderline issue - unless you listen on audio. The reader, Anne Twomey, insanely over-dramatizes the book, weakening it the severely. It sounds like a bad psuedo-science show on a coming UFO invasion. (I did listen to sample before I purchased. There was a very passionate and professional reader. Only after I purchased did I learn that the sample was Kolbert herself, reading the prologue. Wish she had read the whole book.)We have all read plenty of everyone-should-read-this-book comments on important nonfiction books, and that does add a bit of discouragement into the encouragement. I hope the later overpowers the former. Everyone should be reading books like this."

Apart from the stereotypical acts of human depravity, there is also the passive damage inflicted on the natural world by our very existence. In Elizabeth Kolbert's outstanding The Sixth Extinction, the author writes in exceptionally readable and compelling language on a subject that is essential reading for members of our species.  Eschewing one particular approach to the depiction of extinction, Kolbert alternates the subjects of her chapters between multiple disciplines. History, geology, biology, ecology, and many other disciplines all make for a varied and hard-hitting treatise on the demise of the world's organisms. What's more, Kolbert breaks up her exposition with her experiences at the various places around earth on which she writes. These sections ground what can be very esoteric subject matter as the effects of these theories are seen through Kolbert's eyes. In a similar vein, Kolbert's aim with the book is not to accuse and depress, rather she seeks to educate the populace on the changes occurring on Earth. I have read many reviews that called this book depressing and guilt-inducing, however it was my feeling that the book maintains an upbeat, yet objective, tone throughout.  I am more likely to be found reading fiction than nonfiction; stories and characters have always interested me more than fact and figures. Perhaps it is that my professional days are filled with fact that I seek escape on my personal time. Despite this predilection for fiction, I am occasionally taken in by a nonfiction book and revel in the fashion the author arrives at their conclusion. The Sixth Extinction not only has the benefit of being one such book, it also has the prestige of being a book of great importance. If you're overwhelmed and unaffected by the media's liberal use of global warming, climate change, ocean acidification, and extinction events then this is exactly the book you should be reading. Its appeal is visceral as well as intellectual, and should be read by as many humans as possible. After all, we just happen to be the book's primary villains."

This non-fiction science book briefly covers the major and minor extinction cycles that have occured over the life of the planet, as well as current theories as to what caused them. The book is divided into 13 chapters, and each chapter deals with a specific current extinction, or near extinction, event. I loved the dots that this book connected for me. I loved that this current extinction cycle (clearly caused by Sapiens) is discussed in the context of the very long history of the planet. I loved learning about things I had no idea about, annual coral reef sex orgies comes to mind, and was saddened to learn about some of the species that have gone the way of the Dodo in my lifetime. I loved the science and learning about some scientists I knew nothing about. There is so much covered here, but all in a very accessible, easy to read manner. I am surprised that I was left with a feeling of hope at the end of this book. Not because I think that Humans will halt or reverse the processes we have put into play, but rather because after we become extinct, life will continue to find a way. Context is everything. I highly recommend this one."

Because despite what some people would have you believe, climate change is real, scientists can be trusted, and humans have had a significant impact on the earth pretty much since our appearance on it. So yeah, it felt like a timely choice!Fortunately for me, Adam, with his scientist mind, is more reserved in his judgment and optimistic in his outlook than I am. With the help of our (local!) beer of choice for this episode, he managed to talk me off the ledge. For now, anyway.Click here to watch!"

There's something very magical about it, as if the planet is getting a good spring cleaning and all its inhabitants an urgently needed recalibrating of priorities. I love how people who do important jobs are suddenly getting all the love instead of narcissistic moronic reality TV celebrities and the like who had the limelight before. And the absence of cars, especially at night, is wonderful. The shot of the Himalayas visible from New Delhi for the first time in decades was especially poignant. And, on the whole, people are more friendly. There's a lot more generosity towards the poor. And so many health workers over here in the UK are of ethnic minority backgrounds that racism more than ever has been highlighted as the outlandish unforgivable expression of brute stupidity it is. The virus has made a nonsense of militant nationalism too. Takes a pandemic for most to understand that every border is in essence illusory; that we're all in this together. And how pettily absurd Brexit now seems. I hope this new generation will take on board this rejigging of social and ethical priorities and as a result be much more committed to looking after the planet.   Anyway, Elizabeth Kolbert in this book visits a series of research centres all over the globe, all with their own specialised subject, all charting and trying to prevent the sudden alarming demise of various species of mammal, bird, reptile and insect. She intersperses these individual and local sagas with an overview of how extinctions have occurred in the planet's history. Meticulously and convincingly she helps us to understand how quickly and carelessly we're heading towards the next big extinction, the first caused by humans. I liked this more than The Uninhabitable Earth because it's completely cleansed of the hellfire indignation which for me marred David Wallace-Wells' book."

You won’t be after you read this.Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it. To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly. Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.Harboring some hubris about your place in the world? Here’s a tonic:a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man—the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories—will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper.What else can I say about this book? The picture Kolbert paints of our situation is every bit as depressing as you might expect. I already knew the facts about climate change and animal extinction, but according to Kolbert the prognosis is even worse than I was aware, given that ocean acidification – “global warming’s ‘equally evil twin’” – is one contributor I hadn’t ever considered. Likewise, though I’d heard about the crisis with the world’s amphibians, I was entirely ignorant of the bat cataclysm (white-nose syndrome).As a longtime New Yorker journalist, Kolbert writes at a good level for laymen: not talking down, but not assuming any specialist knowledge either. I was somewhat unconvinced by her thematic, species-by-species approach here; it makes each chapter more like an individual essay than a part of a larger argument. Winging her way around the world (what carbon footprint?!), she considers auks and ammonites, mastodons and endangered zoo animals in captive breeding programs, dying coral reefs, and pockets of Amazonian rainforest. By the end, you’ll be in no doubt that we are in the middle of a major extinction event, and that our era will be known as the “Anthropocene” – the age of the influence of man.Luckily, there are spots of humor to lighten the tone, such as “The reason this book is being written by a hairy biped, rather than a scaly one, has more to do with dinosaurian misfortune than with any particular mammalian virtue.”As Caspar Henderson writes in his Guardian review, “The extinction crisis is so vast and complex that it almost repels thought. We need a lot more imaginative thinking about the choices we can make and what comes next.” Now that this has won a Pulitzer, one hopes it will get people talking and doing some of that imaginative thinking. Unfortunately, it’s so much easier to bury heads in the sand and keep going as we have been. Time will tell whether we heed the lessons of this book."
92,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"There have been very long uneventful stretches and very, very occasionally ""revolutions on the surface of the earth."" To the extent that we can identify the causes of these revolutions, they're highly varied: glaciation in the case of the ordovician extinction, global warming and chances in chemistry at the end of the Permian, an asteroid impact in the final seconds of the Cretaceous. The current extinction has its own novel cause: not an asteroid or a massive volcanic eruption but ""one weedy species. As Walter Alvarez put it to me, ""We're seeing right now that a mass extinction can be cause by human beings."" (265-266) ""With the capacity to represent the world in signs and symbols comes the capacity to change it, which as it happens, is also the capacity to destroy it. A ting set of genetic variations divides us from the Neanderthals, but that has made all the difference. (258)It isn't unique to note that humanity has dangerously altered the planet in a way that no other species before it has done as conclusively demonstrated by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. What makes this book not only important but a must-read is the case by case basis which she follows through with each chapter of extinct or near-to-extinct case studies of populations of animals, from the American Mastodon to the frogs of central Panama to the Sumatran Rhino. Because of the subject matter and the grand question of purpose among our own species, the ones before us, and the ones that will come after we're gone, this book is something that stays with the reader afterwards, pondering the grand invention of creation, evolution, and eventual disarray. The book provides a great overview of the subject matter that newcomers will find informative and enjoyable, and despite the information presented, does offer glimpses of hope and even humour. What is so fascinating about the subject matter is the concept of how life has survived and altered itself time after time on our bountiful rock, and how little we as a species really understand the world we have seemingly (or rather forcibly) inherited. It was only roughly 300 years ago that palaeontology began to take it's first steps as a major science with the discovery of mastodon bones in North America, and that whole different worlds existed before ours. It was only in 1831 that Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle and made his way around the world, specifically to the Galapagos, giving us terms in his ""On the Origins of Species"" that now represent mainstream science. Neanderthals only were discovered shorted after Darwin's voyage, and it was only in 2004 that a hobbit like humanoid species was discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia. How freaking amazing and unbelievable is that?It was interested to see Kolbert's travels around the globe, diving into the globalisation aspects of humanity that give us terms like ""New Pangaea,"" how bat populations in the Northeastern part of the US have dropped off significantly do to factors that bats elsewhere in the world are immune to, the investigation into rainforest populations in South America, and the incredible efforts scientists are doing to protect endangered species, like giving rhinos ultrasounds and crows handjobs. It's a tale of our grim actions, but the hopeful aspects of our understanding of the world that can add it. The choice is up to us as a species."

94,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"It's absolutely, extremely, utterly, incredibly important for the general reader to remember that the real story of science is written in the language of mathematics. When authors put the story of scientific disciplines like physics, or chemistry or even biology into words and stories, they are translating something hard and complex and precise into a soft, fuzzy medium.It's analogous to knitting a replica of Michelangelo's David. Even if you are a genius knitter, the end result will only be (at best) a flabby simulacrum of the authentic object.If you experienced the knitted David (let's call him Dave) you would have a general, vague sense of what the real David was like. But you would be a long way away from really understanding the awe inspiring experience of the real deal.Let's take the analogy one step further. Imagine you're an alien, and you discovered the knitted Dave. But you had never seen the real David sculpture, or (more importantly) an actual human specimen. How much would you really understand about people, based on you're observations of the knitted Dave. You would have a very general sense. Enough to pick a hominid out of a crowd of donkeys. But that's about it. Better than nothing, but far from expertise. I love evolutionary biology and ecology and sociology. But I'm not trained in any of these disciplines. My understanding of them is via popularizations like this. Even within my discipline of clinical psychology, I'm barely educated. But outside of my discipline, I am essentially an enthusiastic dilettante. That's not a dis. That's just another way of saying, I haven't spent 4 years of undergraduate training to prepare for another 4 years of doctoral training to prepare for another 3-5 years of post doctoral training to prepare for another 10-20 years of professional research in any of those fields.Humans specialize. None of us could possibly be specialists in more than one or maybe two of these domains. There just isn't enough time in a human life span.I have a laypersons education of ecology and biology. That's nothing to scoff at. It took (literally) hundreds of hours of hard work, reading a bunch of books, taking classes, talking to experts etc. to gain my laypersons understanding of evolutionary biology. But honestly, I wouldn't know an actual darwinian algorithm from a hole in the ground, let alone be able to accurately interpret the findings of the mathematical models experts develop and use to understand complex systems like species population dynamics and ecosystems.So I have to rely on experts and science journalists to tell me the story in English. I need these dedicated, talented individuals to ""knit me a Dave"". That's exactly what Elizabeth Kolbert did. She knitted us a Dave. The Sixth Extinction is a soft, cuddly, children's storybook version of the hard, awful reality the actual experts in the field of biology and ecology are bearing witness to.If she had delivered us a harder version. It would have been (a) unintelligible to us mere mortals, and (b) so unspeakably awful, that most of us would have never, ever willingly subjected ourselves to this horrible, terrifying (much more than inconvenient) truth. Even the ""soft"" Dave version is pretty fucking tragic and demoralizing. If I were to give you a quick sketch analogy of what the knitted Dave of mass extinction looks like. Imagine a plush toy bat (flying mammal), stuffed with dead, decomposing frogs, with an invasive fungus choking his nostrils, literally starving to death, drooling acrid barren sea water and sputtering a creepy recorded (five nights at Freddie's) robot voice looping the phrase, ""we're all going to die a horrible, slow death, we're all going to suffocate in a giant cesspool of our own feces, and it's way too late to do anything about it"".Not exactly Tickle Me Elmo, but still, a very soft version of the reality.One can only imagine the horror that experts feel when they see entire species evaporate, or when they crunch the numbers and the results look like an ASCII skull and bones. You can imagine these nerdy bookworm types, realizing the awful reality and trying desperately to communicate the immense gravity of the situation to the stoners, jocks and rednecks who used to beat and torture them in high school, only to receive responses like ""The Bible says we can despoil the earth however we see fit"" or ""it's only a theory"" or ""not all scientists agree"" or ""it was cold for a few days this summer, so that proves global warming is a scam"".Even the most charismatic of the nerds, Think Neil Degrassi Tyson, Carl Sagan or Al Gore still only managed to capture the hearts and minds of ""egg head PBS types"", even when they limit their messages to what can be communicated via entertaining, schticky soundbites, Hollywood style computer animated visualizations and 30 minute PowerPoint slideshows.The Sixth Extinction goes at explaining the issue of the ecological disaster we currently find ourselves in by giving a brief history of the previous five mass extinction events that science has identified. Apparently global species population and diversity levels expand and contract regularly, but have dropped to next to nothing for various reasons thorough out the history of life on earth. The previous 5 mass extinction events are:1: the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event (occurring about 66 Ma) in which about 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. 2: the Triassic–Jurassic extinction (occurring about 201.3 Ma) in which about 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species went extinct.3: the Permian-Triassic transition. (occurring about 252 Ma). Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects).4: the Devonian Period (occurring 375–360 Ma), a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species.5: the Ordovician–Silurian extinction (occurring 450–440 Ma) killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.At one point, around 70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens almost went extinct. About 90% of us died. We got down to an estimated 40 breeding pairs. That's really close to extinction. But we showed em our bounce back stuff and boy look at us now!Now we're officially in the Holocene period (and have been for more than 10,000 years), but many scientists are pushing the point that we have officially exited the Holocene and entered an altogether new epoch that they are calling the Anthropocene. They argue that humans are having such a pronounced impact on the enviornment that we should be the titular species of this particular cene (hence the Anthro at the beginning of the word).They also argue that there is a new mass extinction event currently under way that may be the worst one yet. They are calling it the.... You guessed it....6: the Anthropocene extinction.That's awesome right? It's exciting to be a part of history. Even if it's potentially the end of it.Bad Boundaries:One of the salient points in the book is that global climate instability is not the only source of extinction. Another big problem happens when an ecosystems square footage is reduced or its boundaries are violated. Obviously deforestation is a huge problem. By making the rain forests land coverage smaller, it shrinks the biodiversity exponentially (there's that math stuff again). Apparently there's a formula for it that calculates the extinction rates as you down scale an environment. It's like the E=Mc2 of the apocalypse.But globalization is also a huge problem in that it introduces invasive species like rats into sensitive environments. Apparently rats have been hitching rides on boats for as long as people of been sailing.Invasive species can literally crash an ecology. In the book, Kolbert discusses a species of gray snake that was introduced to an island echo system that basically ate everything. It reduced to a tropical island full of pretty birds, lizards and bugs to pretty much just only snakes.Kolbert makes the gorgeous point that it's easy to vilify the little grey snake. But the snake isn't mean or immoral, it's amoral, meaning it's It's simply doing what it's hardwired to do. It's just trying to survive and reproduce. The Ultimate Invasive Species:In case you're wondering where this is going, the ultimate invasive species is us. Humans go just about everywhere And everywhere that humans go, almost everything else dies. It's not that were mean or immoral, were actually amoral in the same way the grey snake is. We're simply doing we're all hardwired to do. Survive and reproduce (with obvious exceptions, but not enough to make a critical difference).We like to hold ourselves to moral standards, and vilify some bad guys e.g. Dick Cheney (I'm not saying he's not, but just hear me out).The fact of the matter is, the Anthropocene extinction isn't happening because we're immoral. It's happening because we're amoral.It may seem like I'm splitting hairs but the distinction is important.Perhaps viewing ourselves as moral, and holding ourselves and others to standards of morality is part of the problem. Perhaps framing this ecological crisis as a moral issue is creating a fatal blind spot. Perhaps experimental psychology can be of assistance in explaining my point.Don't Diss Me:Cognitive dissonance is the very reliably observed psychological phenomena, whereby people (including you me and everybody we know) confabulate anxiety reducing fictions when confronted with our own amoral behavior.So in other words, when people realize that their behavior is incongruent with their values, they feel bad, but rather than change the behavior, they make up a story (no matter how absurd) that relieves them of the pain of their own hypocrisy. For example, consider a situation in which someone who places a value on being environmentally responsible just purchased a cool new chick magnet car that he later discovers is a gas guzzler.The conflict:It is important for the man to be (at least viewed as) a good steward of the environment. But he is now driving a babe getting machine that also happens to double as an earth warmer.As you can imagine, he's feeling rather conflicted about now. Drive a Prius and die a childless and alone, or drive the Maserati and repopulate Brentwood. In order to reduce the dissonance between his values and his behavior, he can (a) utilize public transportation more frequently (which is probably not going to happen, maybe in Seattle, not in L.A.), or he could (b) sell the car and purchase another one that gets better gas mileage (which, again, not hugely probable), or he could (c) convince himself that maybe all the global warming stuff is a little overblown, and one little Maserati aint gona kill nobody (which is a whole lot easier than option (a) or (b), and therefore pretty fucking likely).I know what you're thinking, ""other people do that, but I don't do that"". But you do, we all do, we just don't realize it. That's why they call it a blind spot.It sounds far fetched but cognitive dissonance has been observed in tightly controlled experiments again and again. Everyone does it. Even (no particularly) if you're a trained mental health professional,So maybe if we stop viewing the ecology issue moralistically, and start viewing it more pragmatically, than perhaps we can all stop pointing fingers and except the fact that we're all totally fucked and were going to die and there's noting we can do about it.No no. Of course there's something we can do about it. But we really need to accept that it's happening. Accept that were all complicit (even if you recycle), and then....I actually don't know what. But something I hope. Additionally, all of us regular people need to trust the experts. We may get a cold day in August and think we're all good. But that's not how this shit works. You have to do math and stuff. And odds are great that you don't. So trust the people that do and just do what they tell you. Even if you love Jesus. Which you probably don't if you're still reading this.Lastly, it occurred to me that I'm not going to face the worst of this, and my kid won't either, but her kids (should she ignore reason and reproduce) will. I'll just be honest here. Part of me has a hard time worrying past next week. And that same part of me kind of thinks, what ever, I'll be dead by then, and I know I'm not alone in this particular brand of denial. Cognitive dissonance ladies and gentlemen, don't let it win."

The first half is solid, inasmuch as it has some information about the history, and historiography, of extinction. The second half gets a little head-banging-against-a-wall, with example after example of currently endangered or recently extinct species, all told in the same palatable way. So, beware reader, that if you are like me, you might want to skip this book. It goes to great lengths to be entertaining, but entertaining in a very New Yorker kind of way. We learn more, I would guess, about the appearance and dress of the scientists Kolbert meets than we do about the extinctions she describes. We hear a lot about how people feel. We get a lot of novelistic realism about animal's rumps. And I just don't care. So frustrated was I by Kolbert's presentation of genuinely disturbing events that I started to think what a counter-argument might look like. Here are a couple: i) Kolbert pushes the 'anthropocene' (i.e., the 'geological' epoch determined by the existence of humanity and our destruction of other species) into the *very* distant past, roughly, when the indigenous peoples of Australia first killed off the continent's mega-fauna. But it is utterly ridiculous to liken prehistoric, and 20th and 21st century, human impact on the environment. Not to put too fine a point on it, back then we were just another species, though a successful one. Today, we run the planet. Eliding that difference makes it impossible to recognize what has caused the vast majority of extinctions over the last two centuries, viz., uncontrolled economic development. That's an argument I believe. The next one I'm not so sure about, but I do think there's a case to be answered: ii) Extinction is a natural occurrence. Granted that it's greatly accelerated over the last couple of centuries, but really, why worry so much? What moral obligation do we have towards *species*, as opposed to *living individuals*? If you have to kill a hundred foxes to reintroduce a threatened species into their previously natural environment, is that really a moral thing to do? What about the foxes' lives, after all? And so on. This book doesn't deal with such problems, but then, it wasn't meant to. It is entertaining propaganda, and good on Kolbert for bringing the issues up in the first place. "

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human. (watch here"

""To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more or were willing to make sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter when lather people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.""Does it mean that any conservation effort is for naught? Have we crossed a threshold that we cannot uncross? Not sure. Very likely you won't be either after reading it.Lots to chew on here - not all that pleasant either.

I have not been this disappointed in a book in a long while. More than a quarter of the length of the book was dedicated to notes. She touched on history as archeology has helped define it with reference to the past extinctions. I think, because she was being a writer, she needed to tell me things I didn't care to know, like what she and her research mates had for breakfast before they set out to discover whether or not a particular bug was or was not extinct.So here's the big spoiler alert.....she said humans were well on the way to an extinction and we were bringing it on ourselves. The sixth extinction is us. The one high point of the book for me was that she did not....to my memory....suggest that we could change things before it's too late. It seems to me she's saying it is already too late. There are just too many of us shitting in our own nest.....Michael"

100,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,4,"Elizabeth Kolbert knows how to put things together. She managed to create a very thoroughly documented book and to raise awareness about the extinction of species.The five extinctions known in the history of Earth decimated the species up to 96% (a brief summary can be read here: https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontol...)The sixth extinction here in question is named so because of the rate at which species are disappearing now:
“Calculating the background extinction rate is a laborious task that entails combing through whole databases’ worth of fossils. For what’s probably the best-studied group, which is mammals, it’s been reckoned to be roughly .25 per million species-years. This means that, since there are about fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around today, at the background extinction rate you’d expect—once again, very roughly—one species to disappear every seven hundred years.A rigorous calculation of the background extinction rate for amphibians has not been performed, in part because amphibian fossils are so rare. Almost certainly, though, the rate is lower than it is for mammals. Probably, one amphibian species should go extinct every thousand years or so.Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world’s most endangered class of animals; it’s been calculated that the group’s extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.”
And we, humans, are to blame here. The book has plenty of examples in which we exterminated a lot of species: the one concerning the great auk is so heart-breaking depicted. I do hope this book to be read by as many people as possible and maybe something in our collective mentality will change. We are just one species among so many other and just because we are more intelligent than the others (debatable from my point of view) does not make us owners of this planet and its life forms.
”In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us? One possibility—the possibility implied by the Hall of Biodiversity—is that we, too, will eventually be undone by our “transformation of the ecological landscape.” The logic behind this way of thinking runs as follows: having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth’s biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems—cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans—we’re putting our own survival in danger.”
It is not an easy book but it is definitely worth reading."
101,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches. - Stanford ecologist Paul EhrlichAs far as science has been able to determine, there have been five mass extinctions of life on Earth in the history of our planet. The first of these occurred at the end of the Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era about 450 million years ago. The second occurred less than 100 million years later in the late Devonian period. There followed the End-Permian extinction of some 250 million years ago, the Late Triassic extinction of 200 million years ago, and finally, the last one and the one we are most familiar with, the End-Cretaceous extinction which occurred about 65 million years ago. That's the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. (Well, almost - except for the ancestors of birds.)The best evidence seems to indicate that all of these extinctions except for the last one were the result of climatological events, often relatively sudden events to which plants and animals did not have time to adapt. The cause of the fifth one was also a change in climate but it was brought about by a collision with an asteroid. That cataclysmic event so altered the climate of the planet for a time that many, many species died out either suddenly or over a period of years.Scientists believe that we are now in the midst of the sixth extinction which Earth has endured and that this extinction is entirely human-caused. Elizabeth Kolbert writes in this book about how our species has altered life on the planet as no other species has before. It's not just that we are changing the climate for the worse, although that certainly is a big part of it, but we also have altered the face of Earth and the chemistry of the oceans to the detriment of very many species.One of the biggest problems that we have created for other species is simply the fact that we move everything around and wherever we go on Earth, it seems that some species hitch a ride with us. So a species from Asia that would never under normal circumstances make it to the Americas is brought here either wittingly or unwittingly and it wreaks havoc. Kolbert points out that the most endangered family of animals on Earth today are the amphibians. They are being wiped out by a fungus that has been spread around the world by humans. Kolbert writes about a dozen species, some of them already irrevocably lost and others on their way out. Through these very personal stories of that wonderful bird the Great Auk, the Panamanian golden frog, staghorn coral, the Sumatran rhino and others, the reader is moved to begin to understand the enormity of what is happening. What we are causing to happen to our world. It is somewhat surprising to learn that the concept of extinction is not a very old one. Kolbert points out that it was first articulated by Georges Cuvier in the revolutionary Paris of the 18th century. As always it seems, with any new scientific idea or concept, it took a while for it to be accepted, but later work by paleontologists has confirmed Cuvier's findings.This is a well-written book which can popularize scientific concepts and principles for a mass audience. It is an easy read and a fairly short one at less than 300 pages. Kolbert includes extensive notes and bibliography for those who wish to read more on the subject."
102,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17061542-zoe-s-human,4,"I learned many new things and I laughed a few times as well. That's pretty much a win for non-fiction. Humanity's impact on the environment tends to either be presented in a deliberately polarizing manner for political reasons or presented with assumptions of scientific knowledge which most lack. The author did an amazing job of explaining the science behind the impact in layman's terms without omitting details that frequently don't make ""news"" stories on the topic. She even took the time to explain how mistakes and theory discrepancies happen in science. Even better, she did all of this calmly by presenting facts and logic without resorting to emotional manipulation.I loved the inclusion of small personal notes about the assorted scientists featured. While such asides don't contribute to the main premise of the book, they do make it much more engaging. Between that and her wonderful descriptive style, I found myself able to visualize her experiences and environments with a fullness usually only found in fiction.There are two things which would have greatly enhanced my pleasure in this book. An insert of color photos of the assorted plants and animals discussed would be awesome. I did Google quite a bit while reading this and it would have been preferable to have photos right in the book.Additionally, a chart/timeline depicting the assorted eras and epochs mentioned in chronological order with dates and maybe a few sample organisms listed for each section would have been great. Perhaps with the mass extinctions and suggested range for the anthropocene marked as well? As clear as her explanations were, some information processes better in images than text.Things I think should be changed before the final release:The graph on page 16 is hella blurry.On page 46 at the end of chapter 2, she first mentions that the megafauna extinction is becoming understood as being the result of the spread of modern humans. No specifics are gone into on this until page 230. This left me wary that she was going to start making assertions without any kind of backup in the beginning of the book and I felt a bit weirded out all the way through the book by that hanging thread even when it became clear that she was validating her beliefs with facts. As a reader, it would have been better for that statement to have been omitted in chapter 2 if it wasn't going to be developed for almost 200 pages. At the very least, it should be noted that it will be expanded upon later in the book.Page 86, line 19, the paragraph that starts with ""The bolide arrived from the southeast..."" I'm assuming that ""doe to its trajectory"" (later in that paragraph) should read due ""to its trajectory.""The last sentence on 113 going over to page 114 reads ""Change the atmosphere's composition atmosphere..."" Is that right? It seems like the second atmosphere is superfluous or at least awkward.I would omit the bit about the gift shop cashier not showing Ms. Kolbert around from page 226. It comes across petty and unflattering to the author. Even if there were no other customers, it's a given in *any* clerking job that you don't leave the shop unattended. You can get fired for that.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway. Many thanks to all involved in providing me with this opportunity."

In the pages that follow, I try to convey both sides: the excitement of what's being learned as well as the horror of it."" (3)Mission accomplished. I learned something, and I felt something.Kolbert writes scientific journalism with the best of them and here she distills a lot of contemporary findings into easily conveyed factoids for the layperson. She tells a dynamic story but with very little pearl-clutching. She's largely neutral in her presentation, though she doesn't shy away from the (well-supported and widely accepted) thesis that it's human activity that's effected the climate change resulting in subsequent extinctions and a vast reduction to Earth's biodiversity. Maybe it's too late for us to halt the sweeping global change humankind has generated, but like it or not it's inexcusable to not pay attention and not learn about it. And those skeptical or uninterested in hearing anyone try to cram environmentalism down their throat with a lot of moralizing needn't fear. There are many chapters that focus on other, nonhuman catastrophes and extinction events, how they were discovered and how they shaped modern scientific thought and theory.And stylistically, her prose is entertaining and never dull. Just one example:When I visited Reserve 1202, I ran into a graduate student from Portugal who was surveying bats. At noon he had just recently woken up and was eating pasta in a shed that served as a research station-cum-kitchen. While we were talking, a very skinny cowboy rode up on an only slightly less skinny horse. He had a rifle slung over one shoulder. I wasn't sure whether he'd come because he'd heard the truck I'd arrived on and wanted to protect the student from possible intruders, or because he sensed that there was pasta.

Exploring the other five extinctions in the past and comparing them to the current destruction of the biosphere is sobering. It is unclear whether the sixth will surpass the other five (each extinction had its own pathology) or if we will survive the catastrophe we created but it is not pleasant to read about. This is one of those books that reminds the reader that it is worse than you think by far. I am not sure how to read the forensics of armageddon being shielded from nature by modern life, one will put this book down and pick up another at least until the resources run out. What books like this usually elicit are deer in the headlights paralysis or ostrich-like behavior or a shrug of the shoulders. Kind of strange the way we respond selectively to threats.

The only thing I could have asked for it is that for it to be longer. “One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is that the world is changing in ways that compel species to move, and another is that it’s changing in ways that create barriers—roads, clear-cuts, cities—that prevent them from doing so.”“By burning through coal and oil deposits, humans are putting carbon back into the air that has been sequestered for tens—in most cases hundreds—of millions of years. In the process, we are running geologic history not only in reverse but at warp speed.” The anthropologist Richard Leakey has warned that “Homo sapiens might not only be the agent of the sixth extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.” A sign in the Hall of Biodiversity offers a quote from the Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich: IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” “coral cover in the Caribbean has in recent decades declined by close to eighty percent.”“Asian elephants have declined by fifty percent over the last three generations.” “some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere.” “WHY is ocean acidification so dangerous? The question is tough to answer only because the list of reasons is so long. Depending on how tightly organisms are able to regulate their internal chemistry, acidification may affect such basic processes as metabolism, enzyme activity, and protein function.

It explains the earlier big exctinctions and why there is one caused by us, happening now. It is a complex topic and this journalist does a job of presenting the facts in an understandable manner.

Unfortunately, I struggled with finishing it and walked away from it several times before I finally finished. Despite my statements, I want to make it clear that my failure to enjoy this book had nothing to do with the quality of the writing. It was clear that Ms. Kolbert spent a great deal of time researching.. traveling to various habitats for a first hand observation of the species which have already disappeared and the ones who are on the brink. She obtained an enormous amount of information from various scientists and even provided photographs. I simply found that the book could not hold my attention. Perhaps if I had more of a knowledge base in animal biology, botany and environmental science, I could have enjoyed this book more than I did. Or perhaps if I had just put it aside to come back to it at a later time, I would have gotten more out of it… regardless, the book just did not hold my interest. That said, I would not discourage anyone else from reading the book. The failure to enjoy was mine. "
110,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"A depressing but important book. Very important. The book covers a lot of ground, from Georges Cuvier, Darwin, to modern day ecology and conservations, from arctic to tropical rain forests, from national parks to zoos. I've learned lot of about extinctions in the earth history and the current ongoing extinction—the sixth extinction that is solely humans' doing. Perhaps the reason that we, homo sapiens, have become the dominate species of the world, is the same reason that will cause our own eventual extinction."
111,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-shakespeareandspice,4,I read this all in one go because I knew multiple pauses would likely just extend the misery. It’s particularly hard to read a book such as this knowing things will likely only get worse with the donkey that is our President leading one of the world’s most powerful nations. We’re talking billions of lives. And millions of species. Including us.
112,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"It sounds strange to say I enjoyed reading this book about the increasingly profound and potentially devastating impact humans are having on our home planet, with an especial focus on the animals and plants who share Earth with us, but enjoy it I did. It’s a riveting topic, the history of our world and our species, and Elizabeth Kolbert has the knack of writing about science so it retains all its natural fascination while still being accessible to laypeople. She takes the reader with her back in time and around the world as she accompanies researchers in places ranging from the Andes mountains to the Great Barrier Reef. One particular fact has really stuck with me--as human activity increasingly homogenizes the global environment by transporting plants and animals all over the planet biodiversity is increasing on the small scale, so that where you live is likely to have more species than it did formerly, but because invasive flora and fauna can wipe out native plants and animals global biodiversity is rapidly shrinking as the total number of species on the Earth continues to dwindle. And that’s the point of the title, The Sixth Extinction. There have been five periods of mass extinction on our planet and some scientists are finding evidence indicating that we may be on the cusp of or even in the midst of a sixth wave of mass die offs, this one caused by the activities of humans, a chilling realization."
113,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'The Sixth Extinction' is written like a magazine article for a general reader, yet it tells intelligently an engaging true science story about several various geological locations important to the history of the scientific discoveries about evolution and extinction. The author personally visits and describes sites around the world - islands, forests, oceans, caves, museums - some of which take a lot of effort and discomfort to reach. These particular locations have a huge importance because each site is where an 'eureka!' moment occurred for a scientist who was often there for a different reason, but then he discovered something else instead; something which ended in clearing up everything confusing or wrong about our understanding of how the earth's climate changed in the past and is changing now. The discovery that the macro-climate can change on earth, and has apparently changed five times previously, and that these macro-climate changes also appear to be linked to changes in local animals and plants as well. It took time before everyone accepted the evidence presented that the earth and its environment has changed dramatically several times, and even longer for scientists to agree what the evidence signified. Early scientists had to not only accept the evidence of their own eyes and discoveries, they had to overcome biblical teachings which had told them the earth cannot change because it must be as perfect as the god who created it 6,000 years previously. These early struggles with the Church in interpreting physical clues are what led to the 'scientific method' of proving beyond doubt the conclusions reached from actually studying physical discoveries and not relying on religious beliefs from ancient scriptures. (One of the Church's precepts was everything on earth was unchanging and perfect. The fact that animals could die off as a species and disappear permanently from the face of the earth, or even worse, evolve, was not a possibility if the Church or the bible was correct. In time, the preponderance of the physical evidence overwhelmed the bible's myths. The author hints at the scientific disarray in accepting the facts of living creatures changing and disappearing because of the rigid philosophical belief in an unchanging world, but she does not dive into the religious elements which delayed the conclusions from scientific discoveries.)I found the book easy to read and understand. The facts and history of the concepts of evolution and climate change are conversationally and logically introduced. It deepened my understanding of how the scientists know climate changed billions of years ago and is changing now, and how they know the current change is already affecting life dramatically. Instead of jargon, you'll be able to speak it in plain English.The three issues the author gently exposes, after unobtrusively teaching us history, is how Humanity is involved, perhaps primarily responsible, in the current sixth ongoing climate change because: one, of our restless traveling around the world transporting, mostly unwisely, other life forms; as well as two, the CO2 we are pumping into the air from our gasoline-fueled cars and coal burning for electrical energy, which is changing (killing) the seas, trees/forests and wildlife the world over; and our extermination of animals in hunting for food, fun and profit (animals affect the type and quantity/quality of plants in their environment through their activities and nutritional needs, and by the symbiotic or otherwise interested neighbor animals who want to live close to their prey food). Your grandkids may not grow up with the trees, insects or local neighborhood wild animals and birds you did, or have cheap water to drink or cheap electricity to run their devices. The air certainly will be different.After finishing this book, you might want to look at a fiction novel, The Road. Warning: it's an extremely terrifying look at living in a world utterly wrecked environmentally, and it had me in tears.The following opinions are all me, and not in this science book. I think we will be the first species in earth's history that had the power to destroy AND save the earth, as well as ourselves, but we couldn't focus. Instead, we chose to party on: 1. hunt and kill off the last mega fauna like rhinoceroses and sharks to eat their horns/fins for that important personal 15-minute sexual erection; 2. cut down the annoying mega-flora for more houses and cheap furniture and better views; 3. put personal mega-billions of capital to work as investments in dozens of mansions/property around the world (plus living in one or three mansions isn't enough of an exercise of personal power, which is why the addition of environmentally controlled garages to house the yachts, the hundreds of 'antique' cars that will never be driven, to possess shoes, dresses and purses purchased for thousands of dollars each, etc. - conspicuous consumption being a tried-and-true method of relieving the boredom of wealth); 4. become socially powerful enough to manipulate/buy political votes to benefit/protect individual sources of capital; 5. use valuable resources to make war murder mayhem because of displaced aggression and blood lust; 6. make more babies because a priest/minister/Imam says god hates contraception (more mouths to feed, house and poop);7. For every facility which finally reduces their air/water/soil pollutants after decades of extended court fights, nine other facilities continue to pollute excessively around the world.8. and pray fruitlessly in religious rituals for a god to tell us our marching orders (which will never occur). We REALLY should be more environmentally responsible for our own self and the others who depend on us, but honestly? I don't think it's gonna happen. Anyone else notice, for example, how the local waters are too polluted for your kids to fish and swim in today, but you remember happily doing both safely? Anyone else notice how more flooding occurs in your neighborhood today? Anyone else notice how the local birds, bees and animal life have disappeared around your house? Anyone else notice the mountains of trash everywhere? Or the fouled beaches because the sewage treatment facility, overwhelmed again, had a spill? For the record, I believe we are doomed as a viable species. We don't seem to be able to overcome our DNA inheritance or be able to reprogram our animal brain desires for immediate emotional rush satisfactions. Our lusts for sex, social/tribal affiliation, personal power and self-aggrandizement, chocolate, drama, speed, explosions and killing things overwhelm our strengths in planning ahead, memory, intelligence, education, math and spatial skills, creativity, building tools, feelings that a single sacrifice for the many is worthy, love, affection, empathy, sharing the abundance and living in moderation. Our archaeological record, when it is dug up and discovered by the next species to rise to intelligence and tool-building a million years from now, after Homo sapiens has disappeared, will be condensed down to 'we coulda and we shoulda, but we didna'."

It's quite a topic - what we are doing to the world, and what we have done and what we are likely going to do. This mostly wasn't new information to me - but the acidification of the oceans was new. I mean I see the headlines and I know it's a issue, but I didn't understand the nature of it, or make the connection to shells and reefs.What I like about the book is, first of all, that it's getting read. The more people who read this the better. It's good information. Even well informed people don't generally grasp the scope and extent of what we are doing to our planet. She mixes in the dire future predictions, and the uncertainties of these, with lots of interesting historical details on science coming to terms with extinction, and other related topics. She covers in some detail three of the five major extinction events (why only three?) The problem with ocean acidification, in brief, is how it affects animals that secrete shells or any hard carbonate-mineral parts, especially in the common form of aragonite. This stuff dissolves in acid. The extra CO2 in the air leads to more of it getting absorbed into the ocean, and this makes the oceans more acidic. The acidity makes these hard parts more soluble, as in closer to actually dissolving, and therefore they become harder to make and animals make less of them. So, as the acidity increases, our corals start making less exoskeleton and eventually will just stop, meaning our coral reefs will die. We have made the oceans 40% more acidic then they were before the industrial revolution. My one complaint is that the book seems to target our emotions more than I'm comfortable with. It's really a borderline issue - unless you listen on audio. The reader, Anne Twomey, insanely over-dramatizes the book, weakening it the severely. It sounds like a bad psuedo-science show on a coming UFO invasion. (I did listen to sample before I purchased. There was a very passionate and professional reader. Only after I purchased did I learn that the sample was Kolbert herself, reading the prologue. Wish she had read the whole book.)We have all read plenty of everyone-should-read-this-book comments on important nonfiction books, and that does add a bit of discouragement into the encouragement. I hope the later overpowers the former. Everyone should be reading books like this."

Apart from the stereotypical acts of human depravity, there is also the passive damage inflicted on the natural world by our very existence. In Elizabeth Kolbert's outstanding The Sixth Extinction, the author writes in exceptionally readable and compelling language on a subject that is essential reading for members of our species.  Eschewing one particular approach to the depiction of extinction, Kolbert alternates the subjects of her chapters between multiple disciplines. History, geology, biology, ecology, and many other disciplines all make for a varied and hard-hitting treatise on the demise of the world's organisms. What's more, Kolbert breaks up her exposition with her experiences at the various places around earth on which she writes. These sections ground what can be very esoteric subject matter as the effects of these theories are seen through Kolbert's eyes. In a similar vein, Kolbert's aim with the book is not to accuse and depress, rather she seeks to educate the populace on the changes occurring on Earth. I have read many reviews that called this book depressing and guilt-inducing, however it was my feeling that the book maintains an upbeat, yet objective, tone throughout.  I am more likely to be found reading fiction than nonfiction; stories and characters have always interested me more than fact and figures. Perhaps it is that my professional days are filled with fact that I seek escape on my personal time. Despite this predilection for fiction, I am occasionally taken in by a nonfiction book and revel in the fashion the author arrives at their conclusion. The Sixth Extinction not only has the benefit of being one such book, it also has the prestige of being a book of great importance. If you're overwhelmed and unaffected by the media's liberal use of global warming, climate change, ocean acidification, and extinction events then this is exactly the book you should be reading. Its appeal is visceral as well as intellectual, and should be read by as many humans as possible. After all, we just happen to be the book's primary villains."
116,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,5,"This Pulitzer Prize winner for General Nonfiction (2015) was my book club selection this month, and I listened to the audiobook, which is really well narrated by Anne Twomey.Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari was my absolute favorite book last year, so I was primed to read this one. This non-fiction science book briefly covers the major and minor extinction cycles that have occured over the life of the planet, as well as current theories as to what caused them. The book is divided into 13 chapters, and each chapter deals with a specific current extinction, or near extinction, event. I loved the dots that this book connected for me. I loved that this current extinction cycle (clearly caused by Sapiens) is discussed in the context of the very long history of the planet. I loved learning about things I had no idea about, annual coral reef sex orgies comes to mind, and was saddened to learn about some of the species that have gone the way of the Dodo in my lifetime. I loved the science and learning about some scientists I knew nothing about. There is so much covered here, but all in a very accessible, easy to read manner. I am surprised that I was left with a feeling of hope at the end of this book. Not because I think that Humans will halt or reverse the processes we have put into play, but rather because after we become extinct, life will continue to find a way. Context is everything. I highly recommend this one."

Because despite what some people would have you believe, climate change is real, scientists can be trusted, and humans have had a significant impact on the earth pretty much since our appearance on it. So yeah, it felt like a timely choice!Fortunately for me, Adam, with his scientist mind, is more reserved in his judgment and optimistic in his outlook than I am. With the help of our (local!) beer of choice for this episode, he managed to talk me off the ledge. For now, anyway.Click here to watch!"

There's something very magical about it, as if the planet is getting a good spring cleaning and all its inhabitants an urgently needed recalibrating of priorities. I love how people who do important jobs are suddenly getting all the love instead of narcissistic moronic reality TV celebrities and the like who had the limelight before. And the absence of cars, especially at night, is wonderful. The shot of the Himalayas visible from New Delhi for the first time in decades was especially poignant. And, on the whole, people are more friendly. There's a lot more generosity towards the poor. And so many health workers over here in the UK are of ethnic minority backgrounds that racism more than ever has been highlighted as the outlandish unforgivable expression of brute stupidity it is. The virus has made a nonsense of militant nationalism too. Takes a pandemic for most to understand that every border is in essence illusory; that we're all in this together. And how pettily absurd Brexit now seems. I hope this new generation will take on board this rejigging of social and ethical priorities and as a result be much more committed to looking after the planet.   Anyway, Elizabeth Kolbert in this book visits a series of research centres all over the globe, all with their own specialised subject, all charting and trying to prevent the sudden alarming demise of various species of mammal, bird, reptile and insect. She intersperses these individual and local sagas with an overview of how extinctions have occurred in the planet's history. Meticulously and convincingly she helps us to understand how quickly and carelessly we're heading towards the next big extinction, the first caused by humans. I liked this more than The Uninhabitable Earth because it's completely cleansed of the hellfire indignation which for me marred David Wallace-Wells' book."

You won’t be after you read this.Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it. To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly. Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.Harboring some hubris about your place in the world? Here’s a tonic:a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man—the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories—will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper.What else can I say about this book? The picture Kolbert paints of our situation is every bit as depressing as you might expect. I already knew the facts about climate change and animal extinction, but according to Kolbert the prognosis is even worse than I was aware, given that ocean acidification – “global warming’s ‘equally evil twin’” – is one contributor I hadn’t ever considered. Likewise, though I’d heard about the crisis with the world’s amphibians, I was entirely ignorant of the bat cataclysm (white-nose syndrome).As a longtime New Yorker journalist, Kolbert writes at a good level for laymen: not talking down, but not assuming any specialist knowledge either. I was somewhat unconvinced by her thematic, species-by-species approach here; it makes each chapter more like an individual essay than a part of a larger argument. Winging her way around the world (what carbon footprint?!), she considers auks and ammonites, mastodons and endangered zoo animals in captive breeding programs, dying coral reefs, and pockets of Amazonian rainforest. By the end, you’ll be in no doubt that we are in the middle of a major extinction event, and that our era will be known as the “Anthropocene” – the age of the influence of man.Luckily, there are spots of humor to lighten the tone, such as “The reason this book is being written by a hairy biped, rather than a scaly one, has more to do with dinosaurian misfortune than with any particular mammalian virtue.”As Caspar Henderson writes in his Guardian review, “The extinction crisis is so vast and complex that it almost repels thought. We need a lot more imaginative thinking about the choices we can make and what comes next.” Now that this has won a Pulitzer, one hopes it will get people talking and doing some of that imaginative thinking. Unfortunately, it’s so much easier to bury heads in the sand and keep going as we have been. Time will tell whether we heed the lessons of this book."
122,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"There have been very long uneventful stretches and very, very occasionally ""revolutions on the surface of the earth."" To the extent that we can identify the causes of these revolutions, they're highly varied: glaciation in the case of the ordovician extinction, global warming and chances in chemistry at the end of the Permian, an asteroid impact in the final seconds of the Cretaceous. The current extinction has its own novel cause: not an asteroid or a massive volcanic eruption but ""one weedy species. As Walter Alvarez put it to me, ""We're seeing right now that a mass extinction can be cause by human beings."" (265-266) ""With the capacity to represent the world in signs and symbols comes the capacity to change it, which as it happens, is also the capacity to destroy it. A ting set of genetic variations divides us from the Neanderthals, but that has made all the difference. (258)It isn't unique to note that humanity has dangerously altered the planet in a way that no other species before it has done as conclusively demonstrated by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. What makes this book not only important but a must-read is the case by case basis which she follows through with each chapter of extinct or near-to-extinct case studies of populations of animals, from the American Mastodon to the frogs of central Panama to the Sumatran Rhino. Because of the subject matter and the grand question of purpose among our own species, the ones before us, and the ones that will come after we're gone, this book is something that stays with the reader afterwards, pondering the grand invention of creation, evolution, and eventual disarray. The book provides a great overview of the subject matter that newcomers will find informative and enjoyable, and despite the information presented, does offer glimpses of hope and even humour. What is so fascinating about the subject matter is the concept of how life has survived and altered itself time after time on our bountiful rock, and how little we as a species really understand the world we have seemingly (or rather forcibly) inherited. It was only roughly 300 years ago that palaeontology began to take it's first steps as a major science with the discovery of mastodon bones in North America, and that whole different worlds existed before ours. It was only in 1831 that Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle and made his way around the world, specifically to the Galapagos, giving us terms in his ""On the Origins of Species"" that now represent mainstream science. Neanderthals only were discovered shorted after Darwin's voyage, and it was only in 2004 that a hobbit like humanoid species was discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia. How freaking amazing and unbelievable is that?It was interested to see Kolbert's travels around the globe, diving into the globalisation aspects of humanity that give us terms like ""New Pangaea,"" how bat populations in the Northeastern part of the US have dropped off significantly do to factors that bats elsewhere in the world are immune to, the investigation into rainforest populations in South America, and the incredible efforts scientists are doing to protect endangered species, like giving rhinos ultrasounds and crows handjobs. It's a tale of our grim actions, but the hopeful aspects of our understanding of the world that can add it. The choice is up to us as a species."

124,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"It's absolutely, extremely, utterly, incredibly important for the general reader to remember that the real story of science is written in the language of mathematics. When authors put the story of scientific disciplines like physics, or chemistry or even biology into words and stories, they are translating something hard and complex and precise into a soft, fuzzy medium.It's analogous to knitting a replica of Michelangelo's David. Even if you are a genius knitter, the end result will only be (at best) a flabby simulacrum of the authentic object.If you experienced the knitted David (let's call him Dave) you would have a general, vague sense of what the real David was like. But you would be a long way away from really understanding the awe inspiring experience of the real deal.Let's take the analogy one step further. Imagine you're an alien, and you discovered the knitted Dave. But you had never seen the real David sculpture, or (more importantly) an actual human specimen. How much would you really understand about people, based on you're observations of the knitted Dave. You would have a very general sense. Enough to pick a hominid out of a crowd of donkeys. But that's about it. Better than nothing, but far from expertise. I love evolutionary biology and ecology and sociology. But I'm not trained in any of these disciplines. My understanding of them is via popularizations like this. Even within my discipline of clinical psychology, I'm barely educated. But outside of my discipline, I am essentially an enthusiastic dilettante. That's not a dis. That's just another way of saying, I haven't spent 4 years of undergraduate training to prepare for another 4 years of doctoral training to prepare for another 3-5 years of post doctoral training to prepare for another 10-20 years of professional research in any of those fields.Humans specialize. None of us could possibly be specialists in more than one or maybe two of these domains. There just isn't enough time in a human life span.I have a laypersons education of ecology and biology. That's nothing to scoff at. It took (literally) hundreds of hours of hard work, reading a bunch of books, taking classes, talking to experts etc. to gain my laypersons understanding of evolutionary biology. But honestly, I wouldn't know an actual darwinian algorithm from a hole in the ground, let alone be able to accurately interpret the findings of the mathematical models experts develop and use to understand complex systems like species population dynamics and ecosystems.So I have to rely on experts and science journalists to tell me the story in English. I need these dedicated, talented individuals to ""knit me a Dave"". That's exactly what Elizabeth Kolbert did. She knitted us a Dave. The Sixth Extinction is a soft, cuddly, children's storybook version of the hard, awful reality the actual experts in the field of biology and ecology are bearing witness to.If she had delivered us a harder version. It would have been (a) unintelligible to us mere mortals, and (b) so unspeakably awful, that most of us would have never, ever willingly subjected ourselves to this horrible, terrifying (much more than inconvenient) truth. Even the ""soft"" Dave version is pretty fucking tragic and demoralizing. If I were to give you a quick sketch analogy of what the knitted Dave of mass extinction looks like. Imagine a plush toy bat (flying mammal), stuffed with dead, decomposing frogs, with an invasive fungus choking his nostrils, literally starving to death, drooling acrid barren sea water and sputtering a creepy recorded (five nights at Freddie's) robot voice looping the phrase, ""we're all going to die a horrible, slow death, we're all going to suffocate in a giant cesspool of our own feces, and it's way too late to do anything about it"".Not exactly Tickle Me Elmo, but still, a very soft version of the reality.One can only imagine the horror that experts feel when they see entire species evaporate, or when they crunch the numbers and the results look like an ASCII skull and bones. You can imagine these nerdy bookworm types, realizing the awful reality and trying desperately to communicate the immense gravity of the situation to the stoners, jocks and rednecks who used to beat and torture them in high school, only to receive responses like ""The Bible says we can despoil the earth however we see fit"" or ""it's only a theory"" or ""not all scientists agree"" or ""it was cold for a few days this summer, so that proves global warming is a scam"".Even the most charismatic of the nerds, Think Neil Degrassi Tyson, Carl Sagan or Al Gore still only managed to capture the hearts and minds of ""egg head PBS types"", even when they limit their messages to what can be communicated via entertaining, schticky soundbites, Hollywood style computer animated visualizations and 30 minute PowerPoint slideshows.The Sixth Extinction goes at explaining the issue of the ecological disaster we currently find ourselves in by giving a brief history of the previous five mass extinction events that science has identified. Apparently global species population and diversity levels expand and contract regularly, but have dropped to next to nothing for various reasons thorough out the history of life on earth. The previous 5 mass extinction events are:1: the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event (occurring about 66 Ma) in which about 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. 2: the Triassic–Jurassic extinction (occurring about 201.3 Ma) in which about 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species went extinct.3: the Permian-Triassic transition. (occurring about 252 Ma). Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects).4: the Devonian Period (occurring 375–360 Ma), a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species.5: the Ordovician–Silurian extinction (occurring 450–440 Ma) killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.At one point, around 70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens almost went extinct. About 90% of us died. We got down to an estimated 40 breeding pairs. That's really close to extinction. But we showed em our bounce back stuff and boy look at us now!Now we're officially in the Holocene period (and have been for more than 10,000 years), but many scientists are pushing the point that we have officially exited the Holocene and entered an altogether new epoch that they are calling the Anthropocene. They argue that humans are having such a pronounced impact on the enviornment that we should be the titular species of this particular cene (hence the Anthro at the beginning of the word).They also argue that there is a new mass extinction event currently under way that may be the worst one yet. They are calling it the.... You guessed it....6: the Anthropocene extinction.That's awesome right? It's exciting to be a part of history. Even if it's potentially the end of it.Bad Boundaries:One of the salient points in the book is that global climate instability is not the only source of extinction. Another big problem happens when an ecosystems square footage is reduced or its boundaries are violated. Obviously deforestation is a huge problem. By making the rain forests land coverage smaller, it shrinks the biodiversity exponentially (there's that math stuff again). Apparently there's a formula for it that calculates the extinction rates as you down scale an environment. It's like the E=Mc2 of the apocalypse.But globalization is also a huge problem in that it introduces invasive species like rats into sensitive environments. Apparently rats have been hitching rides on boats for as long as people of been sailing.Invasive species can literally crash an ecology. In the book, Kolbert discusses a species of gray snake that was introduced to an island echo system that basically ate everything. It reduced to a tropical island full of pretty birds, lizards and bugs to pretty much just only snakes.Kolbert makes the gorgeous point that it's easy to vilify the little grey snake. But the snake isn't mean or immoral, it's amoral, meaning it's It's simply doing what it's hardwired to do. It's just trying to survive and reproduce. The Ultimate Invasive Species:In case you're wondering where this is going, the ultimate invasive species is us. Humans go just about everywhere And everywhere that humans go, almost everything else dies. It's not that were mean or immoral, were actually amoral in the same way the grey snake is. We're simply doing we're all hardwired to do. Survive and reproduce (with obvious exceptions, but not enough to make a critical difference).We like to hold ourselves to moral standards, and vilify some bad guys e.g. Dick Cheney (I'm not saying he's not, but just hear me out).The fact of the matter is, the Anthropocene extinction isn't happening because we're immoral. It's happening because we're amoral.It may seem like I'm splitting hairs but the distinction is important.Perhaps viewing ourselves as moral, and holding ourselves and others to standards of morality is part of the problem. Perhaps framing this ecological crisis as a moral issue is creating a fatal blind spot. Perhaps experimental psychology can be of assistance in explaining my point.Don't Diss Me:Cognitive dissonance is the very reliably observed psychological phenomena, whereby people (including you me and everybody we know) confabulate anxiety reducing fictions when confronted with our own amoral behavior.So in other words, when people realize that their behavior is incongruent with their values, they feel bad, but rather than change the behavior, they make up a story (no matter how absurd) that relieves them of the pain of their own hypocrisy. For example, consider a situation in which someone who places a value on being environmentally responsible just purchased a cool new chick magnet car that he later discovers is a gas guzzler.The conflict:It is important for the man to be (at least viewed as) a good steward of the environment. But he is now driving a babe getting machine that also happens to double as an earth warmer.As you can imagine, he's feeling rather conflicted about now. Drive a Prius and die a childless and alone, or drive the Maserati and repopulate Brentwood. In order to reduce the dissonance between his values and his behavior, he can (a) utilize public transportation more frequently (which is probably not going to happen, maybe in Seattle, not in L.A.), or he could (b) sell the car and purchase another one that gets better gas mileage (which, again, not hugely probable), or he could (c) convince himself that maybe all the global warming stuff is a little overblown, and one little Maserati aint gona kill nobody (which is a whole lot easier than option (a) or (b), and therefore pretty fucking likely).I know what you're thinking, ""other people do that, but I don't do that"". But you do, we all do, we just don't realize it. That's why they call it a blind spot.It sounds far fetched but cognitive dissonance has been observed in tightly controlled experiments again and again. Everyone does it. Even (no particularly) if you're a trained mental health professional,So maybe if we stop viewing the ecology issue moralistically, and start viewing it more pragmatically, than perhaps we can all stop pointing fingers and except the fact that we're all totally fucked and were going to die and there's noting we can do about it.No no. Of course there's something we can do about it. But we really need to accept that it's happening. Accept that were all complicit (even if you recycle), and then....I actually don't know what. But something I hope. Additionally, all of us regular people need to trust the experts. We may get a cold day in August and think we're all good. But that's not how this shit works. You have to do math and stuff. And odds are great that you don't. So trust the people that do and just do what they tell you. Even if you love Jesus. Which you probably don't if you're still reading this.Lastly, it occurred to me that I'm not going to face the worst of this, and my kid won't either, but her kids (should she ignore reason and reproduce) will. I'll just be honest here. Part of me has a hard time worrying past next week. And that same part of me kind of thinks, what ever, I'll be dead by then, and I know I'm not alone in this particular brand of denial. Cognitive dissonance ladies and gentlemen, don't let it win."

The first half is solid, inasmuch as it has some information about the history, and historiography, of extinction. The second half gets a little head-banging-against-a-wall, with example after example of currently endangered or recently extinct species, all told in the same palatable way. So, beware reader, that if you are like me, you might want to skip this book. It goes to great lengths to be entertaining, but entertaining in a very New Yorker kind of way. We learn more, I would guess, about the appearance and dress of the scientists Kolbert meets than we do about the extinctions she describes. We hear a lot about how people feel. We get a lot of novelistic realism about animal's rumps. And I just don't care. So frustrated was I by Kolbert's presentation of genuinely disturbing events that I started to think what a counter-argument might look like. Here are a couple: i) Kolbert pushes the 'anthropocene' (i.e., the 'geological' epoch determined by the existence of humanity and our destruction of other species) into the *very* distant past, roughly, when the indigenous peoples of Australia first killed off the continent's mega-fauna. But it is utterly ridiculous to liken prehistoric, and 20th and 21st century, human impact on the environment. Not to put too fine a point on it, back then we were just another species, though a successful one. Today, we run the planet. Eliding that difference makes it impossible to recognize what has caused the vast majority of extinctions over the last two centuries, viz., uncontrolled economic development. That's an argument I believe. The next one I'm not so sure about, but I do think there's a case to be answered: ii) Extinction is a natural occurrence. Granted that it's greatly accelerated over the last couple of centuries, but really, why worry so much? What moral obligation do we have towards *species*, as opposed to *living individuals*? If you have to kill a hundred foxes to reintroduce a threatened species into their previously natural environment, is that really a moral thing to do? What about the foxes' lives, after all? And so on. This book doesn't deal with such problems, but then, it wasn't meant to. It is entertaining propaganda, and good on Kolbert for bringing the issues up in the first place. "

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human. (watch here"
127,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"Kolbert won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 2015 for this detailed study of the five mass extinctions over the last 500 million years, and the titular sixth extinction that she (and scores of researchers) says is occurring right now.She documents the conservation work in nearly every environment and landscape, and a number of living things: amphibians, trees, birds, corals, microorganisms, bats, rhinoceros, as well as many other species of living things. ""To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more or were willing to make sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter when lather people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.""Does it mean that any conservation effort is for naught? Have we crossed a threshold that we cannot uncross? Not sure. Very likely you won't be either after reading it.Lots to chew on here - not all that pleasant either. This book had me googling left and right to find more information and learn more. This is one I will be thinking about for a long time to come."

I have not been this disappointed in a book in a long while. More than a quarter of the length of the book was dedicated to notes. She touched on history as archeology has helped define it with reference to the past extinctions. I think, because she was being a writer, she needed to tell me things I didn't care to know, like what she and her research mates had for breakfast before they set out to discover whether or not a particular bug was or was not extinct.So here's the big spoiler alert.....she said humans were well on the way to an extinction and we were bringing it on ourselves. The sixth extinction is us. The one high point of the book for me was that she did not....to my memory....suggest that we could change things before it's too late. It seems to me she's saying it is already too late. There are just too many of us shitting in our own nest.....Michael"
129,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,3,"Fascinating topic, but has a bit of a lull in the middle that was a little hard to get through."
130,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,4,"Elizabeth Kolbert knows how to put things together. She managed to create a very thoroughly documented book and to raise awareness about the extinction of species.The five extinctions known in the history of Earth decimated the species up to 96% (a brief summary can be read here: https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontol...)The sixth extinction here in question is named so because of the rate at which species are disappearing now:
“Calculating the background extinction rate is a laborious task that entails combing through whole databases’ worth of fossils. For what’s probably the best-studied group, which is mammals, it’s been reckoned to be roughly .25 per million species-years. This means that, since there are about fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around today, at the background extinction rate you’d expect—once again, very roughly—one species to disappear every seven hundred years.A rigorous calculation of the background extinction rate for amphibians has not been performed, in part because amphibian fossils are so rare. Almost certainly, though, the rate is lower than it is for mammals. Probably, one amphibian species should go extinct every thousand years or so.Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world’s most endangered class of animals; it’s been calculated that the group’s extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.”
And we, humans, are to blame here. The book has plenty of examples in which we exterminated a lot of species: the one concerning the great auk is so heart-breaking depicted. I do hope this book to be read by as many people as possible and maybe something in our collective mentality will change. We are just one species among so many other and just because we are more intelligent than the others (debatable from my point of view) does not make us owners of this planet and its life forms.
”In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us? One possibility—the possibility implied by the Hall of Biodiversity—is that we, too, will eventually be undone by our “transformation of the ecological landscape.” The logic behind this way of thinking runs as follows: having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth’s biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems—cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans—we’re putting our own survival in danger.”
It is not an easy book but it is definitely worth reading."
131,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches. - Stanford ecologist Paul EhrlichAs far as science has been able to determine, there have been five mass extinctions of life on Earth in the history of our planet. The first of these occurred at the end of the Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era about 450 million years ago. The second occurred less than 100 million years later in the late Devonian period. There followed the End-Permian extinction of some 250 million years ago, the Late Triassic extinction of 200 million years ago, and finally, the last one and the one we are most familiar with, the End-Cretaceous extinction which occurred about 65 million years ago. That's the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. (Well, almost - except for the ancestors of birds.)The best evidence seems to indicate that all of these extinctions except for the last one were the result of climatological events, often relatively sudden events to which plants and animals did not have time to adapt. The cause of the fifth one was also a change in climate but it was brought about by a collision with an asteroid. That cataclysmic event so altered the climate of the planet for a time that many, many species died out either suddenly or over a period of years.Scientists believe that we are now in the midst of the sixth extinction which Earth has endured and that this extinction is entirely human-caused. Elizabeth Kolbert writes in this book about how our species has altered life on the planet as no other species has before. It's not just that we are changing the climate for the worse, although that certainly is a big part of it, but we also have altered the face of Earth and the chemistry of the oceans to the detriment of very many species.One of the biggest problems that we have created for other species is simply the fact that we move everything around and wherever we go on Earth, it seems that some species hitch a ride with us. So a species from Asia that would never under normal circumstances make it to the Americas is brought here either wittingly or unwittingly and it wreaks havoc. Kolbert points out that the most endangered family of animals on Earth today are the amphibians. They are being wiped out by a fungus that has been spread around the world by humans. Kolbert writes about a dozen species, some of them already irrevocably lost and others on their way out. Through these very personal stories of that wonderful bird the Great Auk, the Panamanian golden frog, staghorn coral, the Sumatran rhino and others, the reader is moved to begin to understand the enormity of what is happening. What we are causing to happen to our world. It is somewhat surprising to learn that the concept of extinction is not a very old one. Kolbert points out that it was first articulated by Georges Cuvier in the revolutionary Paris of the 18th century. As always it seems, with any new scientific idea or concept, it took a while for it to be accepted, but later work by paleontologists has confirmed Cuvier's findings.This is a well-written book which can popularize scientific concepts and principles for a mass audience. It is an easy read and a fairly short one at less than 300 pages. Kolbert includes extensive notes and bibliography for those who wish to read more on the subject."
132,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17061542-zoe-s-human,4,"I learned many new things and I laughed a few times as well. That's pretty much a win for non-fiction. Humanity's impact on the environment tends to either be presented in a deliberately polarizing manner for political reasons or presented with assumptions of scientific knowledge which most lack. The author did an amazing job of explaining the science behind the impact in layman's terms without omitting details that frequently don't make ""news"" stories on the topic. She even took the time to explain how mistakes and theory discrepancies happen in science. Even better, she did all of this calmly by presenting facts and logic without resorting to emotional manipulation.I loved the inclusion of small personal notes about the assorted scientists featured. While such asides don't contribute to the main premise of the book, they do make it much more engaging. Between that and her wonderful descriptive style, I found myself able to visualize her experiences and environments with a fullness usually only found in fiction.There are two things which would have greatly enhanced my pleasure in this book. An insert of color photos of the assorted plants and animals discussed would be awesome. I did Google quite a bit while reading this and it would have been preferable to have photos right in the book.Additionally, a chart/timeline depicting the assorted eras and epochs mentioned in chronological order with dates and maybe a few sample organisms listed for each section would have been great. Perhaps with the mass extinctions and suggested range for the anthropocene marked as well? As clear as her explanations were, some information processes better in images than text.Things I think should be changed before the final release:The graph on page 16 is hella blurry.On page 46 at the end of chapter 2, she first mentions that the megafauna extinction is becoming understood as being the result of the spread of modern humans. No specifics are gone into on this until page 230. This left me wary that she was going to start making assertions without any kind of backup in the beginning of the book and I felt a bit weirded out all the way through the book by that hanging thread even when it became clear that she was validating her beliefs with facts. As a reader, it would have been better for that statement to have been omitted in chapter 2 if it wasn't going to be developed for almost 200 pages. At the very least, it should be noted that it will be expanded upon later in the book.Page 86, line 19, the paragraph that starts with ""The bolide arrived from the southeast..."" I'm assuming that ""doe to its trajectory"" (later in that paragraph) should read due ""to its trajectory.""The last sentence on 113 going over to page 114 reads ""Change the atmosphere's composition atmosphere..."" Is that right? It seems like the second atmosphere is superfluous or at least awkward.I would omit the bit about the gift shop cashier not showing Ms. Kolbert around from page 226. It comes across petty and unflattering to the author. Even if there were no other customers, it's a given in *any* clerking job that you don't leave the shop unattended. You can get fired for that.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway. Many thanks to all involved in providing me with this opportunity."

In the pages that follow, I try to convey both sides: the excitement of what's being learned as well as the horror of it."" (3)Mission accomplished. I learned something, and I felt something.Kolbert writes scientific journalism with the best of them and here she distills a lot of contemporary findings into easily conveyed factoids for the layperson. She tells a dynamic story but with very little pearl-clutching. She's largely neutral in her presentation, though she doesn't shy away from the (well-supported and widely accepted) thesis that it's human activity that's effected the climate change resulting in subsequent extinctions and a vast reduction to Earth's biodiversity. Maybe it's too late for us to halt the sweeping global change humankind has generated, but like it or not it's inexcusable to not pay attention and not learn about it. And those skeptical or uninterested in hearing anyone try to cram environmentalism down their throat with a lot of moralizing needn't fear. There are many chapters that focus on other, nonhuman catastrophes and extinction events, how they were discovered and how they shaped modern scientific thought and theory.And stylistically, her prose is entertaining and never dull. Just one example:When I visited Reserve 1202, I ran into a graduate student from Portugal who was surveying bats. At noon he had just recently woken up and was eating pasta in a shed that served as a research station-cum-kitchen. While we were talking, a very skinny cowboy rode up on an only slightly less skinny horse. He had a rifle slung over one shoulder. I wasn't sure whether he'd come because he'd heard the truck I'd arrived on and wanted to protect the student from possible intruders, or because he sensed that there was pasta. (174)5 stars out of 5. Informative and entertaining. A big win for popular science fans."

Exploring the other five extinctions in the past and comparing them to the current destruction of the biosphere is sobering. It is unclear whether the sixth will surpass the other five (each extinction had its own pathology) or if we will survive the catastrophe we created but it is not pleasant to read about. This is one of those books that reminds the reader that it is worse than you think by far. I am not sure how to read the forensics of armageddon being shielded from nature by modern life, one will put this book down and pick up another at least until the resources run out. What books like this usually elicit are deer in the headlights paralysis or ostrich-like behavior or a shrug of the shoulders. Kind of strange the way we respond selectively to threats.

We have to try and minimize the damage, the challenge will be beyond difficult, but it is a noble goal. "

I want to write a series of children’s stories teaching them about the Frozen Zoo, and the drones that leads new flocks of birds in the wild to repopulate and make sure they land on safe ground, and apes that are domesticating dogs, that make tools, that every day we learn they are just a bit smarter than we thought. This is a horror story through and through about the changes going on in this world because of how we live our lives, because of how homo sapiens have ALWAYS lived their lives even before we started burning fossil fuels and putting pesticide on everything. I want to go on a tour and shake the hand of everyone working desperately to create safety arks for animals that we are abandoning by our own callousness. I want to visit these refuges and revel in them, and then leave, hopefully, with no trace of ever having been there.And now, I’ll just let the book speak for itself. The only thing I could have asked for it is that for it to be longer. “One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is that the world is changing in ways that compel species to move, and another is that it’s changing in ways that create barriers—roads, clear-cuts, cities—that prevent them from doing so.”“By burning through coal and oil deposits, humans are putting carbon back into the air that has been sequestered for tens—in most cases hundreds—of millions of years. In the process, we are running geologic history not only in reverse but at warp speed.” The anthropologist Richard Leakey has warned that “Homo sapiens might not only be the agent of the sixth extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.” A sign in the Hall of Biodiversity offers a quote from the Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich: IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” “coral cover in the Caribbean has in recent decades declined by close to eighty percent.”“Asian elephants have declined by fifty percent over the last three generations.” “some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere.” “WHY is ocean acidification so dangerous? The question is tough to answer only because the list of reasons is so long. Depending on how tightly organisms are able to regulate their internal chemistry, acidification may affect such basic processes as metabolism, enzyme activity, and protein function. Because it will” "

In North America, the bat population has dropped to next to nothing due to a fungi from Europe, with which European bats live quite happily, but which kill their American counterparts by the millions.""In times of extreme stress, the whole concept of fitness, at least in a Darwinian sense, loses its meaning: how could a creature be adapter, either well or ill, for conditions it has never before encountered in its entire evolutionary history?"" Then theres's the human induced global warming caused by billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere and into the oceans. There is also the impact of habitat loss due to human population explosion. Habitat loss, introduction of alien species and diseases, pouching, changing of living conditions to climate change - all of this means that we are living in a time when the extinction rate far surpasses the background rate.

Life would also surely bound back eventually, long after the last descendant of bipedal, hairless apes have vanished.This is a highly informative, well-written and captivating book. It explains the earlier big exctinctions and why there is one caused by us, happening now. It is a complex topic and this journalist does a job of presenting the facts in an understandable manner. I happened to read in a newspaper while reading this book, that just in England, 421 species have been lost in 200 years. This isn't propaganda - this is really happening. Highly recommended."

Unfortunately, I struggled with finishing it and walked away from it several times before I finally finished. Despite my statements, I want to make it clear that my failure to enjoy this book had nothing to do with the quality of the writing. It was clear that Ms. Kolbert spent a great deal of time researching.. traveling to various habitats for a first hand observation of the species which have already disappeared and the ones who are on the brink. She obtained an enormous amount of information from various scientists and even provided photographs. I simply found that the book could not hold my attention. Perhaps if I had more of a knowledge base in animal biology, botany and environmental science, I could have enjoyed this book more than I did. Or perhaps if I had just put it aside to come back to it at a later time, I would have gotten more out of it… regardless, the book just did not hold my interest.

I've learned lot of about extinctions in the earth history and the current ongoing extinction—the sixth extinction that is solely humans' doing. Perhaps the reason that we, homo sapiens, have become the dominate species of the world, is the same reason that will cause our own eventual extinction."

It’s a riveting topic, the history of our world and our species, and Elizabeth Kolbert has the knack of writing about science so it retains all its natural fascination while still being accessible to laypeople. She takes the reader with her back in time and around the world as she accompanies researchers in places ranging from the Andes mountains to the Great Barrier Reef. One particular fact has really stuck with me--as human activity increasingly homogenizes the global environment by transporting plants and animals all over the planet biodiversity is increasing on the small scale, so that where you live is likely to have more species than it did formerly, but because invasive flora and fauna can wipe out native plants and animals global biodiversity is rapidly shrinking as the total number of species on the Earth continues to dwindle. And that’s the point of the title, The Sixth Extinction. There have been five periods of mass extinction on our planet and some scientists are finding evidence indicating that we may be on the cusp of or even in the midst of a sixth wave of mass die offs, this one caused by the activities of humans, a chilling realization."
143,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'The Sixth Extinction' is written like a magazine article for a general reader, yet it tells intelligently an engaging true science story about several various geological locations important to the history of the scientific discoveries about evolution and extinction. The author personally visits and describes sites around the world - islands, forests, oceans, caves, museums - some of which take a lot of effort and discomfort to reach. These particular locations have a huge importance because each site is where an 'eureka!' moment occurred for a scientist who was often there for a different reason, but then he discovered something else instead; something which ended in clearing up everything confusing or wrong about our understanding of how the earth's climate changed in the past and is changing now. The discovery that the macro-climate can change on earth, and has apparently changed five times previously, and that these macro-climate changes also appear to be linked to changes in local animals and plants as well. It took time before everyone accepted the evidence presented that the earth and its environment has changed dramatically several times, and even longer for scientists to agree what the evidence signified. Early scientists had to not only accept the evidence of their own eyes and discoveries, they had to overcome biblical teachings which had told them the earth cannot change because it must be as perfect as the god who created it 6,000 years previously. These early struggles with the Church in interpreting physical clues are what led to the 'scientific method' of proving beyond doubt the conclusions reached from actually studying physical discoveries and not relying on religious beliefs from ancient scriptures. (One of the Church's precepts was everything on earth was unchanging and perfect. The fact that animals could die off as a species and disappear permanently from the face of the earth, or even worse, evolve, was not a possibility if the Church or the bible was correct. In time, the preponderance of the physical evidence overwhelmed the bible's myths. The author hints at the scientific disarray in accepting the facts of living creatures changing and disappearing because of the rigid philosophical belief in an unchanging world, but she does not dive into the religious elements which delayed the conclusions from scientific discoveries.)I found the book easy to read and understand. The facts and history of the concepts of evolution and climate change are conversationally and logically introduced. It deepened my understanding of how the scientists know climate changed billions of years ago and is changing now, and how they know the current change is already affecting life dramatically. Instead of jargon, you'll be able to speak it in plain English.The three issues the author gently exposes, after unobtrusively teaching us history, is how Humanity is involved, perhaps primarily responsible, in the current sixth ongoing climate change because: one, of our restless traveling around the world transporting, mostly unwisely, other life forms; as well as two, the CO2 we are pumping into the air from our gasoline-fueled cars and coal burning for electrical energy, which is changing (killing) the seas, trees/forests and wildlife the world over; and our extermination of animals in hunting for food, fun and profit (animals affect the type and quantity/quality of plants in their environment through their activities and nutritional needs, and by the symbiotic or otherwise interested neighbor animals who want to live close to their prey food). Your grandkids may not grow up with the trees, insects or local neighborhood wild animals and birds you did, or have cheap water to drink or cheap electricity to run their devices. The air certainly will be different.After finishing this book, you might want to look at a fiction novel, The Road. Warning: it's an extremely terrifying look at living in a world utterly wrecked environmentally, and it had me in tears.The following opinions are all me, and not in this science book. I think we will be the first species in earth's history that had the power to destroy AND save the earth, as well as ourselves, but we couldn't focus. Instead, we chose to party on: 1. hunt and kill off the last mega fauna like rhinoceroses and sharks to eat their horns/fins for that important personal 15-minute sexual erection; 2. cut down the annoying mega-flora for more houses and cheap furniture and better views; 3. put personal mega-billions of capital to work as investments in dozens of mansions/property around the world (plus living in one or three mansions isn't enough of an exercise of personal power, which is why the addition of environmentally controlled garages to house the yachts, the hundreds of 'antique' cars that will never be driven, to possess shoes, dresses and purses purchased for thousands of dollars each, etc. - conspicuous consumption being a tried-and-true method of relieving the boredom of wealth); 4. become socially powerful enough to manipulate/buy political votes to benefit/protect individual sources of capital; 5. use valuable resources to make war murder mayhem because of displaced aggression and blood lust; 6. make more babies because a priest/minister/Imam says god hates contraception (more mouths to feed, house and poop);7. For every facility which finally reduces their air/water/soil pollutants after decades of extended court fights, nine other facilities continue to pollute excessively around the world.8. and pray fruitlessly in religious rituals for a god to tell us our marching orders (which will never occur). We REALLY should be more environmentally responsible for our own self and the others who depend on us, but honestly? I don't think it's gonna happen. Anyone else notice, for example, how the local waters are too polluted for your kids to fish and swim in today, but you remember happily doing both safely? Anyone else notice how more flooding occurs in your neighborhood today? Anyone else notice how the local birds, bees and animal life have disappeared around your house? Anyone else notice the mountains of trash everywhere? Or the fouled beaches because the sewage treatment facility, overwhelmed again, had a spill? For the record, I believe we are doomed as a viable species. We don't seem to be able to overcome our DNA inheritance or be able to reprogram our animal brain desires for immediate emotional rush satisfactions. Our lusts for sex, social/tribal affiliation, personal power and self-aggrandizement, chocolate, drama, speed, explosions and killing things overwhelm our strengths in planning ahead, memory, intelligence, education, math and spatial skills, creativity, building tools, feelings that a single sacrifice for the many is worthy, love, affection, empathy, sharing the abundance and living in moderation. Our archaeological record, when it is dug up and discovered by the next species to rise to intelligence and tool-building a million years from now, after Homo sapiens has disappeared, will be condensed down to 'we coulda and we shoulda, but we didna'."

It's quite a topic - what we are doing to the world, and what we have done and what we are likely going to do. This mostly wasn't new information to me - but the acidification of the oceans was new. I mean I see the headlines and I know it's a issue, but I didn't understand the nature of it, or make the connection to shells and reefs.What I like about the book is, first of all, that it's getting read. The more people who read this the better. It's good information. Even well informed people don't generally grasp the scope and extent of what we are doing to our planet. She mixes in the dire future predictions, and the uncertainties of these, with lots of interesting historical details on science coming to terms with extinction, and other related topics. She covers in some detail three of the five major extinction events (why only three?) The problem with ocean acidification, in brief, is how it affects animals that secrete shells or any hard carbonate-mineral parts, especially in the common form of aragonite. This stuff dissolves in acid. The extra CO2 in the air leads to more of it getting absorbed into the ocean, and this makes the oceans more acidic. The acidity makes these hard parts more soluble, as in closer to actually dissolving, and therefore they become harder to make and animals make less of them. So, as the acidity increases, our corals start making less exoskeleton and eventually will just stop, meaning our coral reefs will die. We have made the oceans 40% more acidic then they were before the industrial revolution. My one complaint is that the book seems to target our emotions more than I'm comfortable with. It's really a borderline issue - unless you listen on audio. The reader, Anne Twomey, insanely over-dramatizes the book, weakening it the severely. It sounds like a bad psuedo-science show on a coming UFO invasion. (I did listen to sample before I purchased. There was a very passionate and professional reader. Only after I purchased did I learn that the sample was Kolbert herself, reading the prologue. Wish she had read the whole book.)We have all read plenty of everyone-should-read-this-book comments on important nonfiction books, and that does add a bit of discouragement into the encouragement. I hope the later overpowers the former. Everyone should be reading books like this."

Apart from the stereotypical acts of human depravity, there is also the passive damage inflicted on the natural world by our very existence. In Elizabeth Kolbert's outstanding The Sixth Extinction, the author writes in exceptionally readable and compelling language on a subject that is essential reading for members of our species.  Eschewing one particular approach to the depiction of extinction, Kolbert alternates the subjects of her chapters between multiple disciplines. History, geology, biology, ecology, and many other disciplines all make for a varied and hard-hitting treatise on the demise of the world's organisms. What's more, Kolbert breaks up her exposition with her experiences at the various places around earth on which she writes. These sections ground what can be very esoteric subject matter as the effects of these theories are seen through Kolbert's eyes. In a similar vein, Kolbert's aim with the book is not to accuse and depress, rather she seeks to educate the populace on the changes occurring on Earth. I have read many reviews that called this book depressing and guilt-inducing, however it was my feeling that the book maintains an upbeat, yet objective, tone throughout.  I am more likely to be found reading fiction than nonfiction; stories and characters have always interested me more than fact and figures. Perhaps it is that my professional days are filled with fact that I seek escape on my personal time. Despite this predilection for fiction, I am occasionally taken in by a nonfiction book and revel in the fashion the author arrives at their conclusion. The Sixth Extinction not only has the benefit of being one such book, it also has the prestige of being a book of great importance. If you're overwhelmed and unaffected by the media's liberal use of global warming, climate change, ocean acidification, and extinction events then this is exactly the book you should be reading. Its appeal is visceral as well as intellectual, and should be read by as many humans as possible. After all, we just happen to be the book's primary villains."

This non-fiction science book briefly covers the major and minor extinction cycles that have occured over the life of the planet, as well as current theories as to what caused them. The book is divided into 13 chapters, and each chapter deals with a specific current extinction, or near extinction, event. I loved the dots that this book connected for me. I loved that this current extinction cycle (clearly caused by Sapiens) is discussed in the context of the very long history of the planet. I loved learning about things I had no idea about, annual coral reef sex orgies comes to mind, and was saddened to learn about some of the species that have gone the way of the Dodo in my lifetime. I loved the science and learning about some scientists I knew nothing about. There is so much covered here, but all in a very accessible, easy to read manner. I am surprised that I was left with a feeling of hope at the end of this book. Not because I think that Humans will halt or reverse the processes we have put into play, but rather because after we become extinct, life will continue to find a way. Context is everything. I highly recommend this one."

Because despite what some people would have you believe, climate change is real, scientists can be trusted, and humans have had a significant impact on the earth pretty much since our appearance on it. So yeah, it felt like a timely choice!Fortunately for me, Adam, with his scientist mind, is more reserved in his judgment and optimistic in his outlook than I am. With the help of our (local!) beer of choice for this episode, he managed to talk me off the ledge. For now, anyway.Click here to watch!"

There's something very magical about it, as if the planet is getting a good spring cleaning and all its inhabitants an urgently needed recalibrating of priorities. I love how people who do important jobs are suddenly getting all the love instead of narcissistic moronic reality TV celebrities and the like who had the limelight before. And the absence of cars, especially at night, is wonderful. The shot of the Himalayas visible from New Delhi for the first time in decades was especially poignant. And, on the whole, people are more friendly. There's a lot more generosity towards the poor. And so many health workers over here in the UK are of ethnic minority backgrounds that racism more than ever has been highlighted as the outlandish unforgivable expression of brute stupidity it is. The virus has made a nonsense of militant nationalism too. Takes a pandemic for most to understand that every border is in essence illusory; that we're all in this together. And how pettily absurd Brexit now seems. I hope this new generation will take on board this rejigging of social and ethical priorities and as a result be much more committed to looking after the planet.   Anyway, Elizabeth Kolbert in this book visits a series of research centres all over the globe, all with their own specialised subject, all charting and trying to prevent the sudden alarming demise of various species of mammal, bird, reptile and insect. She intersperses these individual and local sagas with an overview of how extinctions have occurred in the planet's history. Meticulously and convincingly she helps us to understand how quickly and carelessly we're heading towards the next big extinction, the first caused by humans. I liked this more than The Uninhabitable Earth because it's completely cleansed of the hellfire indignation which for me marred David Wallace-Wells' book."

You won’t be after you read this.Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it. To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly. Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.Harboring some hubris about your place in the world? Here’s a tonic:a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man—the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories—will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper.What else can I say about this book? The picture Kolbert paints of our situation is every bit as depressing as you might expect. I already knew the facts about climate change and animal extinction, but according to Kolbert the prognosis is even worse than I was aware, given that ocean acidification – “global warming’s ‘equally evil twin’” – is one contributor I hadn’t ever considered. Likewise, though I’d heard about the crisis with the world’s amphibians, I was entirely ignorant of the bat cataclysm (white-nose syndrome).As a longtime New Yorker journalist, Kolbert writes at a good level for laymen: not talking down, but not assuming any specialist knowledge either. I was somewhat unconvinced by her thematic, species-by-species approach here; it makes each chapter more like an individual essay than a part of a larger argument. Winging her way around the world (what carbon footprint?!), she considers auks and ammonites, mastodons and endangered zoo animals in captive breeding programs, dying coral reefs, and pockets of Amazonian rainforest. By the end, you’ll be in no doubt that we are in the middle of a major extinction event, and that our era will be known as the “Anthropocene” – the age of the influence of man.Luckily, there are spots of humor to lighten the tone, such as “The reason this book is being written by a hairy biped, rather than a scaly one, has more to do with dinosaurian misfortune than with any particular mammalian virtue.”As Caspar Henderson writes in his Guardian review, “The extinction crisis is so vast and complex that it almost repels thought. We need a lot more imaginative thinking about the choices we can make and what comes next.” Now that this has won a Pulitzer, one hopes it will get people talking and doing some of that imaginative thinking. Unfortunately, it’s so much easier to bury heads in the sand and keep going as we have been. Time will tell whether we heed the lessons of this book."
152,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"There have been very long uneventful stretches and very, very occasionally ""revolutions on the surface of the earth."" To the extent that we can identify the causes of these revolutions, they're highly varied: glaciation in the case of the ordovician extinction, global warming and chances in chemistry at the end of the Permian, an asteroid impact in the final seconds of the Cretaceous. The current extinction has its own novel cause: not an asteroid or a massive volcanic eruption but ""one weedy species. As Walter Alvarez put it to me, ""We're seeing right now that a mass extinction can be cause by human beings."" (265-266) ""With the capacity to represent the world in signs and symbols comes the capacity to change it, which as it happens, is also the capacity to destroy it. A ting set of genetic variations divides us from the Neanderthals, but that has made all the difference. (258)It isn't unique to note that humanity has dangerously altered the planet in a way that no other species before it has done as conclusively demonstrated by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. What makes this book not only important but a must-read is the case by case basis which she follows through with each chapter of extinct or near-to-extinct case studies of populations of animals, from the American Mastodon to the frogs of central Panama to the Sumatran Rhino. Because of the subject matter and the grand question of purpose among our own species, the ones before us, and the ones that will come after we're gone, this book is something that stays with the reader afterwards, pondering the grand invention of creation, evolution, and eventual disarray. The book provides a great overview of the subject matter that newcomers will find informative and enjoyable, and despite the information presented, does offer glimpses of hope and even humour. What is so fascinating about the subject matter is the concept of how life has survived and altered itself time after time on our bountiful rock, and how little we as a species really understand the world we have seemingly (or rather forcibly) inherited. It was only roughly 300 years ago that palaeontology began to take it's first steps as a major science with the discovery of mastodon bones in North America, and that whole different worlds existed before ours. It was only in 1831 that Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle and made his way around the world, specifically to the Galapagos, giving us terms in his ""On the Origins of Species"" that now represent mainstream science. Neanderthals only were discovered shorted after Darwin's voyage, and it was only in 2004 that a hobbit like humanoid species was discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia. How freaking amazing and unbelievable is that?It was interested to see Kolbert's travels around the globe, diving into the globalisation aspects of humanity that give us terms like ""New Pangaea,"" how bat populations in the Northeastern part of the US have dropped off significantly do to factors that bats elsewhere in the world are immune to, the investigation into rainforest populations in South America, and the incredible efforts scientists are doing to protect endangered species, like giving rhinos ultrasounds and crows handjobs. It's a tale of our grim actions, but the hopeful aspects of our understanding of the world that can add it. The choice is up to us as a species."

154,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"It's absolutely, extremely, utterly, incredibly important for the general reader to remember that the real story of science is written in the language of mathematics. When authors put the story of scientific disciplines like physics, or chemistry or even biology into words and stories, they are translating something hard and complex and precise into a soft, fuzzy medium.It's analogous to knitting a replica of Michelangelo's David. Even if you are a genius knitter, the end result will only be (at best) a flabby simulacrum of the authentic object.If you experienced the knitted David (let's call him Dave) you would have a general, vague sense of what the real David was like. But you would be a long way away from really understanding the awe inspiring experience of the real deal.Let's take the analogy one step further. Imagine you're an alien, and you discovered the knitted Dave. But you had never seen the real David sculpture, or (more importantly) an actual human specimen. How much would you really understand about people, based on you're observations of the knitted Dave. You would have a very general sense. Enough to pick a hominid out of a crowd of donkeys. But that's about it. Better than nothing, but far from expertise. I love evolutionary biology and ecology and sociology. But I'm not trained in any of these disciplines. My understanding of them is via popularizations like this. Even within my discipline of clinical psychology, I'm barely educated. But outside of my discipline, I am essentially an enthusiastic dilettante. That's not a dis. That's just another way of saying, I haven't spent 4 years of undergraduate training to prepare for another 4 years of doctoral training to prepare for another 3-5 years of post doctoral training to prepare for another 10-20 years of professional research in any of those fields.Humans specialize. None of us could possibly be specialists in more than one or maybe two of these domains. There just isn't enough time in a human life span.I have a laypersons education of ecology and biology. That's nothing to scoff at. It took (literally) hundreds of hours of hard work, reading a bunch of books, taking classes, talking to experts etc. to gain my laypersons understanding of evolutionary biology. But honestly, I wouldn't know an actual darwinian algorithm from a hole in the ground, let alone be able to accurately interpret the findings of the mathematical models experts develop and use to understand complex systems like species population dynamics and ecosystems.So I have to rely on experts and science journalists to tell me the story in English. I need these dedicated, talented individuals to ""knit me a Dave"". That's exactly what Elizabeth Kolbert did. She knitted us a Dave. The Sixth Extinction is a soft, cuddly, children's storybook version of the hard, awful reality the actual experts in the field of biology and ecology are bearing witness to.If she had delivered us a harder version. It would have been (a) unintelligible to us mere mortals, and (b) so unspeakably awful, that most of us would have never, ever willingly subjected ourselves to this horrible, terrifying (much more than inconvenient) truth. Even the ""soft"" Dave version is pretty fucking tragic and demoralizing. If I were to give you a quick sketch analogy of what the knitted Dave of mass extinction looks like. Imagine a plush toy bat (flying mammal), stuffed with dead, decomposing frogs, with an invasive fungus choking his nostrils, literally starving to death, drooling acrid barren sea water and sputtering a creepy recorded (five nights at Freddie's) robot voice looping the phrase, ""we're all going to die a horrible, slow death, we're all going to suffocate in a giant cesspool of our own feces, and it's way too late to do anything about it"".Not exactly Tickle Me Elmo, but still, a very soft version of the reality.One can only imagine the horror that experts feel when they see entire species evaporate, or when they crunch the numbers and the results look like an ASCII skull and bones. You can imagine these nerdy bookworm types, realizing the awful reality and trying desperately to communicate the immense gravity of the situation to the stoners, jocks and rednecks who used to beat and torture them in high school, only to receive responses like ""The Bible says we can despoil the earth however we see fit"" or ""it's only a theory"" or ""not all scientists agree"" or ""it was cold for a few days this summer, so that proves global warming is a scam"".Even the most charismatic of the nerds, Think Neil Degrassi Tyson, Carl Sagan or Al Gore still only managed to capture the hearts and minds of ""egg head PBS types"", even when they limit their messages to what can be communicated via entertaining, schticky soundbites, Hollywood style computer animated visualizations and 30 minute PowerPoint slideshows.The Sixth Extinction goes at explaining the issue of the ecological disaster we currently find ourselves in by giving a brief history of the previous five mass extinction events that science has identified. Apparently global species population and diversity levels expand and contract regularly, but have dropped to next to nothing for various reasons thorough out the history of life on earth. The previous 5 mass extinction events are:1: the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event (occurring about 66 Ma) in which about 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. 2: the Triassic–Jurassic extinction (occurring about 201.3 Ma) in which about 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species went extinct.3: the Permian-Triassic transition. (occurring about 252 Ma). Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects).4: the Devonian Period (occurring 375–360 Ma), a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species.5: the Ordovician–Silurian extinction (occurring 450–440 Ma) killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.At one point, around 70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens almost went extinct. About 90% of us died. We got down to an estimated 40 breeding pairs. That's really close to extinction. But we showed em our bounce back stuff and boy look at us now!Now we're officially in the Holocene period (and have been for more than 10,000 years), but many scientists are pushing the point that we have officially exited the Holocene and entered an altogether new epoch that they are calling the Anthropocene. They argue that humans are having such a pronounced impact on the enviornment that we should be the titular species of this particular cene (hence the Anthro at the beginning of the word).They also argue that there is a new mass extinction event currently under way that may be the worst one yet. They are calling it the.... You guessed it....6: the Anthropocene extinction.That's awesome right? It's exciting to be a part of history. Even if it's potentially the end of it.Bad Boundaries:One of the salient points in the book is that global climate instability is not the only source of extinction. Another big problem happens when an ecosystems square footage is reduced or its boundaries are violated. Obviously deforestation is a huge problem. By making the rain forests land coverage smaller, it shrinks the biodiversity exponentially (there's that math stuff again). Apparently there's a formula for it that calculates the extinction rates as you down scale an environment. It's like the E=Mc2 of the apocalypse.But globalization is also a huge problem in that it introduces invasive species like rats into sensitive environments. Apparently rats have been hitching rides on boats for as long as people of been sailing.Invasive species can literally crash an ecology. In the book, Kolbert discusses a species of gray snake that was introduced to an island echo system that basically ate everything. It reduced to a tropical island full of pretty birds, lizards and bugs to pretty much just only snakes.Kolbert makes the gorgeous point that it's easy to vilify the little grey snake. But the snake isn't mean or immoral, it's amoral, meaning it's It's simply doing what it's hardwired to do. It's just trying to survive and reproduce. The Ultimate Invasive Species:In case you're wondering where this is going, the ultimate invasive species is us. Humans go just about everywhere And everywhere that humans go, almost everything else dies. It's not that were mean or immoral, were actually amoral in the same way the grey snake is. We're simply doing we're all hardwired to do. Survive and reproduce (with obvious exceptions, but not enough to make a critical difference).We like to hold ourselves to moral standards, and vilify some bad guys e.g. Dick Cheney (I'm not saying he's not, but just hear me out).The fact of the matter is, the Anthropocene extinction isn't happening because we're immoral. It's happening because we're amoral.It may seem like I'm splitting hairs but the distinction is important.Perhaps viewing ourselves as moral, and holding ourselves and others to standards of morality is part of the problem. Perhaps framing this ecological crisis as a moral issue is creating a fatal blind spot. Perhaps experimental psychology can be of assistance in explaining my point.Don't Diss Me:Cognitive dissonance is the very reliably observed psychological phenomena, whereby people (including you me and everybody we know) confabulate anxiety reducing fictions when confronted with our own amoral behavior.So in other words, when people realize that their behavior is incongruent with their values, they feel bad, but rather than change the behavior, they make up a story (no matter how absurd) that relieves them of the pain of their own hypocrisy. For example, consider a situation in which someone who places a value on being environmentally responsible just purchased a cool new chick magnet car that he later discovers is a gas guzzler.The conflict:It is important for the man to be (at least viewed as) a good steward of the environment. But he is now driving a babe getting machine that also happens to double as an earth warmer.As you can imagine, he's feeling rather conflicted about now. Drive a Prius and die a childless and alone, or drive the Maserati and repopulate Brentwood. In order to reduce the dissonance between his values and his behavior, he can (a) utilize public transportation more frequently (which is probably not going to happen, maybe in Seattle, not in L.A.), or he could (b) sell the car and purchase another one that gets better gas mileage (which, again, not hugely probable), or he could (c) convince himself that maybe all the global warming stuff is a little overblown, and one little Maserati aint gona kill nobody (which is a whole lot easier than option (a) or (b), and therefore pretty fucking likely).I know what you're thinking, ""other people do that, but I don't do that"". But you do, we all do, we just don't realize it. That's why they call it a blind spot.It sounds far fetched but cognitive dissonance has been observed in tightly controlled experiments again and again. Everyone does it. Even (no particularly) if you're a trained mental health professional,So maybe if we stop viewing the ecology issue moralistically, and start viewing it more pragmatically, than perhaps we can all stop pointing fingers and except the fact that we're all totally fucked and were going to die and there's noting we can do about it.No no. Of course there's something we can do about it. But we really need to accept that it's happening. Accept that were all complicit (even if you recycle), and then....I actually don't know what. But something I hope. Additionally, all of us regular people need to trust the experts. We may get a cold day in August and think we're all good. But that's not how this shit works. You have to do math and stuff. And odds are great that you don't. So trust the people that do and just do what they tell you. Even if you love Jesus. Which you probably don't if you're still reading this.Lastly, it occurred to me that I'm not going to face the worst of this, and my kid won't either, but her kids (should she ignore reason and reproduce) will. I'll just be honest here. Part of me has a hard time worrying past next week. And that same part of me kind of thinks, what ever, I'll be dead by then, and I know I'm not alone in this particular brand of denial. Cognitive dissonance ladies and gentlemen, don't let it win."
155,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2184529-justin-evans,3,"I'm glad this book was published, and glad it got so much attention. On the other hand, I wish it had been much better. The first half is solid, inasmuch as it has some information about the history, and historiography, of extinction. The second half gets a little head-banging-against-a-wall, with example after example of currently endangered or recently extinct species, all told in the same palatable way. So, beware reader, that if you are like me, you might want to skip this book. It goes to great lengths to be entertaining, but entertaining in a very New Yorker kind of way. We learn more, I would guess, about the appearance and dress of the scientists Kolbert meets than we do about the extinctions she describes. We hear a lot about how people feel. We get a lot of novelistic realism about animal's rumps. And I just don't care. So frustrated was I by Kolbert's presentation of genuinely disturbing events that I started to think what a counter-argument might look like. Here are a couple: i) Kolbert pushes the 'anthropocene' (i.e., the 'geological' epoch determined by the existence of humanity and our destruction of other species) into the *very* distant past, roughly, when the indigenous peoples of Australia first killed off the continent's mega-fauna. But it is utterly ridiculous to liken prehistoric, and 20th and 21st century, human impact on the environment. Not to put too fine a point on it, back then we were just another species, though a successful one. Today, we run the planet. Eliding that difference makes it impossible to recognize what has caused the vast majority of extinctions over the last two centuries, viz., uncontrolled economic development. That's an argument I believe. The next one I'm not so sure about, but I do think there's a case to be answered: ii) Extinction is a natural occurrence. Granted that it's greatly accelerated over the last couple of centuries, but really, why worry so much? What moral obligation do we have towards *species*, as opposed to *living individuals*? If you have to kill a hundred foxes to reintroduce a threatened species into their previously natural environment, is that really a moral thing to do? What about the foxes' lives, after all? And so on. This book doesn't deal with such problems, but then, it wasn't meant to. It is entertaining propaganda, and good on Kolbert for bringing the issues up in the first place. "

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human. (watch here"
157,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"Kolbert won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 2015 for this detailed study of the five mass extinctions over the last 500 million years, and the titular sixth extinction that she (and scores of researchers) says is occurring right now.She documents the conservation work in nearly every environment and landscape, and a number of living things: amphibians, trees, birds, corals, microorganisms, bats, rhinoceros, as well as many other species of living things. ""To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more or were willing to make sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter when lather people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.""Does it mean that any conservation effort is for naught? Have we crossed a threshold that we cannot uncross? Not sure. Very likely you won't be either after reading it.Lots to chew on here - not all that pleasant either. This book had me googling left and right to find more information and learn more. This is one I will be thinking about for a long time to come."

I have not been this disappointed in a book in a long while. More than a quarter of the length of the book was dedicated to notes. She touched on history as archeology has helped define it with reference to the past extinctions. I think, because she was being a writer, she needed to tell me things I didn't care to know, like what she and her research mates had for breakfast before they set out to discover whether or not a particular bug was or was not extinct.So here's the big spoiler alert.....she said humans were well on the way to an extinction and we were bringing it on ourselves. The sixth extinction is us. The one high point of the book for me was that she did not....to my memory....suggest that we could change things before it's too late. It seems to me she's saying it is already too late. There are just too many of us shitting in our own nest.....Michael"
159,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,3,"Fascinating topic, but has a bit of a lull in the middle that was a little hard to get through."
160,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,4,"Elizabeth Kolbert knows how to put things together. She managed to create a very thoroughly documented book and to raise awareness about the extinction of species.The five extinctions known in the history of Earth decimated the species up to 96% (a brief summary can be read here: https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontol...)The sixth extinction here in question is named so because of the rate at which species are disappearing now:
“Calculating the background extinction rate is a laborious task that entails combing through whole databases’ worth of fossils. For what’s probably the best-studied group, which is mammals, it’s been reckoned to be roughly .25 per million species-years. This means that, since there are about fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around today, at the background extinction rate you’d expect—once again, very roughly—one species to disappear every seven hundred years.A rigorous calculation of the background extinction rate for amphibians has not been performed, in part because amphibian fossils are so rare. Almost certainly, though, the rate is lower than it is for mammals. Probably, one amphibian species should go extinct every thousand years or so.Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world’s most endangered class of animals; it’s been calculated that the group’s extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.”
And we, humans, are to blame here. The book has plenty of examples in which we exterminated a lot of species: the one concerning the great auk is so heart-breaking depicted. I do hope this book to be read by as many people as possible and maybe something in our collective mentality will change. We are just one species among so many other and just because we are more intelligent than the others (debatable from my point of view) does not make us owners of this planet and its life forms.
”In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us? One possibility—the possibility implied by the Hall of Biodiversity—is that we, too, will eventually be undone by our “transformation of the ecological landscape.” The logic behind this way of thinking runs as follows: having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth’s biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems—cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans—we’re putting our own survival in danger.”
It is not an easy book but it is definitely worth reading."
161,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches. - Stanford ecologist Paul EhrlichAs far as science has been able to determine, there have been five mass extinctions of life on Earth in the history of our planet. The first of these occurred at the end of the Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era about 450 million years ago. The second occurred less than 100 million years later in the late Devonian period. There followed the End-Permian extinction of some 250 million years ago, the Late Triassic extinction of 200 million years ago, and finally, the last one and the one we are most familiar with, the End-Cretaceous extinction which occurred about 65 million years ago. That's the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. (Well, almost - except for the ancestors of birds.)The best evidence seems to indicate that all of these extinctions except for the last one were the result of climatological events, often relatively sudden events to which plants and animals did not have time to adapt. The cause of the fifth one was also a change in climate but it was brought about by a collision with an asteroid. That cataclysmic event so altered the climate of the planet for a time that many, many species died out either suddenly or over a period of years.Scientists believe that we are now in the midst of the sixth extinction which Earth has endured and that this extinction is entirely human-caused. Elizabeth Kolbert writes in this book about how our species has altered life on the planet as no other species has before. It's not just that we are changing the climate for the worse, although that certainly is a big part of it, but we also have altered the face of Earth and the chemistry of the oceans to the detriment of very many species.One of the biggest problems that we have created for other species is simply the fact that we move everything around and wherever we go on Earth, it seems that some species hitch a ride with us. So a species from Asia that would never under normal circumstances make it to the Americas is brought here either wittingly or unwittingly and it wreaks havoc. Kolbert points out that the most endangered family of animals on Earth today are the amphibians. They are being wiped out by a fungus that has been spread around the world by humans. Kolbert writes about a dozen species, some of them already irrevocably lost and others on their way out. Through these very personal stories of that wonderful bird the Great Auk, the Panamanian golden frog, staghorn coral, the Sumatran rhino and others, the reader is moved to begin to understand the enormity of what is happening. What we are causing to happen to our world. It is somewhat surprising to learn that the concept of extinction is not a very old one. Kolbert points out that it was first articulated by Georges Cuvier in the revolutionary Paris of the 18th century. As always it seems, with any new scientific idea or concept, it took a while for it to be accepted, but later work by paleontologists has confirmed Cuvier's findings.This is a well-written book which can popularize scientific concepts and principles for a mass audience. It is an easy read and a fairly short one at less than 300 pages. Kolbert includes extensive notes and bibliography for those who wish to read more on the subject."
162,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17061542-zoe-s-human,4,"I learned many new things and I laughed a few times as well. That's pretty much a win for non-fiction. Humanity's impact on the environment tends to either be presented in a deliberately polarizing manner for political reasons or presented with assumptions of scientific knowledge which most lack. The author did an amazing job of explaining the science behind the impact in layman's terms without omitting details that frequently don't make ""news"" stories on the topic. She even took the time to explain how mistakes and theory discrepancies happen in science. Even better, she did all of this calmly by presenting facts and logic without resorting to emotional manipulation.I loved the inclusion of small personal notes about the assorted scientists featured. While such asides don't contribute to the main premise of the book, they do make it much more engaging. Between that and her wonderful descriptive style, I found myself able to visualize her experiences and environments with a fullness usually only found in fiction.There are two things which would have greatly enhanced my pleasure in this book. An insert of color photos of the assorted plants and animals discussed would be awesome. I did Google quite a bit while reading this and it would have been preferable to have photos right in the book.Additionally, a chart/timeline depicting the assorted eras and epochs mentioned in chronological order with dates and maybe a few sample organisms listed for each section would have been great. Perhaps with the mass extinctions and suggested range for the anthropocene marked as well? As clear as her explanations were, some information processes better in images than text.Things I think should be changed before the final release:The graph on page 16 is hella blurry.On page 46 at the end of chapter 2, she first mentions that the megafauna extinction is becoming understood as being the result of the spread of modern humans. No specifics are gone into on this until page 230. This left me wary that she was going to start making assertions without any kind of backup in the beginning of the book and I felt a bit weirded out all the way through the book by that hanging thread even when it became clear that she was validating her beliefs with facts. As a reader, it would have been better for that statement to have been omitted in chapter 2 if it wasn't going to be developed for almost 200 pages. At the very least, it should be noted that it will be expanded upon later in the book.Page 86, line 19, the paragraph that starts with ""The bolide arrived from the southeast..."" I'm assuming that ""doe to its trajectory"" (later in that paragraph) should read due ""to its trajectory.""The last sentence on 113 going over to page 114 reads ""Change the atmosphere's composition atmosphere..."" Is that right? It seems like the second atmosphere is superfluous or at least awkward.I would omit the bit about the gift shop cashier not showing Ms. Kolbert around from page 226. It comes across petty and unflattering to the author. Even if there were no other customers, it's a given in *any* clerking job that you don't leave the shop unattended. You can get fired for that.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway. Many thanks to all involved in providing me with this opportunity."

In the pages that follow, I try to convey both sides: the excitement of what's being learned as well as the horror of it."" (3)Mission accomplished. I learned something, and I felt something.Kolbert writes scientific journalism with the best of them and here she distills a lot of contemporary findings into easily conveyed factoids for the layperson. She tells a dynamic story but with very little pearl-clutching. She's largely neutral in her presentation, though she doesn't shy away from the (well-supported and widely accepted) thesis that it's human activity that's effected the climate change resulting in subsequent extinctions and a vast reduction to Earth's biodiversity. Maybe it's too late for us to halt the sweeping global change humankind has generated, but like it or not it's inexcusable to not pay attention and not learn about it. And those skeptical or uninterested in hearing anyone try to cram environmentalism down their throat with a lot of moralizing needn't fear. There are many chapters that focus on other, nonhuman catastrophes and extinction events, how they were discovered and how they shaped modern scientific thought and theory.And stylistically, her prose is entertaining and never dull. Just one example:When I visited Reserve 1202, I ran into a graduate student from Portugal who was surveying bats. At noon he had just recently woken up and was eating pasta in a shed that served as a research station-cum-kitchen. While we were talking, a very skinny cowboy rode up on an only slightly less skinny horse. He had a rifle slung over one shoulder. I wasn't sure whether he'd come because he'd heard the truck I'd arrived on and wanted to protect the student from possible intruders, or because he sensed that there was pasta. (174)5 stars out of 5. Informative and entertaining. A big win for popular science fans."

Exploring the other five extinctions in the past and comparing them to the current destruction of the biosphere is sobering. It is unclear whether the sixth will surpass the other five (each extinction had its own pathology) or if we will survive the catastrophe we created but it is not pleasant to read about. This is one of those books that reminds the reader that it is worse than you think by far. I am not sure how to read the forensics of armageddon being shielded from nature by modern life, one will put this book down and pick up another at least until the resources run out. What books like this usually elicit are deer in the headlights paralysis or ostrich-like behavior or a shrug of the shoulders. Kind of strange the way we respond selectively to threats. If species extinction flew a plane into a building may be the human race would respond."

Depressing as heck, but if you want a good overview of the challenges facing our planet in regards to humans and how we are changing the earth and its ecosystems I recommend this. There is no doubt in my mind that we have started a cascade of environmental collapses that is going to be hard to curtail. We have to try and minimize the damage, the challenge will be beyond difficult, but it is a noble goal. "

I want to not feel that the earth is so doomed by our simply negligent hand. I want to write a series of children’s stories teaching them about the Frozen Zoo, and the drones that leads new flocks of birds in the wild to repopulate and make sure they land on safe ground, and apes that are domesticating dogs, that make tools, that every day we learn they are just a bit smarter than we thought. This is a horror story through and through about the changes going on in this world because of how we live our lives, because of how homo sapiens have ALWAYS lived their lives even before we started burning fossil fuels and putting pesticide on everything. I want to go on a tour and shake the hand of everyone working desperately to create safety arks for animals that we are abandoning by our own callousness. I want to visit these refuges and revel in them, and then leave, hopefully, with no trace of ever having been there.And now, I’ll just let the book speak for itself. The only thing I could have asked for it is that for it to be longer. “One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is that the world is changing in ways that compel species to move, and another is that it’s changing in ways that create barriers—roads, clear-cuts, cities—that prevent them from doing so.”“By burning through coal and oil deposits, humans are putting carbon back into the air that has been sequestered for tens—in most cases hundreds—of millions of years. In the process, we are running geologic history not only in reverse but at warp speed.” The anthropologist Richard Leakey has warned that “Homo sapiens might not only be the agent of the sixth extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.” A sign in the Hall of Biodiversity offers a quote from the Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich: IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” “coral cover in the Caribbean has in recent decades declined by close to eighty percent.”“Asian elephants have declined by fifty percent over the last three generations.” “some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere.” “WHY is ocean acidification so dangerous? The question is tough to answer only because the list of reasons is so long. Depending on how tightly organisms are able to regulate their internal chemistry, acidification may affect such basic processes as metabolism, enzyme activity, and protein function. Because it will” "

In North America, the bat population has dropped to next to nothing due to a fungi from Europe, with which European bats live quite happily, but which kill their American counterparts by the millions.""In times of extreme stress, the whole concept of fitness, at least in a Darwinian sense, loses its meaning: how could a creature be adapter, either well or ill, for conditions it has never before encountered in its entire evolutionary history?"" Then theres's the human induced global warming caused by billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere and into the oceans. There is also the impact of habitat loss due to human population explosion. Habitat loss, introduction of alien species and diseases, pouching, changing of living conditions to climate change - all of this means that we are living in a time when the extinction rate far surpasses the background rate. ""Right now, in the amazing mment that to us counts as the present, we are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will forever be closed.""Quite possibly, we are sawing off the branch we sit on.

Life would also surely bound back eventually, long after the last descendant of bipedal, hairless apes have vanished.This is a highly informative, well-written and captivating book. It explains the earlier big exctinctions and why there is one caused by us, happening now. It is a complex topic and this journalist does a job of presenting the facts in an understandable manner. I happened to read in a newspaper while reading this book, that just in England, 421 species have been lost in 200 years. This isn't propaganda - this is really happening. Highly recommended."

Unfortunately, I struggled with finishing it and walked away from it several times before I finally finished. Despite my statements, I want to make it clear that my failure to enjoy this book had nothing to do with the quality of the writing. It was clear that Ms. Kolbert spent a great deal of time researching.. traveling to various habitats for a first hand observation of the species which have already disappeared and the ones who are on the brink. She obtained an enormous amount of information from various scientists and even provided photographs. I simply found that the book could not hold my attention. Perhaps if I had more of a knowledge base in animal biology, botany and environmental science, I could have enjoyed this book more than I did. Or perhaps if I had just put it aside to come back to it at a later time, I would have gotten more out of it… regardless, the book just did not hold my interest. That said, I would not discourage anyone else from reading the book. The failure to enjoy was mine. "

The book covers a lot of ground, from Georges Cuvier, Darwin, to modern day ecology and conservations, from arctic to tropical rain forests, from national parks to zoos. I've learned lot of about extinctions in the earth history and the current ongoing extinction—the sixth extinction that is solely humans' doing. Perhaps the reason that we, homo sapiens, have become the dominate species of the world, is the same reason that will cause our own eventual extinction."

It’s particularly hard to read a book such as this knowing things will likely only get worse with the donkey that is our President leading one of the world’s most powerful nations.

It’s a riveting topic, the history of our world and our species, and Elizabeth Kolbert has the knack of writing about science so it retains all its natural fascination while still being accessible to laypeople. She takes the reader with her back in time and around the world as she accompanies researchers in places ranging from the Andes mountains to the Great Barrier Reef. One particular fact has really stuck with me--as human activity increasingly homogenizes the global environment by transporting plants and animals all over the planet biodiversity is increasing on the small scale, so that where you live is likely to have more species than it did formerly, but because invasive flora and fauna can wipe out native plants and animals global biodiversity is rapidly shrinking as the total number of species on the Earth continues to dwindle. And that’s the point of the title, The Sixth Extinction. There have been five periods of mass extinction on our planet and some scientists are finding evidence indicating that we may be on the cusp of or even in the midst of a sixth wave of mass die offs, this one caused by the activities of humans, a chilling realization."
173,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'The Sixth Extinction' is written like a magazine article for a general reader, yet it tells intelligently an engaging true science story about several various geological locations important to the history of the scientific discoveries about evolution and extinction. The author personally visits and describes sites around the world - islands, forests, oceans, caves, museums - some of which take a lot of effort and discomfort to reach. These particular locations have a huge importance because each site is where an 'eureka!' moment occurred for a scientist who was often there for a different reason, but then he discovered something else instead; something which ended in clearing up everything confusing or wrong about our understanding of how the earth's climate changed in the past and is changing now. The discovery that the macro-climate can change on earth, and has apparently changed five times previously, and that these macro-climate changes also appear to be linked to changes in local animals and plants as well. It took time before everyone accepted the evidence presented that the earth and its environment has changed dramatically several times, and even longer for scientists to agree what the evidence signified. Early scientists had to not only accept the evidence of their own eyes and discoveries, they had to overcome biblical teachings which had told them the earth cannot change because it must be as perfect as the god who created it 6,000 years previously. These early struggles with the Church in interpreting physical clues are what led to the 'scientific method' of proving beyond doubt the conclusions reached from actually studying physical discoveries and not relying on religious beliefs from ancient scriptures. (One of the Church's precepts was everything on earth was unchanging and perfect. The fact that animals could die off as a species and disappear permanently from the face of the earth, or even worse, evolve, was not a possibility if the Church or the bible was correct. In time, the preponderance of the physical evidence overwhelmed the bible's myths. The author hints at the scientific disarray in accepting the facts of living creatures changing and disappearing because of the rigid philosophical belief in an unchanging world, but she does not dive into the religious elements which delayed the conclusions from scientific discoveries.)I found the book easy to read and understand. The facts and history of the concepts of evolution and climate change are conversationally and logically introduced. It deepened my understanding of how the scientists know climate changed billions of years ago and is changing now, and how they know the current change is already affecting life dramatically. Instead of jargon, you'll be able to speak it in plain English.The three issues the author gently exposes, after unobtrusively teaching us history, is how Humanity is involved, perhaps primarily responsible, in the current sixth ongoing climate change because: one, of our restless traveling around the world transporting, mostly unwisely, other life forms; as well as two, the CO2 we are pumping into the air from our gasoline-fueled cars and coal burning for electrical energy, which is changing (killing) the seas, trees/forests and wildlife the world over; and our extermination of animals in hunting for food, fun and profit (animals affect the type and quantity/quality of plants in their environment through their activities and nutritional needs, and by the symbiotic or otherwise interested neighbor animals who want to live close to their prey food). Your grandkids may not grow up with the trees, insects or local neighborhood wild animals and birds you did, or have cheap water to drink or cheap electricity to run their devices. The air certainly will be different.After finishing this book, you might want to look at a fiction novel, The Road. Warning: it's an extremely terrifying look at living in a world utterly wrecked environmentally, and it had me in tears.The following opinions are all me, and not in this science book. I think we will be the first species in earth's history that had the power to destroy AND save the earth, as well as ourselves, but we couldn't focus. Instead, we chose to party on: 1. hunt and kill off the last mega fauna like rhinoceroses and sharks to eat their horns/fins for that important personal 15-minute sexual erection; 2. cut down the annoying mega-flora for more houses and cheap furniture and better views; 3. put personal mega-billions of capital to work as investments in dozens of mansions/property around the world (plus living in one or three mansions isn't enough of an exercise of personal power, which is why the addition of environmentally controlled garages to house the yachts, the hundreds of 'antique' cars that will never be driven, to possess shoes, dresses and purses purchased for thousands of dollars each, etc. - conspicuous consumption being a tried-and-true method of relieving the boredom of wealth); 4. become socially powerful enough to manipulate/buy political votes to benefit/protect individual sources of capital; 5. use valuable resources to make war murder mayhem because of displaced aggression and blood lust; 6. make more babies because a priest/minister/Imam says god hates contraception (more mouths to feed, house and poop);7. For every facility which finally reduces their air/water/soil pollutants after decades of extended court fights, nine other facilities continue to pollute excessively around the world.8. and pray fruitlessly in religious rituals for a god to tell us our marching orders (which will never occur). We REALLY should be more environmentally responsible for our own self and the others who depend on us, but honestly? I don't think it's gonna happen. Anyone else notice, for example, how the local waters are too polluted for your kids to fish and swim in today, but you remember happily doing both safely? Anyone else notice how more flooding occurs in your neighborhood today? Anyone else notice how the local birds, bees and animal life have disappeared around your house? Anyone else notice the mountains of trash everywhere? Or the fouled beaches because the sewage treatment facility, overwhelmed again, had a spill? For the record, I believe we are doomed as a viable species. We don't seem to be able to overcome our DNA inheritance or be able to reprogram our animal brain desires for immediate emotional rush satisfactions. Our lusts for sex, social/tribal affiliation, personal power and self-aggrandizement, chocolate, drama, speed, explosions and killing things overwhelm our strengths in planning ahead, memory, intelligence, education, math and spatial skills, creativity, building tools, feelings that a single sacrifice for the many is worthy, love, affection, empathy, sharing the abundance and living in moderation. Our archaeological record, when it is dug up and discovered by the next species to rise to intelligence and tool-building a million years from now, after Homo sapiens has disappeared, will be condensed down to 'we coulda and we shoulda, but we didna'."

It's quite a topic - what we are doing to the world, and what we have done and what we are likely going to do. This mostly wasn't new information to me - but the acidification of the oceans was new. I mean I see the headlines and I know it's a issue, but I didn't understand the nature of it, or make the connection to shells and reefs.What I like about the book is, first of all, that it's getting read. The more people who read this the better. It's good information. Even well informed people don't generally grasp the scope and extent of what we are doing to our planet. She mixes in the dire future predictions, and the uncertainties of these, with lots of interesting historical details on science coming to terms with extinction, and other related topics. She covers in some detail three of the five major extinction events (why only three?) The problem with ocean acidification, in brief, is how it affects animals that secrete shells or any hard carbonate-mineral parts, especially in the common form of aragonite. This stuff dissolves in acid. The extra CO2 in the air leads to more of it getting absorbed into the ocean, and this makes the oceans more acidic. The acidity makes these hard parts more soluble, as in closer to actually dissolving, and therefore they become harder to make and animals make less of them. So, as the acidity increases, our corals start making less exoskeleton and eventually will just stop, meaning our coral reefs will die. We have made the oceans 40% more acidic then they were before the industrial revolution. My one complaint is that the book seems to target our emotions more than I'm comfortable with. It's really a borderline issue - unless you listen on audio. The reader, Anne Twomey, insanely over-dramatizes the book, weakening it the severely. It sounds like a bad psuedo-science show on a coming UFO invasion. (I did listen to sample before I purchased. There was a very passionate and professional reader. Only after I purchased did I learn that the sample was Kolbert herself, reading the prologue. Wish she had read the whole book.)We have all read plenty of everyone-should-read-this-book comments on important nonfiction books, and that does add a bit of discouragement into the encouragement. I hope the later overpowers the former. Everyone should be reading books like this."

Apart from the stereotypical acts of human depravity, there is also the passive damage inflicted on the natural world by our very existence. In Elizabeth Kolbert's outstanding The Sixth Extinction, the author writes in exceptionally readable and compelling language on a subject that is essential reading for members of our species.  Eschewing one particular approach to the depiction of extinction, Kolbert alternates the subjects of her chapters between multiple disciplines. History, geology, biology, ecology, and many other disciplines all make for a varied and hard-hitting treatise on the demise of the world's organisms. What's more, Kolbert breaks up her exposition with her experiences at the various places around earth on which she writes. These sections ground what can be very esoteric subject matter as the effects of these theories are seen through Kolbert's eyes. In a similar vein, Kolbert's aim with the book is not to accuse and depress, rather she seeks to educate the populace on the changes occurring on Earth. I have read many reviews that called this book depressing and guilt-inducing, however it was my feeling that the book maintains an upbeat, yet objective, tone throughout.  I am more likely to be found reading fiction than nonfiction; stories and characters have always interested me more than fact and figures. Perhaps it is that my professional days are filled with fact that I seek escape on my personal time. Despite this predilection for fiction, I am occasionally taken in by a nonfiction book and revel in the fashion the author arrives at their conclusion. The Sixth Extinction not only has the benefit of being one such book, it also has the prestige of being a book of great importance. If you're overwhelmed and unaffected by the media's liberal use of global warming, climate change, ocean acidification, and extinction events then this is exactly the book you should be reading. Its appeal is visceral as well as intellectual, and should be read by as many humans as possible. After all, we just happen to be the book's primary villains."

This non-fiction science book briefly covers the major and minor extinction cycles that have occured over the life of the planet, as well as current theories as to what caused them. The book is divided into 13 chapters, and each chapter deals with a specific current extinction, or near extinction, event. I loved the dots that this book connected for me. I loved that this current extinction cycle (clearly caused by Sapiens) is discussed in the context of the very long history of the planet. I loved learning about things I had no idea about, annual coral reef sex orgies comes to mind, and was saddened to learn about some of the species that have gone the way of the Dodo in my lifetime. I loved the science and learning about some scientists I knew nothing about. There is so much covered here, but all in a very accessible, easy to read manner. I am surprised that I was left with a feeling of hope at the end of this book. Not because I think that Humans will halt or reverse the processes we have put into play, but rather because after we become extinct, life will continue to find a way. Context is everything. I highly recommend this one."

So yeah, it felt like a timely choice!Fortunately for me, Adam, with his scientist mind, is more reserved in his judgment and optimistic in his outlook than I am.

There's something very magical about it, as if the planet is getting a good spring cleaning and all its inhabitants an urgently needed recalibrating of priorities. I love how people who do important jobs are suddenly getting all the love instead of narcissistic moronic reality TV celebrities and the like who had the limelight before. And the absence of cars, especially at night, is wonderful. The shot of the Himalayas visible from New Delhi for the first time in decades was especially poignant. And, on the whole, people are more friendly. There's a lot more generosity towards the poor. And so many health workers over here in the UK are of ethnic minority backgrounds that racism more than ever has been highlighted as the outlandish unforgivable expression of brute stupidity it is. The virus has made a nonsense of militant nationalism too. Takes a pandemic for most to understand that every border is in essence illusory; that we're all in this together. And how pettily absurd Brexit now seems. I hope this new generation will take on board this rejigging of social and ethical priorities and as a result be much more committed to looking after the planet.   Anyway, Elizabeth Kolbert in this book visits a series of research centres all over the globe, all with their own specialised subject, all charting and trying to prevent the sudden alarming demise of various species of mammal, bird, reptile and insect. She intersperses these individual and local sagas with an overview of how extinctions have occurred in the planet's history. Meticulously and convincingly she helps us to understand how quickly and carelessly we're heading towards the next big extinction, the first caused by humans. I liked this more than The Uninhabitable Earth because it's completely cleansed of the hellfire indignation which for me marred David Wallace-Wells' book."

You won’t be after you read this.Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it. To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly. Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.Harboring some hubris about your place in the world? Here’s a tonic:a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man—the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories—will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper.What else can I say about this book? The picture Kolbert paints of our situation is every bit as depressing as you might expect. I already knew the facts about climate change and animal extinction, but according to Kolbert the prognosis is even worse than I was aware, given that ocean acidification – “global warming’s ‘equally evil twin’” – is one contributor I hadn’t ever considered. Likewise, though I’d heard about the crisis with the world’s amphibians, I was entirely ignorant of the bat cataclysm (white-nose syndrome).As a longtime New Yorker journalist, Kolbert writes at a good level for laymen: not talking down, but not assuming any specialist knowledge either. I was somewhat unconvinced by her thematic, species-by-species approach here; it makes each chapter more like an individual essay than a part of a larger argument. Winging her way around the world (what carbon footprint?!), she considers auks and ammonites, mastodons and endangered zoo animals in captive breeding programs, dying coral reefs, and pockets of Amazonian rainforest. By the end, you’ll be in no doubt that we are in the middle of a major extinction event, and that our era will be known as the “Anthropocene” – the age of the influence of man.Luckily, there are spots of humor to lighten the tone, such as “The reason this book is being written by a hairy biped, rather than a scaly one, has more to do with dinosaurian misfortune than with any particular mammalian virtue.”As Caspar Henderson writes in his Guardian review, “The extinction crisis is so vast and complex that it almost repels thought. We need a lot more imaginative thinking about the choices we can make and what comes next.” Now that this has won a Pulitzer, one hopes it will get people talking and doing some of that imaginative thinking. Unfortunately, it’s so much easier to bury heads in the sand and keep going as we have been. Time will tell whether we heed the lessons of this book."
182,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"There have been very long uneventful stretches and very, very occasionally ""revolutions on the surface of the earth."" To the extent that we can identify the causes of these revolutions, they're highly varied: glaciation in the case of the ordovician extinction, global warming and chances in chemistry at the end of the Permian, an asteroid impact in the final seconds of the Cretaceous. The current extinction has its own novel cause: not an asteroid or a massive volcanic eruption but ""one weedy species. As Walter Alvarez put it to me, ""We're seeing right now that a mass extinction can be cause by human beings."" (265-266) ""With the capacity to represent the world in signs and symbols comes the capacity to change it, which as it happens, is also the capacity to destroy it. A ting set of genetic variations divides us from the Neanderthals, but that has made all the difference. (258)It isn't unique to note that humanity has dangerously altered the planet in a way that no other species before it has done as conclusively demonstrated by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. What makes this book not only important but a must-read is the case by case basis which she follows through with each chapter of extinct or near-to-extinct case studies of populations of animals, from the American Mastodon to the frogs of central Panama to the Sumatran Rhino. Because of the subject matter and the grand question of purpose among our own species, the ones before us, and the ones that will come after we're gone, this book is something that stays with the reader afterwards, pondering the grand invention of creation, evolution, and eventual disarray. The book provides a great overview of the subject matter that newcomers will find informative and enjoyable, and despite the information presented, does offer glimpses of hope and even humour. What is so fascinating about the subject matter is the concept of how life has survived and altered itself time after time on our bountiful rock, and how little we as a species really understand the world we have seemingly (or rather forcibly) inherited. It was only roughly 300 years ago that palaeontology began to take it's first steps as a major science with the discovery of mastodon bones in North America, and that whole different worlds existed before ours. It was only in 1831 that Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle and made his way around the world, specifically to the Galapagos, giving us terms in his ""On the Origins of Species"" that now represent mainstream science. Neanderthals only were discovered shorted after Darwin's voyage, and it was only in 2004 that a hobbit like humanoid species was discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia. How freaking amazing and unbelievable is that?It was interested to see Kolbert's travels around the globe, diving into the globalisation aspects of humanity that give us terms like ""New Pangaea,"" how bat populations in the Northeastern part of the US have dropped off significantly do to factors that bats elsewhere in the world are immune to, the investigation into rainforest populations in South America, and the incredible efforts scientists are doing to protect endangered species, like giving rhinos ultrasounds and crows handjobs. It's a tale of our grim actions, but the hopeful aspects of our understanding of the world that can add it. The choice is up to us as a species."

184,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"It's absolutely, extremely, utterly, incredibly important for the general reader to remember that the real story of science is written in the language of mathematics. When authors put the story of scientific disciplines like physics, or chemistry or even biology into words and stories, they are translating something hard and complex and precise into a soft, fuzzy medium.It's analogous to knitting a replica of Michelangelo's David. Even if you are a genius knitter, the end result will only be (at best) a flabby simulacrum of the authentic object.If you experienced the knitted David (let's call him Dave) you would have a general, vague sense of what the real David was like. But you would be a long way away from really understanding the awe inspiring experience of the real deal.Let's take the analogy one step further. Imagine you're an alien, and you discovered the knitted Dave. But you had never seen the real David sculpture, or (more importantly) an actual human specimen. How much would you really understand about people, based on you're observations of the knitted Dave. You would have a very general sense. Enough to pick a hominid out of a crowd of donkeys. But that's about it. Better than nothing, but far from expertise. I love evolutionary biology and ecology and sociology. But I'm not trained in any of these disciplines. My understanding of them is via popularizations like this. Even within my discipline of clinical psychology, I'm barely educated. But outside of my discipline, I am essentially an enthusiastic dilettante. That's not a dis. That's just another way of saying, I haven't spent 4 years of undergraduate training to prepare for another 4 years of doctoral training to prepare for another 3-5 years of post doctoral training to prepare for another 10-20 years of professional research in any of those fields.Humans specialize. None of us could possibly be specialists in more than one or maybe two of these domains. There just isn't enough time in a human life span.I have a laypersons education of ecology and biology. That's nothing to scoff at. It took (literally) hundreds of hours of hard work, reading a bunch of books, taking classes, talking to experts etc. to gain my laypersons understanding of evolutionary biology. But honestly, I wouldn't know an actual darwinian algorithm from a hole in the ground, let alone be able to accurately interpret the findings of the mathematical models experts develop and use to understand complex systems like species population dynamics and ecosystems.So I have to rely on experts and science journalists to tell me the story in English. I need these dedicated, talented individuals to ""knit me a Dave"". That's exactly what Elizabeth Kolbert did. She knitted us a Dave. The Sixth Extinction is a soft, cuddly, children's storybook version of the hard, awful reality the actual experts in the field of biology and ecology are bearing witness to.If she had delivered us a harder version. It would have been (a) unintelligible to us mere mortals, and (b) so unspeakably awful, that most of us would have never, ever willingly subjected ourselves to this horrible, terrifying (much more than inconvenient) truth. Even the ""soft"" Dave version is pretty fucking tragic and demoralizing. If I were to give you a quick sketch analogy of what the knitted Dave of mass extinction looks like. Imagine a plush toy bat (flying mammal), stuffed with dead, decomposing frogs, with an invasive fungus choking his nostrils, literally starving to death, drooling acrid barren sea water and sputtering a creepy recorded (five nights at Freddie's) robot voice looping the phrase, ""we're all going to die a horrible, slow death, we're all going to suffocate in a giant cesspool of our own feces, and it's way too late to do anything about it"".Not exactly Tickle Me Elmo, but still, a very soft version of the reality.One can only imagine the horror that experts feel when they see entire species evaporate, or when they crunch the numbers and the results look like an ASCII skull and bones. You can imagine these nerdy bookworm types, realizing the awful reality and trying desperately to communicate the immense gravity of the situation to the stoners, jocks and rednecks who used to beat and torture them in high school, only to receive responses like ""The Bible says we can despoil the earth however we see fit"" or ""it's only a theory"" or ""not all scientists agree"" or ""it was cold for a few days this summer, so that proves global warming is a scam"".Even the most charismatic of the nerds, Think Neil Degrassi Tyson, Carl Sagan or Al Gore still only managed to capture the hearts and minds of ""egg head PBS types"", even when they limit their messages to what can be communicated via entertaining, schticky soundbites, Hollywood style computer animated visualizations and 30 minute PowerPoint slideshows.The Sixth Extinction goes at explaining the issue of the ecological disaster we currently find ourselves in by giving a brief history of the previous five mass extinction events that science has identified. Apparently global species population and diversity levels expand and contract regularly, but have dropped to next to nothing for various reasons thorough out the history of life on earth. The previous 5 mass extinction events are:1: the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event (occurring about 66 Ma) in which about 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. 2: the Triassic–Jurassic extinction (occurring about 201.3 Ma) in which about 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species went extinct.3: the Permian-Triassic transition. (occurring about 252 Ma). Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects).4: the Devonian Period (occurring 375–360 Ma), a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species.5: the Ordovician–Silurian extinction (occurring 450–440 Ma) killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.At one point, around 70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens almost went extinct. About 90% of us died. We got down to an estimated 40 breeding pairs. That's really close to extinction. But we showed em our bounce back stuff and boy look at us now!Now we're officially in the Holocene period (and have been for more than 10,000 years), but many scientists are pushing the point that we have officially exited the Holocene and entered an altogether new epoch that they are calling the Anthropocene. They argue that humans are having such a pronounced impact on the enviornment that we should be the titular species of this particular cene (hence the Anthro at the beginning of the word).They also argue that there is a new mass extinction event currently under way that may be the worst one yet. They are calling it the.... You guessed it....6: the Anthropocene extinction.That's awesome right? It's exciting to be a part of history. Even if it's potentially the end of it.Bad Boundaries:One of the salient points in the book is that global climate instability is not the only source of extinction. Another big problem happens when an ecosystems square footage is reduced or its boundaries are violated. Obviously deforestation is a huge problem. By making the rain forests land coverage smaller, it shrinks the biodiversity exponentially (there's that math stuff again). Apparently there's a formula for it that calculates the extinction rates as you down scale an environment. It's like the E=Mc2 of the apocalypse.But globalization is also a huge problem in that it introduces invasive species like rats into sensitive environments. Apparently rats have been hitching rides on boats for as long as people of been sailing.Invasive species can literally crash an ecology. In the book, Kolbert discusses a species of gray snake that was introduced to an island echo system that basically ate everything. It reduced to a tropical island full of pretty birds, lizards and bugs to pretty much just only snakes.Kolbert makes the gorgeous point that it's easy to vilify the little grey snake. But the snake isn't mean or immoral, it's amoral, meaning it's It's simply doing what it's hardwired to do. It's just trying to survive and reproduce. The Ultimate Invasive Species:In case you're wondering where this is going, the ultimate invasive species is us. Humans go just about everywhere And everywhere that humans go, almost everything else dies. It's not that were mean or immoral, were actually amoral in the same way the grey snake is. We're simply doing we're all hardwired to do. Survive and reproduce (with obvious exceptions, but not enough to make a critical difference).We like to hold ourselves to moral standards, and vilify some bad guys e.g. Dick Cheney (I'm not saying he's not, but just hear me out).The fact of the matter is, the Anthropocene extinction isn't happening because we're immoral. It's happening because we're amoral.It may seem like I'm splitting hairs but the distinction is important.Perhaps viewing ourselves as moral, and holding ourselves and others to standards of morality is part of the problem. Perhaps framing this ecological crisis as a moral issue is creating a fatal blind spot. Perhaps experimental psychology can be of assistance in explaining my point.Don't Diss Me:Cognitive dissonance is the very reliably observed psychological phenomena, whereby people (including you me and everybody we know) confabulate anxiety reducing fictions when confronted with our own amoral behavior.So in other words, when people realize that their behavior is incongruent with their values, they feel bad, but rather than change the behavior, they make up a story (no matter how absurd) that relieves them of the pain of their own hypocrisy. For example, consider a situation in which someone who places a value on being environmentally responsible just purchased a cool new chick magnet car that he later discovers is a gas guzzler.The conflict:It is important for the man to be (at least viewed as) a good steward of the environment. But he is now driving a babe getting machine that also happens to double as an earth warmer.As you can imagine, he's feeling rather conflicted about now. Drive a Prius and die a childless and alone, or drive the Maserati and repopulate Brentwood. In order to reduce the dissonance between his values and his behavior, he can (a) utilize public transportation more frequently (which is probably not going to happen, maybe in Seattle, not in L.A.), or he could (b) sell the car and purchase another one that gets better gas mileage (which, again, not hugely probable), or he could (c) convince himself that maybe all the global warming stuff is a little overblown, and one little Maserati aint gona kill nobody (which is a whole lot easier than option (a) or (b), and therefore pretty fucking likely).I know what you're thinking, ""other people do that, but I don't do that"". But you do, we all do, we just don't realize it. That's why they call it a blind spot.It sounds far fetched but cognitive dissonance has been observed in tightly controlled experiments again and again. Everyone does it. Even (no particularly) if you're a trained mental health professional,So maybe if we stop viewing the ecology issue moralistically, and start viewing it more pragmatically, than perhaps we can all stop pointing fingers and except the fact that we're all totally fucked and were going to die and there's noting we can do about it.No no. Of course there's something we can do about it. But we really need to accept that it's happening. Accept that were all complicit (even if you recycle), and then....I actually don't know what. But something I hope. Additionally, all of us regular people need to trust the experts. We may get a cold day in August and think we're all good. But that's not how this shit works. You have to do math and stuff. And odds are great that you don't. So trust the people that do and just do what they tell you. Even if you love Jesus. Which you probably don't if you're still reading this.Lastly, it occurred to me that I'm not going to face the worst of this, and my kid won't either, but her kids (should she ignore reason and reproduce) will. I'll just be honest here. Part of me has a hard time worrying past next week. And that same part of me kind of thinks, what ever, I'll be dead by then, and I know I'm not alone in this particular brand of denial. Cognitive dissonance ladies and gentlemen, don't let it win."

The first half is solid, inasmuch as it has some information about the history, and historiography, of extinction. The second half gets a little head-banging-against-a-wall, with example after example of currently endangered or recently extinct species, all told in the same palatable way. So, beware reader, that if you are like me, you might want to skip this book. It goes to great lengths to be entertaining, but entertaining in a very New Yorker kind of way. We learn more, I would guess, about the appearance and dress of the scientists Kolbert meets than we do about the extinctions she describes. We hear a lot about how people feel. We get a lot of novelistic realism about animal's rumps. And I just don't care. So frustrated was I by Kolbert's presentation of genuinely disturbing events that I started to think what a counter-argument might look like. Here are a couple: i) Kolbert pushes the 'anthropocene' (i.e., the 'geological' epoch determined by the existence of humanity and our destruction of other species) into the *very* distant past, roughly, when the indigenous peoples of Australia first killed off the continent's mega-fauna. But it is utterly ridiculous to liken prehistoric, and 20th and 21st century, human impact on the environment. Not to put too fine a point on it, back then we were just another species, though a successful one. Today, we run the planet. Eliding that difference makes it impossible to recognize what has caused the vast majority of extinctions over the last two centuries, viz., uncontrolled economic development. That's an argument I believe. The next one I'm not so sure about, but I do think there's a case to be answered: ii) Extinction is a natural occurrence. Granted that it's greatly accelerated over the last couple of centuries, but really, why worry so much? What moral obligation do we have towards *species*, as opposed to *living individuals*? If you have to kill a hundred foxes to reintroduce a threatened species into their previously natural environment, is that really a moral thing to do? What about the foxes' lives, after all? And so on. This book doesn't deal with such problems, but then, it wasn't meant to. It is entertaining propaganda, and good on Kolbert for bringing the issues up in the first place. "

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human. (watch here"

""To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more or were willing to make sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter when lather people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.""Does it mean that any conservation effort is for naught?

I have not been this disappointed in a book in a long while. More than a quarter of the length of the book was dedicated to notes. She touched on history as archeology has helped define it with reference to the past extinctions. I think, because she was being a writer, she needed to tell me things I didn't care to know, like what she and her research mates had for breakfast before they set out to discover whether or not a particular bug was or was not extinct.So here's the big spoiler alert.....she said humans were well on the way to an extinction and we were bringing it on ourselves. The sixth extinction is us. The one high point of the book for me was that she did not....to my memory....suggest that we could change things before it's too late.

For what’s probably the best-studied group, which is mammals, it’s been reckoned to be roughly .25 per million species-years. This means that, since there are about fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around today, at the background extinction rate you’d expect—once again, very roughly—one species to disappear every seven hundred years.A rigorous calculation of the background extinction rate for amphibians has not been performed, in part because amphibian fossils are so rare. Almost certainly, though, the rate is lower than it is for mammals. Probably, one amphibian species should go extinct every thousand years or so.Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world’s most endangered class of animals; it’s been calculated that the group’s extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.”
And we, humans, are to blame here. The book has plenty of examples in which we exterminated a lot of species: the one concerning the great auk is so heart-breaking depicted. I do hope this book to be read by as many people as possible and maybe something in our collective mentality will change. We are just one species among so many other and just because we are more intelligent than the others (debatable from my point of view) does not make us owners of this planet and its life forms.
”In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us? One possibility—the possibility implied by the Hall of Biodiversity—is that we, too, will eventually be undone by our “transformation of the ecological landscape.” The logic behind this way of thinking runs as follows: having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth’s biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems—cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans—we’re putting our own survival in danger.”
It is not an easy book but it is definitely worth reading."
191,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches. - Stanford ecologist Paul EhrlichAs far as science has been able to determine, there have been five mass extinctions of life on Earth in the history of our planet. The first of these occurred at the end of the Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era about 450 million years ago. The second occurred less than 100 million years later in the late Devonian period. There followed the End-Permian extinction of some 250 million years ago, the Late Triassic extinction of 200 million years ago, and finally, the last one and the one we are most familiar with, the End-Cretaceous extinction which occurred about 65 million years ago. That's the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. (Well, almost - except for the ancestors of birds.)The best evidence seems to indicate that all of these extinctions except for the last one were the result of climatological events, often relatively sudden events to which plants and animals did not have time to adapt. The cause of the fifth one was also a change in climate but it was brought about by a collision with an asteroid. That cataclysmic event so altered the climate of the planet for a time that many, many species died out either suddenly or over a period of years.Scientists believe that we are now in the midst of the sixth extinction which Earth has endured and that this extinction is entirely human-caused. Elizabeth Kolbert writes in this book about how our species has altered life on the planet as no other species has before. It's not just that we are changing the climate for the worse, although that certainly is a big part of it, but we also have altered the face of Earth and the chemistry of the oceans to the detriment of very many species.One of the biggest problems that we have created for other species is simply the fact that we move everything around and wherever we go on Earth, it seems that some species hitch a ride with us. So a species from Asia that would never under normal circumstances make it to the Americas is brought here either wittingly or unwittingly and it wreaks havoc. Kolbert points out that the most endangered family of animals on Earth today are the amphibians. They are being wiped out by a fungus that has been spread around the world by humans. Kolbert writes about a dozen species, some of them already irrevocably lost and others on their way out. Through these very personal stories of that wonderful bird the Great Auk, the Panamanian golden frog, staghorn coral, the Sumatran rhino and others, the reader is moved to begin to understand the enormity of what is happening. What we are causing to happen to our world. It is somewhat surprising to learn that the concept of extinction is not a very old one. Kolbert points out that it was first articulated by Georges Cuvier in the revolutionary Paris of the 18th century. As always it seems, with any new scientific idea or concept, it took a while for it to be accepted, but later work by paleontologists has confirmed Cuvier's findings.This is a well-written book which can popularize scientific concepts and principles for a mass audience. It is an easy read and a fairly short one at less than 300 pages. Kolbert includes extensive notes and bibliography for those who wish to read more on the subject."

Humanity's impact on the environment tends to either be presented in a deliberately polarizing manner for political reasons or presented with assumptions of scientific knowledge which most lack. The author did an amazing job of explaining the science behind the impact in layman's terms without omitting details that frequently don't make ""news"" stories on the topic. She even took the time to explain how mistakes and theory discrepancies happen in science. Even better, she did all of this calmly by presenting facts and logic without resorting to emotional manipulation.I loved the inclusion of small personal notes about the assorted scientists featured. While such asides don't contribute to the main premise of the book, they do make it much more engaging. Between that and her wonderful descriptive style, I found myself able to visualize her experiences and environments with a fullness usually only found in fiction.There are two things which would have greatly enhanced my pleasure in this book. An insert of color photos of the assorted plants and animals discussed would be awesome. I did Google quite a bit while reading this and it would have been preferable to have photos right in the book.Additionally, a chart/timeline depicting the assorted eras and epochs mentioned in chronological order with dates and maybe a few sample organisms listed for each section would have been great. Perhaps with the mass extinctions and suggested range for the anthropocene marked as well? As clear as her explanations were, some information processes better in images than text.Things I think should be changed before the final release:The graph on page 16 is hella blurry.On page 46 at the end of chapter 2, she first mentions that the megafauna extinction is becoming understood as being the result of the spread of modern humans. No specifics are gone into on this until page 230. This left me wary that she was going to start making assertions without any kind of backup in the beginning of the book and I felt a bit weirded out all the way through the book by that hanging thread even when it became clear that she was validating her beliefs with facts. As a reader, it would have been better for that statement to have been omitted in chapter 2 if it wasn't going to be developed for almost 200 pages. At the very least, it should be noted that it will be expanded upon later in the book.Page 86, line 19, the paragraph that starts with ""The bolide arrived from the southeast..."" I'm assuming that ""doe to its trajectory"" (later in that paragraph) should read due ""to its trajectory.""The last sentence on 113 going over to page 114 reads ""Change the atmosphere's composition atmosphere..."" Is that right? It seems like the second atmosphere is superfluous or at least awkward.I would omit the bit about the gift shop cashier not showing Ms. Kolbert around from page 226. It comes across petty and unflattering to the author. Even if there were no other customers, it's a given in *any* clerking job that you don't leave the shop unattended. You can get fired for that.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway. Many thanks to all involved in providing me with this opportunity."

In the pages that follow, I try to convey both sides: the excitement of what's being learned as well as the horror of it."" (3)Mission accomplished. I learned something, and I felt something.Kolbert writes scientific journalism with the best of them and here she distills a lot of contemporary findings into easily conveyed factoids for the layperson. She tells a dynamic story but with very little pearl-clutching. She's largely neutral in her presentation, though she doesn't shy away from the (well-supported and widely accepted) thesis that it's human activity that's effected the climate change resulting in subsequent extinctions and a vast reduction to Earth's biodiversity. Maybe it's too late for us to halt the sweeping global change humankind has generated, but like it or not it's inexcusable to not pay attention and not learn about it. And those skeptical or uninterested in hearing anyone try to cram environmentalism down their throat with a lot of moralizing needn't fear. There are many chapters that focus on other, nonhuman catastrophes and extinction events, how they were discovered and how they shaped modern scientific thought and theory.And stylistically, her prose is entertaining and never dull. Just one example:When I visited Reserve 1202, I ran into a graduate student from Portugal who was surveying bats. At noon he had just recently woken up and was eating pasta in a shed that served as a research station-cum-kitchen. While we were talking, a very skinny cowboy rode up on an only slightly less skinny horse. He had a rifle slung over one shoulder. I wasn't sure whether he'd come because he'd heard the truck I'd arrived on and wanted to protect the student from possible intruders, or because he sensed that there was pasta. (174)5 stars out of 5. Informative and entertaining. A big win for popular science fans."

Exploring the other five extinctions in the past and comparing them to the current destruction of the biosphere is sobering. It is unclear whether the sixth will surpass the other five (each extinction had its own pathology) or if we will survive the catastrophe we created but it is not pleasant to read about. This is one of those books that reminds the reader that it is worse than you think by far. I am not sure how to read the forensics of armageddon being shielded from nature by modern life, one will put this book down and pick up another at least until the resources run out. What books like this usually elicit are deer in the headlights paralysis or ostrich-like behavior or a shrug of the shoulders. Kind of strange the way we respond selectively to threats.

Depressing as heck, but if you want a good overview of the challenges facing our planet in regards to humans and how we are changing the earth and its ecosystems I recommend this. There is no doubt in my mind that we have started a cascade of environmental collapses that is going to be hard to curtail. We have to try and minimize the damage, the challenge will be beyond difficult, but it is a noble goal. "

I want to not feel that the earth is so doomed by our simply negligent hand. I want to write a series of children’s stories teaching them about the Frozen Zoo, and the drones that leads new flocks of birds in the wild to repopulate and make sure they land on safe ground, and apes that are domesticating dogs, that make tools, that every day we learn they are just a bit smarter than we thought. This is a horror story through and through about the changes going on in this world because of how we live our lives, because of how homo sapiens have ALWAYS lived their lives even before we started burning fossil fuels and putting pesticide on everything. I want to go on a tour and shake the hand of everyone working desperately to create safety arks for animals that we are abandoning by our own callousness. I want to visit these refuges and revel in them, and then leave, hopefully, with no trace of ever having been there.And now, I’ll just let the book speak for itself. The only thing I could have asked for it is that for it to be longer. “One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is that the world is changing in ways that compel species to move, and another is that it’s changing in ways that create barriers—roads, clear-cuts, cities—that prevent them from doing so.”“By burning through coal and oil deposits, humans are putting carbon back into the air that has been sequestered for tens—in most cases hundreds—of millions of years. In the process, we are running geologic history not only in reverse but at warp speed.” The anthropologist Richard Leakey has warned that “Homo sapiens might not only be the agent of the sixth extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.” A sign in the Hall of Biodiversity offers a quote from the Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich: IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” “coral cover in the Caribbean has in recent decades declined by close to eighty percent.”“Asian elephants have declined by fifty percent over the last three generations.” “some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere.” “WHY is ocean acidification so dangerous? The question is tough to answer only because the list of reasons is so long. Depending on how tightly organisms are able to regulate their internal chemistry, acidification may affect such basic processes as metabolism, enzyme activity, and protein function. Because it will” "

There is also the impact of habitat loss due to human population explosion.

Life would also surely bound back eventually, long after the last descendant of bipedal, hairless apes have vanished.This is a highly informative, well-written and captivating book. It explains the earlier big exctinctions and why there is one caused by us, happening now. It is a complex topic and this journalist does a job of presenting the facts in an understandable manner. I happened to read in a newspaper while reading this book, that just in England, 421 species have been lost in 200 years. This isn't propaganda - this is really happening. Highly recommended."
199,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene,3," This book was recommended on many lists last year and I had such high hopes when I started reading it. Unfortunately, I struggled with finishing it and walked away from it several times before I finally finished. Despite my statements, I want to make it clear that my failure to enjoy this book had nothing to do with the quality of the writing. It was clear that Ms. Kolbert spent a great deal of time researching.. traveling to various habitats for a first hand observation of the species which have already disappeared and the ones who are on the brink. She obtained an enormous amount of information from various scientists and even provided photographs. I simply found that the book could not hold my attention. Perhaps if I had more of a knowledge base in animal biology, botany and environmental science, I could have enjoyed this book more than I did. Or perhaps if I had just put it aside to come back to it at a later time, I would have gotten more out of it… regardless, the book just did not hold my interest. That said, I would not discourage anyone else from reading the book. The failure to enjoy was mine. "

The book covers a lot of ground, from Georges Cuvier, Darwin, to modern day ecology and conservations, from arctic to tropical rain forests, from national parks to zoos. I've learned lot of about extinctions in the earth history and the current ongoing extinction—the sixth extinction that is solely humans' doing. Perhaps the reason that we, homo sapiens, have become the dominate species of the world, is the same reason that will cause our own eventual extinction."
201,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-shakespeareandspice,4,I read this all in one go because I knew multiple pauses would likely just extend the misery. It’s particularly hard to read a book such as this knowing things will likely only get worse with the donkey that is our President leading one of the world’s most powerful nations. We’re talking billions of lives. And millions of species. Including us.
202,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"It sounds strange to say I enjoyed reading this book about the increasingly profound and potentially devastating impact humans are having on our home planet, with an especial focus on the animals and plants who share Earth with us, but enjoy it I did. It’s a riveting topic, the history of our world and our species, and Elizabeth Kolbert has the knack of writing about science so it retains all its natural fascination while still being accessible to laypeople. She takes the reader with her back in time and around the world as she accompanies researchers in places ranging from the Andes mountains to the Great Barrier Reef. One particular fact has really stuck with me--as human activity increasingly homogenizes the global environment by transporting plants and animals all over the planet biodiversity is increasing on the small scale, so that where you live is likely to have more species than it did formerly, but because invasive flora and fauna can wipe out native plants and animals global biodiversity is rapidly shrinking as the total number of species on the Earth continues to dwindle. And that’s the point of the title, The Sixth Extinction. There have been five periods of mass extinction on our planet and some scientists are finding evidence indicating that we may be on the cusp of or even in the midst of a sixth wave of mass die offs, this one caused by the activities of humans, a chilling realization."
203,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'The Sixth Extinction' is written like a magazine article for a general reader, yet it tells intelligently an engaging true science story about several various geological locations important to the history of the scientific discoveries about evolution and extinction. The author personally visits and describes sites around the world - islands, forests, oceans, caves, museums - some of which take a lot of effort and discomfort to reach. These particular locations have a huge importance because each site is where an 'eureka!' moment occurred for a scientist who was often there for a different reason, but then he discovered something else instead; something which ended in clearing up everything confusing or wrong about our understanding of how the earth's climate changed in the past and is changing now. The discovery that the macro-climate can change on earth, and has apparently changed five times previously, and that these macro-climate changes also appear to be linked to changes in local animals and plants as well. It took time before everyone accepted the evidence presented that the earth and its environment has changed dramatically several times, and even longer for scientists to agree what the evidence signified. Early scientists had to not only accept the evidence of their own eyes and discoveries, they had to overcome biblical teachings which had told them the earth cannot change because it must be as perfect as the god who created it 6,000 years previously. These early struggles with the Church in interpreting physical clues are what led to the 'scientific method' of proving beyond doubt the conclusions reached from actually studying physical discoveries and not relying on religious beliefs from ancient scriptures. (One of the Church's precepts was everything on earth was unchanging and perfect. The fact that animals could die off as a species and disappear permanently from the face of the earth, or even worse, evolve, was not a possibility if the Church or the bible was correct. In time, the preponderance of the physical evidence overwhelmed the bible's myths. The author hints at the scientific disarray in accepting the facts of living creatures changing and disappearing because of the rigid philosophical belief in an unchanging world, but she does not dive into the religious elements which delayed the conclusions from scientific discoveries.)I found the book easy to read and understand. The facts and history of the concepts of evolution and climate change are conversationally and logically introduced. It deepened my understanding of how the scientists know climate changed billions of years ago and is changing now, and how they know the current change is already affecting life dramatically. Instead of jargon, you'll be able to speak it in plain English.The three issues the author gently exposes, after unobtrusively teaching us history, is how Humanity is involved, perhaps primarily responsible, in the current sixth ongoing climate change because: one, of our restless traveling around the world transporting, mostly unwisely, other life forms; as well as two, the CO2 we are pumping into the air from our gasoline-fueled cars and coal burning for electrical energy, which is changing (killing) the seas, trees/forests and wildlife the world over; and our extermination of animals in hunting for food, fun and profit (animals affect the type and quantity/quality of plants in their environment through their activities and nutritional needs, and by the symbiotic or otherwise interested neighbor animals who want to live close to their prey food). Your grandkids may not grow up with the trees, insects or local neighborhood wild animals and birds you did, or have cheap water to drink or cheap electricity to run their devices. The air certainly will be different.After finishing this book, you might want to look at a fiction novel, The Road. Warning: it's an extremely terrifying look at living in a world utterly wrecked environmentally, and it had me in tears.The following opinions are all me, and not in this science book. I think we will be the first species in earth's history that had the power to destroy AND save the earth, as well as ourselves, but we couldn't focus. Instead, we chose to party on: 1. hunt and kill off the last mega fauna like rhinoceroses and sharks to eat their horns/fins for that important personal 15-minute sexual erection; 2. cut down the annoying mega-flora for more houses and cheap furniture and better views; 3. put personal mega-billions of capital to work as investments in dozens of mansions/property around the world (plus living in one or three mansions isn't enough of an exercise of personal power, which is why the addition of environmentally controlled garages to house the yachts, the hundreds of 'antique' cars that will never be driven, to possess shoes, dresses and purses purchased for thousands of dollars each, etc. - conspicuous consumption being a tried-and-true method of relieving the boredom of wealth); 4. become socially powerful enough to manipulate/buy political votes to benefit/protect individual sources of capital; 5. use valuable resources to make war murder mayhem because of displaced aggression and blood lust; 6. make more babies because a priest/minister/Imam says god hates contraception (more mouths to feed, house and poop);7. For every facility which finally reduces their air/water/soil pollutants after decades of extended court fights, nine other facilities continue to pollute excessively around the world.8. and pray fruitlessly in religious rituals for a god to tell us our marching orders (which will never occur). We REALLY should be more environmentally responsible for our own self and the others who depend on us, but honestly? I don't think it's gonna happen. Anyone else notice, for example, how the local waters are too polluted for your kids to fish and swim in today, but you remember happily doing both safely? Anyone else notice how more flooding occurs in your neighborhood today? Anyone else notice how the local birds, bees and animal life have disappeared around your house? Anyone else notice the mountains of trash everywhere? Or the fouled beaches because the sewage treatment facility, overwhelmed again, had a spill? For the record, I believe we are doomed as a viable species. We don't seem to be able to overcome our DNA inheritance or be able to reprogram our animal brain desires for immediate emotional rush satisfactions. Our lusts for sex, social/tribal affiliation, personal power and self-aggrandizement, chocolate, drama, speed, explosions and killing things overwhelm our strengths in planning ahead, memory, intelligence, education, math and spatial skills, creativity, building tools, feelings that a single sacrifice for the many is worthy, love, affection, empathy, sharing the abundance and living in moderation. Our archaeological record, when it is dug up and discovered by the next species to rise to intelligence and tool-building a million years from now, after Homo sapiens has disappeared, will be condensed down to 'we coulda and we shoulda, but we didna'."

It's quite a topic - what we are doing to the world, and what we have done and what we are likely going to do. This mostly wasn't new information to me - but the acidification of the oceans was new. I mean I see the headlines and I know it's a issue, but I didn't understand the nature of it, or make the connection to shells and reefs.What I like about the book is, first of all, that it's getting read. The more people who read this the better. It's good information. Even well informed people don't generally grasp the scope and extent of what we are doing to our planet. She mixes in the dire future predictions, and the uncertainties of these, with lots of interesting historical details on science coming to terms with extinction, and other related topics. She covers in some detail three of the five major extinction events (why only three?) The problem with ocean acidification, in brief, is how it affects animals that secrete shells or any hard carbonate-mineral parts, especially in the common form of aragonite. This stuff dissolves in acid. The extra CO2 in the air leads to more of it getting absorbed into the ocean, and this makes the oceans more acidic. The acidity makes these hard parts more soluble, as in closer to actually dissolving, and therefore they become harder to make and animals make less of them. So, as the acidity increases, our corals start making less exoskeleton and eventually will just stop, meaning our coral reefs will die. We have made the oceans 40% more acidic then they were before the industrial revolution. My one complaint is that the book seems to target our emotions more than I'm comfortable with. It's really a borderline issue - unless you listen on audio. The reader, Anne Twomey, insanely over-dramatizes the book, weakening it the severely. It sounds like a bad psuedo-science show on a coming UFO invasion. (I did listen to sample before I purchased. There was a very passionate and professional reader. Only after I purchased did I learn that the sample was Kolbert herself, reading the prologue. Wish she had read the whole book.)We have all read plenty of everyone-should-read-this-book comments on important nonfiction books, and that does add a bit of discouragement into the encouragement. I hope the later overpowers the former. Everyone should be reading books like this."

Apart from the stereotypical acts of human depravity, there is also the passive damage inflicted on the natural world by our very existence. In Elizabeth Kolbert's outstanding The Sixth Extinction, the author writes in exceptionally readable and compelling language on a subject that is essential reading for members of our species.  Eschewing one particular approach to the depiction of extinction, Kolbert alternates the subjects of her chapters between multiple disciplines. History, geology, biology, ecology, and many other disciplines all make for a varied and hard-hitting treatise on the demise of the world's organisms. What's more, Kolbert breaks up her exposition with her experiences at the various places around earth on which she writes. These sections ground what can be very esoteric subject matter as the effects of these theories are seen through Kolbert's eyes. In a similar vein, Kolbert's aim with the book is not to accuse and depress, rather she seeks to educate the populace on the changes occurring on Earth. I have read many reviews that called this book depressing and guilt-inducing, however it was my feeling that the book maintains an upbeat, yet objective, tone throughout.  I am more likely to be found reading fiction than nonfiction; stories and characters have always interested me more than fact and figures. Perhaps it is that my professional days are filled with fact that I seek escape on my personal time. Despite this predilection for fiction, I am occasionally taken in by a nonfiction book and revel in the fashion the author arrives at their conclusion. The Sixth Extinction not only has the benefit of being one such book, it also has the prestige of being a book of great importance. If you're overwhelmed and unaffected by the media's liberal use of global warming, climate change, ocean acidification, and extinction events then this is exactly the book you should be reading. Its appeal is visceral as well as intellectual, and should be read by as many humans as possible. After all, we just happen to be the book's primary villains."

This non-fiction science book briefly covers the major and minor extinction cycles that have occured over the life of the planet, as well as current theories as to what caused them. The book is divided into 13 chapters, and each chapter deals with a specific current extinction, or near extinction, event. I loved the dots that this book connected for me. I loved that this current extinction cycle (clearly caused by Sapiens) is discussed in the context of the very long history of the planet. I loved learning about things I had no idea about, annual coral reef sex orgies comes to mind, and was saddened to learn about some of the species that have gone the way of the Dodo in my lifetime. I loved the science and learning about some scientists I knew nothing about. There is so much covered here, but all in a very accessible, easy to read manner. I am surprised that I was left with a feeling of hope at the end of this book. Not because I think that Humans will halt or reverse the processes we have put into play, but rather because after we become extinct, life will continue to find a way. Context is everything.

There's something very magical about it, as if the planet is getting a good spring cleaning and all its inhabitants an urgently needed recalibrating of priorities. I love how people who do important jobs are suddenly getting all the love instead of narcissistic moronic reality TV celebrities and the like who had the limelight before. And the absence of cars, especially at night, is wonderful. The shot of the Himalayas visible from New Delhi for the first time in decades was especially poignant. And, on the whole, people are more friendly. There's a lot more generosity towards the poor. And so many health workers over here in the UK are of ethnic minority backgrounds that racism more than ever has been highlighted as the outlandish unforgivable expression of brute stupidity it is. The virus has made a nonsense of militant nationalism too. Takes a pandemic for most to understand that every border is in essence illusory; that we're all in this together. And how pettily absurd Brexit now seems. I hope this new generation will take on board this rejigging of social and ethical priorities and as a result be much more committed to looking after the planet.   Anyway, Elizabeth Kolbert in this book visits a series of research centres all over the globe, all with their own specialised subject, all charting and trying to prevent the sudden alarming demise of various species of mammal, bird, reptile and insect. She intersperses these individual and local sagas with an overview of how extinctions have occurred in the planet's history. Meticulously and convincingly she helps us to understand how quickly and carelessly we're heading towards the next big extinction, the first caused by humans. I liked this more than The Uninhabitable Earth because it's completely cleansed of the hellfire indignation which for me marred David Wallace-Wells' book."

You won’t be after you read this.Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it. To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly. Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.Harboring some hubris about your place in the world? Here’s a tonic:a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man—the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories—will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper.What else can I say about this book? The picture Kolbert paints of our situation is every bit as depressing as you might expect. I already knew the facts about climate change and animal extinction, but according to Kolbert the prognosis is even worse than I was aware, given that ocean acidification – “global warming’s ‘equally evil twin’” – is one contributor I hadn’t ever considered. Likewise, though I’d heard about the crisis with the world’s amphibians, I was entirely ignorant of the bat cataclysm (white-nose syndrome).As a longtime New Yorker journalist, Kolbert writes at a good level for laymen: not talking down, but not assuming any specialist knowledge either. I was somewhat unconvinced by her thematic, species-by-species approach here; it makes each chapter more like an individual essay than a part of a larger argument. Winging her way around the world (what carbon footprint?!), she considers auks and ammonites, mastodons and endangered zoo animals in captive breeding programs, dying coral reefs, and pockets of Amazonian rainforest. By the end, you’ll be in no doubt that we are in the middle of a major extinction event, and that our era will be known as the “Anthropocene” – the age of the influence of man.Luckily, there are spots of humor to lighten the tone, such as “The reason this book is being written by a hairy biped, rather than a scaly one, has more to do with dinosaurian misfortune than with any particular mammalian virtue.”As Caspar Henderson writes in his Guardian review, “The extinction crisis is so vast and complex that it almost repels thought. We need a lot more imaginative thinking about the choices we can make and what comes next.” Now that this has won a Pulitzer, one hopes it will get people talking and doing some of that imaginative thinking. Unfortunately, it’s so much easier to bury heads in the sand and keep going as we have been. Time will tell whether we heed the lessons of this book."
212,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,4,"There have been very long uneventful stretches and very, very occasionally ""revolutions on the surface of the earth."" To the extent that we can identify the causes of these revolutions, they're highly varied: glaciation in the case of the ordovician extinction, global warming and chances in chemistry at the end of the Permian, an asteroid impact in the final seconds of the Cretaceous. The current extinction has its own novel cause: not an asteroid or a massive volcanic eruption but ""one weedy species. As Walter Alvarez put it to me, ""We're seeing right now that a mass extinction can be cause by human beings."" (265-266) ""With the capacity to represent the world in signs and symbols comes the capacity to change it, which as it happens, is also the capacity to destroy it. A ting set of genetic variations divides us from the Neanderthals, but that has made all the difference. (258)It isn't unique to note that humanity has dangerously altered the planet in a way that no other species before it has done as conclusively demonstrated by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. What makes this book not only important but a must-read is the case by case basis which she follows through with each chapter of extinct or near-to-extinct case studies of populations of animals, from the American Mastodon to the frogs of central Panama to the Sumatran Rhino. Because of the subject matter and the grand question of purpose among our own species, the ones before us, and the ones that will come after we're gone, this book is something that stays with the reader afterwards, pondering the grand invention of creation, evolution, and eventual disarray. The book provides a great overview of the subject matter that newcomers will find informative and enjoyable, and despite the information presented, does offer glimpses of hope and even humour. What is so fascinating about the subject matter is the concept of how life has survived and altered itself time after time on our bountiful rock, and how little we as a species really understand the world we have seemingly (or rather forcibly) inherited. It was only roughly 300 years ago that palaeontology began to take it's first steps as a major science with the discovery of mastodon bones in North America, and that whole different worlds existed before ours. It was only in 1831 that Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle and made his way around the world, specifically to the Galapagos, giving us terms in his ""On the Origins of Species"" that now represent mainstream science. Neanderthals only were discovered shorted after Darwin's voyage, and it was only in 2004 that a hobbit like humanoid species was discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia. How freaking amazing and unbelievable is that?It was interested to see Kolbert's travels around the globe, diving into the globalisation aspects of humanity that give us terms like ""New Pangaea,"" how bat populations in the Northeastern part of the US have dropped off significantly do to factors that bats elsewhere in the world are immune to, the investigation into rainforest populations in South America, and the incredible efforts scientists are doing to protect endangered species, like giving rhinos ultrasounds and crows handjobs. It's a tale of our grim actions, but the hopeful aspects of our understanding of the world that can add it. The choice is up to us as a species."

214,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"It's absolutely, extremely, utterly, incredibly important for the general reader to remember that the real story of science is written in the language of mathematics. When authors put the story of scientific disciplines like physics, or chemistry or even biology into words and stories, they are translating something hard and complex and precise into a soft, fuzzy medium.It's analogous to knitting a replica of Michelangelo's David. Even if you are a genius knitter, the end result will only be (at best) a flabby simulacrum of the authentic object.If you experienced the knitted David (let's call him Dave) you would have a general, vague sense of what the real David was like. But you would be a long way away from really understanding the awe inspiring experience of the real deal.Let's take the analogy one step further. Imagine you're an alien, and you discovered the knitted Dave. But you had never seen the real David sculpture, or (more importantly) an actual human specimen. How much would you really understand about people, based on you're observations of the knitted Dave. You would have a very general sense. Enough to pick a hominid out of a crowd of donkeys. But that's about it. Better than nothing, but far from expertise. I love evolutionary biology and ecology and sociology. But I'm not trained in any of these disciplines. My understanding of them is via popularizations like this. Even within my discipline of clinical psychology, I'm barely educated. But outside of my discipline, I am essentially an enthusiastic dilettante. That's not a dis. That's just another way of saying, I haven't spent 4 years of undergraduate training to prepare for another 4 years of doctoral training to prepare for another 3-5 years of post doctoral training to prepare for another 10-20 years of professional research in any of those fields.Humans specialize. None of us could possibly be specialists in more than one or maybe two of these domains. There just isn't enough time in a human life span.I have a laypersons education of ecology and biology. That's nothing to scoff at. It took (literally) hundreds of hours of hard work, reading a bunch of books, taking classes, talking to experts etc. to gain my laypersons understanding of evolutionary biology. But honestly, I wouldn't know an actual darwinian algorithm from a hole in the ground, let alone be able to accurately interpret the findings of the mathematical models experts develop and use to understand complex systems like species population dynamics and ecosystems.So I have to rely on experts and science journalists to tell me the story in English. I need these dedicated, talented individuals to ""knit me a Dave"". That's exactly what Elizabeth Kolbert did. She knitted us a Dave. The Sixth Extinction is a soft, cuddly, children's storybook version of the hard, awful reality the actual experts in the field of biology and ecology are bearing witness to.If she had delivered us a harder version. It would have been (a) unintelligible to us mere mortals, and (b) so unspeakably awful, that most of us would have never, ever willingly subjected ourselves to this horrible, terrifying (much more than inconvenient) truth. Even the ""soft"" Dave version is pretty fucking tragic and demoralizing. If I were to give you a quick sketch analogy of what the knitted Dave of mass extinction looks like. Imagine a plush toy bat (flying mammal), stuffed with dead, decomposing frogs, with an invasive fungus choking his nostrils, literally starving to death, drooling acrid barren sea water and sputtering a creepy recorded (five nights at Freddie's) robot voice looping the phrase, ""we're all going to die a horrible, slow death, we're all going to suffocate in a giant cesspool of our own feces, and it's way too late to do anything about it"".Not exactly Tickle Me Elmo, but still, a very soft version of the reality.One can only imagine the horror that experts feel when they see entire species evaporate, or when they crunch the numbers and the results look like an ASCII skull and bones. You can imagine these nerdy bookworm types, realizing the awful reality and trying desperately to communicate the immense gravity of the situation to the stoners, jocks and rednecks who used to beat and torture them in high school, only to receive responses like ""The Bible says we can despoil the earth however we see fit"" or ""it's only a theory"" or ""not all scientists agree"" or ""it was cold for a few days this summer, so that proves global warming is a scam"".Even the most charismatic of the nerds, Think Neil Degrassi Tyson, Carl Sagan or Al Gore still only managed to capture the hearts and minds of ""egg head PBS types"", even when they limit their messages to what can be communicated via entertaining, schticky soundbites, Hollywood style computer animated visualizations and 30 minute PowerPoint slideshows.The Sixth Extinction goes at explaining the issue of the ecological disaster we currently find ourselves in by giving a brief history of the previous five mass extinction events that science has identified. Apparently global species population and diversity levels expand and contract regularly, but have dropped to next to nothing for various reasons thorough out the history of life on earth. The previous 5 mass extinction events are:1: the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event (occurring about 66 Ma) in which about 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. 2: the Triassic–Jurassic extinction (occurring about 201.3 Ma) in which about 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species went extinct.3: the Permian-Triassic transition. (occurring about 252 Ma). Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects).4: the Devonian Period (occurring 375–360 Ma), a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species.5: the Ordovician–Silurian extinction (occurring 450–440 Ma) killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.At one point, around 70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens almost went extinct. About 90% of us died. We got down to an estimated 40 breeding pairs. That's really close to extinction. But we showed em our bounce back stuff and boy look at us now!Now we're officially in the Holocene period (and have been for more than 10,000 years), but many scientists are pushing the point that we have officially exited the Holocene and entered an altogether new epoch that they are calling the Anthropocene. They argue that humans are having such a pronounced impact on the enviornment that we should be the titular species of this particular cene (hence the Anthro at the beginning of the word).They also argue that there is a new mass extinction event currently under way that may be the worst one yet. They are calling it the.... You guessed it....6: the Anthropocene extinction.That's awesome right? It's exciting to be a part of history. Even if it's potentially the end of it.Bad Boundaries:One of the salient points in the book is that global climate instability is not the only source of extinction. Another big problem happens when an ecosystems square footage is reduced or its boundaries are violated. Obviously deforestation is a huge problem. By making the rain forests land coverage smaller, it shrinks the biodiversity exponentially (there's that math stuff again). Apparently there's a formula for it that calculates the extinction rates as you down scale an environment. It's like the E=Mc2 of the apocalypse.But globalization is also a huge problem in that it introduces invasive species like rats into sensitive environments. Apparently rats have been hitching rides on boats for as long as people of been sailing.Invasive species can literally crash an ecology. In the book, Kolbert discusses a species of gray snake that was introduced to an island echo system that basically ate everything. It reduced to a tropical island full of pretty birds, lizards and bugs to pretty much just only snakes.Kolbert makes the gorgeous point that it's easy to vilify the little grey snake. But the snake isn't mean or immoral, it's amoral, meaning it's It's simply doing what it's hardwired to do. It's just trying to survive and reproduce. The Ultimate Invasive Species:In case you're wondering where this is going, the ultimate invasive species is us. Humans go just about everywhere And everywhere that humans go, almost everything else dies. It's not that were mean or immoral, were actually amoral in the same way the grey snake is. We're simply doing we're all hardwired to do. Survive and reproduce (with obvious exceptions, but not enough to make a critical difference).We like to hold ourselves to moral standards, and vilify some bad guys e.g. Dick Cheney (I'm not saying he's not, but just hear me out).The fact of the matter is, the Anthropocene extinction isn't happening because we're immoral. It's happening because we're amoral.It may seem like I'm splitting hairs but the distinction is important.Perhaps viewing ourselves as moral, and holding ourselves and others to standards of morality is part of the problem. Perhaps framing this ecological crisis as a moral issue is creating a fatal blind spot. Perhaps experimental psychology can be of assistance in explaining my point.Don't Diss Me:Cognitive dissonance is the very reliably observed psychological phenomena, whereby people (including you me and everybody we know) confabulate anxiety reducing fictions when confronted with our own amoral behavior.So in other words, when people realize that their behavior is incongruent with their values, they feel bad, but rather than change the behavior, they make up a story (no matter how absurd) that relieves them of the pain of their own hypocrisy. For example, consider a situation in which someone who places a value on being environmentally responsible just purchased a cool new chick magnet car that he later discovers is a gas guzzler.The conflict:It is important for the man to be (at least viewed as) a good steward of the environment. But he is now driving a babe getting machine that also happens to double as an earth warmer.As you can imagine, he's feeling rather conflicted about now. Drive a Prius and die a childless and alone, or drive the Maserati and repopulate Brentwood. In order to reduce the dissonance between his values and his behavior, he can (a) utilize public transportation more frequently (which is probably not going to happen, maybe in Seattle, not in L.A.), or he could (b) sell the car and purchase another one that gets better gas mileage (which, again, not hugely probable), or he could (c) convince himself that maybe all the global warming stuff is a little overblown, and one little Maserati aint gona kill nobody (which is a whole lot easier than option (a) or (b), and therefore pretty fucking likely).I know what you're thinking, ""other people do that, but I don't do that"". But you do, we all do, we just don't realize it. That's why they call it a blind spot.It sounds far fetched but cognitive dissonance has been observed in tightly controlled experiments again and again. Everyone does it. Even (no particularly) if you're a trained mental health professional,So maybe if we stop viewing the ecology issue moralistically, and start viewing it more pragmatically, than perhaps we can all stop pointing fingers and except the fact that we're all totally fucked and were going to die and there's noting we can do about it.No no. Of course there's something we can do about it. But we really need to accept that it's happening. Accept that were all complicit (even if you recycle), and then....I actually don't know what. But something I hope. Additionally, all of us regular people need to trust the experts. We may get a cold day in August and think we're all good. But that's not how this shit works. You have to do math and stuff. And odds are great that you don't. So trust the people that do and just do what they tell you. Even if you love Jesus. Which you probably don't if you're still reading this.Lastly, it occurred to me that I'm not going to face the worst of this, and my kid won't either, but her kids (should she ignore reason and reproduce) will. I'll just be honest here. Part of me has a hard time worrying past next week. And that same part of me kind of thinks, what ever, I'll be dead by then, and I know I'm not alone in this particular brand of denial. Cognitive dissonance ladies and gentlemen, don't let it win."
215,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2184529-justin-evans,3,"I'm glad this book was published, and glad it got so much attention. On the other hand, I wish it had been much better. The first half is solid, inasmuch as it has some information about the history, and historiography, of extinction. The second half gets a little head-banging-against-a-wall, with example after example of currently endangered or recently extinct species, all told in the same palatable way. So, beware reader, that if you are like me, you might want to skip this book. It goes to great lengths to be entertaining, but entertaining in a very New Yorker kind of way. We learn more, I would guess, about the appearance and dress of the scientists Kolbert meets than we do about the extinctions she describes. We hear a lot about how people feel. We get a lot of novelistic realism about animal's rumps. And I just don't care. So frustrated was I by Kolbert's presentation of genuinely disturbing events that I started to think what a counter-argument might look like. Here are a couple: i) Kolbert pushes the 'anthropocene' (i.e., the 'geological' epoch determined by the existence of humanity and our destruction of other species) into the *very* distant past, roughly, when the indigenous peoples of Australia first killed off the continent's mega-fauna. But it is utterly ridiculous to liken prehistoric, and 20th and 21st century, human impact on the environment. Not to put too fine a point on it, back then we were just another species, though a successful one. Today, we run the planet. Eliding that difference makes it impossible to recognize what has caused the vast majority of extinctions over the last two centuries, viz., uncontrolled economic development. That's an argument I believe. The next one I'm not so sure about, but I do think there's a case to be answered: ii) Extinction is a natural occurrence. Granted that it's greatly accelerated over the last couple of centuries, but really, why worry so much? What moral obligation do we have towards *species*, as opposed to *living individuals*? If you have to kill a hundred foxes to reintroduce a threatened species into their previously natural environment, is that really a moral thing to do? What about the foxes' lives, after all? And so on. This book doesn't deal with such problems, but then, it wasn't meant to. It is entertaining propaganda, and good on Kolbert for bringing the issues up in the first place. "

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human. (watch here"

""To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more or were willing to make sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter when lather people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.""Does it mean that any conservation effort is for naught? Have we crossed a threshold that we cannot uncross? Not sure. Very likely you won't be either after reading it.Lots to chew on here - not all that pleasant either.

I think, because she was being a writer, she needed to tell me things I didn't care to know, like what she and her research mates had for breakfast before they set out to discover whether or not a particular bug was or was not extinct.So here's the big spoiler alert.....she said humans were well on the way to an extinction and we were bringing it on ourselves. The sixth extinction is us. The one high point of the book for me was that she did not....to my memory....suggest that we could change things before it's too late.

220,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,4,"Elizabeth Kolbert knows how to put things together. She managed to create a very thoroughly documented book and to raise awareness about the extinction of species.The five extinctions known in the history of Earth decimated the species up to 96% (a brief summary can be read here: https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontol...)The sixth extinction here in question is named so because of the rate at which species are disappearing now:
“Calculating the background extinction rate is a laborious task that entails combing through whole databases’ worth of fossils. For what’s probably the best-studied group, which is mammals, it’s been reckoned to be roughly .25 per million species-years. This means that, since there are about fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around today, at the background extinction rate you’d expect—once again, very roughly—one species to disappear every seven hundred years.A rigorous calculation of the background extinction rate for amphibians has not been performed, in part because amphibian fossils are so rare. Almost certainly, though, the rate is lower than it is for mammals. Probably, one amphibian species should go extinct every thousand years or so.Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world’s most endangered class of animals; it’s been calculated that the group’s extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.”
And we, humans, are to blame here. The book has plenty of examples in which we exterminated a lot of species: the one concerning the great auk is so heart-breaking depicted. I do hope this book to be read by as many people as possible and maybe something in our collective mentality will change. We are just one species among so many other and just because we are more intelligent than the others (debatable from my point of view) does not make us owners of this planet and its life forms.
”In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us? One possibility—the possibility implied by the Hall of Biodiversity—is that we, too, will eventually be undone by our “transformation of the ecological landscape.” The logic behind this way of thinking runs as follows: having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth’s biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems—cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans—we’re putting our own survival in danger.”
It is not an easy book but it is definitely worth reading."
221,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches. - Stanford ecologist Paul EhrlichAs far as science has been able to determine, there have been five mass extinctions of life on Earth in the history of our planet. The first of these occurred at the end of the Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era about 450 million years ago. The second occurred less than 100 million years later in the late Devonian period. There followed the End-Permian extinction of some 250 million years ago, the Late Triassic extinction of 200 million years ago, and finally, the last one and the one we are most familiar with, the End-Cretaceous extinction which occurred about 65 million years ago. That's the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. (Well, almost - except for the ancestors of birds.)The best evidence seems to indicate that all of these extinctions except for the last one were the result of climatological events, often relatively sudden events to which plants and animals did not have time to adapt. The cause of the fifth one was also a change in climate but it was brought about by a collision with an asteroid. That cataclysmic event so altered the climate of the planet for a time that many, many species died out either suddenly or over a period of years.Scientists believe that we are now in the midst of the sixth extinction which Earth has endured and that this extinction is entirely human-caused. Elizabeth Kolbert writes in this book about how our species has altered life on the planet as no other species has before. It's not just that we are changing the climate for the worse, although that certainly is a big part of it, but we also have altered the face of Earth and the chemistry of the oceans to the detriment of very many species.One of the biggest problems that we have created for other species is simply the fact that we move everything around and wherever we go on Earth, it seems that some species hitch a ride with us. So a species from Asia that would never under normal circumstances make it to the Americas is brought here either wittingly or unwittingly and it wreaks havoc. Kolbert points out that the most endangered family of animals on Earth today are the amphibians. They are being wiped out by a fungus that has been spread around the world by humans. Kolbert writes about a dozen species, some of them already irrevocably lost and others on their way out. Through these very personal stories of that wonderful bird the Great Auk, the Panamanian golden frog, staghorn coral, the Sumatran rhino and others, the reader is moved to begin to understand the enormity of what is happening. What we are causing to happen to our world. It is somewhat surprising to learn that the concept of extinction is not a very old one. Kolbert points out that it was first articulated by Georges Cuvier in the revolutionary Paris of the 18th century. As always it seems, with any new scientific idea or concept, it took a while for it to be accepted, but later work by paleontologists has confirmed Cuvier's findings.This is a well-written book which can popularize scientific concepts and principles for a mass audience. It is an easy read and a fairly short one at less than 300 pages. Kolbert includes extensive notes and bibliography for those who wish to read more on the subject."

Humanity's impact on the environment tends to either be presented in a deliberately polarizing manner for political reasons or presented with assumptions of scientific knowledge which most lack. The author did an amazing job of explaining the science behind the impact in layman's terms without omitting details that frequently don't make ""news"" stories on the topic. She even took the time to explain how mistakes and theory discrepancies happen in science. Even better, she did all of this calmly by presenting facts and logic without resorting to emotional manipulation.I loved the inclusion of small personal notes about the assorted scientists featured. While such asides don't contribute to the main premise of the book, they do make it much more engaging. Between that and her wonderful descriptive style, I found myself able to visualize her experiences and environments with a fullness usually only found in fiction.There are two things which would have greatly enhanced my pleasure in this book. An insert of color photos of the assorted plants and animals discussed would be awesome. I did Google quite a bit while reading this and it would have been preferable to have photos right in the book.Additionally, a chart/timeline depicting the assorted eras and epochs mentioned in chronological order with dates and maybe a few sample organisms listed for each section would have been great. Perhaps with the mass extinctions and suggested range for the anthropocene marked as well? As clear as her explanations were, some information processes better in images than text.Things I think should be changed before the final release:The graph on page 16 is hella blurry.On page 46 at the end of chapter 2, she first mentions that the megafauna extinction is becoming understood as being the result of the spread of modern humans. No specifics are gone into on this until page 230. This left me wary that she was going to start making assertions without any kind of backup in the beginning of the book and I felt a bit weirded out all the way through the book by that hanging thread even when it became clear that she was validating her beliefs with facts. As a reader, it would have been better for that statement to have been omitted in chapter 2 if it wasn't going to be developed for almost 200 pages. At the very least, it should be noted that it will be expanded upon later in the book.Page 86, line 19, the paragraph that starts with ""The bolide arrived from the southeast..."" I'm assuming that ""doe to its trajectory"" (later in that paragraph) should read due ""to its trajectory.""The last sentence on 113 going over to page 114 reads ""Change the atmosphere's composition atmosphere..."" Is that right? It seems like the second atmosphere is superfluous or at least awkward.I would omit the bit about the gift shop cashier not showing Ms. Kolbert around from page 226. It comes across petty and unflattering to the author. Even if there were no other customers, it's a given in *any* clerking job that you don't leave the shop unattended. You can get fired for that.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway. Many thanks to all involved in providing me with this opportunity."

In the pages that follow, I try to convey both sides: the excitement of what's being learned as well as the horror of it."" (3)Mission accomplished. I learned something, and I felt something.Kolbert writes scientific journalism with the best of them and here she distills a lot of contemporary findings into easily conveyed factoids for the layperson. She tells a dynamic story but with very little pearl-clutching. She's largely neutral in her presentation, though she doesn't shy away from the (well-supported and widely accepted) thesis that it's human activity that's effected the climate change resulting in subsequent extinctions and a vast reduction to Earth's biodiversity. Maybe it's too late for us to halt the sweeping global change humankind has generated, but like it or not it's inexcusable to not pay attention and not learn about it. And those skeptical or uninterested in hearing anyone try to cram environmentalism down their throat with a lot of moralizing needn't fear. There are many chapters that focus on other, nonhuman catastrophes and extinction events, how they were discovered and how they shaped modern scientific thought and theory.And stylistically, her prose is entertaining and never dull. Just one example:When I visited Reserve 1202, I ran into a graduate student from Portugal who was surveying bats. At noon he had just recently woken up and was eating pasta in a shed that served as a research station-cum-kitchen. While we were talking, a very skinny cowboy rode up on an only slightly less skinny horse. He had a rifle slung over one shoulder. I wasn't sure whether he'd come because he'd heard the truck I'd arrived on and wanted to protect the student from possible intruders, or because he sensed that there was pasta. (174)5 stars out of 5. Informative and entertaining. A big win for popular science fans."

Exploring the other five extinctions in the past and comparing them to the current destruction of the biosphere is sobering. It is unclear whether the sixth will surpass the other five (each extinction had its own pathology) or if we will survive the catastrophe we created but it is not pleasant to read about. This is one of those books that reminds the reader that it is worse than you think by far. I am not sure how to read the forensics of armageddon being shielded from nature by modern life, one will put this book down and pick up another at least until the resources run out. What books like this usually elicit are deer in the headlights paralysis or ostrich-like behavior or a shrug of the shoulders. Kind of strange the way we respond selectively to threats.

Depressing as heck, but if you want a good overview of the challenges facing our planet in regards to humans and how we are changing the earth and its ecosystems I recommend this. There is no doubt in my mind that we have started a cascade of environmental collapses that is going to be hard to curtail. We have to try and minimize the damage, the challenge will be beyond difficult, but it is a noble goal. "

I want to not feel that the earth is so doomed by our simply negligent hand. I want to write a series of children’s stories teaching them about the Frozen Zoo, and the drones that leads new flocks of birds in the wild to repopulate and make sure they land on safe ground, and apes that are domesticating dogs, that make tools, that every day we learn they are just a bit smarter than we thought. This is a horror story through and through about the changes going on in this world because of how we live our lives, because of how homo sapiens have ALWAYS lived their lives even before we started burning fossil fuels and putting pesticide on everything. I want to go on a tour and shake the hand of everyone working desperately to create safety arks for animals that we are abandoning by our own callousness. I want to visit these refuges and revel in them, and then leave, hopefully, with no trace of ever having been there.And now, I’ll just let the book speak for itself. The only thing I could have asked for it is that for it to be longer. “One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is that the world is changing in ways that compel species to move, and another is that it’s changing in ways that create barriers—roads, clear-cuts, cities—that prevent them from doing so.”“By burning through coal and oil deposits, humans are putting carbon back into the air that has been sequestered for tens—in most cases hundreds—of millions of years. In the process, we are running geologic history not only in reverse but at warp speed.” The anthropologist Richard Leakey has warned that “Homo sapiens might not only be the agent of the sixth extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.” A sign in the Hall of Biodiversity offers a quote from the Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich: IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” “coral cover in the Caribbean has in recent decades declined by close to eighty percent.”“Asian elephants have declined by fifty percent over the last three generations.” “some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere.” “WHY is ocean acidification so dangerous? The question is tough to answer only because the list of reasons is so long. Depending on how tightly organisms are able to regulate their internal chemistry, acidification may affect such basic processes as metabolism, enzyme activity, and protein function. Because it will” "

In South America they're all succumbing to an introduced disease.

Diseases can spread world-wide in a manner that was unthinkable just a few hundred years ago. It's not just the frogs. In North America, the bat population has dropped to next to nothing due to a fungi from Europe, with which European bats live quite happily, but which kill their American counterparts by the millions.""In times of extreme stress, the whole concept of fitness, at least in a Darwinian sense, loses its meaning: how could a creature be adapter, either well or ill, for conditions it has never before encountered in its entire evolutionary history?"" Then theres's the human induced global warming caused by billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere and into the oceans. There is also the impact of habitat loss due to human population explosion. Habitat loss, introduction of alien species and diseases, pouching, changing of living conditions to climate change - all of this means that we are living in a time when the extinction rate far surpasses the background rate. ""Right now, in the amazing mment that to us counts as the present, we are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will forever be closed.""Quite possibly, we are sawing off the branch we sit on.

Life would also surely bound back eventually, long after the last descendant of bipedal, hairless apes have vanished.This is a highly informative, well-written and captivating book. It explains the earlier big exctinctions and why there is one caused by us, happening now. It is a complex topic and this journalist does a job of presenting the facts in an understandable manner. I happened to read in a newspaper while reading this book, that just in England, 421 species have been lost in 200 years. This isn't propaganda - this is really happening. Highly recommended."
229,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene,3," This book was recommended on many lists last year and I had such high hopes when I started reading it. Unfortunately, I struggled with finishing it and walked away from it several times before I finally finished. Despite my statements, I want to make it clear that my failure to enjoy this book had nothing to do with the quality of the writing. It was clear that Ms. Kolbert spent a great deal of time researching.. traveling to various habitats for a first hand observation of the species which have already disappeared and the ones who are on the brink. She obtained an enormous amount of information from various scientists and even provided photographs. I simply found that the book could not hold my attention. Perhaps if I had more of a knowledge base in animal biology, botany and environmental science, I could have enjoyed this book more than I did. Or perhaps if I had just put it aside to come back to it at a later time, I would have gotten more out of it… regardless, the book just did not hold my interest. That said, I would not discourage anyone else from reading the book. The failure to enjoy was mine. "

The book covers a lot of ground, from Georges Cuvier, Darwin, to modern day ecology and conservations, from arctic to tropical rain forests, from national parks to zoos. I've learned lot of about extinctions in the earth history and the current ongoing extinction—the sixth extinction that is solely humans' doing. Perhaps the reason that we, homo sapiens, have become the dominate species of the world, is the same reason that will cause our own eventual extinction."
231,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-shakespeareandspice,4,I read this all in one go because I knew multiple pauses would likely just extend the misery. It’s particularly hard to read a book such as this knowing things will likely only get worse with the donkey that is our President leading one of the world’s most powerful nations. We’re talking billions of lives. And millions of species. Including us.
232,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"It sounds strange to say I enjoyed reading this book about the increasingly profound and potentially devastating impact humans are having on our home planet, with an especial focus on the animals and plants who share Earth with us, but enjoy it I did. It’s a riveting topic, the history of our world and our species, and Elizabeth Kolbert has the knack of writing about science so it retains all its natural fascination while still being accessible to laypeople. She takes the reader with her back in time and around the world as she accompanies researchers in places ranging from the Andes mountains to the Great Barrier Reef. One particular fact has really stuck with me--as human activity increasingly homogenizes the global environment by transporting plants and animals all over the planet biodiversity is increasing on the small scale, so that where you live is likely to have more species than it did formerly, but because invasive flora and fauna can wipe out native plants and animals global biodiversity is rapidly shrinking as the total number of species on the Earth continues to dwindle. And that’s the point of the title, The Sixth Extinction. There have been five periods of mass extinction on our planet and some scientists are finding evidence indicating that we may be on the cusp of or even in the midst of a sixth wave of mass die offs, this one caused by the activities of humans, a chilling realization."
233,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'The Sixth Extinction' is written like a magazine article for a general reader, yet it tells intelligently an engaging true science story about several various geological locations important to the history of the scientific discoveries about evolution and extinction. The author personally visits and describes sites around the world - islands, forests, oceans, caves, museums - some of which take a lot of effort and discomfort to reach. These particular locations have a huge importance because each site is where an 'eureka!' moment occurred for a scientist who was often there for a different reason, but then he discovered something else instead; something which ended in clearing up everything confusing or wrong about our understanding of how the earth's climate changed in the past and is changing now. The discovery that the macro-climate can change on earth, and has apparently changed five times previously, and that these macro-climate changes also appear to be linked to changes in local animals and plants as well. It took time before everyone accepted the evidence presented that the earth and its environment has changed dramatically several times, and even longer for scientists to agree what the evidence signified. Early scientists had to not only accept the evidence of their own eyes and discoveries, they had to overcome biblical teachings which had told them the earth cannot change because it must be as perfect as the god who created it 6,000 years previously. These early struggles with the Church in interpreting physical clues are what led to the 'scientific method' of proving beyond doubt the conclusions reached from actually studying physical discoveries and not relying on religious beliefs from ancient scriptures. (One of the Church's precepts was everything on earth was unchanging and perfect. The fact that animals could die off as a species and disappear permanently from the face of the earth, or even worse, evolve, was not a possibility if the Church or the bible was correct. In time, the preponderance of the physical evidence overwhelmed the bible's myths. The author hints at the scientific disarray in accepting the facts of living creatures changing and disappearing because of the rigid philosophical belief in an unchanging world, but she does not dive into the religious elements which delayed the conclusions from scientific discoveries.)I found the book easy to read and understand. The facts and history of the concepts of evolution and climate change are conversationally and logically introduced. It deepened my understanding of how the scientists know climate changed billions of years ago and is changing now, and how they know the current change is already affecting life dramatically. Instead of jargon, you'll be able to speak it in plain English.The three issues the author gently exposes, after unobtrusively teaching us history, is how Humanity is involved, perhaps primarily responsible, in the current sixth ongoing climate change because: one, of our restless traveling around the world transporting, mostly unwisely, other life forms; as well as two, the CO2 we are pumping into the air from our gasoline-fueled cars and coal burning for electrical energy, which is changing (killing) the seas, trees/forests and wildlife the world over; and our extermination of animals in hunting for food, fun and profit (animals affect the type and quantity/quality of plants in their environment through their activities and nutritional needs, and by the symbiotic or otherwise interested neighbor animals who want to live close to their prey food). Your grandkids may not grow up with the trees, insects or local neighborhood wild animals and birds you did, or have cheap water to drink or cheap electricity to run their devices. The air certainly will be different.After finishing this book, you might want to look at a fiction novel, The Road. Warning: it's an extremely terrifying look at living in a world utterly wrecked environmentally, and it had me in tears.The following opinions are all me, and not in this science book. I think we will be the first species in earth's history that had the power to destroy AND save the earth, as well as ourselves, but we couldn't focus. Instead, we chose to party on: 1. hunt and kill off the last mega fauna like rhinoceroses and sharks to eat their horns/fins for that important personal 15-minute sexual erection; 2. cut down the annoying mega-flora for more houses and cheap furniture and better views; 3. put personal mega-billions of capital to work as investments in dozens of mansions/property around the world (plus living in one or three mansions isn't enough of an exercise of personal power, which is why the addition of environmentally controlled garages to house the yachts, the hundreds of 'antique' cars that will never be driven, to possess shoes, dresses and purses purchased for thousands of dollars each, etc. - conspicuous consumption being a tried-and-true method of relieving the boredom of wealth); 4. become socially powerful enough to manipulate/buy political votes to benefit/protect individual sources of capital; 5. use valuable resources to make war murder mayhem because of displaced aggression and blood lust; 6. make more babies because a priest/minister/Imam says god hates contraception (more mouths to feed, house and poop);7. For every facility which finally reduces their air/water/soil pollutants after decades of extended court fights, nine other facilities continue to pollute excessively around the world.8. and pray fruitlessly in religious rituals for a god to tell us our marching orders (which will never occur). We REALLY should be more environmentally responsible for our own self and the others who depend on us, but honestly? I don't think it's gonna happen. Anyone else notice, for example, how the local waters are too polluted for your kids to fish and swim in today, but you remember happily doing both safely? Anyone else notice how more flooding occurs in your neighborhood today? Anyone else notice how the local birds, bees and animal life have disappeared around your house? Anyone else notice the mountains of trash everywhere? Or the fouled beaches because the sewage treatment facility, overwhelmed again, had a spill? For the record, I believe we are doomed as a viable species. We don't seem to be able to overcome our DNA inheritance or be able to reprogram our animal brain desires for immediate emotional rush satisfactions. Our lusts for sex, social/tribal affiliation, personal power and self-aggrandizement, chocolate, drama, speed, explosions and killing things overwhelm our strengths in planning ahead, memory, intelligence, education, math and spatial skills, creativity, building tools, feelings that a single sacrifice for the many is worthy, love, affection, empathy, sharing the abundance and living in moderation. Our archaeological record, when it is dug up and discovered by the next species to rise to intelligence and tool-building a million years from now, after Homo sapiens has disappeared, will be condensed down to 'we coulda and we shoulda, but we didna'."

It's quite a topic - what we are doing to the world, and what we have done and what we are likely going to do. This mostly wasn't new information to me - but the acidification of the oceans was new. I mean I see the headlines and I know it's a issue, but I didn't understand the nature of it, or make the connection to shells and reefs.What I like about the book is, first of all, that it's getting read. The more people who read this the better. It's good information. Even well informed people don't generally grasp the scope and extent of what we are doing to our planet. She mixes in the dire future predictions, and the uncertainties of these, with lots of interesting historical details on science coming to terms with extinction, and other related topics. She covers in some detail three of the five major extinction events (why only three?) The problem with ocean acidification, in brief, is how it affects animals that secrete shells or any hard carbonate-mineral parts, especially in the common form of aragonite. This stuff dissolves in acid. The extra CO2 in the air leads to more of it getting absorbed into the ocean, and this makes the oceans more acidic. The acidity makes these hard parts more soluble, as in closer to actually dissolving, and therefore they become harder to make and animals make less of them. So, as the acidity increases, our corals start making less exoskeleton and eventually will just stop, meaning our coral reefs will die. We have made the oceans 40% more acidic then they were before the industrial revolution. My one complaint is that the book seems to target our emotions more than I'm comfortable with. It's really a borderline issue - unless you listen on audio. The reader, Anne Twomey, insanely over-dramatizes the book, weakening it the severely. It sounds like a bad psuedo-science show on a coming UFO invasion. (I did listen to sample before I purchased. There was a very passionate and professional reader. Only after I purchased did I learn that the sample was Kolbert herself, reading the prologue. Wish she had read the whole book.)We have all read plenty of everyone-should-read-this-book comments on important nonfiction books, and that does add a bit of discouragement into the encouragement. I hope the later overpowers the former. Everyone should be reading books like this."

Apart from the stereotypical acts of human depravity, there is also the passive damage inflicted on the natural world by our very existence. In Elizabeth Kolbert's outstanding The Sixth Extinction, the author writes in exceptionally readable and compelling language on a subject that is essential reading for members of our species.  Eschewing one particular approach to the depiction of extinction, Kolbert alternates the subjects of her chapters between multiple disciplines. History, geology, biology, ecology, and many other disciplines all make for a varied and hard-hitting treatise on the demise of the world's organisms. What's more, Kolbert breaks up her exposition with her experiences at the various places around earth on which she writes. These sections ground what can be very esoteric subject matter as the effects of these theories are seen through Kolbert's eyes. In a similar vein, Kolbert's aim with the book is not to accuse and depress, rather she seeks to educate the populace on the changes occurring on Earth. I have read many reviews that called this book depressing and guilt-inducing, however it was my feeling that the book maintains an upbeat, yet objective, tone throughout.  I am more likely to be found reading fiction than nonfiction; stories and characters have always interested me more than fact and figures. Perhaps it is that my professional days are filled with fact that I seek escape on my personal time. Despite this predilection for fiction, I am occasionally taken in by a nonfiction book and revel in the fashion the author arrives at their conclusion. The Sixth Extinction not only has the benefit of being one such book, it also has the prestige of being a book of great importance. If you're overwhelmed and unaffected by the media's liberal use of global warming, climate change, ocean acidification, and extinction events then this is exactly the book you should be reading. Its appeal is visceral as well as intellectual, and should be read by as many humans as possible. After all, we just happen to be the book's primary villains."

This non-fiction science book briefly covers the major and minor extinction cycles that have occured over the life of the planet, as well as current theories as to what caused them. The book is divided into 13 chapters, and each chapter deals with a specific current extinction, or near extinction, event. I loved the dots that this book connected for me. I loved that this current extinction cycle (clearly caused by Sapiens) is discussed in the context of the very long history of the planet. I loved learning about things I had no idea about, annual coral reef sex orgies comes to mind, and was saddened to learn about some of the species that have gone the way of the Dodo in my lifetime. I loved the science and learning about some scientists I knew nothing about. There is so much covered here, but all in a very accessible, easy to read manner. I am surprised that I was left with a feeling of hope at the end of this book. Not because I think that Humans will halt or reverse the processes we have put into play, but rather because after we become extinct, life will continue to find a way. Context is everything. I highly recommend this one."

There's something very magical about it, as if the planet is getting a good spring cleaning and all its inhabitants an urgently needed recalibrating of priorities. I love how people who do important jobs are suddenly getting all the love instead of narcissistic moronic reality TV celebrities and the like who had the limelight before. And the absence of cars, especially at night, is wonderful. The shot of the Himalayas visible from New Delhi for the first time in decades was especially poignant. And, on the whole, people are more friendly. There's a lot more generosity towards the poor. And so many health workers over here in the UK are of ethnic minority backgrounds that racism more than ever has been highlighted as the outlandish unforgivable expression of brute stupidity it is. The virus has made a nonsense of militant nationalism too. Takes a pandemic for most to understand that every border is in essence illusory; that we're all in this together. And how pettily absurd Brexit now seems. I hope this new generation will take on board this rejigging of social and ethical priorities and as a result be much more committed to looking after the planet.   Anyway, Elizabeth Kolbert in this book visits a series of research centres all over the globe, all with their own specialised subject, all charting and trying to prevent the sudden alarming demise of various species of mammal, bird, reptile and insect. She intersperses these individual and local sagas with an overview of how extinctions have occurred in the planet's history. Meticulously and convincingly she helps us to understand how quickly and carelessly we're heading towards the next big extinction, the first caused by humans. I liked this more than The Uninhabitable Earth because it's completely cleansed of the hellfire indignation which for me marred David Wallace-Wells' book."

You won’t be after you read this.Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it. To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly. Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.Harboring some hubris about your place in the world? Here’s a tonic:a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man—the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories—will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper.What else can I say about this book? The picture Kolbert paints of our situation is every bit as depressing as you might expect. I already knew the facts about climate change and animal extinction, but according to Kolbert the prognosis is even worse than I was aware, given that ocean acidification – “global warming’s ‘equally evil twin’” – is one contributor I hadn’t ever considered. Likewise, though I’d heard about the crisis with the world’s amphibians, I was entirely ignorant of the bat cataclysm (white-nose syndrome).As a longtime New Yorker journalist, Kolbert writes at a good level for laymen: not talking down, but not assuming any specialist knowledge either. I was somewhat unconvinced by her thematic, species-by-species approach here; it makes each chapter more like an individual essay than a part of a larger argument. Winging her way around the world (what carbon footprint?!), she considers auks and ammonites, mastodons and endangered zoo animals in captive breeding programs, dying coral reefs, and pockets of Amazonian rainforest. By the end, you’ll be in no doubt that we are in the middle of a major extinction event, and that our era will be known as the “Anthropocene” – the age of the influence of man.Luckily, there are spots of humor to lighten the tone, such as “The reason this book is being written by a hairy biped, rather than a scaly one, has more to do with dinosaurian misfortune than with any particular mammalian virtue.”As Caspar Henderson writes in his Guardian review, “The extinction crisis is so vast and complex that it almost repels thought. We need a lot more imaginative thinking about the choices we can make and what comes next.” Now that this has won a Pulitzer, one hopes it will get people talking and doing some of that imaginative thinking. Unfortunately, it’s so much easier to bury heads in the sand and keep going as we have been. Time will tell whether we heed the lessons of this book."

To the extent that we can identify the causes of these revolutions, they're highly varied: glaciation in the case of the ordovician extinction, global warming and chances in chemistry at the end of the Permian, an asteroid impact in the final seconds of the Cretaceous. The current extinction has its own novel cause: not an asteroid or a massive volcanic eruption but ""one weedy species. As Walter Alvarez put it to me, ""We're seeing right now that a mass extinction can be cause by human beings."" (265-266) ""With the capacity to represent the world in signs and symbols comes the capacity to change it, which as it happens, is also the capacity to destroy it. A ting set of genetic variations divides us from the Neanderthals, but that has made all the difference. (258)It isn't unique to note that humanity has dangerously altered the planet in a way that no other species before it has done as conclusively demonstrated by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. What makes this book not only important but a must-read is the case by case basis which she follows through with each chapter of extinct or near-to-extinct case studies of populations of animals, from the American Mastodon to the frogs of central Panama to the Sumatran Rhino. Because of the subject matter and the grand question of purpose among our own species, the ones before us, and the ones that will come after we're gone, this book is something that stays with the reader afterwards, pondering the grand invention of creation, evolution, and eventual disarray. The book provides a great overview of the subject matter that newcomers will find informative and enjoyable, and despite the information presented, does offer glimpses of hope and even humour. What is so fascinating about the subject matter is the concept of how life has survived and altered itself time after time on our bountiful rock, and how little we as a species really understand the world we have seemingly (or rather forcibly) inherited. It was only roughly 300 years ago that palaeontology began to take it's first steps as a major science with the discovery of mastodon bones in North America, and that whole different worlds existed before ours. It was only in 1831 that Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle and made his way around the world, specifically to the Galapagos, giving us terms in his ""On the Origins of Species"" that now represent mainstream science. Neanderthals only were discovered shorted after Darwin's voyage, and it was only in 2004 that a hobbit like humanoid species was discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia. How freaking amazing and unbelievable is that?It was interested to see Kolbert's travels around the globe, diving into the globalisation aspects of humanity that give us terms like ""New Pangaea,"" how bat populations in the Northeastern part of the US have dropped off significantly do to factors that bats elsewhere in the world are immune to, the investigation into rainforest populations in South America, and the incredible efforts scientists are doing to protect endangered species, like giving rhinos ultrasounds and crows handjobs. It's a tale of our grim actions, but the hopeful aspects of our understanding of the world that can add it. The choice is up to us as a species."

244,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"It's absolutely, extremely, utterly, incredibly important for the general reader to remember that the real story of science is written in the language of mathematics. When authors put the story of scientific disciplines like physics, or chemistry or even biology into words and stories, they are translating something hard and complex and precise into a soft, fuzzy medium.It's analogous to knitting a replica of Michelangelo's David. Even if you are a genius knitter, the end result will only be (at best) a flabby simulacrum of the authentic object.If you experienced the knitted David (let's call him Dave) you would have a general, vague sense of what the real David was like. But you would be a long way away from really understanding the awe inspiring experience of the real deal.Let's take the analogy one step further. Imagine you're an alien, and you discovered the knitted Dave. But you had never seen the real David sculpture, or (more importantly) an actual human specimen. How much would you really understand about people, based on you're observations of the knitted Dave. You would have a very general sense. Enough to pick a hominid out of a crowd of donkeys. But that's about it. Better than nothing, but far from expertise. I love evolutionary biology and ecology and sociology. But I'm not trained in any of these disciplines. My understanding of them is via popularizations like this. Even within my discipline of clinical psychology, I'm barely educated. But outside of my discipline, I am essentially an enthusiastic dilettante. That's not a dis. That's just another way of saying, I haven't spent 4 years of undergraduate training to prepare for another 4 years of doctoral training to prepare for another 3-5 years of post doctoral training to prepare for another 10-20 years of professional research in any of those fields.Humans specialize. None of us could possibly be specialists in more than one or maybe two of these domains. There just isn't enough time in a human life span.I have a laypersons education of ecology and biology. That's nothing to scoff at. It took (literally) hundreds of hours of hard work, reading a bunch of books, taking classes, talking to experts etc. to gain my laypersons understanding of evolutionary biology. But honestly, I wouldn't know an actual darwinian algorithm from a hole in the ground, let alone be able to accurately interpret the findings of the mathematical models experts develop and use to understand complex systems like species population dynamics and ecosystems.So I have to rely on experts and science journalists to tell me the story in English. I need these dedicated, talented individuals to ""knit me a Dave"". That's exactly what Elizabeth Kolbert did. She knitted us a Dave. The Sixth Extinction is a soft, cuddly, children's storybook version of the hard, awful reality the actual experts in the field of biology and ecology are bearing witness to.If she had delivered us a harder version. It would have been (a) unintelligible to us mere mortals, and (b) so unspeakably awful, that most of us would have never, ever willingly subjected ourselves to this horrible, terrifying (much more than inconvenient) truth. Even the ""soft"" Dave version is pretty fucking tragic and demoralizing. If I were to give you a quick sketch analogy of what the knitted Dave of mass extinction looks like. Imagine a plush toy bat (flying mammal), stuffed with dead, decomposing frogs, with an invasive fungus choking his nostrils, literally starving to death, drooling acrid barren sea water and sputtering a creepy recorded (five nights at Freddie's) robot voice looping the phrase, ""we're all going to die a horrible, slow death, we're all going to suffocate in a giant cesspool of our own feces, and it's way too late to do anything about it"".Not exactly Tickle Me Elmo, but still, a very soft version of the reality.One can only imagine the horror that experts feel when they see entire species evaporate, or when they crunch the numbers and the results look like an ASCII skull and bones. You can imagine these nerdy bookworm types, realizing the awful reality and trying desperately to communicate the immense gravity of the situation to the stoners, jocks and rednecks who used to beat and torture them in high school, only to receive responses like ""The Bible says we can despoil the earth however we see fit"" or ""it's only a theory"" or ""not all scientists agree"" or ""it was cold for a few days this summer, so that proves global warming is a scam"".Even the most charismatic of the nerds, Think Neil Degrassi Tyson, Carl Sagan or Al Gore still only managed to capture the hearts and minds of ""egg head PBS types"", even when they limit their messages to what can be communicated via entertaining, schticky soundbites, Hollywood style computer animated visualizations and 30 minute PowerPoint slideshows.The Sixth Extinction goes at explaining the issue of the ecological disaster we currently find ourselves in by giving a brief history of the previous five mass extinction events that science has identified. Apparently global species population and diversity levels expand and contract regularly, but have dropped to next to nothing for various reasons thorough out the history of life on earth. The previous 5 mass extinction events are:1: the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event (occurring about 66 Ma) in which about 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. 2: the Triassic–Jurassic extinction (occurring about 201.3 Ma) in which about 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species went extinct.3: the Permian-Triassic transition. (occurring about 252 Ma). Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects).4: the Devonian Period (occurring 375–360 Ma), a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species.5: the Ordovician–Silurian extinction (occurring 450–440 Ma) killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.At one point, around 70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens almost went extinct. About 90% of us died. We got down to an estimated 40 breeding pairs. That's really close to extinction. But we showed em our bounce back stuff and boy look at us now!Now we're officially in the Holocene period (and have been for more than 10,000 years), but many scientists are pushing the point that we have officially exited the Holocene and entered an altogether new epoch that they are calling the Anthropocene. They argue that humans are having such a pronounced impact on the enviornment that we should be the titular species of this particular cene (hence the Anthro at the beginning of the word).They also argue that there is a new mass extinction event currently under way that may be the worst one yet. They are calling it the.... You guessed it....6: the Anthropocene extinction.That's awesome right? It's exciting to be a part of history. Even if it's potentially the end of it.Bad Boundaries:One of the salient points in the book is that global climate instability is not the only source of extinction. Another big problem happens when an ecosystems square footage is reduced or its boundaries are violated. Obviously deforestation is a huge problem. By making the rain forests land coverage smaller, it shrinks the biodiversity exponentially (there's that math stuff again). Apparently there's a formula for it that calculates the extinction rates as you down scale an environment. It's like the E=Mc2 of the apocalypse.But globalization is also a huge problem in that it introduces invasive species like rats into sensitive environments. Apparently rats have been hitching rides on boats for as long as people of been sailing.Invasive species can literally crash an ecology. In the book, Kolbert discusses a species of gray snake that was introduced to an island echo system that basically ate everything. It reduced to a tropical island full of pretty birds, lizards and bugs to pretty much just only snakes.Kolbert makes the gorgeous point that it's easy to vilify the little grey snake. But the snake isn't mean or immoral, it's amoral, meaning it's It's simply doing what it's hardwired to do. It's just trying to survive and reproduce. The Ultimate Invasive Species:In case you're wondering where this is going, the ultimate invasive species is us. Humans go just about everywhere And everywhere that humans go, almost everything else dies. It's not that were mean or immoral, were actually amoral in the same way the grey snake is. We're simply doing we're all hardwired to do. Survive and reproduce (with obvious exceptions, but not enough to make a critical difference).We like to hold ourselves to moral standards, and vilify some bad guys e.g. Dick Cheney (I'm not saying he's not, but just hear me out).The fact of the matter is, the Anthropocene extinction isn't happening because we're immoral. It's happening because we're amoral.It may seem like I'm splitting hairs but the distinction is important.Perhaps viewing ourselves as moral, and holding ourselves and others to standards of morality is part of the problem. Perhaps framing this ecological crisis as a moral issue is creating a fatal blind spot. Perhaps experimental psychology can be of assistance in explaining my point.Don't Diss Me:Cognitive dissonance is the very reliably observed psychological phenomena, whereby people (including you me and everybody we know) confabulate anxiety reducing fictions when confronted with our own amoral behavior.So in other words, when people realize that their behavior is incongruent with their values, they feel bad, but rather than change the behavior, they make up a story (no matter how absurd) that relieves them of the pain of their own hypocrisy. For example, consider a situation in which someone who places a value on being environmentally responsible just purchased a cool new chick magnet car that he later discovers is a gas guzzler.The conflict:It is important for the man to be (at least viewed as) a good steward of the environment. But he is now driving a babe getting machine that also happens to double as an earth warmer.As you can imagine, he's feeling rather conflicted about now. Drive a Prius and die a childless and alone, or drive the Maserati and repopulate Brentwood. In order to reduce the dissonance between his values and his behavior, he can (a) utilize public transportation more frequently (which is probably not going to happen, maybe in Seattle, not in L.A.), or he could (b) sell the car and purchase another one that gets better gas mileage (which, again, not hugely probable), or he could (c) convince himself that maybe all the global warming stuff is a little overblown, and one little Maserati aint gona kill nobody (which is a whole lot easier than option (a) or (b), and therefore pretty fucking likely).I know what you're thinking, ""other people do that, but I don't do that"". But you do, we all do, we just don't realize it. That's why they call it a blind spot.It sounds far fetched but cognitive dissonance has been observed in tightly controlled experiments again and again. Everyone does it. Even (no particularly) if you're a trained mental health professional,So maybe if we stop viewing the ecology issue moralistically, and start viewing it more pragmatically, than perhaps we can all stop pointing fingers and except the fact that we're all totally fucked and were going to die and there's noting we can do about it.No no. Of course there's something we can do about it. But we really need to accept that it's happening. Accept that were all complicit (even if you recycle), and then....I actually don't know what. But something I hope. Additionally, all of us regular people need to trust the experts. We may get a cold day in August and think we're all good. But that's not how this shit works. You have to do math and stuff. And odds are great that you don't. So trust the people that do and just do what they tell you. Even if you love Jesus. Which you probably don't if you're still reading this.Lastly, it occurred to me that I'm not going to face the worst of this, and my kid won't either, but her kids (should she ignore reason and reproduce) will. I'll just be honest here. Part of me has a hard time worrying past next week. And that same part of me kind of thinks, what ever, I'll be dead by then, and I know I'm not alone in this particular brand of denial. Cognitive dissonance ladies and gentlemen, don't let it win."
245,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2184529-justin-evans,3,"I'm glad this book was published, and glad it got so much attention. On the other hand, I wish it had been much better. The first half is solid, inasmuch as it has some information about the history, and historiography, of extinction. The second half gets a little head-banging-against-a-wall, with example after example of currently endangered or recently extinct species, all told in the same palatable way. So, beware reader, that if you are like me, you might want to skip this book. It goes to great lengths to be entertaining, but entertaining in a very New Yorker kind of way. We learn more, I would guess, about the appearance and dress of the scientists Kolbert meets than we do about the extinctions she describes. We hear a lot about how people feel. We get a lot of novelistic realism about animal's rumps. And I just don't care. So frustrated was I by Kolbert's presentation of genuinely disturbing events that I started to think what a counter-argument might look like. Here are a couple: i) Kolbert pushes the 'anthropocene' (i.e., the 'geological' epoch determined by the existence of humanity and our destruction of other species) into the *very* distant past, roughly, when the indigenous peoples of Australia first killed off the continent's mega-fauna. But it is utterly ridiculous to liken prehistoric, and 20th and 21st century, human impact on the environment. Not to put too fine a point on it, back then we were just another species, though a successful one. Today, we run the planet. Eliding that difference makes it impossible to recognize what has caused the vast majority of extinctions over the last two centuries, viz., uncontrolled economic development. That's an argument I believe. The next one I'm not so sure about, but I do think there's a case to be answered: ii) Extinction is a natural occurrence. Granted that it's greatly accelerated over the last couple of centuries, but really, why worry so much? What moral obligation do we have towards *species*, as opposed to *living individuals*? If you have to kill a hundred foxes to reintroduce a threatened species into their previously natural environment, is that really a moral thing to do? What about the foxes' lives, after all? And so on. This book doesn't deal with such problems, but then, it wasn't meant to. It is entertaining propaganda, and good on Kolbert for bringing the issues up in the first place. "

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human. (watch here"

""To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more or were willing to make sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter when lather people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.""Does it mean that any conservation effort is for naught? Have we crossed a threshold that we cannot uncross? Not sure. Very likely you won't be either after reading it.Lots to chew on here - not all that pleasant either.

I have not been this disappointed in a book in a long while. More than a quarter of the length of the book was dedicated to notes. She touched on history as archeology has helped define it with reference to the past extinctions. I think, because she was being a writer, she needed to tell me things I didn't care to know, like what she and her research mates had for breakfast before they set out to discover whether or not a particular bug was or was not extinct.So here's the big spoiler alert.....she said humans were well on the way to an extinction and we were bringing it on ourselves. The sixth extinction is us. The one high point of the book for me was that she did not....to my memory....suggest that we could change things before it's too late.

250,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,4,"Elizabeth Kolbert knows how to put things together. She managed to create a very thoroughly documented book and to raise awareness about the extinction of species.The five extinctions known in the history of Earth decimated the species up to 96% (a brief summary can be read here: https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontol...)The sixth extinction here in question is named so because of the rate at which species are disappearing now:
“Calculating the background extinction rate is a laborious task that entails combing through whole databases’ worth of fossils. For what’s probably the best-studied group, which is mammals, it’s been reckoned to be roughly .25 per million species-years. This means that, since there are about fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around today, at the background extinction rate you’d expect—once again, very roughly—one species to disappear every seven hundred years.A rigorous calculation of the background extinction rate for amphibians has not been performed, in part because amphibian fossils are so rare. Almost certainly, though, the rate is lower than it is for mammals. Probably, one amphibian species should go extinct every thousand years or so.Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world’s most endangered class of animals; it’s been calculated that the group’s extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.”
And we, humans, are to blame here. The book has plenty of examples in which we exterminated a lot of species: the one concerning the great auk is so heart-breaking depicted. I do hope this book to be read by as many people as possible and maybe something in our collective mentality will change. We are just one species among so many other and just because we are more intelligent than the others (debatable from my point of view) does not make us owners of this planet and its life forms.
”In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us? One possibility—the possibility implied by the Hall of Biodiversity—is that we, too, will eventually be undone by our “transformation of the ecological landscape.” The logic behind this way of thinking runs as follows: having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth’s biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems—cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans—we’re putting our own survival in danger.”
It is not an easy book but it is definitely worth reading."
251,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches. - Stanford ecologist Paul EhrlichAs far as science has been able to determine, there have been five mass extinctions of life on Earth in the history of our planet. The first of these occurred at the end of the Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era about 450 million years ago. The second occurred less than 100 million years later in the late Devonian period. There followed the End-Permian extinction of some 250 million years ago, the Late Triassic extinction of 200 million years ago, and finally, the last one and the one we are most familiar with, the End-Cretaceous extinction which occurred about 65 million years ago. That's the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. (Well, almost - except for the ancestors of birds.)The best evidence seems to indicate that all of these extinctions except for the last one were the result of climatological events, often relatively sudden events to which plants and animals did not have time to adapt. The cause of the fifth one was also a change in climate but it was brought about by a collision with an asteroid. That cataclysmic event so altered the climate of the planet for a time that many, many species died out either suddenly or over a period of years.Scientists believe that we are now in the midst of the sixth extinction which Earth has endured and that this extinction is entirely human-caused. Elizabeth Kolbert writes in this book about how our species has altered life on the planet as no other species has before. It's not just that we are changing the climate for the worse, although that certainly is a big part of it, but we also have altered the face of Earth and the chemistry of the oceans to the detriment of very many species.One of the biggest problems that we have created for other species is simply the fact that we move everything around and wherever we go on Earth, it seems that some species hitch a ride with us. So a species from Asia that would never under normal circumstances make it to the Americas is brought here either wittingly or unwittingly and it wreaks havoc. Kolbert points out that the most endangered family of animals on Earth today are the amphibians. They are being wiped out by a fungus that has been spread around the world by humans. Kolbert writes about a dozen species, some of them already irrevocably lost and others on their way out. Through these very personal stories of that wonderful bird the Great Auk, the Panamanian golden frog, staghorn coral, the Sumatran rhino and others, the reader is moved to begin to understand the enormity of what is happening. What we are causing to happen to our world. It is somewhat surprising to learn that the concept of extinction is not a very old one. Kolbert points out that it was first articulated by Georges Cuvier in the revolutionary Paris of the 18th century. As always it seems, with any new scientific idea or concept, it took a while for it to be accepted, but later work by paleontologists has confirmed Cuvier's findings.This is a well-written book which can popularize scientific concepts and principles for a mass audience. It is an easy read and a fairly short one at less than 300 pages. Kolbert includes extensive notes and bibliography for those who wish to read more on the subject."
252,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17061542-zoe-s-human,4,"I learned many new things and I laughed a few times as well. That's pretty much a win for non-fiction. Humanity's impact on the environment tends to either be presented in a deliberately polarizing manner for political reasons or presented with assumptions of scientific knowledge which most lack. The author did an amazing job of explaining the science behind the impact in layman's terms without omitting details that frequently don't make ""news"" stories on the topic. She even took the time to explain how mistakes and theory discrepancies happen in science. Even better, she did all of this calmly by presenting facts and logic without resorting to emotional manipulation.I loved the inclusion of small personal notes about the assorted scientists featured. While such asides don't contribute to the main premise of the book, they do make it much more engaging. Between that and her wonderful descriptive style, I found myself able to visualize her experiences and environments with a fullness usually only found in fiction.There are two things which would have greatly enhanced my pleasure in this book. An insert of color photos of the assorted plants and animals discussed would be awesome. I did Google quite a bit while reading this and it would have been preferable to have photos right in the book.Additionally, a chart/timeline depicting the assorted eras and epochs mentioned in chronological order with dates and maybe a few sample organisms listed for each section would have been great. Perhaps with the mass extinctions and suggested range for the anthropocene marked as well? As clear as her explanations were, some information processes better in images than text.Things I think should be changed before the final release:The graph on page 16 is hella blurry.On page 46 at the end of chapter 2, she first mentions that the megafauna extinction is becoming understood as being the result of the spread of modern humans. No specifics are gone into on this until page 230. This left me wary that she was going to start making assertions without any kind of backup in the beginning of the book and I felt a bit weirded out all the way through the book by that hanging thread even when it became clear that she was validating her beliefs with facts. As a reader, it would have been better for that statement to have been omitted in chapter 2 if it wasn't going to be developed for almost 200 pages. At the very least, it should be noted that it will be expanded upon later in the book.Page 86, line 19, the paragraph that starts with ""The bolide arrived from the southeast..."" I'm assuming that ""doe to its trajectory"" (later in that paragraph) should read due ""to its trajectory.""The last sentence on 113 going over to page 114 reads ""Change the atmosphere's composition atmosphere..."" Is that right? It seems like the second atmosphere is superfluous or at least awkward.I would omit the bit about the gift shop cashier not showing Ms. Kolbert around from page 226. It comes across petty and unflattering to the author. Even if there were no other customers, it's a given in *any* clerking job that you don't leave the shop unattended. You can get fired for that.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway. Many thanks to all involved in providing me with this opportunity."

In the pages that follow, I try to convey both sides: the excitement of what's being learned as well as the horror of it."" (3)Mission accomplished. I learned something, and I felt something.Kolbert writes scientific journalism with the best of them and here she distills a lot of contemporary findings into easily conveyed factoids for the layperson. She tells a dynamic story but with very little pearl-clutching. She's largely neutral in her presentation, though she doesn't shy away from the (well-supported and widely accepted) thesis that it's human activity that's effected the climate change resulting in subsequent extinctions and a vast reduction to Earth's biodiversity. Maybe it's too late for us to halt the sweeping global change humankind has generated, but like it or not it's inexcusable to not pay attention and not learn about it. And those skeptical or uninterested in hearing anyone try to cram environmentalism down their throat with a lot of moralizing needn't fear. There are many chapters that focus on other, nonhuman catastrophes and extinction events, how they were discovered and how they shaped modern scientific thought and theory.And stylistically, her prose is entertaining and never dull. Just one example:When I visited Reserve 1202, I ran into a graduate student from Portugal who was surveying bats. At noon he had just recently woken up and was eating pasta in a shed that served as a research station-cum-kitchen. While we were talking, a very skinny cowboy rode up on an only slightly less skinny horse. He had a rifle slung over one shoulder. I wasn't sure whether he'd come because he'd heard the truck I'd arrived on and wanted to protect the student from possible intruders, or because he sensed that there was pasta. (174)5 stars out of 5. Informative and entertaining. A big win for popular science fans."

Exploring the other five extinctions in the past and comparing them to the current destruction of the biosphere is sobering. It is unclear whether the sixth will surpass the other five (each extinction had its own pathology) or if we will survive the catastrophe we created but it is not pleasant to read about. This is one of those books that reminds the reader that it is worse than you think by far. I am not sure how to read the forensics of armageddon being shielded from nature by modern life, one will put this book down and pick up another at least until the resources run out. What books like this usually elicit are deer in the headlights paralysis or ostrich-like behavior or a shrug of the shoulders. Kind of strange the way we respond selectively to threats. If species extinction flew a plane into a building may be the human race would respond."

Depressing as heck, but if you want a good overview of the challenges facing our planet in regards to humans and how we are changing the earth and its ecosystems I recommend this. There is no doubt in my mind that we have started a cascade of environmental collapses that is going to be hard to curtail. We have to try and minimize the damage, the challenge will be beyond difficult, but it is a noble goal. "

I want to not feel that the earth is so doomed by our simply negligent hand. I want to write a series of children’s stories teaching them about the Frozen Zoo, and the drones that leads new flocks of birds in the wild to repopulate and make sure they land on safe ground, and apes that are domesticating dogs, that make tools, that every day we learn they are just a bit smarter than we thought. This is a horror story through and through about the changes going on in this world because of how we live our lives, because of how homo sapiens have ALWAYS lived their lives even before we started burning fossil fuels and putting pesticide on everything. I want to go on a tour and shake the hand of everyone working desperately to create safety arks for animals that we are abandoning by our own callousness. I want to visit these refuges and revel in them, and then leave, hopefully, with no trace of ever having been there.And now, I’ll just let the book speak for itself. The only thing I could have asked for it is that for it to be longer. “One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is that the world is changing in ways that compel species to move, and another is that it’s changing in ways that create barriers—roads, clear-cuts, cities—that prevent them from doing so.”“By burning through coal and oil deposits, humans are putting carbon back into the air that has been sequestered for tens—in most cases hundreds—of millions of years. In the process, we are running geologic history not only in reverse but at warp speed.” The anthropologist Richard Leakey has warned that “Homo sapiens might not only be the agent of the sixth extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.” A sign in the Hall of Biodiversity offers a quote from the Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich: IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” “coral cover in the Caribbean has in recent decades declined by close to eighty percent.”“Asian elephants have declined by fifty percent over the last three generations.” “some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere.” “WHY is ocean acidification so dangerous? The question is tough to answer only because the list of reasons is so long. Depending on how tightly organisms are able to regulate their internal chemistry, acidification may affect such basic processes as metabolism, enzyme activity, and protein function. Because it will” "

In South America they're all succumbing to an introduced disease. One of the problems with the global world we live in is mobility - we bring species that would normally never had a chance of contact together. Diseases can spread world-wide in a manner that was unthinkable just a few hundred years ago. It's not just the frogs. In North America, the bat population has dropped to next to nothing due to a fungi from Europe, with which European bats live quite happily, but which kill their American counterparts by the millions.""In times of extreme stress, the whole concept of fitness, at least in a Darwinian sense, loses its meaning: how could a creature be adapter, either well or ill, for conditions it has never before encountered in its entire evolutionary history?"" Then theres's the human induced global warming caused by billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere and into the oceans. There is also the impact of habitat loss due to human population explosion. Habitat loss, introduction of alien species and diseases, pouching, changing of living conditions to climate change - all of this means that we are living in a time when the extinction rate far surpasses the background rate. ""Right now, in the amazing mment that to us counts as the present, we are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will forever be closed.""Quite possibly, we are sawing off the branch we sit on. It's likely that our ""weedy species"" will be its own undoing. Life is resilient, but within limits. Life would also surely bound back eventually, long after the last descendant of bipedal, hairless apes have vanished.This is a highly informative, well-written and captivating book. It explains the earlier big exctinctions and why there is one caused by us, happening now. It is a complex topic and this journalist does a job of presenting the facts in an understandable manner. I happened to read in a newspaper while reading this book, that just in England, 421 species have been lost in 200 years. This isn't propaganda - this is really happening. Highly recommended."

Unfortunately, I struggled with finishing it and walked away from it several times before I finally finished. Despite my statements, I want to make it clear that my failure to enjoy this book had nothing to do with the quality of the writing. It was clear that Ms. Kolbert spent a great deal of time researching.. traveling to various habitats for a first hand observation of the species which have already disappeared and the ones who are on the brink. She obtained an enormous amount of information from various scientists and even provided photographs. I simply found that the book could not hold my attention. Perhaps if I had more of a knowledge base in animal biology, botany and environmental science, I could have enjoyed this book more than I did. Or perhaps if I had just put it aside to come back to it at a later time, I would have gotten more out of it… regardless, the book just did not hold my interest. That said, I would not discourage anyone else from reading the book. The failure to enjoy was mine. "

The book covers a lot of ground, from Georges Cuvier, Darwin, to modern day ecology and conservations, from arctic to tropical rain forests, from national parks to zoos. I've learned lot of about extinctions in the earth history and the current ongoing extinction—the sixth extinction that is solely humans' doing. Perhaps the reason that we, homo sapiens, have become the dominate species of the world, is the same reason that will cause our own eventual extinction."

It’s particularly hard to read a book such as this knowing things will likely only get worse with the donkey that is our President leading one of the world’s most powerful nations. We’re talking billions of lives. And millions of species. Including us.

It’s a riveting topic, the history of our world and our species, and Elizabeth Kolbert has the knack of writing about science so it retains all its natural fascination while still being accessible to laypeople. She takes the reader with her back in time and around the world as she accompanies researchers in places ranging from the Andes mountains to the Great Barrier Reef. One particular fact has really stuck with me--as human activity increasingly homogenizes the global environment by transporting plants and animals all over the planet biodiversity is increasing on the small scale, so that where you live is likely to have more species than it did formerly, but because invasive flora and fauna can wipe out native plants and animals global biodiversity is rapidly shrinking as the total number of species on the Earth continues to dwindle. And that’s the point of the title, The Sixth Extinction. There have been five periods of mass extinction on our planet and some scientists are finding evidence indicating that we may be on the cusp of or even in the midst of a sixth wave of mass die offs, this one caused by the activities of humans, a chilling realization."
263,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'The Sixth Extinction' is written like a magazine article for a general reader, yet it tells intelligently an engaging true science story about several various geological locations important to the history of the scientific discoveries about evolution and extinction. The author personally visits and describes sites around the world - islands, forests, oceans, caves, museums - some of which take a lot of effort and discomfort to reach. These particular locations have a huge importance because each site is where an 'eureka!' moment occurred for a scientist who was often there for a different reason, but then he discovered something else instead; something which ended in clearing up everything confusing or wrong about our understanding of how the earth's climate changed in the past and is changing now. The discovery that the macro-climate can change on earth, and has apparently changed five times previously, and that these macro-climate changes also appear to be linked to changes in local animals and plants as well. It took time before everyone accepted the evidence presented that the earth and its environment has changed dramatically several times, and even longer for scientists to agree what the evidence signified. Early scientists had to not only accept the evidence of their own eyes and discoveries, they had to overcome biblical teachings which had told them the earth cannot change because it must be as perfect as the god who created it 6,000 years previously. These early struggles with the Church in interpreting physical clues are what led to the 'scientific method' of proving beyond doubt the conclusions reached from actually studying physical discoveries and not relying on religious beliefs from ancient scriptures. (One of the Church's precepts was everything on earth was unchanging and perfect. The fact that animals could die off as a species and disappear permanently from the face of the earth, or even worse, evolve, was not a possibility if the Church or the bible was correct. In time, the preponderance of the physical evidence overwhelmed the bible's myths. The author hints at the scientific disarray in accepting the facts of living creatures changing and disappearing because of the rigid philosophical belief in an unchanging world, but she does not dive into the religious elements which delayed the conclusions from scientific discoveries.)I found the book easy to read and understand. The facts and history of the concepts of evolution and climate change are conversationally and logically introduced. It deepened my understanding of how the scientists know climate changed billions of years ago and is changing now, and how they know the current change is already affecting life dramatically. Instead of jargon, you'll be able to speak it in plain English.The three issues the author gently exposes, after unobtrusively teaching us history, is how Humanity is involved, perhaps primarily responsible, in the current sixth ongoing climate change because: one, of our restless traveling around the world transporting, mostly unwisely, other life forms; as well as two, the CO2 we are pumping into the air from our gasoline-fueled cars and coal burning for electrical energy, which is changing (killing) the seas, trees/forests and wildlife the world over; and our extermination of animals in hunting for food, fun and profit (animals affect the type and quantity/quality of plants in their environment through their activities and nutritional needs, and by the symbiotic or otherwise interested neighbor animals who want to live close to their prey food). Your grandkids may not grow up with the trees, insects or local neighborhood wild animals and birds you did, or have cheap water to drink or cheap electricity to run their devices. The air certainly will be different.After finishing this book, you might want to look at a fiction novel, The Road. Warning: it's an extremely terrifying look at living in a world utterly wrecked environmentally, and it had me in tears.The following opinions are all me, and not in this science book. I think we will be the first species in earth's history that had the power to destroy AND save the earth, as well as ourselves, but we couldn't focus. Instead, we chose to party on: 1. hunt and kill off the last mega fauna like rhinoceroses and sharks to eat their horns/fins for that important personal 15-minute sexual erection; 2. cut down the annoying mega-flora for more houses and cheap furniture and better views; 3. put personal mega-billions of capital to work as investments in dozens of mansions/property around the world (plus living in one or three mansions isn't enough of an exercise of personal power, which is why the addition of environmentally controlled garages to house the yachts, the hundreds of 'antique' cars that will never be driven, to possess shoes, dresses and purses purchased for thousands of dollars each, etc. - conspicuous consumption being a tried-and-true method of relieving the boredom of wealth); 4. become socially powerful enough to manipulate/buy political votes to benefit/protect individual sources of capital; 5. use valuable resources to make war murder mayhem because of displaced aggression and blood lust; 6. make more babies because a priest/minister/Imam says god hates contraception (more mouths to feed, house and poop);7. For every facility which finally reduces their air/water/soil pollutants after decades of extended court fights, nine other facilities continue to pollute excessively around the world.8. and pray fruitlessly in religious rituals for a god to tell us our marching orders (which will never occur). We REALLY should be more environmentally responsible for our own self and the others who depend on us, but honestly? I don't think it's gonna happen. Anyone else notice, for example, how the local waters are too polluted for your kids to fish and swim in today, but you remember happily doing both safely? Anyone else notice how more flooding occurs in your neighborhood today? Anyone else notice how the local birds, bees and animal life have disappeared around your house? Anyone else notice the mountains of trash everywhere? Or the fouled beaches because the sewage treatment facility, overwhelmed again, had a spill? For the record, I believe we are doomed as a viable species. We don't seem to be able to overcome our DNA inheritance or be able to reprogram our animal brain desires for immediate emotional rush satisfactions. Our lusts for sex, social/tribal affiliation, personal power and self-aggrandizement, chocolate, drama, speed, explosions and killing things overwhelm our strengths in planning ahead, memory, intelligence, education, math and spatial skills, creativity, building tools, feelings that a single sacrifice for the many is worthy, love, affection, empathy, sharing the abundance and living in moderation. Our archaeological record, when it is dug up and discovered by the next species to rise to intelligence and tool-building a million years from now, after Homo sapiens has disappeared, will be condensed down to 'we coulda and we shoulda, but we didna'."

It's quite a topic - what we are doing to the world, and what we have done and what we are likely going to do. This mostly wasn't new information to me - but the acidification of the oceans was new. I mean I see the headlines and I know it's a issue, but I didn't understand the nature of it, or make the connection to shells and reefs.What I like about the book is, first of all, that it's getting read. The more people who read this the better. It's good information. Even well informed people don't generally grasp the scope and extent of what we are doing to our planet. She mixes in the dire future predictions, and the uncertainties of these, with lots of interesting historical details on science coming to terms with extinction, and other related topics. She covers in some detail three of the five major extinction events (why only three?) The problem with ocean acidification, in brief, is how it affects animals that secrete shells or any hard carbonate-mineral parts, especially in the common form of aragonite. This stuff dissolves in acid. The extra CO2 in the air leads to more of it getting absorbed into the ocean, and this makes the oceans more acidic. The acidity makes these hard parts more soluble, as in closer to actually dissolving, and therefore they become harder to make and animals make less of them. So, as the acidity increases, our corals start making less exoskeleton and eventually will just stop, meaning our coral reefs will die. We have made the oceans 40% more acidic then they were before the industrial revolution. My one complaint is that the book seems to target our emotions more than I'm comfortable with. It's really a borderline issue - unless you listen on audio. The reader, Anne Twomey, insanely over-dramatizes the book, weakening it the severely. It sounds like a bad psuedo-science show on a coming UFO invasion. (I did listen to sample before I purchased. There was a very passionate and professional reader. Only after I purchased did I learn that the sample was Kolbert herself, reading the prologue. Wish she had read the whole book.)We have all read plenty of everyone-should-read-this-book comments on important nonfiction books, and that does add a bit of discouragement into the encouragement. I hope the later overpowers the former. Everyone should be reading books like this."

Apart from the stereotypical acts of human depravity, there is also the passive damage inflicted on the natural world by our very existence. In Elizabeth Kolbert's outstanding The Sixth Extinction, the author writes in exceptionally readable and compelling language on a subject that is essential reading for members of our species.  Eschewing one particular approach to the depiction of extinction, Kolbert alternates the subjects of her chapters between multiple disciplines. History, geology, biology, ecology, and many other disciplines all make for a varied and hard-hitting treatise on the demise of the world's organisms. What's more, Kolbert breaks up her exposition with her experiences at the various places around earth on which she writes. These sections ground what can be very esoteric subject matter as the effects of these theories are seen through Kolbert's eyes. In a similar vein, Kolbert's aim with the book is not to accuse and depress, rather she seeks to educate the populace on the changes occurring on Earth. I have read many reviews that called this book depressing and guilt-inducing, however it was my feeling that the book maintains an upbeat, yet objective, tone throughout.  I am more likely to be found reading fiction than nonfiction; stories and characters have always interested me more than fact and figures. Perhaps it is that my professional days are filled with fact that I seek escape on my personal time. Despite this predilection for fiction, I am occasionally taken in by a nonfiction book and revel in the fashion the author arrives at their conclusion. The Sixth Extinction not only has the benefit of being one such book, it also has the prestige of being a book of great importance. If you're overwhelmed and unaffected by the media's liberal use of global warming, climate change, ocean acidification, and extinction events then this is exactly the book you should be reading. Its appeal is visceral as well as intellectual, and should be read by as many humans as possible. After all, we just happen to be the book's primary villains."

This non-fiction science book briefly covers the major and minor extinction cycles that have occured over the life of the planet, as well as current theories as to what caused them. The book is divided into 13 chapters, and each chapter deals with a specific current extinction, or near extinction, event. I loved the dots that this book connected for me. I loved that this current extinction cycle (clearly caused by Sapiens) is discussed in the context of the very long history of the planet. I loved learning about things I had no idea about, annual coral reef sex orgies comes to mind, and was saddened to learn about some of the species that have gone the way of the Dodo in my lifetime. I loved the science and learning about some scientists I knew nothing about. There is so much covered here, but all in a very accessible, easy to read manner. I am surprised that I was left with a feeling of hope at the end of this book. Not because I think that Humans will halt or reverse the processes we have put into play, but rather because after we become extinct, life will continue to find a way. Context is everything. I highly recommend this one."

So yeah, it felt like a timely choice!Fortunately for me, Adam, with his scientist mind, is more reserved in his judgment and optimistic in his outlook than I am.

There's something very magical about it, as if the planet is getting a good spring cleaning and all its inhabitants an urgently needed recalibrating of priorities. I love how people who do important jobs are suddenly getting all the love instead of narcissistic moronic reality TV celebrities and the like who had the limelight before. And the absence of cars, especially at night, is wonderful. The shot of the Himalayas visible from New Delhi for the first time in decades was especially poignant. And, on the whole, people are more friendly. There's a lot more generosity towards the poor. And so many health workers over here in the UK are of ethnic minority backgrounds that racism more than ever has been highlighted as the outlandish unforgivable expression of brute stupidity it is. The virus has made a nonsense of militant nationalism too. Takes a pandemic for most to understand that every border is in essence illusory; that we're all in this together. And how pettily absurd Brexit now seems. I hope this new generation will take on board this rejigging of social and ethical priorities and as a result be much more committed to looking after the planet.   Anyway, Elizabeth Kolbert in this book visits a series of research centres all over the globe, all with their own specialised subject, all charting and trying to prevent the sudden alarming demise of various species of mammal, bird, reptile and insect. She intersperses these individual and local sagas with an overview of how extinctions have occurred in the planet's history. Meticulously and convincingly she helps us to understand how quickly and carelessly we're heading towards the next big extinction, the first caused by humans. I liked this more than The Uninhabitable Earth because it's completely cleansed of the hellfire indignation which for me marred David Wallace-Wells' book."

You won’t be after you read this.Warming today is taking place at least ten times faster than it did at the end of the last glaciation, and at the end of all those glaciations that preceded it. To keep up, organisms will have to migrate, or otherwise adapt, at least ten times more quickly. Though it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in harmony with nature, it’s not clear that he ever really did.Harboring some hubris about your place in the world? Here’s a tonic:a hundred million years from now, all that we consider to be the great works of man—the sculptures and the libraries, the monuments and the museums, the cities and the factories—will be compressed into a layer of sediment not much thicker than a cigarette paper.What else can I say about this book? The picture Kolbert paints of our situation is every bit as depressing as you might expect. I already knew the facts about climate change and animal extinction, but according to Kolbert the prognosis is even worse than I was aware, given that ocean acidification – “global warming’s ‘equally evil twin’” – is one contributor I hadn’t ever considered. Likewise, though I’d heard about the crisis with the world’s amphibians, I was entirely ignorant of the bat cataclysm (white-nose syndrome).As a longtime New Yorker journalist, Kolbert writes at a good level for laymen: not talking down, but not assuming any specialist knowledge either. I was somewhat unconvinced by her thematic, species-by-species approach here; it makes each chapter more like an individual essay than a part of a larger argument. Winging her way around the world (what carbon footprint?!), she considers auks and ammonites, mastodons and endangered zoo animals in captive breeding programs, dying coral reefs, and pockets of Amazonian rainforest. By the end, you’ll be in no doubt that we are in the middle of a major extinction event, and that our era will be known as the “Anthropocene” – the age of the influence of man.Luckily, there are spots of humor to lighten the tone, such as “The reason this book is being written by a hairy biped, rather than a scaly one, has more to do with dinosaurian misfortune than with any particular mammalian virtue.”As Caspar Henderson writes in his Guardian review, “The extinction crisis is so vast and complex that it almost repels thought. We need a lot more imaginative thinking about the choices we can make and what comes next.” Now that this has won a Pulitzer, one hopes it will get people talking and doing some of that imaginative thinking. Unfortunately, it’s so much easier to bury heads in the sand and keep going as we have been. Time will tell whether we heed the lessons of this book."

To the extent that we can identify the causes of these revolutions, they're highly varied: glaciation in the case of the ordovician extinction, global warming and chances in chemistry at the end of the Permian, an asteroid impact in the final seconds of the Cretaceous. The current extinction has its own novel cause: not an asteroid or a massive volcanic eruption but ""one weedy species. As Walter Alvarez put it to me, ""We're seeing right now that a mass extinction can be cause by human beings."" (265-266) ""With the capacity to represent the world in signs and symbols comes the capacity to change it, which as it happens, is also the capacity to destroy it. A ting set of genetic variations divides us from the Neanderthals, but that has made all the difference. (258)It isn't unique to note that humanity has dangerously altered the planet in a way that no other species before it has done as conclusively demonstrated by Elizabeth Kolbert in The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History. What makes this book not only important but a must-read is the case by case basis which she follows through with each chapter of extinct or near-to-extinct case studies of populations of animals, from the American Mastodon to the frogs of central Panama to the Sumatran Rhino. Because of the subject matter and the grand question of purpose among our own species, the ones before us, and the ones that will come after we're gone, this book is something that stays with the reader afterwards, pondering the grand invention of creation, evolution, and eventual disarray. The book provides a great overview of the subject matter that newcomers will find informative and enjoyable, and despite the information presented, does offer glimpses of hope and even humour. What is so fascinating about the subject matter is the concept of how life has survived and altered itself time after time on our bountiful rock, and how little we as a species really understand the world we have seemingly (or rather forcibly) inherited. It was only roughly 300 years ago that palaeontology began to take it's first steps as a major science with the discovery of mastodon bones in North America, and that whole different worlds existed before ours. It was only in 1831 that Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle and made his way around the world, specifically to the Galapagos, giving us terms in his ""On the Origins of Species"" that now represent mainstream science. Neanderthals only were discovered shorted after Darwin's voyage, and it was only in 2004 that a hobbit like humanoid species was discovered on the island of Flores in Indonesia. How freaking amazing and unbelievable is that?It was interested to see Kolbert's travels around the globe, diving into the globalisation aspects of humanity that give us terms like ""New Pangaea,"" how bat populations in the Northeastern part of the US have dropped off significantly do to factors that bats elsewhere in the world are immune to, the investigation into rainforest populations in South America, and the incredible efforts scientists are doing to protect endangered species, like giving rhinos ultrasounds and crows handjobs. It's a tale of our grim actions, but the hopeful aspects of our understanding of the world that can add it. The choice is up to us as a species."

When authors put the story of scientific disciplines like physics, or chemistry or even biology into words and stories, they are translating something hard and complex and precise into a soft, fuzzy medium.It's analogous to knitting a replica of Michelangelo's David. Even if you are a genius knitter, the end result will only be (at best) a flabby simulacrum of the authentic object.If you experienced the knitted David (let's call him Dave) you would have a general, vague sense of what the real David was like. But you would be a long way away from really understanding the awe inspiring experience of the real deal.Let's take the analogy one step further. Imagine you're an alien, and you discovered the knitted Dave. But you had never seen the real David sculpture, or (more importantly) an actual human specimen. How much would you really understand about people, based on you're observations of the knitted Dave. You would have a very general sense. Enough to pick a hominid out of a crowd of donkeys. But that's about it. Better than nothing, but far from expertise. I love evolutionary biology and ecology and sociology. But I'm not trained in any of these disciplines. My understanding of them is via popularizations like this. Even within my discipline of clinical psychology, I'm barely educated. But outside of my discipline, I am essentially an enthusiastic dilettante. That's not a dis. That's just another way of saying, I haven't spent 4 years of undergraduate training to prepare for another 4 years of doctoral training to prepare for another 3-5 years of post doctoral training to prepare for another 10-20 years of professional research in any of those fields.Humans specialize. None of us could possibly be specialists in more than one or maybe two of these domains. There just isn't enough time in a human life span.I have a laypersons education of ecology and biology. That's nothing to scoff at. It took (literally) hundreds of hours of hard work, reading a bunch of books, taking classes, talking to experts etc. to gain my laypersons understanding of evolutionary biology. But honestly, I wouldn't know an actual darwinian algorithm from a hole in the ground, let alone be able to accurately interpret the findings of the mathematical models experts develop and use to understand complex systems like species population dynamics and ecosystems.So I have to rely on experts and science journalists to tell me the story in English. I need these dedicated, talented individuals to ""knit me a Dave"". That's exactly what Elizabeth Kolbert did. She knitted us a Dave. The Sixth Extinction is a soft, cuddly, children's storybook version of the hard, awful reality the actual experts in the field of biology and ecology are bearing witness to.If she had delivered us a harder version. It would have been (a) unintelligible to us mere mortals, and (b) so unspeakably awful, that most of us would have never, ever willingly subjected ourselves to this horrible, terrifying (much more than inconvenient) truth. Even the ""soft"" Dave version is pretty fucking tragic and demoralizing. If I were to give you a quick sketch analogy of what the knitted Dave of mass extinction looks like. Imagine a plush toy bat (flying mammal), stuffed with dead, decomposing frogs, with an invasive fungus choking his nostrils, literally starving to death, drooling acrid barren sea water and sputtering a creepy recorded (five nights at Freddie's) robot voice looping the phrase, ""we're all going to die a horrible, slow death, we're all going to suffocate in a giant cesspool of our own feces, and it's way too late to do anything about it"".Not exactly Tickle Me Elmo, but still, a very soft version of the reality.One can only imagine the horror that experts feel when they see entire species evaporate, or when they crunch the numbers and the results look like an ASCII skull and bones. You can imagine these nerdy bookworm types, realizing the awful reality and trying desperately to communicate the immense gravity of the situation to the stoners, jocks and rednecks who used to beat and torture them in high school, only to receive responses like ""The Bible says we can despoil the earth however we see fit"" or ""it's only a theory"" or ""not all scientists agree"" or ""it was cold for a few days this summer, so that proves global warming is a scam"".Even the most charismatic of the nerds, Think Neil Degrassi Tyson, Carl Sagan or Al Gore still only managed to capture the hearts and minds of ""egg head PBS types"", even when they limit their messages to what can be communicated via entertaining, schticky soundbites, Hollywood style computer animated visualizations and 30 minute PowerPoint slideshows.The Sixth Extinction goes at explaining the issue of the ecological disaster we currently find ourselves in by giving a brief history of the previous five mass extinction events that science has identified. Apparently global species population and diversity levels expand and contract regularly, but have dropped to next to nothing for various reasons thorough out the history of life on earth. The previous 5 mass extinction events are:1: the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event (occurring about 66 Ma) in which about 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. 2: the Triassic–Jurassic extinction (occurring about 201.3 Ma) in which about 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species went extinct.3: the Permian-Triassic transition. (occurring about 252 Ma). Earth's largest extinction killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects).4: the Devonian Period (occurring 375–360 Ma), a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and 70% of all species.5: the Ordovician–Silurian extinction (occurring 450–440 Ma) killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.At one point, around 70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens almost went extinct. About 90% of us died. We got down to an estimated 40 breeding pairs. That's really close to extinction. But we showed em our bounce back stuff and boy look at us now!Now we're officially in the Holocene period (and have been for more than 10,000 years), but many scientists are pushing the point that we have officially exited the Holocene and entered an altogether new epoch that they are calling the Anthropocene. They argue that humans are having such a pronounced impact on the enviornment that we should be the titular species of this particular cene (hence the Anthro at the beginning of the word).They also argue that there is a new mass extinction event currently under way that may be the worst one yet. They are calling it the.... You guessed it....6: the Anthropocene extinction.That's awesome right? It's exciting to be a part of history. Even if it's potentially the end of it.Bad Boundaries:One of the salient points in the book is that global climate instability is not the only source of extinction. Another big problem happens when an ecosystems square footage is reduced or its boundaries are violated. Obviously deforestation is a huge problem. By making the rain forests land coverage smaller, it shrinks the biodiversity exponentially (there's that math stuff again). Apparently there's a formula for it that calculates the extinction rates as you down scale an environment. It's like the E=Mc2 of the apocalypse.But globalization is also a huge problem in that it introduces invasive species like rats into sensitive environments. Apparently rats have been hitching rides on boats for as long as people of been sailing.Invasive species can literally crash an ecology. In the book, Kolbert discusses a species of gray snake that was introduced to an island echo system that basically ate everything. It reduced to a tropical island full of pretty birds, lizards and bugs to pretty much just only snakes.Kolbert makes the gorgeous point that it's easy to vilify the little grey snake. But the snake isn't mean or immoral, it's amoral, meaning it's It's simply doing what it's hardwired to do. It's just trying to survive and reproduce. The Ultimate Invasive Species:In case you're wondering where this is going, the ultimate invasive species is us. Humans go just about everywhere And everywhere that humans go, almost everything else dies. It's not that were mean or immoral, were actually amoral in the same way the grey snake is. We're simply doing we're all hardwired to do. Survive and reproduce (with obvious exceptions, but not enough to make a critical difference).We like to hold ourselves to moral standards, and vilify some bad guys e.g. Dick Cheney (I'm not saying he's not, but just hear me out).The fact of the matter is, the Anthropocene extinction isn't happening because we're immoral. It's happening because we're amoral.It may seem like I'm splitting hairs but the distinction is important.Perhaps viewing ourselves as moral, and holding ourselves and others to standards of morality is part of the problem. Perhaps framing this ecological crisis as a moral issue is creating a fatal blind spot. Perhaps experimental psychology can be of assistance in explaining my point.Don't Diss Me:Cognitive dissonance is the very reliably observed psychological phenomena, whereby people (including you me and everybody we know) confabulate anxiety reducing fictions when confronted with our own amoral behavior.So in other words, when people realize that their behavior is incongruent with their values, they feel bad, but rather than change the behavior, they make up a story (no matter how absurd) that relieves them of the pain of their own hypocrisy. For example, consider a situation in which someone who places a value on being environmentally responsible just purchased a cool new chick magnet car that he later discovers is a gas guzzler.The conflict:It is important for the man to be (at least viewed as) a good steward of the environment. But he is now driving a babe getting machine that also happens to double as an earth warmer.As you can imagine, he's feeling rather conflicted about now. Drive a Prius and die a childless and alone, or drive the Maserati and repopulate Brentwood. In order to reduce the dissonance between his values and his behavior, he can (a) utilize public transportation more frequently (which is probably not going to happen, maybe in Seattle, not in L.A.), or he could (b) sell the car and purchase another one that gets better gas mileage (which, again, not hugely probable), or he could (c) convince himself that maybe all the global warming stuff is a little overblown, and one little Maserati aint gona kill nobody (which is a whole lot easier than option (a) or (b), and therefore pretty fucking likely).I know what you're thinking, ""other people do that, but I don't do that"". But you do, we all do, we just don't realize it. That's why they call it a blind spot.It sounds far fetched but cognitive dissonance has been observed in tightly controlled experiments again and again. Everyone does it. Even (no particularly) if you're a trained mental health professional,So maybe if we stop viewing the ecology issue moralistically, and start viewing it more pragmatically, than perhaps we can all stop pointing fingers and except the fact that we're all totally fucked and were going to die and there's noting we can do about it.No no. Of course there's something we can do about it. But we really need to accept that it's happening. Accept that were all complicit (even if you recycle), and then....I actually don't know what. But something I hope. Additionally, all of us regular people need to trust the experts. We may get a cold day in August and think we're all good. But that's not how this shit works. You have to do math and stuff. And odds are great that you don't. So trust the people that do and just do what they tell you. Even if you love Jesus. Which you probably don't if you're still reading this.Lastly, it occurred to me that I'm not going to face the worst of this, and my kid won't either, but her kids (should she ignore reason and reproduce) will. I'll just be honest here. Part of me has a hard time worrying past next week. And that same part of me kind of thinks, what ever, I'll be dead by then, and I know I'm not alone in this particular brand of denial. Cognitive dissonance ladies and gentlemen, don't let it win."

The first half is solid, inasmuch as it has some information about the history, and historiography, of extinction. The second half gets a little head-banging-against-a-wall, with example after example of currently endangered or recently extinct species, all told in the same palatable way. So, beware reader, that if you are like me, you might want to skip this book. It goes to great lengths to be entertaining, but entertaining in a very New Yorker kind of way. We learn more, I would guess, about the appearance and dress of the scientists Kolbert meets than we do about the extinctions she describes. We hear a lot about how people feel. We get a lot of novelistic realism about animal's rumps. And I just don't care. So frustrated was I by Kolbert's presentation of genuinely disturbing events that I started to think what a counter-argument might look like. Here are a couple: i) Kolbert pushes the 'anthropocene' (i.e., the 'geological' epoch determined by the existence of humanity and our destruction of other species) into the *very* distant past, roughly, when the indigenous peoples of Australia first killed off the continent's mega-fauna. But it is utterly ridiculous to liken prehistoric, and 20th and 21st century, human impact on the environment. Not to put too fine a point on it, back then we were just another species, though a successful one. Today, we run the planet. Eliding that difference makes it impossible to recognize what has caused the vast majority of extinctions over the last two centuries, viz., uncontrolled economic development. That's an argument I believe. The next one I'm not so sure about, but I do think there's a case to be answered: ii) Extinction is a natural occurrence. Granted that it's greatly accelerated over the last couple of centuries, but really, why worry so much? What moral obligation do we have towards *species*, as opposed to *living individuals*? If you have to kill a hundred foxes to reintroduce a threatened species into their previously natural environment, is that really a moral thing to do? What about the foxes' lives, after all? And so on. This book doesn't deal with such problems, but then, it wasn't meant to. It is entertaining propaganda, and good on Kolbert for bringing the issues up in the first place. "

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us.In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human. (watch here"

""To argue that the current extinction event could be averted if people just cared more or were willing to make sacrifices is not wrong, exactly; still, it misses the point. It doesn't much matter when lather people care or don't care. What matters is that people change the world.""Does it mean that any conservation effort is for naught? Have we crossed a threshold that we cannot uncross? Not sure. Very likely you won't be either after reading it.Lots to chew on here - not all that pleasant either. This book had me googling left and right to find more information and learn more. This is one I will be thinking about for a long time to come."

I have not been this disappointed in a book in a long while. More than a quarter of the length of the book was dedicated to notes. She touched on history as archeology has helped define it with reference to the past extinctions. I think, because she was being a writer, she needed to tell me things I didn't care to know, like what she and her research mates had for breakfast before they set out to discover whether or not a particular bug was or was not extinct.So here's the big spoiler alert.....she said humans were well on the way to an extinction and we were bringing it on ourselves. The sixth extinction is us. The one high point of the book for me was that she did not....to my memory....suggest that we could change things before it's too late. It seems to me she's saying it is already too late. There are just too many of us shitting in our own nest.....Michael"

280,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,4,"Elizabeth Kolbert knows how to put things together. She managed to create a very thoroughly documented book and to raise awareness about the extinction of species.The five extinctions known in the history of Earth decimated the species up to 96% (a brief summary can be read here: https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontol...)The sixth extinction here in question is named so because of the rate at which species are disappearing now:
“Calculating the background extinction rate is a laborious task that entails combing through whole databases’ worth of fossils. For what’s probably the best-studied group, which is mammals, it’s been reckoned to be roughly .25 per million species-years. This means that, since there are about fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around today, at the background extinction rate you’d expect—once again, very roughly—one species to disappear every seven hundred years.A rigorous calculation of the background extinction rate for amphibians has not been performed, in part because amphibian fossils are so rare. Almost certainly, though, the rate is lower than it is for mammals. Probably, one amphibian species should go extinct every thousand years or so.Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world’s most endangered class of animals; it’s been calculated that the group’s extinction rate could be as much as forty-five thousand times higher than the background rate. But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.”
And we, humans, are to blame here. The book has plenty of examples in which we exterminated a lot of species: the one concerning the great auk is so heart-breaking depicted. I do hope this book to be read by as many people as possible and maybe something in our collective mentality will change. We are just one species among so many other and just because we are more intelligent than the others (debatable from my point of view) does not make us owners of this planet and its life forms.
”In an extinction event of our own making, what happens to us? One possibility—the possibility implied by the Hall of Biodiversity—is that we, too, will eventually be undone by our “transformation of the ecological landscape.” The logic behind this way of thinking runs as follows: having freed ourselves from the constraints of evolution, humans nevertheless remain dependent on the earth’s biological and geochemical systems. By disrupting these systems—cutting down tropical rainforests, altering the composition of the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans—we’re putting our own survival in danger.”
It is not an easy book but it is definitely worth reading."
281,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches. - Stanford ecologist Paul EhrlichAs far as science has been able to determine, there have been five mass extinctions of life on Earth in the history of our planet. The first of these occurred at the end of the Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era about 450 million years ago. The second occurred less than 100 million years later in the late Devonian period. There followed the End-Permian extinction of some 250 million years ago, the Late Triassic extinction of 200 million years ago, and finally, the last one and the one we are most familiar with, the End-Cretaceous extinction which occurred about 65 million years ago. That's the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. (Well, almost - except for the ancestors of birds.)The best evidence seems to indicate that all of these extinctions except for the last one were the result of climatological events, often relatively sudden events to which plants and animals did not have time to adapt. The cause of the fifth one was also a change in climate but it was brought about by a collision with an asteroid. That cataclysmic event so altered the climate of the planet for a time that many, many species died out either suddenly or over a period of years.Scientists believe that we are now in the midst of the sixth extinction which Earth has endured and that this extinction is entirely human-caused. Elizabeth Kolbert writes in this book about how our species has altered life on the planet as no other species has before. It's not just that we are changing the climate for the worse, although that certainly is a big part of it, but we also have altered the face of Earth and the chemistry of the oceans to the detriment of very many species.One of the biggest problems that we have created for other species is simply the fact that we move everything around and wherever we go on Earth, it seems that some species hitch a ride with us. So a species from Asia that would never under normal circumstances make it to the Americas is brought here either wittingly or unwittingly and it wreaks havoc. Kolbert points out that the most endangered family of animals on Earth today are the amphibians. They are being wiped out by a fungus that has been spread around the world by humans. Kolbert writes about a dozen species, some of them already irrevocably lost and others on their way out. Through these very personal stories of that wonderful bird the Great Auk, the Panamanian golden frog, staghorn coral, the Sumatran rhino and others, the reader is moved to begin to understand the enormity of what is happening. What we are causing to happen to our world. It is somewhat surprising to learn that the concept of extinction is not a very old one. Kolbert points out that it was first articulated by Georges Cuvier in the revolutionary Paris of the 18th century. As always it seems, with any new scientific idea or concept, it took a while for it to be accepted, but later work by paleontologists has confirmed Cuvier's findings.This is a well-written book which can popularize scientific concepts and principles for a mass audience. It is an easy read and a fairly short one at less than 300 pages. Kolbert includes extensive notes and bibliography for those who wish to read more on the subject."
282,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17061542-zoe-s-human,4,"I learned many new things and I laughed a few times as well. That's pretty much a win for non-fiction. Humanity's impact on the environment tends to either be presented in a deliberately polarizing manner for political reasons or presented with assumptions of scientific knowledge which most lack. The author did an amazing job of explaining the science behind the impact in layman's terms without omitting details that frequently don't make ""news"" stories on the topic. She even took the time to explain how mistakes and theory discrepancies happen in science. Even better, she did all of this calmly by presenting facts and logic without resorting to emotional manipulation.I loved the inclusion of small personal notes about the assorted scientists featured. While such asides don't contribute to the main premise of the book, they do make it much more engaging. Between that and her wonderful descriptive style, I found myself able to visualize her experiences and environments with a fullness usually only found in fiction.There are two things which would have greatly enhanced my pleasure in this book. An insert of color photos of the assorted plants and animals discussed would be awesome. I did Google quite a bit while reading this and it would have been preferable to have photos right in the book.Additionally, a chart/timeline depicting the assorted eras and epochs mentioned in chronological order with dates and maybe a few sample organisms listed for each section would have been great. Perhaps with the mass extinctions and suggested range for the anthropocene marked as well? As clear as her explanations were, some information processes better in images than text.Things I think should be changed before the final release:The graph on page 16 is hella blurry.On page 46 at the end of chapter 2, she first mentions that the megafauna extinction is becoming understood as being the result of the spread of modern humans. No specifics are gone into on this until page 230. This left me wary that she was going to start making assertions without any kind of backup in the beginning of the book and I felt a bit weirded out all the way through the book by that hanging thread even when it became clear that she was validating her beliefs with facts. As a reader, it would have been better for that statement to have been omitted in chapter 2 if it wasn't going to be developed for almost 200 pages. At the very least, it should be noted that it will be expanded upon later in the book.Page 86, line 19, the paragraph that starts with ""The bolide arrived from the southeast..."" I'm assuming that ""doe to its trajectory"" (later in that paragraph) should read due ""to its trajectory.""The last sentence on 113 going over to page 114 reads ""Change the atmosphere's composition atmosphere..."" Is that right? It seems like the second atmosphere is superfluous or at least awkward.I would omit the bit about the gift shop cashier not showing Ms. Kolbert around from page 226. It comes across petty and unflattering to the author. Even if there were no other customers, it's a given in *any* clerking job that you don't leave the shop unattended. You can get fired for that.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway. Many thanks to all involved in providing me with this opportunity."

In the pages that follow, I try to convey both sides: the excitement of what's being learned as well as the horror of it."" (3)Mission accomplished. I learned something, and I felt something.Kolbert writes scientific journalism with the best of them and here she distills a lot of contemporary findings into easily conveyed factoids for the layperson. She tells a dynamic story but with very little pearl-clutching. She's largely neutral in her presentation, though she doesn't shy away from the (well-supported and widely accepted) thesis that it's human activity that's effected the climate change resulting in subsequent extinctions and a vast reduction to Earth's biodiversity. Maybe it's too late for us to halt the sweeping global change humankind has generated, but like it or not it's inexcusable to not pay attention and not learn about it. And those skeptical or uninterested in hearing anyone try to cram environmentalism down their throat with a lot of moralizing needn't fear. There are many chapters that focus on other, nonhuman catastrophes and extinction events, how they were discovered and how they shaped modern scientific thought and theory.And stylistically, her prose is entertaining and never dull. Just one example:When I visited Reserve 1202, I ran into a graduate student from Portugal who was surveying bats. At noon he had just recently woken up and was eating pasta in a shed that served as a research station-cum-kitchen. While we were talking, a very skinny cowboy rode up on an only slightly less skinny horse. He had a rifle slung over one shoulder. I wasn't sure whether he'd come because he'd heard the truck I'd arrived on and wanted to protect the student from possible intruders, or because he sensed that there was pasta. (174)5 stars out of 5. Informative and entertaining. A big win for popular science fans."

Exploring the other five extinctions in the past and comparing them to the current destruction of the biosphere is sobering. It is unclear whether the sixth will surpass the other five (each extinction had its own pathology) or if we will survive the catastrophe we created but it is not pleasant to read about. This is one of those books that reminds the reader that it is worse than you think by far. I am not sure how to read the forensics of armageddon being shielded from nature by modern life, one will put this book down and pick up another at least until the resources run out. What books like this usually elicit are deer in the headlights paralysis or ostrich-like behavior or a shrug of the shoulders. Kind of strange the way we respond selectively to threats.

The only thing I could have asked for it is that for it to be longer. “One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is that the world is changing in ways that compel species to move, and another is that it’s changing in ways that create barriers—roads, clear-cuts, cities—that prevent them from doing so.”“By burning through coal and oil deposits, humans are putting carbon back into the air that has been sequestered for tens—in most cases hundreds—of millions of years. In the process, we are running geologic history not only in reverse but at warp speed.” The anthropologist Richard Leakey has warned that “Homo sapiens might not only be the agent of the sixth extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.” A sign in the Hall of Biodiversity offers a quote from the Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich: IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” “coral cover in the Caribbean has in recent decades declined by close to eighty percent.”“Asian elephants have declined by fifty percent over the last three generations.” “some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere.” “WHY is ocean acidification so dangerous?

Interesting book to give you some facts on the previous mass extinctions on Earth, as well as information about the one we are currently in and of which we (more than) seem to be responsible."

In South America they're all succumbing to an introduced disease. One of the problems with the global world we live in is mobility - we bring species that would normally never had a chance of contact together. Diseases can spread world-wide in a manner that was unthinkable just a few hundred years ago. It's not just the frogs. In North America, the bat population has dropped to next to nothing due to a fungi from Europe, with which European bats live quite happily, but which kill their American counterparts by the millions.""In times of extreme stress, the whole concept of fitness, at least in a Darwinian sense, loses its meaning: how could a creature be adapter, either well or ill, for conditions it has never before encountered in its entire evolutionary history?"" Then theres's the human induced global warming caused by billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere and into the oceans. There is also the impact of habitat loss due to human population explosion. Habitat loss, introduction of alien species and diseases, pouching, changing of living conditions to climate change - all of this means that we are living in a time when the extinction rate far surpasses the background rate. ""Right now, in the amazing mment that to us counts as the present, we are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will forever be closed.""Quite possibly, we are sawing off the branch we sit on. It's likely that our ""weedy species"" will be its own undoing. Life is resilient, but within limits. Life would also surely bound back eventually, long after the last descendant of bipedal, hairless apes have vanished.This is a highly informative, well-written and captivating book. It explains the earlier big exctinctions and why there is one caused by us, happening now. It is a complex topic and this journalist does a job of presenting the facts in an understandable manner. I happened to read in a newspaper while reading this book, that just in England, 421 species have been lost in 200 years. This isn't propaganda - this is really happening. Highly recommended."
289,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene,3," This book was recommended on many lists last year and I had such high hopes when I started reading it. Unfortunately, I struggled with finishing it and walked away from it several times before I finally finished. Despite my statements, I want to make it clear that my failure to enjoy this book had nothing to do with the quality of the writing. It was clear that Ms. Kolbert spent a great deal of time researching.. traveling to various habitats for a first hand observation of the species which have already disappeared and the ones who are on the brink. She obtained an enormous amount of information from various scientists and even provided photographs. I simply found that the book could not hold my attention. Perhaps if I had more of a knowledge base in animal biology, botany and environmental science, I could have enjoyed this book more than I did. Or perhaps if I had just put it aside to come back to it at a later time, I would have gotten more out of it… regardless, the book just did not hold my interest. That said, I would not discourage anyone else from reading the book. The failure to enjoy was mine. "
290,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"A depressing but important book. Very important. The book covers a lot of ground, from Georges Cuvier, Darwin, to modern day ecology and conservations, from arctic to tropical rain forests, from national parks to zoos. I've learned lot of about extinctions in the earth history and the current ongoing extinction—the sixth extinction that is solely humans' doing. Perhaps the reason that we, homo sapiens, have become the dominate species of the world, is the same reason that will cause our own eventual extinction."
291,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-shakespeareandspice,4,I read this all in one go because I knew multiple pauses would likely just extend the misery. It’s particularly hard to read a book such as this knowing things will likely only get worse with the donkey that is our President leading one of the world’s most powerful nations. We’re talking billions of lives. And millions of species. Including us.
292,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"It sounds strange to say I enjoyed reading this book about the increasingly profound and potentially devastating impact humans are having on our home planet, with an especial focus on the animals and plants who share Earth with us, but enjoy it I did. It’s a riveting topic, the history of our world and our species, and Elizabeth Kolbert has the knack of writing about science so it retains all its natural fascination while still being accessible to laypeople. She takes the reader with her back in time and around the world as she accompanies researchers in places ranging from the Andes mountains to the Great Barrier Reef. One particular fact has really stuck with me--as human activity increasingly homogenizes the global environment by transporting plants and animals all over the planet biodiversity is increasing on the small scale, so that where you live is likely to have more species than it did formerly, but because invasive flora and fauna can wipe out native plants and animals global biodiversity is rapidly shrinking as the total number of species on the Earth continues to dwindle. And that’s the point of the title, The Sixth Extinction. There have been five periods of mass extinction on our planet and some scientists are finding evidence indicating that we may be on the cusp of or even in the midst of a sixth wave of mass die offs, this one caused by the activities of humans, a chilling realization."
293,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'The Sixth Extinction' is written like a magazine article for a general reader, yet it tells intelligently an engaging true science story about several various geological locations important to the history of the scientific discoveries about evolution and extinction. The author personally visits and describes sites around the world - islands, forests, oceans, caves, museums - some of which take a lot of effort and discomfort to reach. These particular locations have a huge importance because each site is where an 'eureka!' moment occurred for a scientist who was often there for a different reason, but then he discovered something else instead; something which ended in clearing up everything confusing or wrong about our understanding of how the earth's climate changed in the past and is changing now. The discovery that the macro-climate can change on earth, and has apparently changed five times previously, and that these macro-climate changes also appear to be linked to changes in local animals and plants as well. It took time before everyone accepted the evidence presented that the earth and its environment has changed dramatically several times, and even longer for scientists to agree what the evidence signified. Early scientists had to not only accept the evidence of their own eyes and discoveries, they had to overcome biblical teachings which had told them the earth cannot change because it must be as perfect as the god who created it 6,000 years previously. These early struggles with the Church in interpreting physical clues are what led to the 'scientific method' of proving beyond doubt the conclusions reached from actually studying physical discoveries and not relying on religious beliefs from ancient scriptures. (One of the Church's precepts was everything on earth was unchanging and perfect. The fact that animals could die off as a species and disappear permanently from the face of the earth, or even worse, evolve, was not a possibility if the Church or the bible was correct. In time, the preponderance of the physical evidence overwhelmed the bible's myths. The author hints at the scientific disarray in accepting the facts of living creatures changing and disappearing because of the rigid philosophical belief in an unchanging world, but she does not dive into the religious elements which delayed the conclusions from scientific discoveries.)I found the book easy to read and understand. The facts and history of the concepts of evolution and climate change are conversationally and logically introduced. It deepened my understanding of how the scientists know climate changed billions of years ago and is changing now, and how they know the current change is already affecting life dramatically. Instead of jargon, you'll be able to speak it in plain English.The three issues the author gently exposes, after unobtrusively teaching us history, is how Humanity is involved, perhaps primarily responsible, in the current sixth ongoing climate change because: one, of our restless traveling around the world transporting, mostly unwisely, other life forms; as well as two, the CO2 we are pumping into the air from our gasoline-fueled cars and coal burning for electrical energy, which is changing (killing) the seas, trees/forests and wildlife the world over; and our extermination of animals in hunting for food, fun and profit (animals affect the type and quantity/quality of plants in their environment through their activities and nutritional needs, and by the symbiotic or otherwise interested neighbor animals who want to live close to their prey food). Your grandkids may not grow up with the trees, insects or local neighborhood wild animals and birds you did, or have cheap water to drink or cheap electricity to run their devices. The air certainly will be different.After finishing this book, you might want to look at a fiction novel, The Road. Warning: it's an extremely terrifying look at living in a world utterly wrecked environmentally, and it had me in tears.The following opinions are all me, and not in this science book. I think we will be the first species in earth's history that had the power to destroy AND save the earth, as well as ourselves, but we couldn't focus. Instead, we chose to party on: 1. hunt and kill off the last mega fauna like rhinoceroses and sharks to eat their horns/fins for that important personal 15-minute sexual erection; 2. cut down the annoying mega-flora for more houses and cheap furniture and better views; 3. put personal mega-billions of capital to work as investments in dozens of mansions/property around the world (plus living in one or three mansions isn't enough of an exercise of personal power, which is why the addition of environmentally controlled garages to house the yachts, the hundreds of 'antique' cars that will never be driven, to possess shoes, dresses and purses purchased for thousands of dollars each, etc. - conspicuous consumption being a tried-and-true method of relieving the boredom of wealth); 4. become socially powerful enough to manipulate/buy political votes to benefit/protect individual sources of capital; 5. use valuable resources to make war murder mayhem because of displaced aggression and blood lust; 6. make more babies because a priest/minister/Imam says god hates contraception (more mouths to feed, house and poop);7. For every facility which finally reduces their air/water/soil pollutants after decades of extended court fights, nine other facilities continue to pollute excessively around the world.8. and pray fruitlessly in religious rituals for a god to tell us our marching orders (which will never occur). We REALLY should be more environmentally responsible for our own self and the others who depend on us, but honestly? I don't think it's gonna happen. Anyone else notice, for example, how the local waters are too polluted for your kids to fish and swim in today, but you remember happily doing both safely? Anyone else notice how more flooding occurs in your neighborhood today? Anyone else notice how the local birds, bees and animal life have disappeared around your house? Anyone else notice the mountains of trash everywhere? Or the fouled beaches because the sewage treatment facility, overwhelmed again, had a spill? For the record, I believe we are doomed as a viable species. We don't seem to be able to overcome our DNA inheritance or be able to reprogram our animal brain desires for immediate emotional rush satisfactions. Our lusts for sex, social/tribal affiliation, personal power and self-aggrandizement, chocolate, drama, speed, explosions and killing things overwhelm our strengths in planning ahead, memory, intelligence, education, math and spatial skills, creativity, building tools, feelings that a single sacrifice for the many is worthy, love, affection, empathy, sharing the abundance and living in moderation. Our archaeological record, when it is dug up and discovered by the next species to rise to intelligence and tool-building a million years from now, after Homo sapiens has disappeared, will be condensed down to 'we coulda and we shoulda, but we didna'."

It's quite a topic - what we are doing to the world, and what we have done and what we are likely going to do. This mostly wasn't new information to me - but the acidification of the oceans was new. I mean I see the headlines and I know it's a issue, but I didn't understand the nature of it, or make the connection to shells and reefs.What I like about the book is, first of all, that it's getting read. The more people who read this the better. It's good information. Even well informed people don't generally grasp the scope and extent of what we are doing to our planet. She mixes in the dire future predictions, and the uncertainties of these, with lots of interesting historical details on science coming to terms with extinction, and other related topics. She covers in some detail three of the five major extinction events (why only three?) The problem with ocean acidification, in brief, is how it affects animals that secrete shells or any hard carbonate-mineral parts, especially in the common form of aragonite. This stuff dissolves in acid. The extra CO2 in the air leads to more of it getting absorbed into the ocean, and this makes the oceans more acidic. The acidity makes these hard parts more soluble, as in closer to actually dissolving, and therefore they become harder to make and animals make less of them. So, as the acidity increases, our corals start making less exoskeleton and eventually will just stop, meaning our coral reefs will die. We have made the oceans 40% more acidic then they were before the industrial revolution. My one complaint is that the book seems to target our emotions more than I'm comfortable with. It's really a borderline issue - unless you listen on audio. The reader, Anne Twomey, insanely over-dramatizes the book, weakening it the severely. It sounds like a bad psuedo-science show on a coming UFO invasion. (I did listen to sample before I purchased. There was a very passionate and professional reader. Only after I purchased did I learn that the sample was Kolbert herself, reading the prologue. Wish she had read the whole book.)We have all read plenty of everyone-should-read-this-book comments on important nonfiction books, and that does add a bit of discouragement into the encouragement. I hope the later overpowers the former. Everyone should be reading books like this."

Apart from the stereotypical acts of human depravity, there is also the passive damage inflicted on the natural world by our very existence. In Elizabeth Kolbert's outstanding The Sixth Extinction, the author writes in exceptionally readable and compelling language on a subject that is essential reading for members of our species.  Eschewing one particular approach to the depiction of extinction, Kolbert alternates the subjects of her chapters between multiple disciplines. History, geology, biology, ecology, and many other disciplines all make for a varied and hard-hitting treatise on the demise of the world's organisms. What's more, Kolbert breaks up her exposition with her experiences at the various places around earth on which she writes. These sections ground what can be very esoteric subject matter as the effects of these theories are seen through Kolbert's eyes. In a similar vein, Kolbert's aim with the book is not to accuse and depress, rather she seeks to educate the populace on the changes occurring on Earth. I have read many reviews that called this book depressing and guilt-inducing, however it was my feeling that the book maintains an upbeat, yet objective, tone throughout.  I am more likely to be found reading fiction than nonfiction; stories and characters have always interested me more than fact and figures. Perhaps it is that my professional days are filled with fact that I seek escape on my personal time. Despite this predilection for fiction, I am occasionally taken in by a nonfiction book and revel in the fashion the author arrives at their conclusion. The Sixth Extinction not only has the benefit of being one such book, it also has the prestige of being a book of great importance. If you're overwhelmed and unaffected by the media's liberal use of global warming, climate change, ocean acidification, and extinction events then this is exactly the book you should be reading. Its appeal is visceral as well as intellectual, and should be read by as many humans as possible. After all, we just happen to be the book's primary villains."
296,0805092994,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,5,"This Pulitzer Prize winner for General Nonfiction (2015) was my book club selection this month, and I listened to the audiobook, which is really well narrated by Anne Twomey.Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari was my absolute favorite book last year, so I was primed to read this one. This non-fiction science book briefly covers the major and minor extinction cycles that have occured over the life of the planet, as well as current theories as to what caused them. The book is divided into 13 chapters, and each chapter deals with a specific current extinction, or near extinction, event. I loved the dots that this book connected for me. I loved that this current extinction cycle (clearly caused by Sapiens) is discussed in the context of the very long history of the planet. I loved learning about things I had no idea about, annual coral reef sex orgies comes to mind, and was saddened to learn about some of the species that have gone the way of the Dodo in my lifetime. I loved the science and learning about some scientists I knew nothing about. There is so much covered here, but all in a very accessible, easy to read manner. I am surprised that I was left with a feeling of hope at the end of this book. Not because I think that Humans will halt or reverse the processes we have put into play, but rather because after we become extinct, life will continue to find a way. Context is everything. I highly recommend this one."

Because despite what some people would have you believe, climate change is real, scientists can be trusted, and humans have had a significant impact on the earth pretty much since our appearance on it. So yeah, it felt like a timely choice!Fortunately for me, Adam, with his scientist mind, is more reserved in his judgment and optimistic in his outlook than I am. With the help of our (local!) beer of choice for this episode, he managed to talk me off the ledge. For now, anyway.Click here to watch!"
