0,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1838273-burk,0,"I've read a lot of physics books, always trying to get a better handle on these bizarre concepts. Each new book I read seems to take me closer to that ""Okay, now I get it!"" moment that I wish would come. According to the best scientists working in that field, though, there's really no way for our primate brains to accept some of the genuinely strange ideas. How can particles be in multiple places at once? How can they apparently move through time in different ways than we do? How can the laws of nature be different for these particles, and yet we, who are made of these particles, apparently function ""normally"" every day? What role does our consciousness play in all of this?""The Quantum Enigma"" is one of the best books I've read about these topics. It's great at leading the reader through some of those difficult ideas, and eventually allowing you to at least get a few steps closer to understanding. It addresses the deeply weird ideas inherent in the study of the nature of reality, but not in the way that some popular media has in the past like the film/book ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" which cops out by saying it's all magical and supernatural, and that the universe loves you and cares about you. I certainly don't get that impression about nature, and answering these big, intriguing questions with a simple, ""It was made by a magical being who loves us!"" doesn't work if you really care about knowing what's going on. ""The Quantum Enigma"" acknowledges that it's likely beyond our current ability to understand the true origins of everything in a way that works nicely with how we understand things in our daily lives, but it gave me a few good ways of looking at these things without leaving me feeling completely lost in them."
1,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113430-jon-erik,2,"If you liked this book, did you like it because the subject matter was fascinating, or because the book was well written? I doubt it was the latter.Ever see a cartoon where after a few scenes, you realize that the animation is just the same frames spliced over and over? This book is about 5 minutes worth of footage to make an hour cartoon. You can read the last two or three chapters and get the whole thing, and I can sum it up nicely here: physicists have trouble with the observer problem and get upset that they have to address something they don't (yet) have experiments for.The authors display the same arrogance typical of physicists who ignore most of 2,500 years of philosophical history and act like the questions raised by quantum theory are Something New Under The Sun. They are not. Nor are they newly intellectually serious questions. Indeed, the angst of physicists who use derisive terms like ""speculative"" poses the question: are you an engineer or a calculator, or are you a scientist? A scientist seeks to answer questions about the universe. Sometimes those questions go beyond where you thought they might. Ask Newton. Ask Einstein.The topic is fascinating, of course. But until enough philosophers get good at math and enough physicists learn how to read libraries of prose this field will be the preserve of the few people who have done both, like Stuart Kauffman. Physicists presenting a book that might be appropriate for general ed students sitting in a class they heard will, like, blow their mind, on drugs at places like UC Santa Cruz without adding anything from psychologists, biologists, philosophers, or mathematicians leaves this book way, way too thin. I can't even believe they include, as a legitimate idea, scientific reductionism. Chemistry can be explained by physics, but biology can't be. They should know that. They use the term ""emergent"" once or twice, but don't explain it, and don't explain why this is important for the quantum brain.Let me add this: if you like this book, don't you think it might have been a lot better if they had collaborated with someone in another field on this?"
2,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333893-shane,4,"I ordered this book after finishing the previous one I posted (From Science to God) because I wanted a more thorough explanation of the Quantum ""Mystery."" It seems that movies like ""What the Bleep do We Know"" have taken some of the more bizarre observations about quantum physics and allowed their imaginations to run wild with their claims, giving the less discerning public a less-than-accurate idea about what's really going on here. This book, written by two widely-respected Physicists, presents the facts of quantum physics in a ""Truth, Whole Truth, and Nothing But the Truth"" manner. They attempt to separate the facts from the myths, while addressing the ""Skeleton in the Closet"" of science...Human Consciousness. It's a heady read, and I'll have to go over it several more times to completely wrap my head around the material. If this topic interests you at all (and you are already familiar with the subject), this book is a MUST read. If it's all new to you, I recommend starting with something MUCH simpler (like the books I mentioned at the top) "
3,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27907870-marcha-fox,5,"Since I have a bachelor's degree in physics, I'm reasonably familiar with quantum theory and the mystery it presents with regard to the influence of an observer. I've even written a few blogs on the subject you can find here: https://marcha2014.wordpress.com/cate.... I keep reading about quantum theory hoping for a deeper understanding but all I seem to discover is that no one really knows what's going on, even several decades after its first discovery. However, this well-written book did explain numerous other things that helped my understanding of the various interpretations and the differences between them.This book does an excellent job of explaining the different interpretations, e.g. the Copenhagen interpretation, Schrodinger's cat, Einstein's view, Niels Bohr's opinion and various others, in a way that anyone interested in the subject can understand. What stands out the most is that even today the experts don't agree. In other words, they simply do not know. I continue to marvel that physicists can propose the existence of parallel universes, multiverses, and thirteen or more dimensions while dismissing and even disparaging anything that relates to consciousness. Give me a break. Without consciousness they couldn't even consider the meaning of the physical world.Thanks to reading this book I understand more thoroughly that physicists fear to tread outside their domain of the material world and to touch on anything that borders on parapsychology because it can result in professional suicide. How sad that science has become so specialized and compartmentalized that professional tunnel vision precludes solving some of life's greatest mysteries while those who think outside the box are ostracized by their peers and even looked upon as ignorant fools. Which side best fits that description only time will tell."
4,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89242656-diana,4,"Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness [2011] – ★★★★ “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” (Matthew 7: 7- 8, The King James Version of the Bible). “The universe begins to look more like a great thought than a great machine” (Sir James Jeans).Did you know that it has been experimentally proven in physics that the way you decide to look at something (your observation) changes that something or dictates/creates its locality/position? This happens on the atomic level and no one disputes that finding in the scientific community because this has been proved through the so-called “double-slit” experiment. However, virtually no one in the scientific community wants to consider what this finding means beyond its practical application. Quantum Enigma is a book that explores the divide that has emerged in science between Einstein’s theory of relativity, governing big objects in the universe and, the quantum theory that governs objects on the atomic level. The book provides a good historical overview of the knowledge so far on quantum mechanics, delving into the famous “double-slit” experiment and the Schrödinger’s Cat Paradox. In this sense, it is a great book for those completely unacquainted with the topic because it explains concepts in a very clear and unhurried way. The downside of this, of course, is that the book is needlessly repetitive and provides very few, if any, fresh ideas beyond the already established knowledge. I initially assumed that Quantum Enigma would start straight with the workings of quantum mechanics, explaining its basic concepts (with the reference to the laws governing big objects), but the book starts with Ptolemy of Alexandria, and talks at length about the discoveries made by Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton, underlining numerous times that quantum mechanics call into question the “separability” principle (a notion that every object is separate/different from any other) established previously in science and provides proof of universal “connectedness” (each object in the universe is connected and influenced by any other). The book then goes to explain electromagnetic forces and Albert Einstein’s theories of relativity, before jumping into the science of quantum mechanics, talking about the early discoveries of Max Planck, Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrödinger (the debate whether light is a wave or a particle). After that, there are detailed explanations of the various phenomena of quantum mechanics, including the (somewhat dull) Copenhagen interpretation that says that “only the observed properties of microscopic objects exist” [2011: 130], and the talk about how the workings of quantum mechanics can be seen in real life and in technology. Then, the Schrödinger’s Cat Experiment is explained in full and the so-called law of entanglement is put forward (objects can influence each other without any direct physical force existing between them, provided these objects made their initial contact at some point).The last parts of the book are all about more mystical explanations of the quantum mechanics’ enigma, such as the explanation put forward by John Stewart Bell, and the implications of this for the concept of consciousness. The quantum enigma resides in the fact that “the observed cannot (seem to) be separated from the observer”, that “the physical reality of an object depends on how you choose to look at it” [2011: 72], and that a single atom may be found in two places at once. These are very difficult concepts to grasp for an ordinary human being, but the double-slit experiment proved that they are scientifically correct statements.In brief, the double-slit experiment tells that if you direct one light electron into two opening slits in the wall that are positioned in parallel to each other, and start observing that electron of light, it would behave as a single particle, entering either of the two respective slits, and hitting the wall behind the slits, showing just one mark on the wall. However, if you direct that one particle into two opening slits without observing it at any point, it would behave as though it is a wave – passing somehow through two slits at the same time, creating an interference pattern on the wall behind the two slits. So, are electrons of light waves or single particles? The scientific answer is that they are what you want them to be. Your decision to show them as either participles or waves determines whether they would behave as such. If you choose to use two slits and decide to observe how a single electron can create an interference pattern by passing through two slits at the same time, the electron would immediate act as though it is single particle as though it is aware you are watching it. It is as though it does not want you to see how it passes through two slits at the same time. The conclusion is that the external reality at the atomic level is all about you and your observation. You create the reality for that electron and its place. That is what experimental physics currently says. “The reality of the physical world depends somehow on our observation of it” [2011: 54] and “quantum theory… denies the existence of a physically real world independent of its observation” [2011: 7].Thus, the last chapters of Quantum Enigma talk about how this phenomenon may be explained, and such explanations are given as the parallel universes or the Many Worlds Theory and the idea that our free will may not be “free” at all, but predetermined in advance (otherwise, how would electrons have known in advance what experiment we would choose to do?). It seems that the external reality is created at the atomic level based on our previous beliefs and perceptions – based on our observation. We still do not know much about consciousness and how it arises in the brain, and some scientists believe that there are parallels between the quantum enigma and the mystery of consciousness. This parallel may have something to do with our perception, free will and observation.The negative aspect of the book is that there are not many theories in the book that speculate about the quantum enigma, trying to provide a sound explanation of it, and there are none coming from the authors themselves. The book reads like a history of quantum mechanics for beginners and there is much needless background information. Rosenblum and Kuttner also make a weird choice of repeating the quantum mechanics’ enigma in an imaginary school setting with one teacher explaining the theory again in the book in a rather strange and allegorical way.Quantum Enigma will be a good book for those who have very little knowledge on the subject and who are curious about the mysteries of quantum mechanisms. The book is thought-provoking as it suggests that our scientific knowledge is incomplete and there is still much we do not know about the universe, its workings, as well as about our own perception of reality. In this respect, the book gives much food for thought, and many scientists nowadays are also trying to explain the quantum mechanism’s enigma by seeking answers elsewhere – beyond the realms of physics and science. Another interesting thought is that science seems to be finally catching up with what ancient wisdom (such as Buddhism) has been telling us all along and, perhaps, we are simply limited by our brain functions and this stops us from understanding fully the universe’s working and the nature of reality (including the concept that an object can be in two places at once and its very creation and position may come from within ourselves)."
5,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/305384-dan,4,"I found this book to be real food for thought. Rosenblum points out that Quantum probability tells us not the probability of the state of a system but rather where an observer will measure it to be. The system wasn't in that state until it was observed to be there. Quantum cosmologist John Wheeler puts it concisely: ""No microscopic property is a property until it is an observed property."" Quantum mechanics thus requires a conscious observer to produce physical properties.He next deals with the very strange concept of separability. Physicists have now demonstrated conclusively that once quantum states interact with each other they remain forever linked in such a way that the state of one such state is immediately influenced by a change in state of the other system even when separated from it by long distances, thus apparently violating our belief that information cannot be transmitted faster than the speed of light. As a consequence any quantum states that have ever interacted are no longer separable and the universe is highly linked with many other parts of the universe. Physicists do not really understand this instantaneous action-at-a-distance, but it is predicted by Quantum Mechanics and has been verified experimentally.He then turns to modern thinking about consciousness. Is consciousness more than the product of chemical reactions in the body? He states that the two great mysteries are the mystery of the existence of the world ""out there"" and the mystery of consciousness ""in here"". He claims that quantum mechanics appears to connect the two.He then takes this mystery to the beginning of time, at the Big Bang. If a microscopic property requires a conscious observer to produce physical properties, what created the first matter? One explanation could be a consciousness outside of the universe--God. Another is that spacetime is closed back on itself and the ""future"" consciousness of people yet to be created were the consciousnesses that caused the original first matter to exist through the mechanism of separability.I find it fascinating that from a scientific viewpoint Rosenblum reaches the conclusion that some consciousness was necessary to create the universe."
6,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10155744-thelbert-dewain-belgard,5,"I've read this book several times -- first edition and second. It's not really hard to understand at all. The authors have a clear and to-the-point writing style--unusually entertaining for a non-fiction idea-oriented book of this sort. It is hard to accept. What it says is so disturbing to the prevailing world-view that I'm sure many people just shut it out by saying, ""Oh this is too hard to understand."" That means they've probably understood it. Other readers may say, ""This is all old-hat. Nothing new here -- it's boring."" That's probably someone who doesn't understand what the book is saying. The quantum experiments are about as simple in principle as it's possible to be -- although some of them may require some awfully hi-tech equipment to conduct. So you don't need much if any math to understand this book. It's more about the implications of the experiments. What kind of world is this? Is it real? What does ""real"" mean? Do things have any separate existence? How can things that have no known physical connection still be connected -- even at vast distances -- in some weird mysterious way? How can things exist in different -- and even opposing -- states depending on how they are observed? How can the fact of being observed affect the values of the properties being measured?I won't promise that you will find the answers to all these questions in this book. But I think you may learn more about what the questions are and how to ask them -- perhaps better than I have. Knowing how to ask a question is, I believe, a large part of finding the answer."
7,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17817291-tim,5,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this book nearly as much as I did when I started reading it. The clearest history and exposition of quantum physics I have ever read. Additionally, it doesn't shy away from examining the various speculations about what it might mean. An interesting, level headed, and thought-provoking read. "
8,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1670648-lori,5,"The best nonfiction book I’ve read in awhile. This book is a fascinating and an easy-to-visualize introduction to concepts that fuel current scientific debate around the implications of quantum theory and its reliance on a conscious observer. Written by two UC Santa Cruz physics professors, short chapters include humorous analogies and non-technical descriptions of Newtonian physics, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. The quantum enigma emerges from experimental evidence that shows what scientists observe at the quantum level depends on what they “decide” to evaluate. Contrary to the tenets of the scientific method, when it comes to the world of subatomic matter, there is no such thing as an “objective” observer. In fact, consciousness might actually create a particular reality by collapsing the wave function of potential outcomes into one physical reality...that is, if reality even exists at all. The authors never officially take sides with competing interpretations of the quantum enigma, but their work will undoubtedly fuel much discussion about the role of consciousness in scientific observation."
9,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105666-raven,5,"This book, perhaps more than any of the others that I have read, brings the concepts of Quantum Mechanics out of the strict academic in into a more reader friendly world. I would go so far as to label it a 'primer' on the subject.Perhaps its most significant contribution is how well it illustrates that place where Consciousness and Quantum Physics meet. A place that established Psychiatrists and Physicists all over the world fear to go.I highly recommend this book."
10,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/329222-shani,2,Generally a good and easy read but some concepts are over-explained and some (I guess the more complicated ones) are not explained well or left unexplained. Only in the end do they get to concsiousness and their points are not as good as I expected.
11,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,2,"This book deals with quantum enigma and consciousness, the fact that at microscopic (quantum) scales weird things happen that our conscious mind cannot comprehend.The authors take their time to explain the quantum enigma (and I must admit they do this well), the fact that observation creates reality, and the reality (or experimental outcome) depends on the observation, contrary to our intuition originated from classical Physics that observation alone cannot affect reality.It is the final chapters when I started to feel uneasy about this book. I found subtle but nevertheless annoying sense of supernatural or weirdness being over emphasised to the extent of being mystical, and Physics being sidetracked.To set the record straight, I don't find consciousness mystical, philosophical or weird, to me it is as biological as my bones or blood. The fact that we cannot comprehend quantum enigma today does not necessarily mean that we are supposed to comprehend it despite our biological limitations, unless we find new ways of mapping physical reality into our limited view."
12,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762020-dr-barrett-dylan-brown-phd,2,"I was taught by these two authors of this book at UCSC and got to have several conversations with them regarding how Quantum Mechanics effects our current theories of Parapsychology. Dr. Fred Kittener is an absolutely stubborn old clod and fool, but Dr. Bruce Rosenblum is a gem of a human with an open mind and good nature about him. Dr. Rosenblum is also cited briefly in ""Unbelievable: The Duke Parapsychology Lab"""
13,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/201615-vish-ramabhatta,0,I am still reading this book.... my hope is that this book bridges the gap between physics (observable world) and spiritual underpinnings as expounded by Advaita Vedanta (Hindu philosophy) for the totally scientifically inclined. 
14,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015304-frank-jude,5,"This is one of the most clear-headed, accessible, and straight-forward accounts of Quantum Mechanics and the 'measurement problem' I've read. Based upon their course at Santa Cruz for liberal arts students, they manage to convey the implications of Quantum Mechanics with nary an equation. Good job!"
15,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2386521-mike,4,"Very informative. excellent introduction to quantum physics. At times I was falling asleep, but it keeps it entertaining enough.

16,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27874550-roberta-grimes,5,"Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner are adventurous academic physicists, and they here give us a handy summary of their understanding of the consciousness issue in quantum physics. This book is plainly written and highly accessible for non-physicists, and it is flat-out fun to read."
17,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28792997-eitakbackwards,5,"This is one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. (I'd like to note that is in significant part due to the TOPIC and not simply the book.) Also likely because (not coming from a physics or maths background), I knew almost no specifics about quantum going into it beyond the vague idea most people have when mentioned: the idea of something being in 2 places at once.However, I'd have to praise the way it was written too. The authors take a complex topic and present it to the lay person, in my opinon, very effectively through analogies, dialogues, occasional sketches and thought-experiments. It is repetitive so, when introducing an idea the necessary background for you to understand what follows is restated. I suppose, for those who are already acquainted with quantum, this could be annoying but I appreciated it given that it was read in multiple sittings. It took a long time (relative to length) to work through and gain a thorough understanding but was worth it. It is very systematic. To start, it lays down the foundations that resulted in the development of quantum theory and later it's most accepted interpretation before contrasting this with other interpretations. It then presents the enigma (s): namely 'the measurement problem', that quantum theory seems unable to ignore i.e. the requirement of an observer. It begins to introduce the idea of a conscious observer and the speculative implications for theories of consciousness. It clearly signposts these speculations and evidence for and against such hypotheses. Helpfully, there is also a 'Suggested Reading' list at the end.The majority of the book talks about what quantum theory actually is and what the problems with it are. The implications and more outlandish possible explainations of these problems feature only for a short time at the end. This was actually better for me as I just wanted a sound appreciation of the fundamentals to start. I have sat and just thought very often during the course of reading this book- and what a delight it has been. Would love to discuss specifics (lots of q's!) and have got a couple of related books lined up to explore the topic further. 4.8 - more detail on other interpretations would have been useful but granted might have made it longer an introductory text than necessary."
18,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,5,"Similar in scope of coverage to another layman text within the field of quantum physics, from the perspective of the ""foundations"", Anton Zeilinger's ""Dance of the Photons"", 3/4ths of this book is exposition broadly on two things:  1. Interference phenomena  2. Bell's InequalityThe difference between the two texts is the pedagogical approach. Whereas Zeilinger's book explained both of these phenomena within the context of the ""fable"" or story of two fictitious underclassmen physics students, ""Alice"" and ""Bob"", running the interference experiment for the first time, and struggling to interpret what they're observing, Rosenblum and Kuttner go the more direct route. Though, they too leverage one really well-crafted, well-placed, ""fable""/story at the beginning of the book that likens the mystery of entanglement with a story of an anthropologist, tribe, their shaman, and that claims at recreating a ""scientific miracle"" (you'll have to read this for yourself!). Beside this bit of creative storytelling in the beginning, the rest of of the text follows a more literally conceptual exposition on the subject matter. Despite the lack of any mathematics, the treatment retains all the logic one would find in a textbook, perhaps a bit more drawn out. Having started my own amateur journey of self-learning in this subject-matter, I can attest directly that books like this definitely benefit students studying this formally with the linear algebra/diff-eq retained as well.Coming back briefly to the story of the tribe and huts, I just have to emphasize it's really well-done, and definitely recreates the surprise (and joy) of looking at something seemingly mundane, but then coming to an understanding suddenly that something extraordinary is happening, and I think it's very important a formal student of this subject matter should be forced to an experience. I can imagine that someone approaching this subject purely from the mathematical angle, may end up gaining the mechanical skills of reading bra-ket notation, solving the hamiltonian, or correctly analyzing various wave-in-box scenarios, but they miss a lot if they miss the interpretation, and are constantly scrambling to pass exams or labs. Although, I really think Zeilinger's book is first-rate as exposition for both these phenomena, Rosenblum and Kuttner beat him out slightly in terms as a tight-and-compact conceptual exposition. From the start with the anthropologist realizing the tribesmen are somehow ""reading his mind"" in the story, to later in the book when the author explains the motivation/concept behind Bell's experiment to disprove the hidden-variables theory, by illustrating the mental-model that spin and other properties are ""real"", illustrating it as a ""stick"" protruding from the particle in one's mind, and reasoning about how this ""real"" property will interact with polarization to distribute the particles along one path or another in an experiment, then showing how this hypothesis totally fails to explain reality when the predicted counts and actual counts breaks Bell's inequality (based on some simple logic about how those sticks will be impacted by equal magnitude but opposite rotations of the apparatus). Although the author doesn't state it explicitly, he likens the Bell experiments to a kind of reductio-ad absurdem, whereby the physicist is attempting to show how all the alternative cases all fail, leaving only the canonical interpretation from QM left. Brilliant.Hands-down the best explanation of Bell's phenomena and the debate on physical realism, because of how clean it was and how easily understandable it is to the common reader. Despite these accolades, the book does suffer from one major flaw, it is supposedly a text on consciousness and it's potential part with respect to the measurement problem in QM, yet this topic occupies less than a quarter of the text. Sort of a bummer, but because the rest of the text is so good, this can be overlooked. Recommended"
19,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4628720-jeffery,3,"I got this book with the hopes of obtaining tools to help me understand -- and to help me help others to understand -- some of the concepts and popular [mis-]conceptions of quantum mechanics. It's become almost de rigueur among New Age spiritualists to pilfer bits of quantum theory for use in fortressing and promoting their ideas and books and DVDs and seminars ad nauseum. (see ""What the Bleep do We Know?"" and ""The Secret"" and huge sections of book stores). Ideas such as ""our consciousness creates reality"", matter can exist in multiple locations at the same time, and matter and energy are the same thing, are enticing concepts to the woo-woo crowd, but it must be remembered: quantum effects take place at sub-atomic levels, where time and space and dimensions are only vaguely related to our level of reality. The same can be said of the theory of Relativity. Yes, space bends in the presence of mass, and yes, the speed of light cannot be exceeded, and yes, time slows down as one accelerates. But these are all phenomenon that can only be experienced on astronomical scales. Likewise, quantum effects occur on the nuclear scale.I actually didn't find what I was looking for in Quantum Enigma. In fact, it's just another book that takes a stab at explaining a topic that is -- while undeniably the most tested and proven theory of science -- very complicated and very difficult to understand. Very. And its concepts are often bizarre, counter-intuitive and down-right out of reach for the great majority of us. Including all those spewers of non-science non-sense."
20,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60444495-alma,1,"This book is full of misinterpretation. The authors clearly have a romanticized view of physics and certainly don't understand it. The good marks come from people who either really really want to believe that physics is weird or people who don't know what's it about. To give an example: the authors want to present entanglement as a quantum weirdness and arrange a mental experiment where they put people in huts with closed doors. Through the way they present the experiment, they suggest that the results of quantum measurements are a conspiracy in which the universe or the particles *know* what the measurement will ask. That's an absolutely stupid interpretation and has no connection to reality. Moreover, setting up a quantum experiment with people changes the premise so much that it can't be called quantum mechanics. This book isn't science. Actually if you look at some of the previous reviews, you'll see that the authors are interested in parapsychology. Whomever wants a good presentation of modern physics should try Richard Feynman, Leonard Susskind, or Brian Greene. Even Feynman likes to have a romanticized view on quantum mechanics but at least he presents the main ideas in the correct way."
21,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971847-george,3,"Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner's, book, Quantum Enigma, is an interesting read, but if you’re looking for answers into the enigma of quantum events, you will be disappointed. There are no sure answers into the perplexing world of the quantum or for that matter why anything exist at all! In this publication and others like it. So in the final analysis, which may even be your own, is probably as good as anyone else’s. If you want to get a clear understanding of the wave-particle dilemma, this book offers a good description of such events. The analogy of using paired boxes while the quantum event is spread out in both and thus only existing in one after you looked into one of them, is an excellent way of saying that you do indeed create your own reality. You will also be left with the notion that you are a particle as well as a wave. Does that seem odd? Or is that satisfying in some ways regarding your true existence. If you’re looking for a confirmation of God’s existence, you won’t find it there either. But if you read between the lines, you might have the notion that you are GOD! At least in part…you are part of the same broken mirror. Ala the Big Bang!"
22,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33119635-neil,3,"A slightly frustrating book. Thirteen chapters taking us from quantum physics to consciousness and then just four chapters exploring the reverse journey. These last four are by far the more interesting - hence the frustration. Interesting, though. If you think you understand this book, you haven't read it properly. If you read it properly, it will give you food for thought that will more than slightly scramble your brain. I did a course in Quantum Theory as part of my degree, but that was over 30 years ago and things have changed a lot since then. Also, my degree was just about the mathematics, not the philosophy and the alarming implications. If a tree falls over in a forest when no one is there to witness it, does it still make a noise.

I thought of Quantum Mechanics (QM) as a theory that produced strange results on the microscopic level that would eventually be understood rationally. QM has been around a hundred years and its predictions have always proven correct. One third of our economy is generated by discoveries that rely on QM. QM isn't just for the microscopic world, but all of physics rests upon it. The amazing thing about QM is that it doesn't teach a reality independent of consciousness. Like in the double slit experiment, the results depend on the observer. Objects become entangled and information is shared instantaneously, apparently faster than the speed of light!Rosenblum and Kuttner tell the history of QM, describe how it works and explore its implications. The book is entertaining and written so that it can be understood by the non-physicist. Well, at least most of it."
24,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1777066-mitchell,4,"Rigid but recommendedThe book spends more time setting up what's confusing about quantum theory than exploring what is implied by consciousness interaction with the theory. A problem that the authors note is that we do not know how consciousness is derived, and that presents a self-referential challenge in understanding the quantum scale as well. To that end, if you already have a grasp on what the theory entails - skip this one. If you are looking for a baseline on quantum theory though, this book is for you. The authors stick to the facts, tightly scope the implications, and let former physicists do the speculating for them. Very conservative, and thankfully non-mystical.I'm moving on to Alexander Wendt's exploration of what quantum theory could mean for social science, since for all practical purposes, quantum theory currently has little more to offer.

32,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10746832-wesley-fox,2,"The book sets out to explain quantum mechanics to the layperson in non-technical language, and to give an overview of the academic origin of the theory. It also offers up the limits of the theory and no one is able to explain the ""why"" it works. A noble goal for a book and an important area of science as it is part of the basis of a huge part of our economy. Unfortunately, I think this book really doesn't set itself apart from Quantum Physics for Dummies. It is also not as enjoyable as the ""for Dummies"" titles.The book was difficult to finish. I ended up skimming a third of the book in total and it seems the authors expected some of that to take place. They even suggest readers skim certain sections. Why any author would want readers to merely skim there work is a mystery to me. Anyway, what made it difficult to read was the painful repetition of the same points over and over and over. The authors also tend to treat their readers like idiots at times, with painfully moronic anecdotes.Also, getting into the background stories of the physicists, (i.e. controversies in their academic careers, personal rivalries) is incompatible with writing a text for laypersons. Non-scientists like me do not care about the dramas of professional rivalries, academic accolades, and private accounts of physicist personalities. Numerous science books I have read are guilty of getting into this uninteresting topic. If I were in this field, I certainly would be interested, but I am not.Finally, I was disappointed that the authors constantly mentioned consciousness and the philosophical ramifications of quantum mechanics but made no real attempt to actually discuss it. It was all Wikipedia-style summaries, nothing more.I would think Quantum Mechanics for Dummies is a better choice if you want a basic introductory text on the subject.

It goes through the history of the founders of quantum theory and details the founders' own difficulty wrestling with the subject. It stays extremely close to the straight-and-narrow of physics except for possibly the last chapter, which gets the teensiest bit speculative.If you wanted a speculative book about how quantum physics is complementary to Buddhist thought, this is probably not the read for you! If you have trouble grasping what quantum physics is and why it's such a big (and weird) discovery, then give this book a try- ESPECIALLY if you lean toward the skeptical side.

Following my theme of physics and the quantum enigma, this book builds upon my understanding of the last book I read. Although it can be said the language did not flow as well, and some explanations can be a bit clumsy, I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It talks about the evolution of quantum theory and how the idea has evolved, showcasing thought experiments in the process with useful diagrams that accompany the explanation. I found some of these explanations a bit hard to follow, but I think that’s rather my limited understanding and ignorance concerning this field of science rather than the fault or the author. At the end chapter is where it really picks up for me, discussing the implications of consciousness and philosophy, and how things are merely observed into existence. Something that has definitely influenced me to research more into this topic. What is also wonderful is that there is a small section of recommended reading at the end, I always love it when authors include such a section, helps keep the flow of ideas fresh for me.

The tone is set in an understandable way, that the theories presented here may click right away for some folks. Those who don't understand immediately are given many chances to experience that ""aha!"" moment. And once you have that clarity, re-read the earlier sections to fully grasp it. There is one or two math equations offered, as the authors do their best to describe QM to the layman using diagrams and repetition in an effective way. As someone who took college physics and was only given an overview of QM at the time, I found the examples annoying at first, but as the author goes deeper into mechanics of quantum science, I was happy to re-read and process the challenging information.

56,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Consciousness remains a great mystery. While it has increasingly begun to look like consciousness is an output part of the brain, intriguing questions remain unanswered, and some of these unknowns are hard to reconcile with a materialist model (materialism says all phenomena are born out of matter.) It isn’t just pseudo-scientists and cranks that have a problem with the materialist approach. Major names in physics have pointed out that everything is not accounted for by a model that imagines consciousness as the computational product of the brain. Rosenblum and Kuttner address one such hiccup, the so-called Quantum Enigma that lends its name to the book. In brief, the quantum enigma reflects the fact that physical reality is created by observation. This may seem hard to believe, because it’s only been observed at the levels of the really small—i.e. primarily the atomic and subatomic, though the authors propose that there is theoretically nothing to limit the phenomenon to that level and experiments are being conducted at molecular level. Rosenblum and Kuttner remind us that while the quantum world behaves oddly, quantum theory is exceptionally successful in scientific terms. Meaning that it has been validated by every single experimental inquiry, and the knowledge gained from quantum mechanics has made possible many of the advanced technologies that shape our world (laser, transistor, CCD, and MRI.) The oddness of Quantum Mechanics can be seen in several issues. One is the two-slit experiment in which atoms and photons behave like either a particle or a wave. Another is quantum entanglement, in which two atoms that have interacted become “wired” together such that changes in one are instantaneously reflected in the other—even if they have been separated by great distances. The book is a bit repetitive, but perhaps this is necessary. People seem to have trouble grasping the nuances of the arguments being made, and this can lead to some wrong conclusions. For example, some people have leapt to the conclusion that ESP is supported by quantum entanglement, but the evidence doesn’t support the idea that one’s thoughts can control anything. Observation causes some physical reality to coalesce, but one has no influence over what reality displays itself. (In other words, with observation the wave form collapses and some state of being comes into existence from what was a field of probabilities.) Randomness remains. Physicists tell us that this is the problem with the idea of using quantum entanglement for instantaneous communications across light-years of space. A further example of a nuance that is hard to grasp is the notion that quantum probability doesn’t describe the likelihood an atom is a certain place, but rather it describes the likelihood you’ll find it there (and that that is a distinction with a difference.) One may be wondering how consciousness is central the issue. If a non-intelligent entity observed, would the wave forms collapse? Consciousness doesn’t necessarily equate to intelligence as we know it. Consciousness can be thought of as merely the ability to observe and recognize significance in what is observed. So a thermostat is a very primitive form of consciousness. However, the authors do outline why a robotic observer wouldn’t end the controversy. I found “Quantum Enigma” to be readable despite the challenging subject being explained. The authors to a good job of both describing the relevant phenomenon in terms the average person could understand (Ch.2 though which doesn’t reflect reality) before going on to explain the experiments in which the phenomena is actually observed (i.e. Ch. 7.) The authors use simple line drawings as graphics as necessary as well as staged dialogues to help make the concept clear by anticipating objections and dealing with them as they come. I’d recommend the book for those interested in the unresolved questions of science with respect to Quantum Mechanics. In particular, there is the issue of consciousness—though it might not seem as central to the book’s discussion as the subtitle would lead one to believe. The last few chapters do deal in consciousness, though in a way that creates more questions than they answer. (It often feels like another summation of the strangeness of quantum mechanics, but that may be because the issues regarding consciousness remain so unclear. Furthermore, a lot of background is necessary to make sense of these complicated issues.) "
57,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8586468-liesel-hill,5,"So I don't usually do reviews on Mondays, but last week I was literally reading seven books at once. Deep breaths, Everyone. It's really okay! I didn't finish them all, but I finished four of the seven, which leaves me three (plus one new one) to finish this week. Because of that, I'll have quite a few books to review over the next week or two.Quantum Enigma by Bruce Rosenblum, unlike most that I review, is not a fiction book. It's a non-fiction book that deals with physics principles. Now, before everyone roles their eyes and click away from my page (Hey! That means you! Get back here!) please hear me out. Back when I was still taking science classes in college and totally hated my life, the thing I did like about the classes was contemplating where the physical aspects of science met the non-physical. The non-physical often meant religious for me, but there is also the consciousness. In fact, that's how I became interested in the brain. There's so much we don't know about the physical brain. We're learning new things every day as our technology sprints toward the Star-Trekkian age, but neurosurgeons will tell you that most things that work in brain surgery are donebecause they've been proven to work, but no one knows exactly why they work. We simply don't have the technology to measure the workings of the brain on a small enough level.Quantum Enigma was written by what might have twenty years ago been considered ""fringe"" physicists who are interested in where the conscious mind meets the physical reality. The quantum enigma is getting much more attention today as new things are discovered. If you ever learn about quantum mechanics (not something I'd advise in the classroom as you'd suddenly find yourself drowning in mathematical equations) you learn that, as your headache grows and your understanding flounders, you also run into a fundamental enigma in the universe.Quantum physics is based on several basic principles, including but not limited to the facts that 1) energy can exist as both waves and particles (opposite and contradictory properties) 2) that observation by intelligent beings (i.e. humans) can create the concrete properties of energy (dah!), and 3) that the physics of the unseen world are completely different than those of the seen world.Basically, Rosenblum and his co-author take very complex concepts that something like a percentage of one percent of the population understand, and explains them in (sort of) layman's terms. This is exactly the kind of thing that fascinates me so I was happy to find a book that explained it in everyday English. That said, it was still difficult to get through. I had to stop every couple of paragraphs and re-explain what I'd just read to myself to make sure I got it. I could only read a chapter a day (at most) and then had to give my brain a rest.Overall, I really liked the book. I wanted to finish it before I moved forward with my Interchron series, which is loosely based on physics concepts of this nature. I knew it would help me piece my story together in a more concrete way.So, if you're into physics, creepy and abstract science, or just sci-fi in general (or if you want to have some background for where I'm going with my series--hey, it could happen!) this is the book for you! :D Just know that you're in for brain-bender. Happy Monday!"
58,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,4," We all understand classical (Newtonian) physics pretty well; it seems intuitive. If we push something, it moves. Hot things get colder. High things fall down. Einsteinian physics (relativity) is not really intuitive at all. The speed of light is constant no matter how fast one is going. Matter can be converted into energy, and vice versa. Fast-moving clocks run slower. Fortunately, we don't much have to think about things in a relativistic way. Unless we're scientists we don't have to think about quantum mechanics at all, but we should. The implications of quantum mechanics go far beyond those of relativity. The theory of quantum mechanics is far and away the most successful scientific theory ever developed; its predictions have never been proved wrong. It tells us that in the world of the very small (electrons, photons, atoms, etc.) strange things happen. Things can be both a particle and a wave. Objects can be in two places at the same time. One particle can communicate instantaneously with another particle no matter how far apart they are (faster than light)! Experiments have shown all this and more to be true. This book provides a clear and understandable introduction to the quantum world. It also describes the deepest, most bizarre aspect of the quantum world. A photon is simultaneously both a particle and a wave UNTIL SOMEONE LOOKS AT IT. It then becomes either a particle, behaving as one would expect a particle to behave, or it becomes a wave, exhibiting normal wave behavior. The observer forces the photon to take on one set of characteristics or the other. In a sense, nothing is fixed in the quantum world until an observer intervenes. You might ask why this should make any difference to us if quantum mechanics only applies to very small things. There are at least two reasons, and perhaps a third. First, modern technology uses quantum effects to achieve real results. Lasers and transistors(and the devices that rely on them, like computers) are just two of the things that could not exist without the application of quantum-mechanical principles. Second, quantum effects do not seem to necessarily be limited to very small things; objects as large as organic molecules and viruses have been shown to exhibit quantum behavior, and since everything, no matter how large, is made of the very small, it may just be a technological limitation that currently prevents us from seeing quantum behavior in, say, a Honda Civic.  There are parts of this book that need to be taken slowly, and sometimes reread a time or two, but the effort will be rewarded. Physicists have traditionally been reluctant to accept the implications of quantum mechanics, which seem to say that perhaps nothing is real until it is observed. Lay readers, who are not so heavily invested in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (described well in the book) may possibly be more willing to embrace one of the ten or more explanations of the theory that are herein described. (Or maybe not - we are venturing into very strange waters here.) Nevertheless, the authors point out that quantum mechanics should not lead anyone to some of the conclusions reached by people in the film What the #&%(# Do We Know. I found this to be a fascinating read."
59,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,5,"Rosenblum and Kuttner do a good job of calling attention to a remarkable problem at the heart of modern physics. Traditionally, science has worked within a realist perspective, assuming that the objects of our experience exist independently of our experience of them. Since our experience is all we know, we don't really know of any objects existing apart from subjects, and the idealist tradition in philosophy has placed subjectivity at the heart of reality. But science has considered it more objective to regard subjects as marginal to reality, perhaps because objects do exist independently of any particular subject, such as myself! So as they explored smaller and smaller realms of reality, physicists expected to find little particles of matter whose definite properties didn't depend on their being observed. Instead, they found wave functions describing only possibilities whose actualization seems to depend on observation. In the words of John Wheeler, ""No microscopic property is a property until it is an observed property."" This reopens the question of whether a real world exists independently of observation. The book is strongest when it is telling the story of how quantum physics came to be and describing the scientific and philosophical dilemmas it has created. I found it less exciting when it got to the question of interpretation beginning in Chapter 14. As other reviewers have noted, the authors give rather short shrift to some of the more popular interpretations, such as consistent histories and many worlds, probably because they feel that these approaches are still trying to minimize subjectivity and avoid confronting the real issue of consciousness. Here I wish they had provided a more thorough discussion and critique. I was also a little disappointed in the chapters on consciousness because they seemed to have only human consciousness in mind. But higher animals like ourselves appear too late in the evolutionary story to take too much credit for actualizing the possibilities of the universe! If physics is to confront consciousness in a serious way, it must confront the idealist philosophies that place the subject-object relationship at the heart of all reality, not just humanly experienced reality (but preferably without falling into a dualistic conception of subject as immaterial or supernatural being). In other words, the concept of consciousness must be thoroughly analyzed and perhaps singificantly broadened. Maybe whenever little things interact to form larger things, some form of ""measurement"" or ""observation"" is occurring to actualize posibilities. As John Bell asked, ""Are we not obliged to admit that more or less 'measurement-like' processes are going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere?""

Following my theme of physics and the quantum enigma, this book builds upon my understanding of the last book I read. Although it can be said the language did not flow as well, and some explanations can be a bit clumsy, I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It talks about the evolution of quantum theory and how the idea has evolved, showcasing thought experiments in the process with useful diagrams that accompany the explanation. I found some of these explanations a bit hard to follow, but I think that’s rather my limited understanding and ignorance concerning this field of science rather than the fault or the author. At the end chapter is where it really picks up for me, discussing the implications of consciousness and philosophy, and how things are merely observed into existence. Something that has definitely influenced me to research more into this topic.

The tone is set in an understandable way, that the theories presented here may click right away for some folks. Those who don't understand immediately are given many chances to experience that ""aha!"" moment. And once you have that clarity, re-read the earlier sections to fully grasp it. There is one or two math equations offered, as the authors do their best to describe QM to the layman using diagrams and repetition in an effective way. As someone who took college physics and was only given an overview of QM at the time, I found the examples annoying at first, but as the author goes deeper into mechanics of quantum science, I was happy to re-read and process the challenging information.

86,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Consciousness remains a great mystery. While it has increasingly begun to look like consciousness is an output part of the brain, intriguing questions remain unanswered, and some of these unknowns are hard to reconcile with a materialist model (materialism says all phenomena are born out of matter.) It isn’t just pseudo-scientists and cranks that have a problem with the materialist approach. Major names in physics have pointed out that everything is not accounted for by a model that imagines consciousness as the computational product of the brain. Rosenblum and Kuttner address one such hiccup, the so-called Quantum Enigma that lends its name to the book. In brief, the quantum enigma reflects the fact that physical reality is created by observation. This may seem hard to believe, because it’s only been observed at the levels of the really small—i.e. primarily the atomic and subatomic, though the authors propose that there is theoretically nothing to limit the phenomenon to that level and experiments are being conducted at molecular level. Rosenblum and Kuttner remind us that while the quantum world behaves oddly, quantum theory is exceptionally successful in scientific terms. Meaning that it has been validated by every single experimental inquiry, and the knowledge gained from quantum mechanics has made possible many of the advanced technologies that shape our world (laser, transistor, CCD, and MRI.) The oddness of Quantum Mechanics can be seen in several issues. One is the two-slit experiment in which atoms and photons behave like either a particle or a wave. Another is quantum entanglement, in which two atoms that have interacted become “wired” together such that changes in one are instantaneously reflected in the other—even if they have been separated by great distances. The book is a bit repetitive, but perhaps this is necessary. People seem to have trouble grasping the nuances of the arguments being made, and this can lead to some wrong conclusions. For example, some people have leapt to the conclusion that ESP is supported by quantum entanglement, but the evidence doesn’t support the idea that one’s thoughts can control anything. Observation causes some physical reality to coalesce, but one has no influence over what reality displays itself. (In other words, with observation the wave form collapses and some state of being comes into existence from what was a field of probabilities.) Randomness remains. Physicists tell us that this is the problem with the idea of using quantum entanglement for instantaneous communications across light-years of space. A further example of a nuance that is hard to grasp is the notion that quantum probability doesn’t describe the likelihood an atom is a certain place, but rather it describes the likelihood you’ll find it there (and that that is a distinction with a difference.) One may be wondering how consciousness is central the issue. If a non-intelligent entity observed, would the wave forms collapse? Consciousness doesn’t necessarily equate to intelligence as we know it. Consciousness can be thought of as merely the ability to observe and recognize significance in what is observed. So a thermostat is a very primitive form of consciousness. However, the authors do outline why a robotic observer wouldn’t end the controversy. I found “Quantum Enigma” to be readable despite the challenging subject being explained. The authors to a good job of both describing the relevant phenomenon in terms the average person could understand (Ch.2 though which doesn’t reflect reality) before going on to explain the experiments in which the phenomena is actually observed (i.e. Ch. 7.) The authors use simple line drawings as graphics as necessary as well as staged dialogues to help make the concept clear by anticipating objections and dealing with them as they come. I’d recommend the book for those interested in the unresolved questions of science with respect to Quantum Mechanics. In particular, there is the issue of consciousness—though it might not seem as central to the book’s discussion as the subtitle would lead one to believe. The last few chapters do deal in consciousness, though in a way that creates more questions than they answer. (It often feels like another summation of the strangeness of quantum mechanics, but that may be because the issues regarding consciousness remain so unclear. Furthermore, a lot of background is necessary to make sense of these complicated issues.) "
87,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8586468-liesel-hill,5,"So I don't usually do reviews on Mondays, but last week I was literally reading seven books at once. Deep breaths, Everyone. It's really okay! I didn't finish them all, but I finished four of the seven, which leaves me three (plus one new one) to finish this week. Because of that, I'll have quite a few books to review over the next week or two.Quantum Enigma by Bruce Rosenblum, unlike most that I review, is not a fiction book. It's a non-fiction book that deals with physics principles. Now, before everyone roles their eyes and click away from my page (Hey! That means you! Get back here!) please hear me out. Back when I was still taking science classes in college and totally hated my life, the thing I did like about the classes was contemplating where the physical aspects of science met the non-physical. The non-physical often meant religious for me, but there is also the consciousness. In fact, that's how I became interested in the brain. There's so much we don't know about the physical brain. We're learning new things every day as our technology sprints toward the Star-Trekkian age, but neurosurgeons will tell you that most things that work in brain surgery are donebecause they've been proven to work, but no one knows exactly why they work. We simply don't have the technology to measure the workings of the brain on a small enough level.Quantum Enigma was written by what might have twenty years ago been considered ""fringe"" physicists who are interested in where the conscious mind meets the physical reality. The quantum enigma is getting much more attention today as new things are discovered. If you ever learn about quantum mechanics (not something I'd advise in the classroom as you'd suddenly find yourself drowning in mathematical equations) you learn that, as your headache grows and your understanding flounders, you also run into a fundamental enigma in the universe.Quantum physics is based on several basic principles, including but not limited to the facts that 1) energy can exist as both waves and particles (opposite and contradictory properties) 2) that observation by intelligent beings (i.e. humans) can create the concrete properties of energy (dah!), and 3) that the physics of the unseen world are completely different than those of the seen world.Basically, Rosenblum and his co-author take very complex concepts that something like a percentage of one percent of the population understand, and explains them in (sort of) layman's terms. This is exactly the kind of thing that fascinates me so I was happy to find a book that explained it in everyday English. That said, it was still difficult to get through. I had to stop every couple of paragraphs and re-explain what I'd just read to myself to make sure I got it. I could only read a chapter a day (at most) and then had to give my brain a rest.Overall, I really liked the book. I wanted to finish it before I moved forward with my Interchron series, which is loosely based on physics concepts of this nature. I knew it would help me piece my story together in a more concrete way.So, if you're into physics, creepy and abstract science, or just sci-fi in general (or if you want to have some background for where I'm going with my series--hey, it could happen!) this is the book for you! :D Just know that you're in for brain-bender. Happy Monday!"
88,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,4," We all understand classical (Newtonian) physics pretty well; it seems intuitive. If we push something, it moves. Hot things get colder. High things fall down. Einsteinian physics (relativity) is not really intuitive at all. The speed of light is constant no matter how fast one is going. Matter can be converted into energy, and vice versa. Fast-moving clocks run slower. Fortunately, we don't much have to think about things in a relativistic way. Unless we're scientists we don't have to think about quantum mechanics at all, but we should. The implications of quantum mechanics go far beyond those of relativity. The theory of quantum mechanics is far and away the most successful scientific theory ever developed; its predictions have never been proved wrong. It tells us that in the world of the very small (electrons, photons, atoms, etc.) strange things happen. Things can be both a particle and a wave. Objects can be in two places at the same time. One particle can communicate instantaneously with another particle no matter how far apart they are (faster than light)! Experiments have shown all this and more to be true. This book provides a clear and understandable introduction to the quantum world. It also describes the deepest, most bizarre aspect of the quantum world. A photon is simultaneously both a particle and a wave UNTIL SOMEONE LOOKS AT IT. It then becomes either a particle, behaving as one would expect a particle to behave, or it becomes a wave, exhibiting normal wave behavior. The observer forces the photon to take on one set of characteristics or the other. In a sense, nothing is fixed in the quantum world until an observer intervenes. You might ask why this should make any difference to us if quantum mechanics only applies to very small things. There are at least two reasons, and perhaps a third. First, modern technology uses quantum effects to achieve real results. Lasers and transistors(and the devices that rely on them, like computers) are just two of the things that could not exist without the application of quantum-mechanical principles. Second, quantum effects do not seem to necessarily be limited to very small things; objects as large as organic molecules and viruses have been shown to exhibit quantum behavior, and since everything, no matter how large, is made of the very small, it may just be a technological limitation that currently prevents us from seeing quantum behavior in, say, a Honda Civic.  There are parts of this book that need to be taken slowly, and sometimes reread a time or two, but the effort will be rewarded. Physicists have traditionally been reluctant to accept the implications of quantum mechanics, which seem to say that perhaps nothing is real until it is observed. Lay readers, who are not so heavily invested in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (described well in the book) may possibly be more willing to embrace one of the ten or more explanations of the theory that are herein described. (Or maybe not - we are venturing into very strange waters here.) Nevertheless, the authors point out that quantum mechanics should not lead anyone to some of the conclusions reached by people in the film What the #&%(# Do We Know. I found this to be a fascinating read."
89,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,5,"Rosenblum and Kuttner do a good job of calling attention to a remarkable problem at the heart of modern physics. Traditionally, science has worked within a realist perspective, assuming that the objects of our experience exist independently of our experience of them. Since our experience is all we know, we don't really know of any objects existing apart from subjects, and the idealist tradition in philosophy has placed subjectivity at the heart of reality. But science has considered it more objective to regard subjects as marginal to reality, perhaps because objects do exist independently of any particular subject, such as myself! So as they explored smaller and smaller realms of reality, physicists expected to find little particles of matter whose definite properties didn't depend on their being observed. Instead, they found wave functions describing only possibilities whose actualization seems to depend on observation. In the words of John Wheeler, ""No microscopic property is a property until it is an observed property."" This reopens the question of whether a real world exists independently of observation. The book is strongest when it is telling the story of how quantum physics came to be and describing the scientific and philosophical dilemmas it has created. I found it less exciting when it got to the question of interpretation beginning in Chapter 14. As other reviewers have noted, the authors give rather short shrift to some of the more popular interpretations, such as consistent histories and many worlds, probably because they feel that these approaches are still trying to minimize subjectivity and avoid confronting the real issue of consciousness. Here I wish they had provided a more thorough discussion and critique. I was also a little disappointed in the chapters on consciousness because they seemed to have only human consciousness in mind. But higher animals like ourselves appear too late in the evolutionary story to take too much credit for actualizing the possibilities of the universe! If physics is to confront consciousness in a serious way, it must confront the idealist philosophies that place the subject-object relationship at the heart of all reality, not just humanly experienced reality (but preferably without falling into a dualistic conception of subject as immaterial or supernatural being). In other words, the concept of consciousness must be thoroughly analyzed and perhaps singificantly broadened. Maybe whenever little things interact to form larger things, some form of ""measurement"" or ""observation"" is occurring to actualize posibilities. As John Bell asked, ""Are we not obliged to admit that more or less 'measurement-like' processes are going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere?"" I gave the book five stars, despite my reservations, because it is an important step toward getting people to address the philosophical questions raised by quantum mechanics. The alternative is to wall off post-classical physics in some isolated compartment of our brains, so it won't disturb our classical worldview."

116,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Consciousness remains a great mystery. While it has increasingly begun to look like consciousness is an output part of the brain, intriguing questions remain unanswered, and some of these unknowns are hard to reconcile with a materialist model (materialism says all phenomena are born out of matter.) It isn’t just pseudo-scientists and cranks that have a problem with the materialist approach. Major names in physics have pointed out that everything is not accounted for by a model that imagines consciousness as the computational product of the brain. Rosenblum and Kuttner address one such hiccup, the so-called Quantum Enigma that lends its name to the book. In brief, the quantum enigma reflects the fact that physical reality is created by observation. This may seem hard to believe, because it’s only been observed at the levels of the really small—i.e. primarily the atomic and subatomic, though the authors propose that there is theoretically nothing to limit the phenomenon to that level and experiments are being conducted at molecular level. Rosenblum and Kuttner remind us that while the quantum world behaves oddly, quantum theory is exceptionally successful in scientific terms. Meaning that it has been validated by every single experimental inquiry, and the knowledge gained from quantum mechanics has made possible many of the advanced technologies that shape our world (laser, transistor, CCD, and MRI.) The oddness of Quantum Mechanics can be seen in several issues. One is the two-slit experiment in which atoms and photons behave like either a particle or a wave. Another is quantum entanglement, in which two atoms that have interacted become “wired” together such that changes in one are instantaneously reflected in the other—even if they have been separated by great distances. The book is a bit repetitive, but perhaps this is necessary. People seem to have trouble grasping the nuances of the arguments being made, and this can lead to some wrong conclusions. For example, some people have leapt to the conclusion that ESP is supported by quantum entanglement, but the evidence doesn’t support the idea that one’s thoughts can control anything. Observation causes some physical reality to coalesce, but one has no influence over what reality displays itself. (In other words, with observation the wave form collapses and some state of being comes into existence from what was a field of probabilities.) Randomness remains. Physicists tell us that this is the problem with the idea of using quantum entanglement for instantaneous communications across light-years of space. A further example of a nuance that is hard to grasp is the notion that quantum probability doesn’t describe the likelihood an atom is a certain place, but rather it describes the likelihood you’ll find it there (and that that is a distinction with a difference.) One may be wondering how consciousness is central the issue. If a non-intelligent entity observed, would the wave forms collapse? Consciousness doesn’t necessarily equate to intelligence as we know it. Consciousness can be thought of as merely the ability to observe and recognize significance in what is observed. So a thermostat is a very primitive form of consciousness. However, the authors do outline why a robotic observer wouldn’t end the controversy. I found “Quantum Enigma” to be readable despite the challenging subject being explained. The authors to a good job of both describing the relevant phenomenon in terms the average person could understand (Ch.2 though which doesn’t reflect reality) before going on to explain the experiments in which the phenomena is actually observed (i.e. Ch. 7.) The authors use simple line drawings as graphics as necessary as well as staged dialogues to help make the concept clear by anticipating objections and dealing with them as they come. I’d recommend the book for those interested in the unresolved questions of science with respect to Quantum Mechanics. In particular, there is the issue of consciousness—though it might not seem as central to the book’s discussion as the subtitle would lead one to believe. The last few chapters do deal in consciousness, though in a way that creates more questions than they answer. (It often feels like another summation of the strangeness of quantum mechanics, but that may be because the issues regarding consciousness remain so unclear. Furthermore, a lot of background is necessary to make sense of these complicated issues.) "
117,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8586468-liesel-hill,5,"So I don't usually do reviews on Mondays, but last week I was literally reading seven books at once. Deep breaths, Everyone. It's really okay! I didn't finish them all, but I finished four of the seven, which leaves me three (plus one new one) to finish this week. Because of that, I'll have quite a few books to review over the next week or two.Quantum Enigma by Bruce Rosenblum, unlike most that I review, is not a fiction book. It's a non-fiction book that deals with physics principles. Now, before everyone roles their eyes and click away from my page (Hey! That means you! Get back here!) please hear me out. Back when I was still taking science classes in college and totally hated my life, the thing I did like about the classes was contemplating where the physical aspects of science met the non-physical. The non-physical often meant religious for me, but there is also the consciousness. In fact, that's how I became interested in the brain. There's so much we don't know about the physical brain. We're learning new things every day as our technology sprints toward the Star-Trekkian age, but neurosurgeons will tell you that most things that work in brain surgery are donebecause they've been proven to work, but no one knows exactly why they work. We simply don't have the technology to measure the workings of the brain on a small enough level.Quantum Enigma was written by what might have twenty years ago been considered ""fringe"" physicists who are interested in where the conscious mind meets the physical reality. The quantum enigma is getting much more attention today as new things are discovered. If you ever learn about quantum mechanics (not something I'd advise in the classroom as you'd suddenly find yourself drowning in mathematical equations) you learn that, as your headache grows and your understanding flounders, you also run into a fundamental enigma in the universe.Quantum physics is based on several basic principles, including but not limited to the facts that 1) energy can exist as both waves and particles (opposite and contradictory properties) 2) that observation by intelligent beings (i.e. humans) can create the concrete properties of energy (dah!), and 3) that the physics of the unseen world are completely different than those of the seen world.Basically, Rosenblum and his co-author take very complex concepts that something like a percentage of one percent of the population understand, and explains them in (sort of) layman's terms. This is exactly the kind of thing that fascinates me so I was happy to find a book that explained it in everyday English. That said, it was still difficult to get through. I had to stop every couple of paragraphs and re-explain what I'd just read to myself to make sure I got it. I could only read a chapter a day (at most) and then had to give my brain a rest.Overall, I really liked the book. I wanted to finish it before I moved forward with my Interchron series, which is loosely based on physics concepts of this nature. I knew it would help me piece my story together in a more concrete way.So, if you're into physics, creepy and abstract science, or just sci-fi in general (or if you want to have some background for where I'm going with my series--hey, it could happen!) this is the book for you! :D Just know that you're in for brain-bender. Happy Monday!"
118,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,4," We all understand classical (Newtonian) physics pretty well; it seems intuitive. If we push something, it moves. Hot things get colder. High things fall down. Einsteinian physics (relativity) is not really intuitive at all. The speed of light is constant no matter how fast one is going. Matter can be converted into energy, and vice versa. Fast-moving clocks run slower. Fortunately, we don't much have to think about things in a relativistic way. Unless we're scientists we don't have to think about quantum mechanics at all, but we should. The implications of quantum mechanics go far beyond those of relativity. The theory of quantum mechanics is far and away the most successful scientific theory ever developed; its predictions have never been proved wrong. It tells us that in the world of the very small (electrons, photons, atoms, etc.) strange things happen. Things can be both a particle and a wave. Objects can be in two places at the same time. One particle can communicate instantaneously with another particle no matter how far apart they are (faster than light)! Experiments have shown all this and more to be true. This book provides a clear and understandable introduction to the quantum world. It also describes the deepest, most bizarre aspect of the quantum world. A photon is simultaneously both a particle and a wave UNTIL SOMEONE LOOKS AT IT. It then becomes either a particle, behaving as one would expect a particle to behave, or it becomes a wave, exhibiting normal wave behavior. The observer forces the photon to take on one set of characteristics or the other. In a sense, nothing is fixed in the quantum world until an observer intervenes. You might ask why this should make any difference to us if quantum mechanics only applies to very small things. There are at least two reasons, and perhaps a third. First, modern technology uses quantum effects to achieve real results. Lasers and transistors(and the devices that rely on them, like computers) are just two of the things that could not exist without the application of quantum-mechanical principles. Second, quantum effects do not seem to necessarily be limited to very small things; objects as large as organic molecules and viruses have been shown to exhibit quantum behavior, and since everything, no matter how large, is made of the very small, it may just be a technological limitation that currently prevents us from seeing quantum behavior in, say, a Honda Civic.  There are parts of this book that need to be taken slowly, and sometimes reread a time or two, but the effort will be rewarded. Physicists have traditionally been reluctant to accept the implications of quantum mechanics, which seem to say that perhaps nothing is real until it is observed. Lay readers, who are not so heavily invested in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (described well in the book) may possibly be more willing to embrace one of the ten or more explanations of the theory that are herein described. (Or maybe not - we are venturing into very strange waters here.) Nevertheless, the authors point out that quantum mechanics should not lead anyone to some of the conclusions reached by people in the film What the #&%(# Do We Know. I found this to be a fascinating read."
119,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,5,"Rosenblum and Kuttner do a good job of calling attention to a remarkable problem at the heart of modern physics. Traditionally, science has worked within a realist perspective, assuming that the objects of our experience exist independently of our experience of them. Since our experience is all we know, we don't really know of any objects existing apart from subjects, and the idealist tradition in philosophy has placed subjectivity at the heart of reality. But science has considered it more objective to regard subjects as marginal to reality, perhaps because objects do exist independently of any particular subject, such as myself! So as they explored smaller and smaller realms of reality, physicists expected to find little particles of matter whose definite properties didn't depend on their being observed. Instead, they found wave functions describing only possibilities whose actualization seems to depend on observation. In the words of John Wheeler, ""No microscopic property is a property until it is an observed property."" This reopens the question of whether a real world exists independently of observation. The book is strongest when it is telling the story of how quantum physics came to be and describing the scientific and philosophical dilemmas it has created. I found it less exciting when it got to the question of interpretation beginning in Chapter 14. As other reviewers have noted, the authors give rather short shrift to some of the more popular interpretations, such as consistent histories and many worlds, probably because they feel that these approaches are still trying to minimize subjectivity and avoid confronting the real issue of consciousness. Here I wish they had provided a more thorough discussion and critique. I was also a little disappointed in the chapters on consciousness because they seemed to have only human consciousness in mind. But higher animals like ourselves appear too late in the evolutionary story to take too much credit for actualizing the possibilities of the universe! If physics is to confront consciousness in a serious way, it must confront the idealist philosophies that place the subject-object relationship at the heart of all reality, not just humanly experienced reality (but preferably without falling into a dualistic conception of subject as immaterial or supernatural being). In other words, the concept of consciousness must be thoroughly analyzed and perhaps singificantly broadened. Maybe whenever little things interact to form larger things, some form of ""measurement"" or ""observation"" is occurring to actualize posibilities. As John Bell asked, ""Are we not obliged to admit that more or less 'measurement-like' processes are going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere?"" I gave the book five stars, despite my reservations, because it is an important step toward getting people to address the philosophical questions raised by quantum mechanics. The alternative is to wall off post-classical physics in some isolated compartment of our brains, so it won't disturb our classical worldview."

Unfortunately, I think this book really doesn't set itself apart from Quantum Physics for Dummies. It is also not as enjoyable as the ""for Dummies"" titles.The book was difficult to finish. I ended up skimming a third of the book in total and it seems the authors expected some of that to take place. They even suggest readers skim certain sections. Why any author would want readers to merely skim there work is a mystery to me. Anyway, what made it difficult to read was the painful repetition of the same points over and over and over. The authors also tend to treat their readers like idiots at times, with painfully moronic anecdotes.Also, getting into the background stories of the physicists, (i.e. controversies in their academic careers, personal rivalries) is incompatible with writing a text for laypersons. Non-scientists like me do not care about the dramas of professional rivalries, academic accolades, and private accounts of physicist personalities. Numerous science books I have read are guilty of getting into this uninteresting topic. If I were in this field, I certainly would be interested, but I am not.Finally, I was disappointed that the authors constantly mentioned consciousness and the philosophical ramifications of quantum mechanics but made no real attempt to actually discuss it. It was all Wikipedia-style summaries, nothing more.I would think Quantum Mechanics for Dummies is a better choice if you want a basic introductory text on the subject.

It goes through the history of the founders of quantum theory and details the founders' own difficulty wrestling with the subject.

146,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Consciousness remains a great mystery. While it has increasingly begun to look like consciousness is an output part of the brain, intriguing questions remain unanswered, and some of these unknowns are hard to reconcile with a materialist model (materialism says all phenomena are born out of matter.) It isn’t just pseudo-scientists and cranks that have a problem with the materialist approach. Major names in physics have pointed out that everything is not accounted for by a model that imagines consciousness as the computational product of the brain. Rosenblum and Kuttner address one such hiccup, the so-called Quantum Enigma that lends its name to the book. In brief, the quantum enigma reflects the fact that physical reality is created by observation. This may seem hard to believe, because it’s only been observed at the levels of the really small—i.e. primarily the atomic and subatomic, though the authors propose that there is theoretically nothing to limit the phenomenon to that level and experiments are being conducted at molecular level. Rosenblum and Kuttner remind us that while the quantum world behaves oddly, quantum theory is exceptionally successful in scientific terms. Meaning that it has been validated by every single experimental inquiry, and the knowledge gained from quantum mechanics has made possible many of the advanced technologies that shape our world (laser, transistor, CCD, and MRI.) The oddness of Quantum Mechanics can be seen in several issues. One is the two-slit experiment in which atoms and photons behave like either a particle or a wave. Another is quantum entanglement, in which two atoms that have interacted become “wired” together such that changes in one are instantaneously reflected in the other—even if they have been separated by great distances. The book is a bit repetitive, but perhaps this is necessary. People seem to have trouble grasping the nuances of the arguments being made, and this can lead to some wrong conclusions. For example, some people have leapt to the conclusion that ESP is supported by quantum entanglement, but the evidence doesn’t support the idea that one’s thoughts can control anything. Observation causes some physical reality to coalesce, but one has no influence over what reality displays itself. (In other words, with observation the wave form collapses and some state of being comes into existence from what was a field of probabilities.) Randomness remains. Physicists tell us that this is the problem with the idea of using quantum entanglement for instantaneous communications across light-years of space. A further example of a nuance that is hard to grasp is the notion that quantum probability doesn’t describe the likelihood an atom is a certain place, but rather it describes the likelihood you’ll find it there (and that that is a distinction with a difference.) One may be wondering how consciousness is central the issue. If a non-intelligent entity observed, would the wave forms collapse? Consciousness doesn’t necessarily equate to intelligence as we know it. Consciousness can be thought of as merely the ability to observe and recognize significance in what is observed. So a thermostat is a very primitive form of consciousness. However, the authors do outline why a robotic observer wouldn’t end the controversy. I found “Quantum Enigma” to be readable despite the challenging subject being explained. The authors to a good job of both describing the relevant phenomenon in terms the average person could understand (Ch.2 though which doesn’t reflect reality) before going on to explain the experiments in which the phenomena is actually observed (i.e. Ch. 7.) The authors use simple line drawings as graphics as necessary as well as staged dialogues to help make the concept clear by anticipating objections and dealing with them as they come. I’d recommend the book for those interested in the unresolved questions of science with respect to Quantum Mechanics. In particular, there is the issue of consciousness—though it might not seem as central to the book’s discussion as the subtitle would lead one to believe. The last few chapters do deal in consciousness, though in a way that creates more questions than they answer. (It often feels like another summation of the strangeness of quantum mechanics, but that may be because the issues regarding consciousness remain so unclear. Furthermore, a lot of background is necessary to make sense of these complicated issues.) "
147,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8586468-liesel-hill,5,"So I don't usually do reviews on Mondays, but last week I was literally reading seven books at once. Deep breaths, Everyone. It's really okay! I didn't finish them all, but I finished four of the seven, which leaves me three (plus one new one) to finish this week. Because of that, I'll have quite a few books to review over the next week or two.Quantum Enigma by Bruce Rosenblum, unlike most that I review, is not a fiction book. It's a non-fiction book that deals with physics principles. Now, before everyone roles their eyes and click away from my page (Hey! That means you! Get back here!) please hear me out. Back when I was still taking science classes in college and totally hated my life, the thing I did like about the classes was contemplating where the physical aspects of science met the non-physical. The non-physical often meant religious for me, but there is also the consciousness. In fact, that's how I became interested in the brain. There's so much we don't know about the physical brain. We're learning new things every day as our technology sprints toward the Star-Trekkian age, but neurosurgeons will tell you that most things that work in brain surgery are donebecause they've been proven to work, but no one knows exactly why they work. We simply don't have the technology to measure the workings of the brain on a small enough level.Quantum Enigma was written by what might have twenty years ago been considered ""fringe"" physicists who are interested in where the conscious mind meets the physical reality. The quantum enigma is getting much more attention today as new things are discovered. If you ever learn about quantum mechanics (not something I'd advise in the classroom as you'd suddenly find yourself drowning in mathematical equations) you learn that, as your headache grows and your understanding flounders, you also run into a fundamental enigma in the universe.Quantum physics is based on several basic principles, including but not limited to the facts that 1) energy can exist as both waves and particles (opposite and contradictory properties) 2) that observation by intelligent beings (i.e. humans) can create the concrete properties of energy (dah!), and 3) that the physics of the unseen world are completely different than those of the seen world.Basically, Rosenblum and his co-author take very complex concepts that something like a percentage of one percent of the population understand, and explains them in (sort of) layman's terms. This is exactly the kind of thing that fascinates me so I was happy to find a book that explained it in everyday English. That said, it was still difficult to get through. I had to stop every couple of paragraphs and re-explain what I'd just read to myself to make sure I got it. I could only read a chapter a day (at most) and then had to give my brain a rest.Overall, I really liked the book. I wanted to finish it before I moved forward with my Interchron series, which is loosely based on physics concepts of this nature. I knew it would help me piece my story together in a more concrete way.So, if you're into physics, creepy and abstract science, or just sci-fi in general (or if you want to have some background for where I'm going with my series--hey, it could happen!) this is the book for you! :D Just know that you're in for brain-bender. Happy Monday!"
148,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,4," We all understand classical (Newtonian) physics pretty well; it seems intuitive. If we push something, it moves. Hot things get colder. High things fall down. Einsteinian physics (relativity) is not really intuitive at all. The speed of light is constant no matter how fast one is going. Matter can be converted into energy, and vice versa. Fast-moving clocks run slower. Fortunately, we don't much have to think about things in a relativistic way. Unless we're scientists we don't have to think about quantum mechanics at all, but we should. The implications of quantum mechanics go far beyond those of relativity. The theory of quantum mechanics is far and away the most successful scientific theory ever developed; its predictions have never been proved wrong. It tells us that in the world of the very small (electrons, photons, atoms, etc.) strange things happen. Things can be both a particle and a wave. Objects can be in two places at the same time. One particle can communicate instantaneously with another particle no matter how far apart they are (faster than light)! Experiments have shown all this and more to be true. This book provides a clear and understandable introduction to the quantum world. It also describes the deepest, most bizarre aspect of the quantum world. A photon is simultaneously both a particle and a wave UNTIL SOMEONE LOOKS AT IT. It then becomes either a particle, behaving as one would expect a particle to behave, or it becomes a wave, exhibiting normal wave behavior. The observer forces the photon to take on one set of characteristics or the other. In a sense, nothing is fixed in the quantum world until an observer intervenes. You might ask why this should make any difference to us if quantum mechanics only applies to very small things. There are at least two reasons, and perhaps a third. First, modern technology uses quantum effects to achieve real results. Lasers and transistors(and the devices that rely on them, like computers) are just two of the things that could not exist without the application of quantum-mechanical principles. Second, quantum effects do not seem to necessarily be limited to very small things; objects as large as organic molecules and viruses have been shown to exhibit quantum behavior, and since everything, no matter how large, is made of the very small, it may just be a technological limitation that currently prevents us from seeing quantum behavior in, say, a Honda Civic.  There are parts of this book that need to be taken slowly, and sometimes reread a time or two, but the effort will be rewarded. Physicists have traditionally been reluctant to accept the implications of quantum mechanics, which seem to say that perhaps nothing is real until it is observed. Lay readers, who are not so heavily invested in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (described well in the book) may possibly be more willing to embrace one of the ten or more explanations of the theory that are herein described. (Or maybe not - we are venturing into very strange waters here.) Nevertheless, the authors point out that quantum mechanics should not lead anyone to some of the conclusions reached by people in the film What the #&%(# Do We Know. I found this to be a fascinating read."
149,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,5,"Rosenblum and Kuttner do a good job of calling attention to a remarkable problem at the heart of modern physics. Traditionally, science has worked within a realist perspective, assuming that the objects of our experience exist independently of our experience of them. Since our experience is all we know, we don't really know of any objects existing apart from subjects, and the idealist tradition in philosophy has placed subjectivity at the heart of reality. But science has considered it more objective to regard subjects as marginal to reality, perhaps because objects do exist independently of any particular subject, such as myself! So as they explored smaller and smaller realms of reality, physicists expected to find little particles of matter whose definite properties didn't depend on their being observed. Instead, they found wave functions describing only possibilities whose actualization seems to depend on observation. In the words of John Wheeler, ""No microscopic property is a property until it is an observed property."" This reopens the question of whether a real world exists independently of observation. The book is strongest when it is telling the story of how quantum physics came to be and describing the scientific and philosophical dilemmas it has created. I found it less exciting when it got to the question of interpretation beginning in Chapter 14. As other reviewers have noted, the authors give rather short shrift to some of the more popular interpretations, such as consistent histories and many worlds, probably because they feel that these approaches are still trying to minimize subjectivity and avoid confronting the real issue of consciousness. Here I wish they had provided a more thorough discussion and critique. I was also a little disappointed in the chapters on consciousness because they seemed to have only human consciousness in mind. But higher animals like ourselves appear too late in the evolutionary story to take too much credit for actualizing the possibilities of the universe! If physics is to confront consciousness in a serious way, it must confront the idealist philosophies that place the subject-object relationship at the heart of all reality, not just humanly experienced reality (but preferably without falling into a dualistic conception of subject as immaterial or supernatural being). In other words, the concept of consciousness must be thoroughly analyzed and perhaps singificantly broadened. Maybe whenever little things interact to form larger things, some form of ""measurement"" or ""observation"" is occurring to actualize posibilities. As John Bell asked, ""Are we not obliged to admit that more or less 'measurement-like' processes are going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere?"" I gave the book five stars, despite my reservations, because it is an important step toward getting people to address the philosophical questions raised by quantum mechanics. The alternative is to wall off post-classical physics in some isolated compartment of our brains, so it won't disturb our classical worldview."

Unfortunately, I think this book really doesn't set itself apart from Quantum Physics for Dummies. It is also not as enjoyable as the ""for Dummies"" titles.The book was difficult to finish. I ended up skimming a third of the book in total and it seems the authors expected some of that to take place. They even suggest readers skim certain sections. Why any author would want readers to merely skim there work is a mystery to me. Anyway, what made it difficult to read was the painful repetition of the same points over and over and over. The authors also tend to treat their readers like idiots at times, with painfully moronic anecdotes.Also, getting into the background stories of the physicists, (i.e. controversies in their academic careers, personal rivalries) is incompatible with writing a text for laypersons. Non-scientists like me do not care about the dramas of professional rivalries, academic accolades, and private accounts of physicist personalities. Numerous science books I have read are guilty of getting into this uninteresting topic. If I were in this field, I certainly would be interested, but I am not.Finally, I was disappointed that the authors constantly mentioned consciousness and the philosophical ramifications of quantum mechanics but made no real attempt to actually discuss it. It was all Wikipedia-style summaries, nothing more.I would think Quantum Mechanics for Dummies is a better choice if you want a basic introductory text on the subject. This one is too long, repetitive, and tends to insult intelligence of the reader."

It goes through the history of the founders of quantum theory and details the founders' own difficulty wrestling with the subject. It stays extremely close to the straight-and-narrow of physics except for possibly the last chapter, which gets the teensiest bit speculative.If you wanted a speculative book about how quantum physics is complementary to Buddhist thought, this is probably not the read for you! If you have trouble grasping what quantum physics is and why it's such a big (and weird) discovery, then give this book a try- ESPECIALLY if you lean toward the skeptical side. The authors are not trying to do anything but educate so that, by the end of the book, readers have something endlessly fascinating and vastly significant to the nature of our existence to ponder."

Following my theme of physics and the quantum enigma, this book builds upon my understanding of the last book I read. Although it can be said the language did not flow as well, and some explanations can be a bit clumsy, I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It talks about the evolution of quantum theory and how the idea has evolved, showcasing thought experiments in the process with useful diagrams that accompany the explanation. I found some of these explanations a bit hard to follow, but I think that’s rather my limited understanding and ignorance concerning this field of science rather than the fault or the author. At the end chapter is where it really picks up for me, discussing the implications of consciousness and philosophy, and how things are merely observed into existence. Something that has definitely influenced me to research more into this topic. What is also wonderful is that there is a small section of recommended reading at the end, I always love it when authors include such a section, helps keep the flow of ideas fresh for me.

The tone is set in an understandable way, that the theories presented here may click right away for some folks. Those who don't understand immediately are given many chances to experience that ""aha!"" moment. And once you have that clarity, re-read the earlier sections to fully grasp it. There is one or two math equations offered, as the authors do their best to describe QM to the layman using diagrams and repetition in an effective way.

176,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Consciousness remains a great mystery. While it has increasingly begun to look like consciousness is an output part of the brain, intriguing questions remain unanswered, and some of these unknowns are hard to reconcile with a materialist model (materialism says all phenomena are born out of matter.) It isn’t just pseudo-scientists and cranks that have a problem with the materialist approach. Major names in physics have pointed out that everything is not accounted for by a model that imagines consciousness as the computational product of the brain. Rosenblum and Kuttner address one such hiccup, the so-called Quantum Enigma that lends its name to the book. In brief, the quantum enigma reflects the fact that physical reality is created by observation. This may seem hard to believe, because it’s only been observed at the levels of the really small—i.e. primarily the atomic and subatomic, though the authors propose that there is theoretically nothing to limit the phenomenon to that level and experiments are being conducted at molecular level. Rosenblum and Kuttner remind us that while the quantum world behaves oddly, quantum theory is exceptionally successful in scientific terms. Meaning that it has been validated by every single experimental inquiry, and the knowledge gained from quantum mechanics has made possible many of the advanced technologies that shape our world (laser, transistor, CCD, and MRI.) The oddness of Quantum Mechanics can be seen in several issues. One is the two-slit experiment in which atoms and photons behave like either a particle or a wave. Another is quantum entanglement, in which two atoms that have interacted become “wired” together such that changes in one are instantaneously reflected in the other—even if they have been separated by great distances. The book is a bit repetitive, but perhaps this is necessary. People seem to have trouble grasping the nuances of the arguments being made, and this can lead to some wrong conclusions. For example, some people have leapt to the conclusion that ESP is supported by quantum entanglement, but the evidence doesn’t support the idea that one’s thoughts can control anything. Observation causes some physical reality to coalesce, but one has no influence over what reality displays itself. (In other words, with observation the wave form collapses and some state of being comes into existence from what was a field of probabilities.) Randomness remains. Physicists tell us that this is the problem with the idea of using quantum entanglement for instantaneous communications across light-years of space. A further example of a nuance that is hard to grasp is the notion that quantum probability doesn’t describe the likelihood an atom is a certain place, but rather it describes the likelihood you’ll find it there (and that that is a distinction with a difference.) One may be wondering how consciousness is central the issue. If a non-intelligent entity observed, would the wave forms collapse? Consciousness doesn’t necessarily equate to intelligence as we know it. Consciousness can be thought of as merely the ability to observe and recognize significance in what is observed. So a thermostat is a very primitive form of consciousness. However, the authors do outline why a robotic observer wouldn’t end the controversy. I found “Quantum Enigma” to be readable despite the challenging subject being explained. The authors to a good job of both describing the relevant phenomenon in terms the average person could understand (Ch.2 though which doesn’t reflect reality) before going on to explain the experiments in which the phenomena is actually observed (i.e. Ch. 7.) The authors use simple line drawings as graphics as necessary as well as staged dialogues to help make the concept clear by anticipating objections and dealing with them as they come. I’d recommend the book for those interested in the unresolved questions of science with respect to Quantum Mechanics. In particular, there is the issue of consciousness—though it might not seem as central to the book’s discussion as the subtitle would lead one to believe. The last few chapters do deal in consciousness, though in a way that creates more questions than they answer. (It often feels like another summation of the strangeness of quantum mechanics, but that may be because the issues regarding consciousness remain so unclear. Furthermore, a lot of background is necessary to make sense of these complicated issues.) "
177,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8586468-liesel-hill,5,"So I don't usually do reviews on Mondays, but last week I was literally reading seven books at once. Deep breaths, Everyone. It's really okay! I didn't finish them all, but I finished four of the seven, which leaves me three (plus one new one) to finish this week. Because of that, I'll have quite a few books to review over the next week or two.Quantum Enigma by Bruce Rosenblum, unlike most that I review, is not a fiction book. It's a non-fiction book that deals with physics principles. Now, before everyone roles their eyes and click away from my page (Hey! That means you! Get back here!) please hear me out. Back when I was still taking science classes in college and totally hated my life, the thing I did like about the classes was contemplating where the physical aspects of science met the non-physical. The non-physical often meant religious for me, but there is also the consciousness. In fact, that's how I became interested in the brain. There's so much we don't know about the physical brain. We're learning new things every day as our technology sprints toward the Star-Trekkian age, but neurosurgeons will tell you that most things that work in brain surgery are donebecause they've been proven to work, but no one knows exactly why they work. We simply don't have the technology to measure the workings of the brain on a small enough level.Quantum Enigma was written by what might have twenty years ago been considered ""fringe"" physicists who are interested in where the conscious mind meets the physical reality. The quantum enigma is getting much more attention today as new things are discovered. If you ever learn about quantum mechanics (not something I'd advise in the classroom as you'd suddenly find yourself drowning in mathematical equations) you learn that, as your headache grows and your understanding flounders, you also run into a fundamental enigma in the universe.Quantum physics is based on several basic principles, including but not limited to the facts that 1) energy can exist as both waves and particles (opposite and contradictory properties) 2) that observation by intelligent beings (i.e. humans) can create the concrete properties of energy (dah!), and 3) that the physics of the unseen world are completely different than those of the seen world.Basically, Rosenblum and his co-author take very complex concepts that something like a percentage of one percent of the population understand, and explains them in (sort of) layman's terms. This is exactly the kind of thing that fascinates me so I was happy to find a book that explained it in everyday English. That said, it was still difficult to get through. I had to stop every couple of paragraphs and re-explain what I'd just read to myself to make sure I got it. I could only read a chapter a day (at most) and then had to give my brain a rest.Overall, I really liked the book. I wanted to finish it before I moved forward with my Interchron series, which is loosely based on physics concepts of this nature. I knew it would help me piece my story together in a more concrete way.So, if you're into physics, creepy and abstract science, or just sci-fi in general (or if you want to have some background for where I'm going with my series--hey, it could happen!) this is the book for you! :D Just know that you're in for brain-bender. Happy Monday!"
178,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,4," We all understand classical (Newtonian) physics pretty well; it seems intuitive. If we push something, it moves. Hot things get colder. High things fall down. Einsteinian physics (relativity) is not really intuitive at all. The speed of light is constant no matter how fast one is going. Matter can be converted into energy, and vice versa. Fast-moving clocks run slower. Fortunately, we don't much have to think about things in a relativistic way. Unless we're scientists we don't have to think about quantum mechanics at all, but we should. The implications of quantum mechanics go far beyond those of relativity. The theory of quantum mechanics is far and away the most successful scientific theory ever developed; its predictions have never been proved wrong. It tells us that in the world of the very small (electrons, photons, atoms, etc.) strange things happen. Things can be both a particle and a wave. Objects can be in two places at the same time. One particle can communicate instantaneously with another particle no matter how far apart they are (faster than light)! Experiments have shown all this and more to be true. This book provides a clear and understandable introduction to the quantum world. It also describes the deepest, most bizarre aspect of the quantum world. A photon is simultaneously both a particle and a wave UNTIL SOMEONE LOOKS AT IT. It then becomes either a particle, behaving as one would expect a particle to behave, or it becomes a wave, exhibiting normal wave behavior. The observer forces the photon to take on one set of characteristics or the other. In a sense, nothing is fixed in the quantum world until an observer intervenes. You might ask why this should make any difference to us if quantum mechanics only applies to very small things. There are at least two reasons, and perhaps a third. First, modern technology uses quantum effects to achieve real results. Lasers and transistors(and the devices that rely on them, like computers) are just two of the things that could not exist without the application of quantum-mechanical principles. Second, quantum effects do not seem to necessarily be limited to very small things; objects as large as organic molecules and viruses have been shown to exhibit quantum behavior, and since everything, no matter how large, is made of the very small, it may just be a technological limitation that currently prevents us from seeing quantum behavior in, say, a Honda Civic.  There are parts of this book that need to be taken slowly, and sometimes reread a time or two, but the effort will be rewarded. Physicists have traditionally been reluctant to accept the implications of quantum mechanics, which seem to say that perhaps nothing is real until it is observed. Lay readers, who are not so heavily invested in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (described well in the book) may possibly be more willing to embrace one of the ten or more explanations of the theory that are herein described. (Or maybe not - we are venturing into very strange waters here.) Nevertheless, the authors point out that quantum mechanics should not lead anyone to some of the conclusions reached by people in the film What the #&%(# Do We Know. I found this to be a fascinating read."
179,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,5,"Rosenblum and Kuttner do a good job of calling attention to a remarkable problem at the heart of modern physics. Traditionally, science has worked within a realist perspective, assuming that the objects of our experience exist independently of our experience of them. Since our experience is all we know, we don't really know of any objects existing apart from subjects, and the idealist tradition in philosophy has placed subjectivity at the heart of reality. But science has considered it more objective to regard subjects as marginal to reality, perhaps because objects do exist independently of any particular subject, such as myself! So as they explored smaller and smaller realms of reality, physicists expected to find little particles of matter whose definite properties didn't depend on their being observed. Instead, they found wave functions describing only possibilities whose actualization seems to depend on observation. In the words of John Wheeler, ""No microscopic property is a property until it is an observed property."" This reopens the question of whether a real world exists independently of observation. The book is strongest when it is telling the story of how quantum physics came to be and describing the scientific and philosophical dilemmas it has created. I found it less exciting when it got to the question of interpretation beginning in Chapter 14. As other reviewers have noted, the authors give rather short shrift to some of the more popular interpretations, such as consistent histories and many worlds, probably because they feel that these approaches are still trying to minimize subjectivity and avoid confronting the real issue of consciousness. Here I wish they had provided a more thorough discussion and critique. I was also a little disappointed in the chapters on consciousness because they seemed to have only human consciousness in mind. But higher animals like ourselves appear too late in the evolutionary story to take too much credit for actualizing the possibilities of the universe! If physics is to confront consciousness in a serious way, it must confront the idealist philosophies that place the subject-object relationship at the heart of all reality, not just humanly experienced reality (but preferably without falling into a dualistic conception of subject as immaterial or supernatural being). In other words, the concept of consciousness must be thoroughly analyzed and perhaps singificantly broadened. Maybe whenever little things interact to form larger things, some form of ""measurement"" or ""observation"" is occurring to actualize posibilities. As John Bell asked, ""Are we not obliged to admit that more or less 'measurement-like' processes are going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere?"" I gave the book five stars, despite my reservations, because it is an important step toward getting people to address the philosophical questions raised by quantum mechanics. The alternative is to wall off post-classical physics in some isolated compartment of our brains, so it won't disturb our classical worldview."

182,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10746832-wesley-fox,2,"The book sets out to explain quantum mechanics to the layperson in non-technical language, and to give an overview of the academic origin of the theory. It also offers up the limits of the theory and no one is able to explain the ""why"" it works. A noble goal for a book and an important area of science as it is part of the basis of a huge part of our economy. Unfortunately, I think this book really doesn't set itself apart from Quantum Physics for Dummies. It is also not as enjoyable as the ""for Dummies"" titles.The book was difficult to finish. I ended up skimming a third of the book in total and it seems the authors expected some of that to take place. They even suggest readers skim certain sections. Why any author would want readers to merely skim there work is a mystery to me. Anyway, what made it difficult to read was the painful repetition of the same points over and over and over. The authors also tend to treat their readers like idiots at times, with painfully moronic anecdotes.Also, getting into the background stories of the physicists, (i.e. controversies in their academic careers, personal rivalries) is incompatible with writing a text for laypersons. Non-scientists like me do not care about the dramas of professional rivalries, academic accolades, and private accounts of physicist personalities. Numerous science books I have read are guilty of getting into this uninteresting topic. If I were in this field, I certainly would be interested, but I am not.Finally, I was disappointed that the authors constantly mentioned consciousness and the philosophical ramifications of quantum mechanics but made no real attempt to actually discuss it. It was all Wikipedia-style summaries, nothing more.I would think Quantum Mechanics for Dummies is a better choice if you want a basic introductory text on the subject. This one is too long, repetitive, and tends to insult intelligence of the reader."

It goes through the history of the founders of quantum theory and details the founders' own difficulty wrestling with the subject. It stays extremely close to the straight-and-narrow of physics except for possibly the last chapter, which gets the teensiest bit speculative.If you wanted a speculative book about how quantum physics is complementary to Buddhist thought, this is probably not the read for you! If you have trouble grasping what quantum physics is and why it's such a big (and weird) discovery, then give this book a try- ESPECIALLY if you lean toward the skeptical side. The authors are not trying to do anything but educate so that, by the end of the book, readers have something endlessly fascinating and vastly significant to the nature of our existence to ponder."

Following my theme of physics and the quantum enigma, this book builds upon my understanding of the last book I read. Although it can be said the language did not flow as well, and some explanations can be a bit clumsy, I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It talks about the evolution of quantum theory and how the idea has evolved, showcasing thought experiments in the process with useful diagrams that accompany the explanation. I found some of these explanations a bit hard to follow, but I think that’s rather my limited understanding and ignorance concerning this field of science rather than the fault or the author. At the end chapter is where it really picks up for me, discussing the implications of consciousness and philosophy, and how things are merely observed into existence. Something that has definitely influenced me to research more into this topic. What is also wonderful is that there is a small section of recommended reading at the end, I always love it when authors include such a section, helps keep the flow of ideas fresh for me. All in all, a fantastic, quite heavy and fascinating book to read! "

186,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595687-jenny,4,"What I like about this text is the repetitiveness. QM is a very difficult subject to grasp, and the authors offer many examples of how QM works. If you dont understand the first few examples, (or are new to physics) just keep reading. The tone is set in an understandable way, that the theories presented here may click right away for some folks. Those who don't understand immediately are given many chances to experience that ""aha!"" moment. And once you have that clarity, re-read the earlier sections to fully grasp it. There is one or two math equations offered, as the authors do their best to describe QM to the layman using diagrams and repetition in an effective way. As someone who took college physics and was only given an overview of QM at the time, I found the examples annoying at first, but as the author goes deeper into mechanics of quantum science, I was happy to re-read and process the challenging information.

It is not exactly an easy book to be read, I don't recommend you to read it while you are tired or sleepy, and do not read too many chapters in a row, it's better to take some breath to process the information.

206,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Consciousness remains a great mystery. While it has increasingly begun to look like consciousness is an output part of the brain, intriguing questions remain unanswered, and some of these unknowns are hard to reconcile with a materialist model (materialism says all phenomena are born out of matter.) It isn’t just pseudo-scientists and cranks that have a problem with the materialist approach. Major names in physics have pointed out that everything is not accounted for by a model that imagines consciousness as the computational product of the brain. Rosenblum and Kuttner address one such hiccup, the so-called Quantum Enigma that lends its name to the book. In brief, the quantum enigma reflects the fact that physical reality is created by observation. This may seem hard to believe, because it’s only been observed at the levels of the really small—i.e. primarily the atomic and subatomic, though the authors propose that there is theoretically nothing to limit the phenomenon to that level and experiments are being conducted at molecular level. Rosenblum and Kuttner remind us that while the quantum world behaves oddly, quantum theory is exceptionally successful in scientific terms. Meaning that it has been validated by every single experimental inquiry, and the knowledge gained from quantum mechanics has made possible many of the advanced technologies that shape our world (laser, transistor, CCD, and MRI.) The oddness of Quantum Mechanics can be seen in several issues. One is the two-slit experiment in which atoms and photons behave like either a particle or a wave. Another is quantum entanglement, in which two atoms that have interacted become “wired” together such that changes in one are instantaneously reflected in the other—even if they have been separated by great distances. The book is a bit repetitive, but perhaps this is necessary. People seem to have trouble grasping the nuances of the arguments being made, and this can lead to some wrong conclusions. For example, some people have leapt to the conclusion that ESP is supported by quantum entanglement, but the evidence doesn’t support the idea that one’s thoughts can control anything. Observation causes some physical reality to coalesce, but one has no influence over what reality displays itself. (In other words, with observation the wave form collapses and some state of being comes into existence from what was a field of probabilities.) Randomness remains. Physicists tell us that this is the problem with the idea of using quantum entanglement for instantaneous communications across light-years of space. A further example of a nuance that is hard to grasp is the notion that quantum probability doesn’t describe the likelihood an atom is a certain place, but rather it describes the likelihood you’ll find it there (and that that is a distinction with a difference.) One may be wondering how consciousness is central the issue. If a non-intelligent entity observed, would the wave forms collapse? Consciousness doesn’t necessarily equate to intelligence as we know it. Consciousness can be thought of as merely the ability to observe and recognize significance in what is observed. So a thermostat is a very primitive form of consciousness. However, the authors do outline why a robotic observer wouldn’t end the controversy. I found “Quantum Enigma” to be readable despite the challenging subject being explained. The authors to a good job of both describing the relevant phenomenon in terms the average person could understand (Ch.2 though which doesn’t reflect reality) before going on to explain the experiments in which the phenomena is actually observed (i.e. Ch. 7.) The authors use simple line drawings as graphics as necessary as well as staged dialogues to help make the concept clear by anticipating objections and dealing with them as they come. I’d recommend the book for those interested in the unresolved questions of science with respect to Quantum Mechanics. In particular, there is the issue of consciousness—though it might not seem as central to the book’s discussion as the subtitle would lead one to believe. The last few chapters do deal in consciousness, though in a way that creates more questions than they answer. (It often feels like another summation of the strangeness of quantum mechanics, but that may be because the issues regarding consciousness remain so unclear. Furthermore, a lot of background is necessary to make sense of these complicated issues.) "
207,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8586468-liesel-hill,5,"So I don't usually do reviews on Mondays, but last week I was literally reading seven books at once. Deep breaths, Everyone. It's really okay! I didn't finish them all, but I finished four of the seven, which leaves me three (plus one new one) to finish this week. Because of that, I'll have quite a few books to review over the next week or two.Quantum Enigma by Bruce Rosenblum, unlike most that I review, is not a fiction book. It's a non-fiction book that deals with physics principles. Now, before everyone roles their eyes and click away from my page (Hey! That means you! Get back here!) please hear me out. Back when I was still taking science classes in college and totally hated my life, the thing I did like about the classes was contemplating where the physical aspects of science met the non-physical. The non-physical often meant religious for me, but there is also the consciousness. In fact, that's how I became interested in the brain. There's so much we don't know about the physical brain. We're learning new things every day as our technology sprints toward the Star-Trekkian age, but neurosurgeons will tell you that most things that work in brain surgery are donebecause they've been proven to work, but no one knows exactly why they work. We simply don't have the technology to measure the workings of the brain on a small enough level.Quantum Enigma was written by what might have twenty years ago been considered ""fringe"" physicists who are interested in where the conscious mind meets the physical reality. The quantum enigma is getting much more attention today as new things are discovered. If you ever learn about quantum mechanics (not something I'd advise in the classroom as you'd suddenly find yourself drowning in mathematical equations) you learn that, as your headache grows and your understanding flounders, you also run into a fundamental enigma in the universe.Quantum physics is based on several basic principles, including but not limited to the facts that 1) energy can exist as both waves and particles (opposite and contradictory properties) 2) that observation by intelligent beings (i.e. humans) can create the concrete properties of energy (dah!), and 3) that the physics of the unseen world are completely different than those of the seen world.Basically, Rosenblum and his co-author take very complex concepts that something like a percentage of one percent of the population understand, and explains them in (sort of) layman's terms. This is exactly the kind of thing that fascinates me so I was happy to find a book that explained it in everyday English. That said, it was still difficult to get through. I had to stop every couple of paragraphs and re-explain what I'd just read to myself to make sure I got it. I could only read a chapter a day (at most) and then had to give my brain a rest.Overall, I really liked the book. I wanted to finish it before I moved forward with my Interchron series, which is loosely based on physics concepts of this nature. I knew it would help me piece my story together in a more concrete way.So, if you're into physics, creepy and abstract science, or just sci-fi in general (or if you want to have some background for where I'm going with my series--hey, it could happen!) this is the book for you! :D Just know that you're in for brain-bender. Happy Monday!"
208,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,4," We all understand classical (Newtonian) physics pretty well; it seems intuitive. If we push something, it moves. Hot things get colder. High things fall down. Einsteinian physics (relativity) is not really intuitive at all. The speed of light is constant no matter how fast one is going. Matter can be converted into energy, and vice versa. Fast-moving clocks run slower. Fortunately, we don't much have to think about things in a relativistic way. Unless we're scientists we don't have to think about quantum mechanics at all, but we should. The implications of quantum mechanics go far beyond those of relativity. The theory of quantum mechanics is far and away the most successful scientific theory ever developed; its predictions have never been proved wrong. It tells us that in the world of the very small (electrons, photons, atoms, etc.) strange things happen. Things can be both a particle and a wave. Objects can be in two places at the same time. One particle can communicate instantaneously with another particle no matter how far apart they are (faster than light)! Experiments have shown all this and more to be true. This book provides a clear and understandable introduction to the quantum world. It also describes the deepest, most bizarre aspect of the quantum world. A photon is simultaneously both a particle and a wave UNTIL SOMEONE LOOKS AT IT. It then becomes either a particle, behaving as one would expect a particle to behave, or it becomes a wave, exhibiting normal wave behavior. The observer forces the photon to take on one set of characteristics or the other. In a sense, nothing is fixed in the quantum world until an observer intervenes. You might ask why this should make any difference to us if quantum mechanics only applies to very small things. There are at least two reasons, and perhaps a third. First, modern technology uses quantum effects to achieve real results. Lasers and transistors(and the devices that rely on them, like computers) are just two of the things that could not exist without the application of quantum-mechanical principles. Second, quantum effects do not seem to necessarily be limited to very small things; objects as large as organic molecules and viruses have been shown to exhibit quantum behavior, and since everything, no matter how large, is made of the very small, it may just be a technological limitation that currently prevents us from seeing quantum behavior in, say, a Honda Civic.  There are parts of this book that need to be taken slowly, and sometimes reread a time or two, but the effort will be rewarded. Physicists have traditionally been reluctant to accept the implications of quantum mechanics, which seem to say that perhaps nothing is real until it is observed. Lay readers, who are not so heavily invested in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (described well in the book) may possibly be more willing to embrace one of the ten or more explanations of the theory that are herein described. (Or maybe not - we are venturing into very strange waters here.) Nevertheless, the authors point out that quantum mechanics should not lead anyone to some of the conclusions reached by people in the film What the #&%(# Do We Know. I found this to be a fascinating read."
209,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,5,"Rosenblum and Kuttner do a good job of calling attention to a remarkable problem at the heart of modern physics. Traditionally, science has worked within a realist perspective, assuming that the objects of our experience exist independently of our experience of them. Since our experience is all we know, we don't really know of any objects existing apart from subjects, and the idealist tradition in philosophy has placed subjectivity at the heart of reality. But science has considered it more objective to regard subjects as marginal to reality, perhaps because objects do exist independently of any particular subject, such as myself! So as they explored smaller and smaller realms of reality, physicists expected to find little particles of matter whose definite properties didn't depend on their being observed. Instead, they found wave functions describing only possibilities whose actualization seems to depend on observation. In the words of John Wheeler, ""No microscopic property is a property until it is an observed property."" This reopens the question of whether a real world exists independently of observation. The book is strongest when it is telling the story of how quantum physics came to be and describing the scientific and philosophical dilemmas it has created. I found it less exciting when it got to the question of interpretation beginning in Chapter 14. As other reviewers have noted, the authors give rather short shrift to some of the more popular interpretations, such as consistent histories and many worlds, probably because they feel that these approaches are still trying to minimize subjectivity and avoid confronting the real issue of consciousness. Here I wish they had provided a more thorough discussion and critique. I was also a little disappointed in the chapters on consciousness because they seemed to have only human consciousness in mind. But higher animals like ourselves appear too late in the evolutionary story to take too much credit for actualizing the possibilities of the universe! If physics is to confront consciousness in a serious way, it must confront the idealist philosophies that place the subject-object relationship at the heart of all reality, not just humanly experienced reality (but preferably without falling into a dualistic conception of subject as immaterial or supernatural being). In other words, the concept of consciousness must be thoroughly analyzed and perhaps singificantly broadened. Maybe whenever little things interact to form larger things, some form of ""measurement"" or ""observation"" is occurring to actualize posibilities. As John Bell asked, ""Are we not obliged to admit that more or less 'measurement-like' processes are going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere?"" I gave the book five stars, despite my reservations, because it is an important step toward getting people to address the philosophical questions raised by quantum mechanics. The alternative is to wall off post-classical physics in some isolated compartment of our brains, so it won't disturb our classical worldview."

211,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532635-chris-kemp,3,Mind boggling stuff. I thought it could have been presented a little better.
212,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10746832-wesley-fox,2,"The book sets out to explain quantum mechanics to the layperson in non-technical language, and to give an overview of the academic origin of the theory. It also offers up the limits of the theory and no one is able to explain the ""why"" it works. A noble goal for a book and an important area of science as it is part of the basis of a huge part of our economy. Unfortunately, I think this book really doesn't set itself apart from Quantum Physics for Dummies. It is also not as enjoyable as the ""for Dummies"" titles.The book was difficult to finish. I ended up skimming a third of the book in total and it seems the authors expected some of that to take place. They even suggest readers skim certain sections. Why any author would want readers to merely skim there work is a mystery to me. Anyway, what made it difficult to read was the painful repetition of the same points over and over and over. The authors also tend to treat their readers like idiots at times, with painfully moronic anecdotes.Also, getting into the background stories of the physicists, (i.e. controversies in their academic careers, personal rivalries) is incompatible with writing a text for laypersons. Non-scientists like me do not care about the dramas of professional rivalries, academic accolades, and private accounts of physicist personalities. Numerous science books I have read are guilty of getting into this uninteresting topic. If I were in this field, I certainly would be interested, but I am not.Finally, I was disappointed that the authors constantly mentioned consciousness and the philosophical ramifications of quantum mechanics but made no real attempt to actually discuss it. It was all Wikipedia-style summaries, nothing more.I would think Quantum Mechanics for Dummies is a better choice if you want a basic introductory text on the subject. This one is too long, repetitive, and tends to insult intelligence of the reader."

A black hole of stars (which apparently does not lead to another universe but expels all the stars' information back into our universe through radiation according to Stephen Hawking, that ol' curmudgeon)!Others have commented that the book doesn't delve deep enough into actual philosophical theories about what quantum physics might be revealing to us about consciousness- but, all due respect, that is clearly not the point of this book.This book explains clearly and simply what the quantum enigma is and how physics has revealed that reality and observation are inextricably linked. It goes through the history of the founders of quantum theory and details the founders' own difficulty wrestling with the subject. It stays extremely close to the straight-and-narrow of physics except for possibly the last chapter, which gets the teensiest bit speculative.If you wanted a speculative book about how quantum physics is complementary to Buddhist thought, this is probably not the read for you! If you have trouble grasping what quantum physics is and why it's such a big (and weird) discovery, then give this book a try- ESPECIALLY if you lean toward the skeptical side. The authors are not trying to do anything but educate so that, by the end of the book, readers have something endlessly fascinating and vastly significant to the nature of our existence to ponder."

Following my theme of physics and the quantum enigma, this book builds upon my understanding of the last book I read. Although it can be said the language did not flow as well, and some explanations can be a bit clumsy, I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It talks about the evolution of quantum theory and how the idea has evolved, showcasing thought experiments in the process with useful diagrams that accompany the explanation. I found some of these explanations a bit hard to follow, but I think that’s rather my limited understanding and ignorance concerning this field of science rather than the fault or the author. At the end chapter is where it really picks up for me, discussing the implications of consciousness and philosophy, and how things are merely observed into existence. Something that has definitely influenced me to research more into this topic. What is also wonderful is that there is a small section of recommended reading at the end, I always love it when authors include such a section, helps keep the flow of ideas fresh for me. All in all, a fantastic, quite heavy and fascinating book to read! "

EPR is to debated Bohr, John Bell's theorem turned out to prove that Bohr was right! Spooky action at a distance. Means entanglement does exist. Why the entanglement is so meaningful and important, and most of people dislike this idea: We have no free will. What will happen has been decided since the whole universe was entangled!! (WOW)This could go to the ""Superdeterminism"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superde...The explanation in the book with the experiments were actually beyond my knowledge but i try to capture the meaning. Last part of book was talking about consciousness. Most of us feel hard to believe that our consciousness is simple the series of chemical neuro-reaction. i am ok with that but I am also curious about how it works and why we behave this or that way. That is why the whole packages of knowledge are inseparable, i am here to learn as much as I could. "
216,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595687-jenny,4,"What I like about this text is the repetitiveness. QM is a very difficult subject to grasp, and the authors offer many examples of how QM works. If you dont understand the first few examples, (or are new to physics) just keep reading. The tone is set in an understandable way, that the theories presented here may click right away for some folks. Those who don't understand immediately are given many chances to experience that ""aha!"" moment. And once you have that clarity, re-read the earlier sections to fully grasp it. There is one or two math equations offered, as the authors do their best to describe QM to the layman using diagrams and repetition in an effective way. As someone who took college physics and was only given an overview of QM at the time, I found the examples annoying at first, but as the author goes deeper into mechanics of quantum science, I was happy to re-read and process the challenging information.

The reader must have some knowledge in physics, if you don't you may feel completely confused and consequently frustrated. It is not exactly an easy book to be read, I don't recommend you to read it while you are tired or sleepy, and do not read too many chapters in a row, it's better to take some breath to process the information.

Rosenblum and Kuttner remind us that while the quantum world behaves oddly, quantum theory is exceptionally successful in scientific terms. Meaning that it has been validated by every single experimental inquiry, and the knowledge gained from quantum mechanics has made possible many of the advanced technologies that shape our world (laser, transistor, CCD, and MRI.) The oddness of Quantum Mechanics can be seen in several issues. One is the two-slit experiment in which atoms and photons behave like either a particle or a wave. Another is quantum entanglement, in which two atoms that have interacted become “wired” together such that changes in one are instantaneously reflected in the other—even if they have been separated by great distances. The book is a bit repetitive, but perhaps this is necessary. People seem to have trouble grasping the nuances of the arguments being made, and this can lead to some wrong conclusions. For example, some people have leapt to the conclusion that ESP is supported by quantum entanglement, but the evidence doesn’t support the idea that one’s thoughts can control anything. Observation causes some physical reality to coalesce, but one has no influence over what reality displays itself. (In other words, with observation the wave form collapses and some state of being comes into existence from what was a field of probabilities.) Randomness remains. Physicists tell us that this is the problem with the idea of using quantum entanglement for instantaneous communications across light-years of space. A further example of a nuance that is hard to grasp is the notion that quantum probability doesn’t describe the likelihood an atom is a certain place, but rather it describes the likelihood you’ll find it there (and that that is a distinction with a difference.) One may be wondering how consciousness is central the issue. If a non-intelligent entity observed, would the wave forms collapse? Consciousness doesn’t necessarily equate to intelligence as we know it. Consciousness can be thought of as merely the ability to observe and recognize significance in what is observed. So a thermostat is a very primitive form of consciousness. However, the authors do outline why a robotic observer wouldn’t end the controversy. I found “Quantum Enigma” to be readable despite the challenging subject being explained. The authors to a good job of both describing the relevant phenomenon in terms the average person could understand (Ch.2 though which doesn’t reflect reality) before going on to explain the experiments in which the phenomena is actually observed (i.e. Ch. 7.) The authors use simple line drawings as graphics as necessary as well as staged dialogues to help make the concept clear by anticipating objections and dealing with them as they come. I’d recommend the book for those interested in the unresolved questions of science with respect to Quantum Mechanics. In particular, there is the issue of consciousness—though it might not seem as central to the book’s discussion as the subtitle would lead one to believe. The last few chapters do deal in consciousness, though in a way that creates more questions than they answer. (It often feels like another summation of the strangeness of quantum mechanics, but that may be because the issues regarding consciousness remain so unclear. Furthermore, a lot of background is necessary to make sense of these complicated issues.) "
237,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8586468-liesel-hill,5,"So I don't usually do reviews on Mondays, but last week I was literally reading seven books at once. Deep breaths, Everyone. It's really okay! I didn't finish them all, but I finished four of the seven, which leaves me three (plus one new one) to finish this week. Because of that, I'll have quite a few books to review over the next week or two.Quantum Enigma by Bruce Rosenblum, unlike most that I review, is not a fiction book. It's a non-fiction book that deals with physics principles. Now, before everyone roles their eyes and click away from my page (Hey! That means you! Get back here!) please hear me out. Back when I was still taking science classes in college and totally hated my life, the thing I did like about the classes was contemplating where the physical aspects of science met the non-physical. The non-physical often meant religious for me, but there is also the consciousness. In fact, that's how I became interested in the brain. There's so much we don't know about the physical brain. We're learning new things every day as our technology sprints toward the Star-Trekkian age, but neurosurgeons will tell you that most things that work in brain surgery are donebecause they've been proven to work, but no one knows exactly why they work. We simply don't have the technology to measure the workings of the brain on a small enough level.Quantum Enigma was written by what might have twenty years ago been considered ""fringe"" physicists who are interested in where the conscious mind meets the physical reality. The quantum enigma is getting much more attention today as new things are discovered. If you ever learn about quantum mechanics (not something I'd advise in the classroom as you'd suddenly find yourself drowning in mathematical equations) you learn that, as your headache grows and your understanding flounders, you also run into a fundamental enigma in the universe.Quantum physics is based on several basic principles, including but not limited to the facts that 1) energy can exist as both waves and particles (opposite and contradictory properties) 2) that observation by intelligent beings (i.e. humans) can create the concrete properties of energy (dah!), and 3) that the physics of the unseen world are completely different than those of the seen world.Basically, Rosenblum and his co-author take very complex concepts that something like a percentage of one percent of the population understand, and explains them in (sort of) layman's terms. This is exactly the kind of thing that fascinates me so I was happy to find a book that explained it in everyday English. That said, it was still difficult to get through. I had to stop every couple of paragraphs and re-explain what I'd just read to myself to make sure I got it. I could only read a chapter a day (at most) and then had to give my brain a rest.Overall, I really liked the book. I wanted to finish it before I moved forward with my Interchron series, which is loosely based on physics concepts of this nature. I knew it would help me piece my story together in a more concrete way.So, if you're into physics, creepy and abstract science, or just sci-fi in general (or if you want to have some background for where I'm going with my series--hey, it could happen!) this is the book for you! :D Just know that you're in for brain-bender. Happy Monday!"
238,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,4," We all understand classical (Newtonian) physics pretty well; it seems intuitive. If we push something, it moves. Hot things get colder. High things fall down. Einsteinian physics (relativity) is not really intuitive at all. The speed of light is constant no matter how fast one is going. Matter can be converted into energy, and vice versa. Fast-moving clocks run slower. Fortunately, we don't much have to think about things in a relativistic way. Unless we're scientists we don't have to think about quantum mechanics at all, but we should. The implications of quantum mechanics go far beyond those of relativity. The theory of quantum mechanics is far and away the most successful scientific theory ever developed; its predictions have never been proved wrong. It tells us that in the world of the very small (electrons, photons, atoms, etc.) strange things happen. Things can be both a particle and a wave. Objects can be in two places at the same time. One particle can communicate instantaneously with another particle no matter how far apart they are (faster than light)! Experiments have shown all this and more to be true. This book provides a clear and understandable introduction to the quantum world. It also describes the deepest, most bizarre aspect of the quantum world. A photon is simultaneously both a particle and a wave UNTIL SOMEONE LOOKS AT IT. It then becomes either a particle, behaving as one would expect a particle to behave, or it becomes a wave, exhibiting normal wave behavior. The observer forces the photon to take on one set of characteristics or the other. In a sense, nothing is fixed in the quantum world until an observer intervenes. You might ask why this should make any difference to us if quantum mechanics only applies to very small things. There are at least two reasons, and perhaps a third. First, modern technology uses quantum effects to achieve real results. Lasers and transistors(and the devices that rely on them, like computers) are just two of the things that could not exist without the application of quantum-mechanical principles. Second, quantum effects do not seem to necessarily be limited to very small things; objects as large as organic molecules and viruses have been shown to exhibit quantum behavior, and since everything, no matter how large, is made of the very small, it may just be a technological limitation that currently prevents us from seeing quantum behavior in, say, a Honda Civic.  There are parts of this book that need to be taken slowly, and sometimes reread a time or two, but the effort will be rewarded. Physicists have traditionally been reluctant to accept the implications of quantum mechanics, which seem to say that perhaps nothing is real until it is observed. Lay readers, who are not so heavily invested in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (described well in the book) may possibly be more willing to embrace one of the ten or more explanations of the theory that are herein described. (Or maybe not - we are venturing into very strange waters here.) Nevertheless, the authors point out that quantum mechanics should not lead anyone to some of the conclusions reached by people in the film What the #&%(# Do We Know. I found this to be a fascinating read."
239,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,5,"Rosenblum and Kuttner do a good job of calling attention to a remarkable problem at the heart of modern physics. Traditionally, science has worked within a realist perspective, assuming that the objects of our experience exist independently of our experience of them. Since our experience is all we know, we don't really know of any objects existing apart from subjects, and the idealist tradition in philosophy has placed subjectivity at the heart of reality. But science has considered it more objective to regard subjects as marginal to reality, perhaps because objects do exist independently of any particular subject, such as myself! So as they explored smaller and smaller realms of reality, physicists expected to find little particles of matter whose definite properties didn't depend on their being observed. Instead, they found wave functions describing only possibilities whose actualization seems to depend on observation. In the words of John Wheeler, ""No microscopic property is a property until it is an observed property."" This reopens the question of whether a real world exists independently of observation. The book is strongest when it is telling the story of how quantum physics came to be and describing the scientific and philosophical dilemmas it has created. I found it less exciting when it got to the question of interpretation beginning in Chapter 14. As other reviewers have noted, the authors give rather short shrift to some of the more popular interpretations, such as consistent histories and many worlds, probably because they feel that these approaches are still trying to minimize subjectivity and avoid confronting the real issue of consciousness. Here I wish they had provided a more thorough discussion and critique. I was also a little disappointed in the chapters on consciousness because they seemed to have only human consciousness in mind. But higher animals like ourselves appear too late in the evolutionary story to take too much credit for actualizing the possibilities of the universe! If physics is to confront consciousness in a serious way, it must confront the idealist philosophies that place the subject-object relationship at the heart of all reality, not just humanly experienced reality (but preferably without falling into a dualistic conception of subject as immaterial or supernatural being). In other words, the concept of consciousness must be thoroughly analyzed and perhaps singificantly broadened. Maybe whenever little things interact to form larger things, some form of ""measurement"" or ""observation"" is occurring to actualize posibilities. As John Bell asked, ""Are we not obliged to admit that more or less 'measurement-like' processes are going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere?"" I gave the book five stars, despite my reservations, because it is an important step toward getting people to address the philosophical questions raised by quantum mechanics. The alternative is to wall off post-classical physics in some isolated compartment of our brains, so it won't disturb our classical worldview."

241,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532635-chris-kemp,3,Mind boggling stuff. I thought it could have been presented a little better.
242,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10746832-wesley-fox,2,"The book sets out to explain quantum mechanics to the layperson in non-technical language, and to give an overview of the academic origin of the theory. It also offers up the limits of the theory and no one is able to explain the ""why"" it works. A noble goal for a book and an important area of science as it is part of the basis of a huge part of our economy. Unfortunately, I think this book really doesn't set itself apart from Quantum Physics for Dummies. It is also not as enjoyable as the ""for Dummies"" titles.The book was difficult to finish. I ended up skimming a third of the book in total and it seems the authors expected some of that to take place. They even suggest readers skim certain sections. Why any author would want readers to merely skim there work is a mystery to me. Anyway, what made it difficult to read was the painful repetition of the same points over and over and over. The authors also tend to treat their readers like idiots at times, with painfully moronic anecdotes.Also, getting into the background stories of the physicists, (i.e. controversies in their academic careers, personal rivalries) is incompatible with writing a text for laypersons. Non-scientists like me do not care about the dramas of professional rivalries, academic accolades, and private accounts of physicist personalities. Numerous science books I have read are guilty of getting into this uninteresting topic. If I were in this field, I certainly would be interested, but I am not.Finally, I was disappointed that the authors constantly mentioned consciousness and the philosophical ramifications of quantum mechanics but made no real attempt to actually discuss it. It was all Wikipedia-style summaries, nothing more.I would think Quantum Mechanics for Dummies is a better choice if you want a basic introductory text on the subject. This one is too long, repetitive, and tends to insult intelligence of the reader."
243,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74253693-christa-m,5,"Five stars! Ten stars! Twenty billion stars! A black hole of stars (which apparently does not lead to another universe but expels all the stars' information back into our universe through radiation according to Stephen Hawking, that ol' curmudgeon)!Others have commented that the book doesn't delve deep enough into actual philosophical theories about what quantum physics might be revealing to us about consciousness- but, all due respect, that is clearly not the point of this book.This book explains clearly and simply what the quantum enigma is and how physics has revealed that reality and observation are inextricably linked. It goes through the history of the founders of quantum theory and details the founders' own difficulty wrestling with the subject. It stays extremely close to the straight-and-narrow of physics except for possibly the last chapter, which gets the teensiest bit speculative.If you wanted a speculative book about how quantum physics is complementary to Buddhist thought, this is probably not the read for you! If you have trouble grasping what quantum physics is and why it's such a big (and weird) discovery, then give this book a try- ESPECIALLY if you lean toward the skeptical side. The authors are not trying to do anything but educate so that, by the end of the book, readers have something endlessly fascinating and vastly significant to the nature of our existence to ponder."
244,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50360024-jonathan,4,"I don’t even know where to begin with this book. Following my theme of physics and the quantum enigma, this book builds upon my understanding of the last book I read. Although it can be said the language did not flow as well, and some explanations can be a bit clumsy, I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It talks about the evolution of quantum theory and how the idea has evolved, showcasing thought experiments in the process with useful diagrams that accompany the explanation. I found some of these explanations a bit hard to follow, but I think that’s rather my limited understanding and ignorance concerning this field of science rather than the fault or the author. At the end chapter is where it really picks up for me, discussing the implications of consciousness and philosophy, and how things are merely observed into existence. Something that has definitely influenced me to research more into this topic. What is also wonderful is that there is a small section of recommended reading at the end, I always love it when authors include such a section, helps keep the flow of ideas fresh for me. All in all, a fantastic, quite heavy and fascinating book to read! "
245,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,5,"I enjoyed fully this book, it explained quantum physics in a very understandable way that i get to know even more until I hit EPR and Bell's theorem. EPR is to debated Bohr, John Bell's theorem turned out to prove that Bohr was right! Spooky action at a distance. Means entanglement does exist. Why the entanglement is so meaningful and important, and most of people dislike this idea: We have no free will. What will happen has been decided since the whole universe was entangled!! (WOW)This could go to the ""Superdeterminism"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superde...The explanation in the book with the experiments were actually beyond my knowledge but i try to capture the meaning. Last part of book was talking about consciousness. Most of us feel hard to believe that our consciousness is simple the series of chemical neuro-reaction. i am ok with that but I am also curious about how it works and why we behave this or that way. That is why the whole packages of knowledge are inseparable, i am here to learn as much as I could. "
246,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595687-jenny,4,"What I like about this text is the repetitiveness. QM is a very difficult subject to grasp, and the authors offer many examples of how QM works. If you dont understand the first few examples, (or are new to physics) just keep reading. The tone is set in an understandable way, that the theories presented here may click right away for some folks. Those who don't understand immediately are given many chances to experience that ""aha!"" moment. And once you have that clarity, re-read the earlier sections to fully grasp it. There is one or two math equations offered, as the authors do their best to describe QM to the layman using diagrams and repetition in an effective way. As someone who took college physics and was only given an overview of QM at the time, I found the examples annoying at first, but as the author goes deeper into mechanics of quantum science, I was happy to re-read and process the challenging information.

Very well-separated chapters, containing historical facts, important physical and mathematical fundamentals, practical analogies, physical experiments, current theories, etc. I particulaly liked the way they relate the enigma with psychology and even a few of philosophy. The reader must have some knowledge in physics, if you don't you may feel completely confused and consequently frustrated. It is not exactly an easy book to be read, I don't recommend you to read it while you are tired or sleepy, and do not read too many chapters in a row, it's better to take some breath to process the information. One last advise: try not to freak out during your reading, the quantum enigma even disturbed Albert Einstein. Your perception of time and space will never be the same again."

It is the type of book that you have to stop, frequently, to think about what you just have read, in order to understand and assimilate the material. This book covers from quantum physics to consciousness with the least technical jargon and without stepping into the philosophical point of view. It is a scientific book for all us, the non-scientists community (or the Science Aficionados).

Some of the concepts in this book, which are inherent to the nature of quantum physics and our universe, are so incredible and amazing in regard to how one looks at life that I highly recommend this book to anyone who's even slightly interested.

While it has increasingly begun to look like consciousness is an output part of the brain, intriguing questions remain unanswered, and some of these unknowns are hard to reconcile with a materialist model (materialism says all phenomena are born out of matter.) It isn’t just pseudo-scientists and cranks that have a problem with the materialist approach. Major names in physics have pointed out that everything is not accounted for by a model that imagines consciousness as the computational product of the brain. Rosenblum and Kuttner address one such hiccup, the so-called Quantum Enigma that lends its name to the book. In brief, the quantum enigma reflects the fact that physical reality is created by observation. This may seem hard to believe, because it’s only been observed at the levels of the really small—i.e. primarily the atomic and subatomic, though the authors propose that there is theoretically nothing to limit the phenomenon to that level and experiments are being conducted at molecular level.

Back when I was still taking science classes in college and totally hated my life, the thing I did like about the classes was contemplating where the physical aspects of science met the non-physical. The non-physical often meant religious for me, but there is also the consciousness. In fact, that's how I became interested in the brain. There's so much we don't know about the physical brain. We're learning new things every day as our technology sprints toward the Star-Trekkian age, but neurosurgeons will tell you that most things that work in brain surgery are donebecause they've been proven to work, but no one knows exactly why they work. We simply don't have the technology to measure the workings of the brain on a small enough level.Quantum Enigma was written by what might have twenty years ago been considered ""fringe"" physicists who are interested in where the conscious mind meets the physical reality. The quantum enigma is getting much more attention today as new things are discovered. If you ever learn about quantum mechanics (not something I'd advise in the classroom as you'd suddenly find yourself drowning in mathematical equations) you learn that, as your headache grows and your understanding flounders, you also run into a fundamental enigma in the universe.Quantum physics is based on several basic principles, including but not limited to the facts that 1) energy can exist as both waves and particles (opposite and contradictory properties) 2) that observation by intelligent beings (i.e. humans) can create the concrete properties of energy (dah!), and 3) that the physics of the unseen world are completely different than those of the seen world.Basically, Rosenblum and his co-author take very complex concepts that something like a percentage of one percent of the population understand, and explains them in (sort of) layman's terms. This is exactly the kind of thing that fascinates me so I was happy to find a book that explained it in everyday English. That said, it was still difficult to get through. I had to stop every couple of paragraphs and re-explain what I'd just read to myself to make sure I got it. I could only read a chapter a day (at most) and then had to give my brain a rest.Overall, I really liked the book. I wanted to finish it before I moved forward with my Interchron series, which is loosely based on physics concepts of this nature. I knew it would help me piece my story together in a more concrete way.So, if you're into physics, creepy and abstract science, or just sci-fi in general (or if you want to have some background for where I'm going with my series--hey, it could happen!) this is the book for you! :D Just know that you're in for brain-bender. Happy Monday!"
268,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,4," We all understand classical (Newtonian) physics pretty well; it seems intuitive. If we push something, it moves. Hot things get colder. High things fall down. Einsteinian physics (relativity) is not really intuitive at all. The speed of light is constant no matter how fast one is going. Matter can be converted into energy, and vice versa. Fast-moving clocks run slower. Fortunately, we don't much have to think about things in a relativistic way. Unless we're scientists we don't have to think about quantum mechanics at all, but we should. The implications of quantum mechanics go far beyond those of relativity. The theory of quantum mechanics is far and away the most successful scientific theory ever developed; its predictions have never been proved wrong. It tells us that in the world of the very small (electrons, photons, atoms, etc.) strange things happen. Things can be both a particle and a wave. Objects can be in two places at the same time. One particle can communicate instantaneously with another particle no matter how far apart they are (faster than light)! Experiments have shown all this and more to be true. This book provides a clear and understandable introduction to the quantum world. It also describes the deepest, most bizarre aspect of the quantum world. A photon is simultaneously both a particle and a wave UNTIL SOMEONE LOOKS AT IT. It then becomes either a particle, behaving as one would expect a particle to behave, or it becomes a wave, exhibiting normal wave behavior. The observer forces the photon to take on one set of characteristics or the other. In a sense, nothing is fixed in the quantum world until an observer intervenes. You might ask why this should make any difference to us if quantum mechanics only applies to very small things. There are at least two reasons, and perhaps a third. First, modern technology uses quantum effects to achieve real results. Lasers and transistors(and the devices that rely on them, like computers) are just two of the things that could not exist without the application of quantum-mechanical principles. Second, quantum effects do not seem to necessarily be limited to very small things; objects as large as organic molecules and viruses have been shown to exhibit quantum behavior, and since everything, no matter how large, is made of the very small, it may just be a technological limitation that currently prevents us from seeing quantum behavior in, say, a Honda Civic.  There are parts of this book that need to be taken slowly, and sometimes reread a time or two, but the effort will be rewarded. Physicists have traditionally been reluctant to accept the implications of quantum mechanics, which seem to say that perhaps nothing is real until it is observed. Lay readers, who are not so heavily invested in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (described well in the book) may possibly be more willing to embrace one of the ten or more explanations of the theory that are herein described. (Or maybe not - we are venturing into very strange waters here.) Nevertheless, the authors point out that quantum mechanics should not lead anyone to some of the conclusions reached by people in the film What the #&%(# Do We Know. I found this to be a fascinating read."
269,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,5,"Rosenblum and Kuttner do a good job of calling attention to a remarkable problem at the heart of modern physics. Traditionally, science has worked within a realist perspective, assuming that the objects of our experience exist independently of our experience of them. Since our experience is all we know, we don't really know of any objects existing apart from subjects, and the idealist tradition in philosophy has placed subjectivity at the heart of reality. But science has considered it more objective to regard subjects as marginal to reality, perhaps because objects do exist independently of any particular subject, such as myself! So as they explored smaller and smaller realms of reality, physicists expected to find little particles of matter whose definite properties didn't depend on their being observed. Instead, they found wave functions describing only possibilities whose actualization seems to depend on observation. In the words of John Wheeler, ""No microscopic property is a property until it is an observed property."" This reopens the question of whether a real world exists independently of observation. The book is strongest when it is telling the story of how quantum physics came to be and describing the scientific and philosophical dilemmas it has created. I found it less exciting when it got to the question of interpretation beginning in Chapter 14. As other reviewers have noted, the authors give rather short shrift to some of the more popular interpretations, such as consistent histories and many worlds, probably because they feel that these approaches are still trying to minimize subjectivity and avoid confronting the real issue of consciousness. Here I wish they had provided a more thorough discussion and critique. I was also a little disappointed in the chapters on consciousness because they seemed to have only human consciousness in mind. But higher animals like ourselves appear too late in the evolutionary story to take too much credit for actualizing the possibilities of the universe! If physics is to confront consciousness in a serious way, it must confront the idealist philosophies that place the subject-object relationship at the heart of all reality, not just humanly experienced reality (but preferably without falling into a dualistic conception of subject as immaterial or supernatural being). In other words, the concept of consciousness must be thoroughly analyzed and perhaps singificantly broadened. Maybe whenever little things interact to form larger things, some form of ""measurement"" or ""observation"" is occurring to actualize posibilities. As John Bell asked, ""Are we not obliged to admit that more or less 'measurement-like' processes are going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere?"" I gave the book five stars, despite my reservations, because it is an important step toward getting people to address the philosophical questions raised by quantum mechanics. The alternative is to wall off post-classical physics in some isolated compartment of our brains, so it won't disturb our classical worldview."

271,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532635-chris-kemp,3,Mind boggling stuff. I thought it could have been presented a little better.
272,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10746832-wesley-fox,2,"The book sets out to explain quantum mechanics to the layperson in non-technical language, and to give an overview of the academic origin of the theory. It also offers up the limits of the theory and no one is able to explain the ""why"" it works. A noble goal for a book and an important area of science as it is part of the basis of a huge part of our economy. Unfortunately, I think this book really doesn't set itself apart from Quantum Physics for Dummies. It is also not as enjoyable as the ""for Dummies"" titles.The book was difficult to finish. I ended up skimming a third of the book in total and it seems the authors expected some of that to take place. They even suggest readers skim certain sections. Why any author would want readers to merely skim there work is a mystery to me. Anyway, what made it difficult to read was the painful repetition of the same points over and over and over. The authors also tend to treat their readers like idiots at times, with painfully moronic anecdotes.Also, getting into the background stories of the physicists, (i.e. controversies in their academic careers, personal rivalries) is incompatible with writing a text for laypersons. Non-scientists like me do not care about the dramas of professional rivalries, academic accolades, and private accounts of physicist personalities. Numerous science books I have read are guilty of getting into this uninteresting topic. If I were in this field, I certainly would be interested, but I am not.Finally, I was disappointed that the authors constantly mentioned consciousness and the philosophical ramifications of quantum mechanics but made no real attempt to actually discuss it. It was all Wikipedia-style summaries, nothing more.I would think Quantum Mechanics for Dummies is a better choice if you want a basic introductory text on the subject. This one is too long, repetitive, and tends to insult intelligence of the reader."
273,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74253693-christa-m,5,"Five stars! Ten stars! Twenty billion stars! A black hole of stars (which apparently does not lead to another universe but expels all the stars' information back into our universe through radiation according to Stephen Hawking, that ol' curmudgeon)!Others have commented that the book doesn't delve deep enough into actual philosophical theories about what quantum physics might be revealing to us about consciousness- but, all due respect, that is clearly not the point of this book.This book explains clearly and simply what the quantum enigma is and how physics has revealed that reality and observation are inextricably linked. It goes through the history of the founders of quantum theory and details the founders' own difficulty wrestling with the subject. It stays extremely close to the straight-and-narrow of physics except for possibly the last chapter, which gets the teensiest bit speculative.If you wanted a speculative book about how quantum physics is complementary to Buddhist thought, this is probably not the read for you! If you have trouble grasping what quantum physics is and why it's such a big (and weird) discovery, then give this book a try- ESPECIALLY if you lean toward the skeptical side. The authors are not trying to do anything but educate so that, by the end of the book, readers have something endlessly fascinating and vastly significant to the nature of our existence to ponder."
274,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50360024-jonathan,4,"I don’t even know where to begin with this book. Following my theme of physics and the quantum enigma, this book builds upon my understanding of the last book I read. Although it can be said the language did not flow as well, and some explanations can be a bit clumsy, I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. It talks about the evolution of quantum theory and how the idea has evolved, showcasing thought experiments in the process with useful diagrams that accompany the explanation. I found some of these explanations a bit hard to follow, but I think that’s rather my limited understanding and ignorance concerning this field of science rather than the fault or the author. At the end chapter is where it really picks up for me, discussing the implications of consciousness and philosophy, and how things are merely observed into existence. Something that has definitely influenced me to research more into this topic. What is also wonderful is that there is a small section of recommended reading at the end, I always love it when authors include such a section, helps keep the flow of ideas fresh for me. All in all, a fantastic, quite heavy and fascinating book to read! "
275,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,5,"I enjoyed fully this book, it explained quantum physics in a very understandable way that i get to know even more until I hit EPR and Bell's theorem. EPR is to debated Bohr, John Bell's theorem turned out to prove that Bohr was right! Spooky action at a distance. Means entanglement does exist. Why the entanglement is so meaningful and important, and most of people dislike this idea: We have no free will. What will happen has been decided since the whole universe was entangled!! (WOW)This could go to the ""Superdeterminism"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superde...The explanation in the book with the experiments were actually beyond my knowledge but i try to capture the meaning. Last part of book was talking about consciousness. Most of us feel hard to believe that our consciousness is simple the series of chemical neuro-reaction. i am ok with that but I am also curious about how it works and why we behave this or that way. That is why the whole packages of knowledge are inseparable, i am here to learn as much as I could. "
276,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595687-jenny,4,"What I like about this text is the repetitiveness. QM is a very difficult subject to grasp, and the authors offer many examples of how QM works. If you dont understand the first few examples, (or are new to physics) just keep reading. The tone is set in an understandable way, that the theories presented here may click right away for some folks. Those who don't understand immediately are given many chances to experience that ""aha!"" moment. And once you have that clarity, re-read the earlier sections to fully grasp it. There is one or two math equations offered, as the authors do their best to describe QM to the layman using diagrams and repetition in an effective way. As someone who took college physics and was only given an overview of QM at the time, I found the examples annoying at first, but as the author goes deeper into mechanics of quantum science, I was happy to re-read and process the challenging information.

Very well-separated chapters, containing historical facts, important physical and mathematical fundamentals, practical analogies, physical experiments, current theories, etc. I particulaly liked the way they relate the enigma with psychology and even a few of philosophy. The reader must have some knowledge in physics, if you don't you may feel completely confused and consequently frustrated. It is not exactly an easy book to be read, I don't recommend you to read it while you are tired or sleepy, and do not read too many chapters in a row, it's better to take some breath to process the information. One last advise: try not to freak out during your reading, the quantum enigma even disturbed Albert Einstein. Your perception of time and space will never be the same again."

This is a very accessible look into the world of quantum weirdness, and ""spooky actions"" as Einstein dubbed them.

It is the type of book that you have to stop, frequently, to think about what you just have read, in order to understand and assimilate the material. This book covers from quantum physics to consciousness with the least technical jargon and without stepping into the philosophical point of view. It is a scientific book for all us, the non-scientists community (or the Science Aficionados). It is a book that you must read more than once, for every time you read it, you discover something different in it. A more-than-5-stars type of book. I need to go back to it!"

Some of the concepts in this book, which are inherent to the nature of quantum physics and our universe, are so incredible and amazing in regard to how one looks at life that I highly recommend this book to anyone who's even slightly interested.

296,019517559X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Consciousness remains a great mystery. While it has increasingly begun to look like consciousness is an output part of the brain, intriguing questions remain unanswered, and some of these unknowns are hard to reconcile with a materialist model (materialism says all phenomena are born out of matter.) It isn’t just pseudo-scientists and cranks that have a problem with the materialist approach. Major names in physics have pointed out that everything is not accounted for by a model that imagines consciousness as the computational product of the brain. Rosenblum and Kuttner address one such hiccup, the so-called Quantum Enigma that lends its name to the book. In brief, the quantum enigma reflects the fact that physical reality is created by observation. This may seem hard to believe, because it’s only been observed at the levels of the really small—i.e. primarily the atomic and subatomic, though the authors propose that there is theoretically nothing to limit the phenomenon to that level and experiments are being conducted at molecular level. Rosenblum and Kuttner remind us that while the quantum world behaves oddly, quantum theory is exceptionally successful in scientific terms. Meaning that it has been validated by every single experimental inquiry, and the knowledge gained from quantum mechanics has made possible many of the advanced technologies that shape our world (laser, transistor, CCD, and MRI.) The oddness of Quantum Mechanics can be seen in several issues. One is the two-slit experiment in which atoms and photons behave like either a particle or a wave. Another is quantum entanglement, in which two atoms that have interacted become “wired” together such that changes in one are instantaneously reflected in the other—even if they have been separated by great distances. The book is a bit repetitive, but perhaps this is necessary. People seem to have trouble grasping the nuances of the arguments being made, and this can lead to some wrong conclusions. For example, some people have leapt to the conclusion that ESP is supported by quantum entanglement, but the evidence doesn’t support the idea that one’s thoughts can control anything. Observation causes some physical reality to coalesce, but one has no influence over what reality displays itself. (In other words, with observation the wave form collapses and some state of being comes into existence from what was a field of probabilities.) Randomness remains. Physicists tell us that this is the problem with the idea of using quantum entanglement for instantaneous communications across light-years of space. A further example of a nuance that is hard to grasp is the notion that quantum probability doesn’t describe the likelihood an atom is a certain place, but rather it describes the likelihood you’ll find it there (and that that is a distinction with a difference.) One may be wondering how consciousness is central the issue. If a non-intelligent entity observed, would the wave forms collapse? Consciousness doesn’t necessarily equate to intelligence as we know it. Consciousness can be thought of as merely the ability to observe and recognize significance in what is observed. So a thermostat is a very primitive form of consciousness. However, the authors do outline why a robotic observer wouldn’t end the controversy. I found “Quantum Enigma” to be readable despite the challenging subject being explained. The authors to a good job of both describing the relevant phenomenon in terms the average person could understand (Ch.2 though which doesn’t reflect reality) before going on to explain the experiments in which the phenomena is actually observed (i.e. Ch. 7.) The authors use simple line drawings as graphics as necessary as well as staged dialogues to help make the concept clear by anticipating objections and dealing with them as they come. I’d recommend the book for those interested in the unresolved questions of science with respect to Quantum Mechanics. In particular, there is the issue of consciousness—though it might not seem as central to the book’s discussion as the subtitle would lead one to believe. The last few chapters do deal in consciousness, though in a way that creates more questions than they answer. (It often feels like another summation of the strangeness of quantum mechanics, but that may be because the issues regarding consciousness remain so unclear. Furthermore, a lot of background is necessary to make sense of these complicated issues.) "

This book provides a clear and understandable introduction to the quantum world. It also describes the deepest, most bizarre aspect of the quantum world. A photon is simultaneously both a particle and a wave UNTIL SOMEONE LOOKS AT IT. It then becomes either a particle, behaving as one would expect a particle to behave, or it becomes a wave, exhibiting normal wave behavior. The observer forces the photon to take on one set of characteristics or the other. In a sense, nothing is fixed in the quantum world until an observer intervenes. You might ask why this should make any difference to us if quantum mechanics only applies to very small things. There are at least two reasons, and perhaps a third. First, modern technology uses quantum effects to achieve real results. Lasers and transistors(and the devices that rely on them, like computers) are just two of the things that could not exist without the application of quantum-mechanical principles. Second, quantum effects do not seem to necessarily be limited to very small things; objects as large as organic molecules and viruses have been shown to exhibit quantum behavior, and since everything, no matter how large, is made of the very small, it may just be a technological limitation that currently prevents us from seeing quantum behavior in, say, a Honda Civic.  There are parts of this book that need to be taken slowly, and sometimes reread a time or two, but the effort will be rewarded. Physicists have traditionally been reluctant to accept the implications of quantum mechanics, which seem to say that perhaps nothing is real until it is observed. Lay readers, who are not so heavily invested in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (described well in the book) may possibly be more willing to embrace one of the ten or more explanations of the theory that are herein described. (Or maybe not - we are venturing into very strange waters here.) Nevertheless, the authors point out that quantum mechanics should not lead anyone to some of the conclusions reached by people in the film What the #&%(# Do We Know. I found this to be a fascinating read."

Traditionally, science has worked within a realist perspective, assuming that the objects of our experience exist independently of our experience of them. Since our experience is all we know, we don't really know of any objects existing apart from subjects, and the idealist tradition in philosophy has placed subjectivity at the heart of reality. But science has considered it more objective to regard subjects as marginal to reality, perhaps because objects do exist independently of any particular subject, such as myself! So as they explored smaller and smaller realms of reality, physicists expected to find little particles of matter whose definite properties didn't depend on their being observed. Instead, they found wave functions describing only possibilities whose actualization seems to depend on observation. In the words of John Wheeler, ""No microscopic property is a property until it is an observed property."" This reopens the question of whether a real world exists independently of observation. The book is strongest when it is telling the story of how quantum physics came to be and describing the scientific and philosophical dilemmas it has created. I found it less exciting when it got to the question of interpretation beginning in Chapter 14. As other reviewers have noted, the authors give rather short shrift to some of the more popular interpretations, such as consistent histories and many worlds, probably because they feel that these approaches are still trying to minimize subjectivity and avoid confronting the real issue of consciousness. Here I wish they had provided a more thorough discussion and critique. I was also a little disappointed in the chapters on consciousness because they seemed to have only human consciousness in mind. But higher animals like ourselves appear too late in the evolutionary story to take too much credit for actualizing the possibilities of the universe! If physics is to confront consciousness in a serious way, it must confront the idealist philosophies that place the subject-object relationship at the heart of all reality, not just humanly experienced reality (but preferably without falling into a dualistic conception of subject as immaterial or supernatural being). In other words, the concept of consciousness must be thoroughly analyzed and perhaps singificantly broadened. Maybe whenever little things interact to form larger things, some form of ""measurement"" or ""observation"" is occurring to actualize posibilities. As John Bell asked, ""Are we not obliged to admit that more or less 'measurement-like' processes are going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere?"" I gave the book five stars, despite my reservations, because it is an important step toward getting people to address the philosophical questions raised by quantum mechanics. The alternative is to wall off post-classical physics in some isolated compartment of our brains, so it won't disturb our classical worldview."
