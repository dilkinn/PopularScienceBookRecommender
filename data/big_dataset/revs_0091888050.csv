It is a sequel to The Science of Discworld, and is followed by The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch. The acclaimed Science of Discworld centred around an original Pratchett story about the Wizards of Discworld. In it they accidentally witnessed the creation and evolution of our universe, a plot which was interleaved with a Cohen & Stewart non-fiction narrative about Big Science. In The Science of Discworld II, authors: Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart, and Jack Cohen, join forces again to see just what happens when the wizards meddle with history in a battle against the elves for the future of humanity on Earth. London is replaced by a dozy Neanderthal village. The Renaissance is given a push. The role of fat women in art is developed. And one very famous playwright gets born and writes The Play. ...The Globe (Science of Discworld #2), by Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart, Jack Cohen, Paperback, 345 pages, Published May 1st 2003, by Ebury Press (first published January 2002).تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز پنجم ماه مارس سال 2016 میلادیدر این داستان با عنوان «جهان»، جادوگران به طور تصادفی در دوران الازبیتان، به راندورلد (جهان واقعی که به طور ناخواسته در طول نخستین کتاب ایجاد شده است) منتقل میشوند؛ آنها میفهمند هنوز انسانها وجود دارند و ...؛ تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 15/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
1,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,3,"The Science of Discworld II: The Globe is a 2003 companion book to Terry Pratchett’s wildly successful and entertaining fantasy series.Describing a story where Rincewind and the wizards go to Round world (Earth) in some time travel magic and make observations about how our societies and cultures have evolved, Pratchett also chronicles how Earth’s cultures have developed with and without the influence of the elves, who have strayed from their dimension to Discworld and then also to Round World.The inclusion of the elves into our distant past reminded me of Julian May’s innovative The Many-Coloured Land. Pratchett also makes frequent references to his own books, particularly Lords and Ladies and Small Gods (two of his best).In between chapters, the reader gets a running commentary about scientific and cultural observations about how the Discworld’s stories relate to our life here on Round World.For Discworld fans."
2,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25923230-youkneek,2,"My reaction to the second Science of Discworld book is similar to my reaction to the first. As before, the book alternates between short, fictional chapters that tell a Discworld story and longer chapters that discuss real-world (mostly) science. I enjoyed the fictional chapters. The story was pretty entertaining, but it made up the smaller portion of the book. The science parts, as with the first book, focus heavily on theory and origin topics whereas I would have preferred a heavier emphasis on more practical topics. No doubt other people prefer it exactly the way it is. There were definitely parts that interested me, and parts that made me chuckle, but there were also a lot of parts that induced yawns. I also found it rather repetitive. At least a couple things were repeated from the first book, and there were some themes that the authors went on about over and over. Religion seems to be a particularly favorite topic. Even though I agree with most of their points about religion, they really overdid it, especially when considering it was also discussed quite a bit in the first book. To totally misuse a metaphor, I wanted them to stop preaching to the choir and spend more time on actual science. And, for people who don’t belong to this particular choir, I can imagine they would be even more annoyed. Trust me, repeating something over and over isn’t influential; it’s just irritating.Skimming through some reviews, I don’t see many people who had a similar reaction, so maybe it just boils down to me being the wrong audience for this set of books. In any case, I plan to skip the last two science books."
3,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4944981-serge-boucher,5,"The Science of Discworld may be my favorite book series ever, and this book is probably my favorite in the series. Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen write about science, philosophy, the future of humanity, while Terry Pratchett tells us about wizards trying to make William Shakespeare write A Midsummer Night's Dream. The result manages to be hysterically funny while teaching a serious lesson about what makes us humans. I don't have the words to do this book half the honor it deserves."
4,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10372606-james,2,"This one alternates back and forth between a Discworld story, written by Mr. Pratchett himself, and then a sciency-based chapter, written by the scientists Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart. I remember liking the first Science of Discworld novel, but the first sequel felt... off? I kept wishing I was reading either a real Discworld book or a real science book.The Discworld story seems pretty tired and cliche and phoned-in per Mr. Pratchett's standards, re-hashing a lot of ideas from previous novels. I suppose you could argue there's a point to that, these are after all Science of FRANCHISE books, with the unique distinction of the original author adding his own input. ""Remember that one idea expressed in a previous novel? Well, let's look at it deeper from a scientific standpoint...""Ok, but it made those fictional chapters boring.So then you get to the meat and.... potatoes. The science. I thought they were long rambles written by smart folks with some neat little ideas thrown in there and played around with, but nothing illuminating. Something something physics something time travel something chaos something philosophy something something and that's why William Shakespeare exists.There was some James Burke's Connections and Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time going on, but not quite as convincingly. It's unfair to expect that, true, but it's always painful when you're reading a book and all you can do is wish you were reading a different book a second time.I imagine this book is supposed to serve as a gateway drug to folks who love Discworld and fantasy and hardly ever pick up any science-factual stuff. Maybe introduce them to some crazy science ideas they've never heard before. I don't know if it works well in that manner, though, especially not with any pictures to illustrate some of the ideas talked about.I also would have liked more scientific citations. ""That sounds like a neat study... where did that come from? How do I know it's true?""Not a bad read. Just not real fun or mind-enhancing."
5,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/579016-reenie,3,"I think I'll keep this at three stars. Maybe it's because, unlike the first one in this series, it touches on the mind, and hence the brain, and hence what I spend 12 hours a day thinking about. (Well, 12 hours of quite a lot - yeah, okay, some - of my days. Damn you, internet, and your possibilities for procrastination), and because I know a bit more of it, I'm less convinced by some of the arguments. It could also be because this second installment of the Science of the Discworld series focuses on the development of the Mind (capital intended), which is necessarily a fuzzy concept, and one that many scientists will tell you is 'not a subject for serious/testable/REAL science', but I can't say I really incline to this idea, for two reasons. First, because it's the freaking bane of my existence in a neuroscience program that I continually have to listen to people explaining that, unlike those bloody awful psychologists, we in neuroscience do 'REAL science' - as the authors here mention with some frequency, science is about the process of the scientific method, not about your subject matter. (I could go on and on about this, but I'll spare the paragraph here, because I still have another point). Secondly, if we're talking about fuzzy concepts, the first book in the series was about the origins of the universe, the earth, and life on said earth - since these all happened billions or millions of years ago, we're necessarily talking about things for which most of the physical evidence is long gone, so finding out about them is a process of finding what you can and then stringing together as convincing a story as you can manage...That's basically fuzzy city. At least we still have minds around today that we can try to poke at.Anyway, the idea of telling stories is central to this book, and although at some points it kind of works against it, either because the stories don't make much sense or aren't really introduced too well (there's a repeated idea about barbarians vs tribalism that continues throughout, except that it keeps on being referred to before it's actually been explained, which bugged me), that kind of works with Pratchett & co's overall point: as humans, we're naturally programmed to Tell Stories, which may (or may not) relate to reality... but this relationship doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the likelihood of the story surviving.It's an interesting perspective, and even if the details of their argument about what happened to make humans human don't really float your boat, it's a very interesting context from which to view many things about science, humanity and all that other fun stuff."
6,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2609422-tim-eby-mckenzie,1,"I have LOVED Terry Pratchett's work - thus far. However, upon reading Book #2 of the Science of Discworld series - The Science of Discworld II :), I found myself sorely disappointed. What a snore of a book. I am a bit of a science nerd, so delving into astrophysics or a nice neuroscience book doesn't bother me, but that level of (okay, sometimes mind-numbing) detail doesn't bother me, if it is tied to actual research and practical, real-non-disc-world stuff. But this puppy goes beyond Silmarillion in its background detail. Zzzzzzzzz...From here on, it's the actual fantasy work, and not the ""Science of..."" that I will stick to. Unless, that is, it happens to be something like The Body Keeps the Score - shameless plug for another great book in the real world. ""For what it's worth."""
7,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50207955-andrea,3,"Again, Pratchett chapters are strong, science a bit dated (and this time oddly focused on proving the ""bean counters"" wrong). Very Euro-centric."
8,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121917-peter,0,"The rise of the storytelling ape: Try enlivening a party with this question: ""What's on your mind?"" When the babble has become truly raucous, ask another: ""How did it get in there?"" This book is about those questions, how we came to consider them, and how we've tried to learn to understand them. Interleaving a fantasy story with analyses of scientific thinking about thinking carries certain risks. In the hands of this trio, however, the balance is successfully achieved. Don't be deceived by the name of Terry Pratchett as lead author of this volume. There are wonderful touches of humour in this book, but the basic theme is a serious question: ""Who are we, and how did we get to be this way?""This book repeats a technique used in The Science of Discworld I - two stories in parallel. Discworld is a mirror of Roundworld. The wizards used the computer Hex to construct Roundworld in SoD I. They were shocked at the many differences. Shape was only a beginning. They were confronted with the many ways in which life evolved on Roundworld. They were also forced to reflect on how illogical it seemed for living things to struggle for survival, only to be snuffed out by natural forces. In this sequel, the most advanced life form is going to be confronted with an extinction threat noted in the first book. How to deal with it? It turns out that the best solution is to ally with a great evil force. Humanity has a strange and illogical heritage, this book tells us. As our forebears learned to cope with changing conditions on the African savannah [or on lake shores or even in the sea] they learned to stand upright, to grasp tools, and to think. This has always seemed like a long, continuous progression of small improvements over time - a process in the best Darwinian gradualist sense. This trio of authors reminds us that this picture is false for humans. After a good start, our ancestors simply halted in place, keeping social, mental and technological progress at bay. The ""pause"" went on for a hundred millennia. At some point about fifty thousand years ago, all that changed. We went from the ""standing ape"" to become ""the storytelling ape"". Thinking and speaking resulted in story-telling. In trying to understand ourselves and our surroundings, Pratchett and his colleagues see humans as inventing stories for explanations of nature's mysteries. Magic, allied with the element ""narrativium"", runs the Discworld. On the Roundworld, magic has to be invented. Narratives are the means to bring it about and spread it around. Every human society forges its own stories which are imparted to children as ""Make-A-Human Kits"". Each society creates explanations which become legends which become religions as one example. While we might dispute whether we've ""progressed"" argue the authors, there's no question that once the process started, humans changed rapidly resulting in what we see around us today. This ""advance"", they argue, was not inevitable. While we may not yet understand what prompted this change, we can list alternatives and reject the impossible or implausible. That's why the Discworld parallel story comprises part of this book. It teaches you how to recognise the difference.To long-standing Discworld fans, this book will be a serious challenge. Unlike the ""laugh per page"" of Pratchett's other works, he and his colleagues confront the most serious of issues: ""where do we come from?"" and ""where are we going?"". Cohen and Stewart, who have dealt these questions elsewhere, and Terry Pratchett, who posits them with every book, have produced a significant contribution in attempting an answer. The use of the parallel story line offers great opportunities for the reader to ""step outside the box"" and consider life and beliefs from a detached view. Pratchett has long confronted us with ourselves. Adding Cohen and Stewart's scientific and cognitive abilities to his imagination results in a compelling and informative read.

9,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237558-drew-perron,3,"So, first of all, Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen are awful at communicating the philosophy of science. When you keep them on hard facts, they do pretty well, but let them go even a hair into the why of science and how people think (and how people should think, hoo boy) and they rapidly get smug and passive-aggressive at anyone who doesn't have what they think is The Scientific Viewpoint (occasionally throwing odd shade on other scientists in the process). It's not super useful as a way to get people to understand the world they live in, just as a way to prove how much smarter they and people who attended similar PhD programs are than everyone else.But they're not the really important part; Terry Pratchett is the main event here. And...Pratchett is one of my favorite writers. He's an inspiration, with a deft hand at character and a deeply humanist vision. And that vision comes across here, in a story that's about the value of art, the value of belief and the human viewpoint, the value of making things up and telling each other about them....that said, he's someone who comes out of the same tradition as Stewart and Cohen, and has not always taken the time to deeply question the assumptions of that tradition. And so, what you get here is...I mean, it's a lot of very good writing, with some strong character work and some very emotional scenes (the one with Niklias the Cretan is especially strong). But what the story is, essentially, about, is... Well-off college-educated white men from a thinly-veiled version of the Western world having to invent art because the ancient traditions we come from aren't good enough at it, and weren't getting around fast enough to inventing atheism.It's not a great look.Thankfully, Pratchett did delve deeper into questioning these assumptions later on. (Check out his excellent Nation, from 2008, for a thoughtful piece about non-Western cultures, colonialism, and repudiating that shit.) As a writer and as a person, it's clear that he kept changing and growing his whole life. We can only hope that the rest of us can do as well."

11,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14744976-highlyeccentric,3,"Oh, a confusing reading experience, this one. On the one hand, I had not realised just how MUCH of my mental framework for thinking about, well, the build-a-human-kit is drawn from, or crystalised in, this book. I read it in late high school, and re-read it a few times during undergrad, and while I can express the concepts about the role and use of stories in much fancier lit-wank language now... here it is. On the other hand, now I have degrees in premodern history and I want to set their rigid 'no science before newton' framework on FIRE. Oh my glod. Roger Bacon would like to talk to you, you fuckers. I could almost roll with it, except that I know a lot more about science now than I used to (thanks, Trojie), and their definition of science as experiment-driven rather than data-analysis also rules out MOST OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES. These authors are totally the kind of physics stans who refer to natural history as 'stamp-collecting'. Nope nope nope so much nope."
12,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697835-ronald,4,"I liked this book it contained an interesting story. Unfortunately at times the ""science"" portion of the book fell into the same trap that all philosophy of science books and articles fall (heck the same trap all philosophy falls into this trap). It took itself way to seriously and talk (well wrote) way to much in relation to the actual fiction it was commenting upon. I really would have liked to read a slightly more fleshed out version of the story that followed the usual suspects from Discworld."
13,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18378839-angelica,4,"While still filled with scientific facts, I've felt that this one is a lot more subjective than the first. Probably because it deals with culture, philosophy and religion, instead of astronomy and evolution. Most of it hit home, but I did find myself disagreeing on a few topics. Still, that did not, in any way, stop me from enjoying the book."
14,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3632411-jesus,5,"What made humans so? Why do we believe that our religion/ideology/nationalism is the only right one among so many silly ones? Are we Homo sapiens (wise) or Homo narrans (story-teller)? ... These questions and many others are discussed in the book, along a Discworld story, where the UU wizards try to mend their Roundworld experiment. "
15,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"I just reread this (because the fourth science of Discworld book should be released in the U.S. next month). While I found this second book a bit more of a slog than the first, it is an insightful commentary on how fiction can help create an environment where science can take hold."
16,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10037547-outi,3,"Pretty good 	and interesting, altho the atheist agenda was starting to bug me at the end. The science was explained well, but there were lots of opinions instead of hard science."
17,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48451466-max,4,Also loved this one. Great combination of useful reading and fantasy. Really learning something from this series!
18,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935560-dan-l-danehy-oakes,4,"Having done a bang-up job on cosmology in the first volume, Messrs. PS&C decide, in this volume, to talk about the evolution of the human mind as we sort-of know it. One of their most basic tools in this discussion is what they call ""extelligence,"" the information and such _outside_ our brains that is accessible _to_ the brains. This includes social knowledge, knowledge stored in books and other such formats, knowledge available on the Intartoobz, and much more.Their other primary tool is the concept of _story_. On Discworld, of course, things happen because narrative impulse says they must; but there is no narrativium on Roundworld (i.e., Earth). But our brains need contexts for random facts, and that context (say PS&C) is a story. We tell ourselves stories that help us imagine the consequences of our actions, what's going on in other minds, and so on. We also deliver a great deal of socializing information (what PS&C call a ""Build-a-Human Kit"") to children in the form of stories.And most of these stories, they point out, are lies. We tell children that water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit/100 degrees Celsius, but we don't tell them, because they don't need to know and they couldn't understand it if they did, that this boiling point depends a great deal on things like air pressure; in a vacuum, liquid water just boils, and even ice sublimates into vapor.Newton's Laws of Motion and Gravity are tremendously _useful_ stories, but (as we have known since Einstein) they are also lies. Or, if you will, useful and sufficient approximations for most purposes, but still not fundamentally _true_.The same thing with most of the other things we teach in school. History is grotesquely oversimplified, as it must be, for grammar-school children; and even the moral lessons we teach them are sort of conditional at best. (Never tell a deliberate untruth, we say. What if a Nazi is asking you whether you have any Jews hiding under your house, and you do? I would fib in a hot second... and I'm not even a very good liar, so I might be dooming myself as well.)Oh, and, yes, there's a Discworld story in the odd-numbered chapters. The Wizards of Unseen University find out that elves - and Discworld elves are _nasty_ creatures - have infested the Roundworld they created in Book 1. So they enter and determine to foil the elves at the dawn of prehistory ... but this turns out to prevent much in the way of cultural evolution for humans, so they go back and stop themselves ... but the elves still must be stopped _somehow_.The story part is not quite as enjoyable as I should like from a Discworld book, but the science chapters are fascinating, so overall, yeah, I liked it."
19,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21853313-brandt,3,"When I read the first 
Science of Discworld
 novel, I wasn't too impressed with the bits that Terry Pratchett wrote, but I enjoyed the format of the book, where Pratchett would write a chapter and then the science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen would expound on some scientific topic that was related to the previous chapter's narrative. In this way, Stewart and Cohen basically ran the gamut of scientific topics in physics, chemistry, biology, etc and were able to discuss these topics in the context of how Discworld related (or didn't to them.) This time around, Pratchett, Stewart and Cohen follow the same pattern they did in The Science of Discworld but this time around Stewart and Cohen concern themselves with ""the storytelling ape"" which is their way of describing humanity itself. By their argument it is humanity's ability to tell stories that separates us from our ape cousins--we are able to imagine the world in a way that the other creatures on ""Roundworld"" (Earth) can't, and this has allowed us to create the scientific method and grow in a way that couldn't be imagined apart from a creature that has the capacity to do so. (How delightly recursive, no?) There are of course some side tracks (one being if time travel is possible and all of the wonderful paradoxes that go along with time travel) but it is humanity's ability to tell stories (and be extension the ability to tell lies) that are the focus for Stewart and Cohen here.Ultimately, that may be why I don't find The Globe as successful as its predecessor. Again, the narrative provided by Pratchett seems like a throwaway for Pratchett, but since Stewart and Cohen are committed to providing at least half of the book's content (and honestly it's more like two-thirds--their explanatory chapters are always longer than Pratchett's actual story) he kind of gets away with this. However, it doesn't happen as much in this book, because I feel that Stewart and Cohen aren't really discussing science, but more their views on narratives and the human condition. Is it okay for them to discuss this? Sure. But I am not sure that as science writers they are as equipped to address this topic as deftly as they addressed topics in The Science of Discworld.At this point, I am now as sick of the wizards of the Unseen University as I am of Rincewind himself. But I forge on, since I've gotten this deep into it. Just two more of these to go..."
20,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65146426-felix,3,"A few years back I set out to read all forty-five extant Discworld books, plus the short stories and a selection of supplementary media. I got most of the way fairly quickly, but ground to a halt halfway through book forty-three on my list, SD 2: The Globe. My interest was waning for various external reasons, but the book itself wasn't doing much to keep me - the content was interesting, but it didn't hang together the way SD 1 had done, sad irony for a book about the vital power of narrative. At the end of 2016 I shelved it, put fantasy (mostly) aside, and started reading non-fiction. Around that time I started logging my reads on GR, so my subsequent haphazard trajectory through philosophy, critical theory and classical-toliterature is on record.In August 2019, having finally pushed all the way through Badiou's Theory of the Subject (and maybe even understanding as much as half of it!), I figured it was time for something a bit lighter - forgive my upbringing if 'lighter' in this case refers to liberal-skeptic Anglo-paternalism. The latter is done, by Pratchett, Stewart & Cohen, with great care, and with a minimum of smugness. It's a rousing defense of the scientific worldview, but one that warns repeatedly against scientism and intellectual solipsism, while just as deeply evaluating the advantages and pitfalls of magical, religious, and philosophical models of reality. It still doesn't flow the way SD 1 does, but familiar characters continue to develop throughout the fiction chapters, and the non-fiction chapters draw welcome examples from the wider Discworld series to illustrate various points. "
21,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18735997-chris,3,"The ""Science of Discworld"" series can be a very challenging read. However it is easy to skip through, with every odd chapter here being part of a Discworld story and every even chapter being a further exploration of real world science, myth, religion, history and cultural theories that effect the interpretation of that story context. Hence a reader can enjoy just the storyline, or the deeper philosophical discussion, or both at once. The full benefit is gained by endeavouring through both parts in sequence, but you can get through with just the story without the deathly result of getting totally lost. If the question of logic as experienced by Ponder Gibbons to ""... work out how you got from a few simple rules to, say, the sheen on mother-of-pearl..."" is all thought provoking for you, then you need to have a go at the even chapters. The answer is not given, but the thoughts explored and catalysed will possibly get you closer there.In the end the authors challenge us not to ""accept the word of authority unthinkingly"", including scientific theory as well as other religious and cultural belief systems. It is only through the deeper discussion chapters that this is explored, though the story itself may elude to this possibility occurring without directly pointing the finger at anyone in the real world."
22,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1157324-peter-dunn,5,"Despite being in my to be read piles for some considerable time I hadn’t got around to reading Science of Discworld 4 until nowish. Before I did so I thought I better take the very unusual step (for me) of rereading a book or two at very least Science of Discworld 2 and 3 both of which had become rather sketchy in my mind. “Science of Discworld 2 The Globe” is the very peak of the four book Science of Discworld sequence. Packed full with wizards, elves, and Shakespeare- the play a Midsummer’s Night Dream becomes the obvious and hilarious glue to hold all that in place. The book binds together Terry’s unique, and always entertaining, Discworld universe with the ever enlightening musings of Roundword academics Professor Ian Stewart and Dr Jack Cohen. Jack and Ian aren’t just renowned researchers from The University of Warwick, they were also the very first people from our Roundworld to be appointed by Terry as honorary Wizards of Discworld’s Unseen University. Jack, and Ian’s thoughts on evolution, the development of our human minds, culture, language, art, and science that thread through this book are always worth reading and listening to, and here they shine even more intensely given the back lighting of Terry’s Discworld tale."
23,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69305384-peter-lind,5,"Amazing!I was a little disappointed by the first in the series - mostly because a lot of it was known stuff (to me), I really wanted to learn.And in this second part, I certainly did.It goes much deeper in the ""narrativium""-talk, and makes a great point of showing how we humans make everything make sense, even when it doesn't - as most of the natural world doesn't actually make sense. Why science can sometimes be hard to accept, and why religion and science fiction sometimes seem ""better"" explanations than the current scientific knowledge.And it is a great story of (mostly western) culture and enlightenment - doing a fantastic job of showing how the arts is one of the most important driving forces of the human mind. Even though science does a great job of understanding, it is the arts that makes us want to understand!Recommended, even if you haven't read the first in the series!"
24,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24549251-sam-wescott,4,"My review for this one is pretty much the same as the first Science of Discworld book. The science chapters are.. a bit much sometimes, but the Discworld fiction in between is hilarious. I love the connection between ""Roundworld"" and Discworld and the difficulties the wizards face navigating a world sans ""narrative imperative"". It's delightful. As far as the science chapters go, it really depends on where your interests lie. I love origins of humans and evolutionary science (because I was raised religious and have a huge deficit of knowledge in that area), but the question of ""What is information?"" and explanations of phase space bore me to tears. So it was touch and go.But overall, it was really fun. I wanna learn all my science from Sir Terry and friends. <3"

The fiction and non-fiction sections are blended together as different aspects of a common theme. In the process, various swipes are made at science, history, art, religion and many other areas, but the main theme throughout is the importance of storytelling - and by implication lying - has been to human progress, encapsulated in the description 'the ape that tells stories'.

As with the first book the story is used to further explain scientific topics, with each story chapter followed by a science chapter.Both are highly enjoyable, though naturally the wizards are funnier. The balance between story and non-fiction falls heavily in favour of the latter, which can on occassion be a bit too lengthy in comparison."
27,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6286612-molokov,3,"Another quick fun adventure with the UU wizards on Roundworld, this time influencing human history so that science and imagination overtake superstition (and thus, defeat the elves who've invaded Roundworld). Mostly it focuses on making the world a place where Shakespeare exists and writes A Midsummer's Night Dream - but in order to get there, the wizards have to introduce art to humanity from its earliest days. (Once again, we skipped the science chapters on this read-through, so I can't comment on the content of those in this review). "
28,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87804650-anne-omynous,3,"This one did not have the appeal for me of the first Science of Discworld. The alternating chapters of philosophic musings on how human minds work were either very dull or went over my head.The chapters with the wizards were not compelling enough to make up for it. If I had it to do over again, I would start reading only the wizard chapters at the beginning.The only interesting idea I ran into was the aquatic ape and some of the discussion about humans believing a story against evidence was worthwhile."
29,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17550624-steve,4,"Just like the first book, this is just as hard to categorise -- you push it down and it leaks over the sides and makes a mess. There is an overarching story in this, which in its own right is interesting, if not a tad trite and well, lacking the usual whimsy that Discworld books have. The non-fiction-explainy chapters also tended to steal my brain because they'd point out something interesting and I'd fall into a rabbit hole. Having said that, I probably needed to be a little more familiar with some work before I read this, but I do wish to continue with this series."
30,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25635143-priya-agarwal,2,"The science bit was 75% of the book, and it seemed wholly unnecessary. It was just the authors showing off their knowledge of science. None of it had anything to do with Discworld, or with the story going on.Every alternate chapter was fiction, but....weak. Very weak. It felt like a quick draft sketched up within a couple hours. An excuse of a story shoved in so people buy this ego-booster non Discworld-related book.Absolutely fucking crap. I can't bring myself to give it below 2 stars, but I really hated it, I struggled through the book. 0.5 stars."
31,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1704073-alan-reynolds,5,"I get a lot from reading Pratchett, Cohen and Stewart in various books, including this one that I read in December 2002- January 2003. As the blurb from The Times says: 'The hard science is as gripping as the fiction.' So many good concepts engagingly presented and explicated here. From using 'grandfathers' as a way of measuring time in 50-year periods, to us as Pans narrans instead of as Homo sapiens sapiens. I may well read this again."
32,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/441678-megan,4,"Like the first Science of Discworld book, this one flips back and forth each chapter between a simple discworld wizards story and science-y chapters explaining the related real-world science, history, or theory being spoofed in the narrative. I found this second book much less dry reading than the first, though that's probably just because the topics discussed appealed to me more, so I expect results vary with the reader. It did get a bit repetitive at times, but nothing too annoying. "
33,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57342131-natalia-ahmed,5,"A continuation of the Science of Discworld, where this takes a much closer look at humanity. A fascinating insight into our world, the effects of art and culture, and the ultimate power of the story.A delightful read into the history of humanity, providing a wonderful comparison between Discworld and our world, and how both worlds are able to work.25/10 this needs to be taught in schools I've learned more from this than YEARS of education"
34,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2698659-roberta,5,"The science in this volume is a little harder for me to grasp than the science in the first volume - it is a little more technical, a little more based in theoretical physics. It is still very well described and it ties in well with the alternative chapters. The Discworld part is gripping, and it showcases Rincewind in a better light than most of his own books do - he comes up with a solution to get the Roundworld rid of elves entirely on his own!"
35,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29170317-kim-clarke,4,"A party of wizards find themselves stranded on Roundworld during a team-building exercise with Rincewind and Ponder Stibbons coming to the rescue. Elves are messing around with the story and the wizards need to make sure the resident ape species leave the planet before the next giant rock hits the planet. Wizards and time travel, this should be interesting!"
36,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16508401-mark-bringman,3,"Fine but underwhelmingThis is 2.5 or so. The discworld party was a more engaging story but the science was seriously lackluster. If i reread, it will be the story and not the description (the science element). On the upside did make me want to reread Shakespeare, so not all is lost."
37,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3795867-zivan,5,"The Science of Discworld books are no Discworld Novels, but they are great primers on scientific thought. I found that The Globe hit most of the important points of skeptical thinking.Its a great way to learn about the philosophy of science without having to tackle a heavy academic tome. "
38,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28211225-john-millard,5,"Neil Gaiman once stated something about each of Terry’s books being a miracle. The more books I read the more I agree. This book was funny, informative and pure Terry with a little help from his friends. A bit of knowledge about science, independent thinking and a desire to chuckle often required. "
39,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31388894-sarah,4,"Recommended for all Pratchett fans. I love the idea of the ""make a human kit"" and I feel like I've gotten to know Rincewind better through these /The Science.../ books than in the actual novels. He's much more enjoyable when he's not constantly running away from something."
40,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32428531-charles-yoder,2,"Disappointing. Despite his name on it, it was obvious Terry Pratchett did little if any of the writing. I've read most of the Discworld books at least twice, but I couldn't force myself to finish this one. It consists of thin slices of a humdrum story involving wizards, elves, and time travel, interlaced with thick slabs of pseudo-science."
41,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94816825-vicki,5,"Great story tellers! This is a very thought provoking book but in an entertaining and also highly scientific way. I love the mash-up of this series - Terry Pratchett’s original work cleverly intertwined with science and, refreshingly, common sense! A great read that I highly recommend."
42,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4346085-lauren-little,2,"I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first Science of Discworld book. I felt that the science chapters were long, repetitive, and usually not that enjoyable."
43,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/618545-kat,3,"If religion brings you a lot of comfort, this book might not.I especially appreciated all the talk about the importance of story. "

51,0091888050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6082846-nancy,3,"More like 3.5, but not enough to round up. But I apparently made a bunch of highlights, so there's that."
