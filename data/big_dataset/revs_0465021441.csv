0,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,"I must say that this book left me a bit disappointed and quite underwhelmed: it is well written, very detailed when describing the historical evolution of modern particle physics, rich with anecdotal detail and also conceptually precise and lucid, but it simply does not contain enough actual physics.On the positive side, some subjects of great interest are addressed by the author in a succinct, informative and clear way, accessible even to the novice (including items, like gauge field theories, re-normalization and spontaneous symmetry breaking, that are normally not addressed in the large majority of popular science books); however I must point out that way too much space in the book has been dedicated to specific events/conferences, to the reasons why a Nobel prize was given to one scientist as opposed to another, etc., while more effort should have been devoted to delivering a more meaningful and detailed description of the underlying physics.From this perspective, I must say that, while it was a pleasant read, this book gave me very little information that I had not already previously received, in a more detailed and structured way, in quite a few other books. Overall, a pretty forgettable, 3-star-graded reading experience."
1,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Close provided a history of quantum physics from QED and Feynman's diagrams to the hunt for the Higgs. I never get tired of Feynman's antics, and it's clear Frank Close doesn't either. Like so many other researchers with new and bold ideas, Feynman's new ideas associated with QED were not taken seriously. The debates were always very heated, so much so, that one time, Feynman gave up mid lecture (even though he was right!). He came back the next time with his (not yet) famous diagrams. But even with the diagrams, people simply did not take his idea seriously. They would ask how he knew what he knew, and all he could offer was that the formula was correct because it gave the right answer. They would ask how he came up with the formula and he said he just knew it because it gave the right answer. This was just circular arguing to most. People were not buying it. Eventually people accepted that he was right (it took a lot of science to get them there). However, even when his ideas about QED were well established, the trouble didn't stop there. Feynman, now older, was at a lecture on QED in which the presenter was explaining Feynman's QED. Feynman raised his hand with an objection and the lecturer began to explain QED to the old man, whom he did not recognize. He talked to Feynman as if he were slow. Feynman cut him off and angrily said, ""When I invented it 25 years ago....."" The lecturer went pale. I love that story.This book is filled with many Feynman antics that teach QED in an entertaining manner. My favorite part was describing the normalization of QED and how the infinities are so finely balanced that one can picture the side of the equations as a tightrope walker who was teetering as they walked the rope high above Niagara Falls. Close is definitely not as accessible as Sean Carroll; so if you are not as familiar with quantum physics and the standard model (especially the Higgs), I would start with Carroll and then read Close to enjoy the Feynman antics. "
2,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"This is a really important popular science book if you are interested in physics, because it covers some of the important bits of modern physics that most of us science writers are too afraid to write about. Starting with renormalization in QED, the technique used to get rid of the unwanted infinities that plagued the early versions of the theory and moving on to the weak force, the massive W and Z bosons, the Higgs business and the development of the concept of quarks and some aspects of the theory covering the strong force that holds them in place, it contains a string of revelations that I have never seen covered to any degree in a popular text elsewhere.Take that renormalization business. I have seen (and written) plenty of passing references to this, but never seen a good explanation of what the problem with infinities was really about, or how the renormalization was achieved and justified. Frank Close does this. Similarly I hadn't realised that Murray Gell-Mann, the man behind the 'quark' name, originally took a similar view to quarks as Planck did to quanta - a mathematical trick to get the right answer that didn't reflect anything real in terms of the particles involved.For at least the first half of the book I was determined to give it five stars, despite itself. The content was sufficiently important and infrequently covered to require this. That 'despite itself' is because this is no light read - it makes the infamously frequently unfinished Brief History of Time seem a piece of cake. I think the reason for this is that the concepts here are more alien to the reader than those typically met in traditional 'hard' topics like relativity or quantum theory. Close does define a term like gauge invariance before using it, but then keeps using it for chapter after chapter. The trouble is, to the author this is an everyday concept, but to the reader the words are practically meaningless (unlike, say space and time in relativity), so a couple of pages on from the definition we've forgotten what it means and get horribly lost. These aspects (spontaneous symmetry breaking is another example) would have benefited hugely from a more detailed explanation and then use of more approachable terms along the way rather than what can be a highly opaque jargon.I could forgive the author this though. After all his writing style is fine and there is all that interesting content. But there were a couple of things that dragged the book down a little for me. The first was a tendency to skip over bits of science, leaving them mysterious. For example, at one point we are told that a process can be split into five categories: scalar, pseudo-scalar, tensor, vector and axial. Of these only vector and scalar are defined, so when we are told that the weak force was classified as V-A, we have no clue what this means as we don't know what axial means, or the significance of the minus sign. This is Rutherfordian stamp collecting, giving us labels without understanding the meaning.Worse though, and the dominant part of the second half of the book, was that there was just far too much dissecting exactly who contributed exactly what little component to the theory, and who got the Nobel prize for what, and who didn't get it, despite deserving it. Frankly, this is too much of an insider's idea of what's important. We don't really care. I wish this had been omitted, leaving room for more handholding on the theory.The trouble is, there were far too many people involved to get any successful human interest going in the story. Nobel prizes of themselves don't make people interesting. I have two scientific heroes in the last 100 years - Richard Feynman and Fred Hoyle. (Obviously I'm in awe of the work of many others - Einstein, say - but this misses the point.) In that same period there must have been getting on for 300 Nobel prize winners in physics alone. I'm interested in their work, but I can't get too excited about them as people. Those who criticise popular science for being too driven by the stories of a few individuals when so many have contributed miss the point. You can only have so many heroes.Overall this remain a really important book if you want to get to grips with modern particle physics and quantum field theory. It fills in lots of gaps that other books gloss over. But it would be remiss of me not to also point out my concerns. Originally published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission"
3,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,3,"I have to admit this is not much of a review. For one I read last year, and for two I made very few notes.I feel this was more of a tour of quantum physics. But, what infinity had to do with, unless I missed it, never showed up. [Disclaimer it could be there and I might have forgot] And it failed to provide a very good over view of the nuts and bolts of quantum field theory.So, I did rate it 3 ⭐️s. It wasn't boring and fairly well written, although not with the panache of my more favored authors. There was an interesting bit about emotions and scientific discovery that I did find to be something of importance to point out on page 9 of the Kindle edition.Not a bad read, but not great either."
4,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"This is a detailed history of the discoveries of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and their unification into the Standard Model by spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism. It's one of those people-driven histories of science, which can get boring if not petty at times. But overall, it tells an exciting story of this impressive achievement.The central theme of the book is renormalization in Gauge Theory. The first half of the book introduces the reader to these topics quite well, and doesn't hold back too much of the mathematical details. I feel like I understand this topic a lot better, now. Very educational."
5,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,2,"The book is written by a good scientist who wrote some other very clear work and about some fascinating hardcore particle physics. I fully expect it to be a 4- if not 5-star book. Unfortunately, this is deeply disappointing. No doubt it’s not a simple subject and it’s not easy for laymen to understand. Try this: “The question [...] was this: If symmetry is spontaneously broken in the presence of a massless vector-gauge boson (such as a photon), which gives rise to a long-range force, does the Goldstone Boson become absorbed into the massless gauge boson, thereby providing the longitudinal oscillation — the analog of Anderson’s plasma oscillation — required to covert the massless gauge boson into a massive vector particle?”You can see, you need to be able to retain a lot of concepts to be able to understand what is happening. That’s not the actual problem. Since it took so many brilliant scientist so long to figure these things out, I’m happy to spend a long time to absorb some gist of it. The actual problem is that the book does not attempt to clearly explain these concepts. For instance, the infinity puzzle in the title is about a quantity with physical meaning being predicted by theory as an infinite quantity. I would have welcomed the equation to see for myself. There is no such thing. Fine, maybe it’ll be too much to have equations. But a significant portion of book is devoted to things that are too narrow for anybody to care. And I’m not talking about gossips of Nobel prize. I’m talking stories of timing of the paper somebody wrote, when the review was received, and so on. I get it, they matter for the few scientists in order to sort out chronology. But’s let’s face it, in the grand scheme of things, these are really unnecessary. In fact, I don’t even want to know the circuitous routes of mis-conjecture and the history of corrections. I wanted to know the current understanding explained in more than analogies, in Feynman diagrams and simplified equations so that an engineer can understand. As it is, it’s too much folklore and chronology of the “Hunt for the orderly universe”. I think it is a missed opportunity."
6,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"There's almost not a wasted word in this book. If you blink while listening, you might lose track of the physics. The author is very good at writing a history of quantum science from QED to looking for the Higgs boson.He uses the narrative of the scientific players to describe the physics. There is nothing of the physics or the math for which he does not explain before he talks about it. The problem is the author explains the physics at the moment of introduction than assumes that you will understand it and won't explain it to you again.A large audience of people won't like this book. If you don't follow the physics as he introduces it, the narrative of the history will not be enough to entertain you. He only introduces the physics once and assumes you get it. He covers so much of modern physics he really doesn't have time to repeat his clear explanations more than once.What I liked about this book he really filled in the details for what has happened since quantum mechanics was fully developed and the Large Hadron Collider has gone online. I had read many books on each and had mostly just walked away with that particles were very small. Now I have a very good feel for what's going on and why the Higgs boson is so important.His last chapter was a marvelous summary of the book. I only wish he had summarized more of the physics after he explained difficult concepts more frequently.I don't want to mislead. This book is a very difficult read. Some one with no real background in physics can follow it, but it requires ones full concentration. He covers the topics so well, I'll probably never have to read another history of that period of physics again for a long time. "
7,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42189561-abu-hayat-khan,5,"This book talks about the history of physics since the WWII. It has a particular discussion on two prominent figures in physics: the Dutch physicist Gerard 't Hooft, and the Pakistani physicist Abdus Salam. For general people, probably this is the best book on Higgs Boson, from the evolution of Higgs mechanism until its final discovery in LHC.Similar to classical physics, quantum physics has two eras of development. One goes by the name ""Quantum mechanics"" and the second one as ""Quantum field theory"". ""Heisenberg inequality"" and ""de Broglie's equation"" etc. are the descriptions of the mechanical view of the quantum world. On the other hand, the first Quantum field theory started with Paul Dirac. Thanks to Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, Tomonaga etc. who made their effort to transmute ""Dirac equation"" into QED (Quantum Electro Dynamics). But, all modern Quantum field theory is based on something called the ""Yang Mill theory."" Electroweak theory and QCD/QFD (quantum chromodynamics/quantum flavordynamics) are two such Yang Mill theory.The name of the book ""the infinity puzzle"" comes from the fact that, all the Quantum field theory either based on Dirac equation or Yang Mill theory were unsolvable at the very beginning, as their calculation leads to infinity. In the case of QED, Feynman and Schwinger somehow manage to avoid infinity using their unique method of calculation. Their ""renormalisation"" technique which ultimately made QED practical earned them the Nobel in 1965. But, later same infinity in Yang Mill theory devastated quantum physics. For a very long time, physicist didn't know how to renormalise field equations those based on Yang Mill theory. Many thought future of any Quantum field theory is doomed. Then came the saviour, the brilliant Dutch physicist Gerard 't Hooft who single-handedly solved the renormalisation problem of prevalent Yang Mill theories. Renormalisation may be the critical milestone for modern Quantum field theory, but for a Yang Mill theory to fit with the experiment, other vital concepts need to be ensembled under a unified description. For Electroweak theory, Steven Weinberg explained the mechanism how the symmetry of nature be broken, hence giving mass to specific bosons: W & Z. While Sheldon Glashow had done the main heavy lifting for Electroweak theory, he outlined the ""gauge invariance"" nature of the theory which gives rise to W/Z/Photon (four bosons in total). Both of them earned the Noble of 1979 along with Abdus Salam. The author argued that Abdus Salam was given the Nobel due to political reason. While Abdus Salam's mentor John Clive Ward was ignored entirely.Now a few interesting points from this book:-----------------------Nature of an electron:-----------------------An electron is a point particle, i.e. it doesn't have any spatial dimensions. So, what will happen if we try to zoom into an electron? Because an electron carries an electric charge, this seemingly simple question becomes much complicated. The strength of the electric field depends on the distance, known as the inverse square rule or 1/r^2. As distance increase, the strength of the field decreases. But if we keep zooming toward an electron and as the distance approaches zero, the field strength becomes infinite. This Infinite electric field gives an electron a fractal-like structure. Under a microscope (if such a thing exists!), an electron will look like a boob of negative charge in the middle, and a swarm of virtual particles surrounding the boob. No matter how many times we zoom in, the same picture will repeat itself, infinitely. -------------Heavy Light:-------------We all know the light is nothing but a cloud of the photon. Interestingly, there is another kind of light called the ""heavy light,"" which is the cloud of the Z boson. Inside an atom, the electron and the proton not only exchange photons but something, they also exchange the heavy light or Z boson. As a result, technically, the light we know is a mixture photon and Z, this ratio of this mixing is known as the ""Weinberg angle"".--------------------------------------------------Mass, Superconductivity and broken symmetry:--------------------------------------------------What I understood, ""symmetry"" and ""gauge invariance"" are somehow related. Gauge invariance means if the ""result"" of a particular measurement doesn't change regardless of the change of the ""method"" or the ""units"" of the measurement. In physics, this aspect of nature always gives rise to massless boson. If for some reason a specific ""symmetry"" is broken, we say, that particular ""symmetry"" is hidden, and therefore ""gauge invariance"" results in massive boson.One of the strange manifestations of such broken symmetry is ""mass"". It is difficult to grasp that we have ""mass"" because nature is hiding something from our human perception! Another interesting aspect of hidden symmetry is Superconductivity. In case of Superconductivity, nature hides the electrometric force, often known as ""symmetry"" or ""conservation"" of electric charge. And, nature does this by giving mass to photons. Inside a Superconductor, a photon is a massive particle; hence electrometric force becomes extremely short range force, so narrow its ranged become as if such force does not exist. What happens to Z boson (as well as W) in a natural world occurs to photon inside a superconductor.----------------------------------Longitudinal vs Transverse wave:----------------------------------I guess all high school goer knows the difference between this two. But, there is one difference that I never knew before. The transverse wave is a 2D wave, only massless particle like the photon can have such wave. On the other hand, the longitudinal wave is a 3D wave, and only the massive particles can create such wave. Plasma, as well as the ionosphere of earth, interact with light; consequently, the usual transverse light wave becomes longitudinal when travelling through such cloud of ions. This behaviour of light inside Plasma instigated an idea to physicist Philip Anderson on how the symmetry is broken in the presence of a field, later known as Higgs field."
8,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44383006-adrian,4,"I have always been fascinated by the whole business of the unification of the world of the electron and the photon with the so-called weak force that mediates radioactive decay. As someone with an undergraduate physics degree and a PhD and subsequent career in MRI physics, I have a bit of an advantage over an “average layperson,” but in fact I have none of the relevant background to understand the technicalities of quantum electrodynamics (QED), let alone quantum field theory (QFT), other than the most basic knowledge of introductory quantum mechanics. Over the last thirty or so years, there has been a growing genre of books by leading theoretical physicists, who have attempted to explain their conceptually extraordinary vision of our world to the layperson using metaphors and simplified models. They often write extremely clearly, but there is always a limit to how much intuitive understanding can be communicated when the subject matter is truly so impenetrably difficult to grasp. Over the years, I have found this frustrating. There is the initial excitement that I am going to develop a rather meaningful intuition about the way in which the physical universe is apparently built, only to have my hopes dashed by some terribly important key concept that keeps eluding my understanding.Nowadays, I have more time on hand to ponder these great issues. Frank Close's book has certainly helped to reawaken my interest. It focusses on the history of how the Standard Model of the elementary particles and forces of nature was built over the last fifty or so years. It mixes some very clear explanations of the basic concepts with a detailed account of the jostling of some of the physicists for Nobel glory. Close goes into almost painful detail about missed opportunities, the way posterity has seemingly passed over a number of the most important players, and how a few of these became embittered while most seem at least in public to have been good sports and simply enjoyed the ride. At times, I found the descriptions of the politics and twists of fate rather obscured the flow of the scientific concepts themselves. What I did find remarkable was how several of the key papers were actually the first published papers that the graduate students doing the research had ever written. In many cases, their academic supervisors were of course visionaries themselves, but there were plenty of examples of young prophets being shouted down by their older supposed superiors.The title, The Infinite Puzzle, suggests that the book will focus mostly on the intricate questions concerning whether QFTs can be properly renormalized to avoid the generation of infinitely large answers that are physically nonsensical. It starts by reviewing how this was shown to be possible for QED, which involves a simple local symmetry (the phase of the electron's wave-function) and a massless gauge photon. Problems are shown to arise in a mathematical description of the weak force, where the corresponding symmetry is more complicated, thereby predicting three gauge bosons, two of which must carry an electric charge and so must have mass. (The massive nature of these bosons also makes sense, since the weak force is known to be carried only a very short distance.) But the original Yang-Mills theory based on gauge invariance allowed only massless gauge bosons, reflecting the identical energies of the symmetrical states. The premise goes that the weak force symmetry is somehow hidden, as in superconductivity, which allows for massive gauge bosons to arise. Shortly after the Big Bang, the enormous initial temperature of the universe dropped so that the initial symmetry somehow gets rotated in a special way (and thereby hidden) to create the three massive weak force gauge bosons while also keeping the QED gauge boson massless as required.I have not attempted to explain any of the jargon in order to keep this concise. It will therefore doubtless be a completely meaningless sort of jabberwocky to any reader not already somewhat familiar with these ideas. Anyway, this is the stage where I have always got stuck. One thing Close does hammer home is that it is local symmetry that is important for gauge theories of QFT. But the theories of Weinberg et al. suggest that the electroweak force that we see today has crystallized out in such a way that the original symmetry has become hidden by being rotated by the same special Weinberg angle everywhere in space. So I imagine this is a local symmetry that has somehow become crystallized out into a single global direction, analogous to one huge ferromagnetic domain. I believe this is where the non-zero expectation value for the Higgs field comes in. Does it automatically find the same minimum value everywhere in space and so causes the symmetry to break identically everywhere? Is this somehow a collective phenomenon (like superconductivity and ferromagnetism) that occurs over all space in the universe? As for how on earth this mechanism causes the weak force gauge bosons to acquire mass, I still have not the faintest idea. This is what I mean by the frustration about these metaphors that take you only so far and then dump you in the middle of a conceptual desert. Nevertheless, I did come away from reading this book with a far better overall idea of what sort of issues were involved in putting together a consistent Standard Model. Although I have no idea how the Higgs mechanism works, I sort of get the idea that Yang-Mills theory survives because the requisite symmetries are ultimately still there and so a gauge invariance still applies, requiring gauge bosons that don't have to be massless.Close then moves on to the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) model of the strong force. His historical overview tells us how the fractional charge of quarks came to be accepted after much initial resistance, how the proposal of a yet more complicated symmetry of three “color” charges enabled yet another Yang-Mills theory to be devised, with eight (presumed massless) gluons as the gauge bosons for QCD. At this stage, Close reckons that the reader is comfortable that this too must be renormalizable, and focusses on some of the other quirks of the quark model, including the fact that they have been shown experimentally to act almost independently when they are in very close proximity. My copy of the book was reprinted in 2013 and so Close was also able to add a revised ending that covers the 2012 Large Hadron Collider (LHC) results confirming a sighting of the elusive Higgs boson.Towards the end, Close uses an analogy about cars colliding to explain why it is more efficient to have protons and antiprotons crash into each other rather than have protons simply crashing into a stationary target. He claims that a car moving at some speed colliding with a stationary car with the brakes off will cause less damage than two cars each travelling towards each other at half the speed of the original car. But if I decide to run in the same direction as the first car but at half speed, the first case becomes equivalent to the second case, so by very simple notions of “relativity” the physics must be identical. I can only assume that Close got confused as a result of making each car go at half speed in the second case in order to make too fair a comparison. Presumably, a particle accelerator designed to speed up protons to smash into a stationary target can be used with the same acceleration components to speed up protons and antiprotons to the same speed as in the initial design specification, thereby gaining its advantage over the stationary target.The story as presented by Close details how often several physicists were thinking independently along very similar lines. At the time, their ideas were often greeted with scorn by many of their more senior colleagues. The fact that these quite revolutionary concepts were dreamed up by more than one physicist somehow enables a layperson like myself to view the whole enterprise with less skepticism. The overall theory of a unified SU3xSU2xU1 set of symmetries sounds so elegant, but the details, and the mathematics, seem so horrendously complicated. The universe appears to have taken some remarkable twists and turns to arrive at the world that we and experimental physicists see today. At times, the whole thing still reminds me a bit of the Emperor and his new clothes! Then again, the universe evidently is an utterly weird place when you stop to think about it.The LHC cost an awful lot of money and its realization seems to have been driven at least to some extent by a certain amount of ego. Was it worth it? At some level one must surely marvel at such an outpouring of human ingenuity, both theoretical and technical. But it seems to me that, as the “microscopes” grow larger and the theorists somehow magically do manage to come up with theories that explain, predict and reasonably neatly organize the myriad of experimental results, instead of really answering anything truly fundamental they simply create increasingly more bizarre questions that become ever harder to answer."
9,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5865312-long-nguyen,5,"If you are fascinated at all with recent (and by recent, I mean the latter half of the 20th century) development in physics, and the major players involved, then this book is for you. I am of the personal belief that even though science at its best is about the world, what makes science human is the people behind it. And they, like you or I, have feelings, aspirations, and interests. They also make mistakes, sometimes benign, sometimes tragic.Despite my general knowledge, this book still has places that roughed me up. I suspect that a casual reader with little/no prior experience will become frustrated, especially as you get further along. That being said, I enjoyed the historical context that the book provides; the fact that most of the events mentioned in the book happened within the author's lifetime, and for those of us younger, a mere half century ago, makes it all the more exciting. Why exciting? Because we've learned so much, so recently. The world is far more fascinating than we have imagined, and in all likelihood more than we could ever imagine. Also, the story of Salam and Ward would make a drama worthy of theater. I leave the reader of this review the luxury of discovering the story for him/herself."

The author tries to build a story out of the physicists involved but it doesn’t quite come alive, maybe because the cast list is too long.

12,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4126361-behzad,4,"The Infinity Puzzle: Quantum Field Theory and the Hunt for an Orderly Universe was published in late 2011, just as experimental physicists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) were homing in on the long-sought Higgs particle. In this book, British particle physicist Frank Close successfully meets two very difficult challenges.First, Close provides a non-mathematical but honest account of the most important developments in theoretical elementary particle physics over the last several decades. It is an account that a reader with no physics background can follow, even as Close avoids reducing his presentation to what has been called ""physics porn."" (The Higgs is the God Particle! Quantum Theory = Buddhism! Etc.) Second, Close offers a detailed history of the competing claims to the multiple Nobel Prizes awarded in recent decades as a result of these developments, relying not on the potentially faulty memories of self-interested participants, but on a paper record that includes diaries, conference proceedings, and unpublished papers.This second challenge involves accurately telling a human story of ordinary vanities and anxieties. Abdus Salam's name was joined to that of Steven Weinberg in the ""Weinberg-Salam"" theory of electroweak interactions, eventually allowing Salam to share the 1979 Nobel Prize with Weinberg (and Sheldon Glashow). Salam's long campaign for the prize included writing his own letter of recommendation, and sending it to a distinguished friend to forward to to Nobel Prize Committee. Ironically, given Salam's long and fruitful career, he won the prize for a theory to which he may not have deserved having his name attached. ""Tiny"" Veltman, a giant-sized Dutch physicist, inspired and guided his brilliant student Gerard 't Hooft to overcome enormous mathematical challenges in proving that a class of theories to which Weinberg-Salam belongs give sensible non-infinite results for experimentally measurable quantities. Veltman felt sidelined by his star student's rapid rise, but eventually joined him in Sweden to share with him the 1999 Nobel Prize. Peter Higgs's name became attached to a mechanism for which at least six other physicists can also claim some credit. Now Higgs and others wait to find out who will share in a future Nobel. (The Nobel is given only to living persons.) Then there are those who did not win a Nobel, even as they may have deserved it. They include Salam's close and frequent collaborator John Ward, who may have missed out on the 1979 prize because of his personality, and the Nobel rule that a single prize may not be shared by more than three persons. To make Ward feel worse, he believed that he was also cheated out of being called the Father of the British Hydrogen Bomb.These are stories we can all understand because, at bottom, they are not fundamentally different from the race for, say, a National Book Award, to say nothing of the Oscars. Even the best physicists are all too human, at least when it comes to seeking recognition and, perhaps, immortality.Close's other goal -- essentially to give an honest but comprehensible account of quantum field theory -- is far more difficult to attain. The basic problem here is that, at this stage in our development, the only language we humans have been able to learn that Nature also speaks is mathematics. Eugene Wigner spoke of ""the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences."" Conversely, it is only reasonable that the non-mathematical languages we have developed to help us survive are utterly inadequate for describing the behavior of particles that are many billions of times smaller than us. Mathematics, however effective, is not a language we all speak. Like the Bible in Latin, to be read only by priests, it seems that the Laws of Nature are written in a language reserved for a priesthood of science. So, in explaining their theories to the public, physicists are reduced to giving highly imperfect analogies. In trying to describe how the Higgs field may give rise to the mass, or inertia, of some particles, Close includes an often-told analogy to a person moving through a crowd, slowed down as others approach her and then move away. He recalls watching a film clip of a crowd gathered in an auditorium in Dallas, waiting for John F. Kennedy to arrive. As news of his assassination arrived instead, members of the audience would move towards the announcer to hear him and then move back, to be followed by others who approached and receded.There is an alternative to relying on such analogies, or to trying to learn all the mathematics necessary to appreciate the real stuff. It is is to give an account that, as the story unfolds, develops along the way the minimum mathematics necessary to follow along. Close avoids this approach, perhaps because of the common advice that the sales of a popular physics book are inversely proportional to the number of equations it contains, and also surely because any serious development of the advanced physics that is Close's subject cannot be followed without first understanding multiple layers of more elementary concepts, in math and physics: it is hopeless to try to understand quantum field theory without first understanding group theory (math) and the quantum mechanics of atoms (physics), which is hopeless to understand without understanding matrices (math) and the classical mechanics of particles and waves (physics), which is hopeless to understand without understanding calculus (math) and kinematics (physics). (Gerald 't Hooft, the 1999 Nobel Laureate, gives a sense of the enormous challenge that awaits the person who sets out on a path of real understanding by offering a list of resources available on the web.)The master of teaching physics by developing as little mathematics as possible while giving a highly insightful conceptual account was Richard Feynman, probably physicists' own favorite physicist (with the possible exception of Einstein.) I love this video of Feynman, talking about the pleasure of finding out how the world works. He also talks about winning the first Nobel prize discussed in Close's book, and how he hates all such awards. At bottom, they are not that different from an honor society to which Feynman was elected in high school, whose members spent most of their time trying to decide who else to allow into the society.

13,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5719671-frank-peters,4,"The author has a very pleasant writing style, and with the exception of the beginning and end the book was captivating. For reasons that I don’t understand (so cannot state anything objective), I found it hard to get into initially. But, after 40-50 pages, I was caught. I feel a bit sorry for a few of the historic physicists. At least one was clearly not liked by the author, such that by the time I finished the book, I felt (emotionally) that he did not deserve his Nobel. Then there was Bjorken, whom the author clearly believes has been robbed of a Nobel prize, and ensures that the reader feels the same way. Unfortunately, near the end the author fully abandons science to discuss the politics of CERN and big science surrounding experimental particle physics. This part was downright boring, and I almost abandoned the book. Much of what was written assumes a fair knowledge of physics. I think it may be hard for someone who did not have (at very least) and amateurs’ interest in science to enjoy. But I liked it enough that I have already recommended it to two other physicists I know."

As for the way the book is organized and it’s clear presentation of the evolution of the ideas, 3 is more like it.Perhaps, a better way to present it would have been something along the lines of the following:Idea X - what it is, why it is important, its interrelationships with ideas Y,ZHistory and gossip about the individuals involved, their search down the wrong or right path, the missed opportunities. This too is interesting, but as presented in the book, intertwined with the ideas themselves, it tended to obscure the reader’s understanding of the core ideas.Perhaps in a future version? As the book’s publication preceded the LHC’s Higgs verification, it could stand a new, updated edition."

Frank Close steps the reader through each development, organizing the narrative around the work of each leading scientist.The development is complex with the concepts of the Higgs mechanism and quarks finally leading to Quantum Chromodynamics which explains the strong force. It is surprising how much of the work was done on a mathematical basis that was only tested with the development of big particle accelerators.The book shows how the scientific process works, with individuals building on the work of others to generate new ideas leading to theories as to how matter is constructed. Experiments then verify or disprove these theories, sometimes providing surprises that lead to new areas of work."

This book is yet another masterpiece to not grasp knowledge about quantum physics - its development from the discovery of weak nuclear force, unification of electromagnetism and weak nuclear force, to understand superconductivity, Higgs boson etc. And not to forget it was really a pleasure to read through the mini-biographies of some great particle physicists. This book is definitely not for starters who do not have any prior knowledge in physics. You will definitely lose interest after some time but if Physics is your love, then this book is a must read to appreciate what describes the 'Cosmic Onion'.I think I'll end up reading all Close's books.

I believe the author is a super symmetry theorist as that is mentioned many times throughout the book but without an endorsement. Very good descriptions of the Higgs boson (the book was written a year before the higgs ""discovery"") throughout the book but not enough to keep interest. One thing I've never read before is that physicists are now looking at the big bang as a particle accelerator to reach higher energies beyond current human technology. Not a book I'd read again."

29,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,4,"Since its completion in 2008, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been the focus of a lot of news coverage. It is by far the largest scientific project in history, and very likely the last such project for the foreseeable future. And yet, it has been fairly difficult to explain to the general public the exact purpose of LHC and what sorts of questions are the scientists trying to answer by culling over its experimental results. One of the things that LHC is trying to find is the putative “Higgs boson,” whose existence has been postulated for almost half a century, and without which much of our understanding of particle physics would be incomplete. However, the reasons for the need of the Higgs boson are very hard to express in the layman’s terms. It is the particle that gives all the other particles mass, and without it (or something like it) it would be impossible to justify many of the theoretical results that have proven so incredibly insightful over the past few decades. Some popularizes of science have even resorted to calling it “the God particle,” which in my opinion is one of the most unfortunate and gratuitously obscure “descriptions” of any phenomenon in all of science.In “The Infinity Puzzle” Frank Close delves deep into the theoretical background that has lead to the postulation of the Higgs Boson. Higgs Boson turns out to be an indispensible ingredient for the theoretical formulation of the electroweak theory – the unified theory of electromagnetic and weak interactions. The modern formulation of that theory, the so-called Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model, has come at the end of a long series of abortive attempts at unification, and has been followed by even a longer succession of theoretical and experimental verifications. The discovery of the Higgs Boson would be the final validation of that model, and it would also potentially shed some light on the rest of the Standard Model of particles and fields. This book primarily focuses on personal histories of many of the actors that have contributed to the electroweak theory and experiment, going all the way back to the middle of the twentieth century. These are fascinating personal stories that have been long overdue for a comprehensive popular treatment. Even people like myself whose professional careers have been influenced by the electroweak and similar theories (known as “gauge theories”) have a rudimentary knowledge of their historical development. However, I was hoping that this book would be more focused on physics in its own right, and much less concerned with history. I’ve read several other books by Frank Close (“Nothing: A very Short introduction,” “Neutrino”) and from reading those I’ve come impressed by Close’s ability to present complex physical ideas in an accessible and highly informative manner. “The Infinity Puzzle” turns out to be a very different kind of book. Aside from being overly historical, it also spends too much time on “inside baseball” minutia and arcana that even those who are inside baseball will probably just skip over. I am really not interested in getting the information straight on who presented which scientific talk in what form back in the early 1970s, and I can’t imagine that most readers of this book would care much about this either. This is a very interesting and accessible book, but I am afraid that the choice of topics might be too recondite for the kind of audience that this book is aimed at."
30,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6313503-debsuvra-ghosh,5,"A comprehensive chronological overview of how progresses were made in the field of particle physics spanning almost a century till 2010. The author collected extensive amount of information, interviewed people involved and sorted through that gargantuan heap of information like a human equivalent of CERN sorting through LHC data. A great title for people who's interested in the history of particle physics."
31,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,3,"If your goal is to get an overview of modern physics from a historical perspective The Infinity Puzzle would nicely serve as one of two books to describe the second half of the 20th century (you would need another to cover gravitation and cosmology, perhaps A Brief History of Time). Frank Close, an English particle physicist, begins describing the infinity puzzle by taking up some of the logical holes left in quantum mechanics following its founding in the early 1900's. The reader is then lead through the development of the quantum field theories and the standard model of particle physics culminating in the description of the Higgs Boson and the Large Hadron Collider. Close makes special emphasis of how symmetry, and the breaking of symmetry, has guided the development of modern physics. The importance that symmetry plays is summarized here:This has inspired an intriguing thought: Our present material universe, filled with structures--atoms, crystals, galaxies, and even life--may itself be an example of hidden symmetry. In the beginning, goes the mantra, the universe was created in a state of perfection, where a single superforce ruled. Then, according to the mathematics, at a temperature of a billion-billion degrees, all changed: As beautiful patterns appear when mist freezes on a frosty windowpane, so order and structure emerged from the primeval uniform hot soup of the Big Bang as the cosmos cooled. Disparate forces--which today we perceive as the strong, electromagnetic, and weak forces (and gravity)--and distinct varieties of particle, such as electrons and quarks, were born. It is because the original symmetry became hidden that the variety of forms required for an evolving universe, leading to life itself, emerged.I find it powerful that themes from Genesis--purity of design and eventual corruption--survive to this day embedded in the most modern and fundamental theories. Some people come to blows over the literal differences rather than finding the more subtle correspondences. Overall, this book is a thorough and even treatment of the historical developments of modern particle physics. It may be rather monotone for the average reader as one discovery sounds much like the previous one and the characterizations don't allow the players to stand out very much. Additionally, the title should probably read something much like ""The Struggle for the Nobel Prize"" as much of the latter half of the book is dedicated to the who-said-whats leading up to the Nobel Prize. This is a predictable downfall of describing developments that are less than 50 years old."
32,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366087-randy,4,"Professor Close is a wonderful writer... he does a fine job of inserting and explaining some of the theoretical aspects of the science, without overwhelming us poor laymen.This is a chronology of the theories of matter and the forces acting on matter.... to enjoy it you should have a basic notion what a quark is even if you cannot name the various types of quarks or explain how they do what they do, or how they do it.He compares the role of the Higgs boson in giving matter its mass to the role of the photon in giving electromagnetic energy its force. Very helpful.A secondary theme (which gets in the way, IMHO) is a setting the record straight... Professor Close describes how Dr Abdus Salam, in his super political campaign to obtain a Nobel Prize, effectively elbowed other better candidates out of the limelight. He underlines how others (especially Ward and Bjorken) deserve more credit.The third theme is the history of the Large Hadron Collider, at CERN in Switzerland; what it seeks to discover, how the proposal to build it was successfully pursued (and why the U.S. counterpart, the Superconducting SuperCollider, failed).I was fascinated by the book. I began reading it, got perhaps a third of the way through, then put it aside for a month or three. When I picked it back up again, I found I needed to begin again from page 1... it's that complicated a story.One of the reasons I prefer inorganic chemistry and physics to biology (especially the taxonomy of life and the intricacies of genetics) is the finite-ness of the operating theater. Life is so complex, it seems random and not subject to generalization, and beyond my low tolerance for encompassion.This story veers in that direction for a while, but then brings me back to a comfort zone. There are so many new particles and possible particles! Each one inhabits a cell on a huge matrix and the inter-relationships are seemingly random.But they are all interrelated... The concept of symmetry breaking is the key for me, and the book is very illuminating in its descriptions of symmetry breaking.So, if you have read Brian Greene's works but still don't quite ""get"" the Higgs Mechanism, give this one a try. "
33,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The book is more about the discoverers, their machinations, wins and losses rather than the discoveries.To be clearer, the author does track various QED discoveries of the sixties to the eighties. By not focussing on the first half of the twentieth century which mostly fills all the popular science books (no Einstein or Bohr etc here!), the author has a lot more to offer. Yet, the book implicitly presupposes its reader to be extremely well-acquainted with the complex subject. One is required to know things like fermions/bosons, SU2/SU3, ""color"" etc as there is little introduction to these any elementary standard model concepts that were not a substantial discussion or debate points in the research papers of the time.There is little effort in putting the whole things together as well. With the subject matter being more of the rivalry between the scientists (centered around those in the UK), the tale is largely chronological. The author spends huge time on the process and the papers that led to various conclusions including detailed discussions of the wrong turns and the dates when various bigwigs accepted/rejected conclusions that proved Nobel-worthy later. For the experts, all this must be illuminating and fascinating. For the lay readers - those looking for a good overview of quantum physics from the early days or based on the whole picture as evident today - the subject matter is narrow and the discussions are either too complex, too detailed or too desultory. Of course, it is fascinating and at times even disturbing to read about the way acclaimed scientists slug it out in their quest which is as much about the fame as for the hidden truths (at least for some).

34,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30210549-adam-zabell,3,"Solid history lesson on why we built the LHC, and the vagaries of science-in-practice instead of science-as-mythology.Like many ""first person pop sci"" books (aka ""The Double Helix""), this one builds to a climax. Here, it's when Gerard 't Hooft made a 10 minute presentation on his math showing you could renormalize Yang–Mills Fields and thus bring the weak force into the fold with the electromagnetic. What was unique here, and which I really liked, is how the last third of the book continues the history describing ""what happens after.""The scientists are also, to a man (I don't recall seeing a woman's name among the list), perfectly human. Some are a little quirky, some are frustratingly petty, and everyone has at least one ""wrong place/wrong time"" blind spot which kept them from their most perfect self. These may be physicists instead of structural biologists, but I know my tribe and this is what they look like.This may be simplified science for the general audience, but it is by no means simple. If you want something as easy to read as ""A Brief History of Time"" or ""Atkins' Molecules"" then you're going to be disappointed. But if you've taken a college level physics class (or survived P.Chem.) there are moments where your brain will make connections that were once tenuously rote-memorized. Discovering how some of the nomenclature was built ('quarks' instead of 'partons' was fascinating) was a treat. And, if not, relax and keep reading. You don't need to understand 100% of the book to get a great glimpse into why modern physics cares more about fields than billiards, and why we're so nearly sure that the theory we have today is the right one."
35,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19672057-cade,2,"This book is really just about the history of quantum field theories. It describes the men who made the discoveries and how each one contributed his piece to the final edifice. It does not really bother trying to explain what quantum field theory is or what it means. This is a departure from the author's other books I have read previously (Neutrino and Antimatter)). Perhaps this is because the nature of quantum field theory is too technical to be amenable to a non-technical presentation.Although I am a fan of Frank Close, I found this book disappointing. The historical aspects have such a long laundry list of names that I struggled to keep them straight, and then the content quickly became almost meaningless. Also, since multiple groups/people were almost invariably making related progress at any time, the book constantly tells the story of one group over the course of a few months or a couple years and then jumps back in time and starts over again describing the concurrent work of another group. While it is hard to imagine how else the author could have organized the book, this constant temporal rewinding further obfuscated the actual progression of events for me. It is hard to keep track of what each scientist is doing new/better in the narrative because it is hard to remember which other discoveries have already been made/announced/published while you are reading the second or third account of a particular era."

I like the liquid water / snowflake symmetry breaking example quite a bit. That's the upside to this book.The downside was that 75% of the book was a ""cult of personality"" / history minutia / repetitive discussions about the Nobel prize. Yes, the Nobel prize is a big deal. But I'd be interested to do a word count on this book: I bet the common words (the, a, an, and) do their usual distribution, but I bet Nobel is mentioned over 500 times. And how many times is it necessary to point out only three people can get the Nobel in a single year?!? There was tedious description of driving around in various people's sports cars, serving wine at various workshops, or (most painfully) looking at poorly remembered hallway conversations to try and get out who should and should not be thinking about their Nobel prize. I remember a passage about ""a possible series of three Tuesday afternoon lecture series in 1967 that no one can quite remember if they happened"" and what the ramifications for Nobel prizes are.I wanted to learn more physics and QFT. A little ""stories of the people involved"" is ok. But I think a better title would be: ""The Physics Nobel Prize: vague memories of people who may or may not have deserved and or may or may have not gotten the prize"" There were interesting physics discussion, but that was not that major focus of this book."
37,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8763974-robert,5,"Excellent history of late 20th century elementary physics, especially from about 1946 through 1979, while the Standard Model of particle physics was being developed, from quantum electrodynamics (QED) through the Higgs mechanism through electroweak unification, though also extending through the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) era. I found it utterly fascinating, but it may be a bit esoteric for some. This is a history book, not a physics book, so there's little to no math, though it does explain the history of the physics, and does get somewhat technical in that regard.There is much of discussion about who should or should not have gotten credit for which Nobel-prize winning idea, especially the 1979 prize for the unified theory of electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force (electroweak theory).The title concerns the mathematical puzzles associated with the theory and how they were eventually solved. Along the way, many theoretical calculations of probability would come up with infinite values, which of course makes no sense - thus the puzzle. It turned out that many of these infinities cancelled each other out exactly, leaving finite values, and today's Standard Model now correctly predicts results with fantastic accuracy.The author is a physicist who lived through this era when we discovered so much of the fundamental nature of the universe we live in."
38,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4320811-john,4,"A fascinating history of how physicists achieved a unified understanding of most of the forces of nature in the last half-century or so. The book attempts to convey some of this understanding to non-specialists but also explains why it did not come easily. The question of renormalization, ie, proving that the theories would lead to finite and meaningful results, motivates the title of the book. The author also devotes a lot of space to the human story and the thorny questions of who had priority in the overlapping, more-or-less independent paths to discovery, how Nobel prizes were attributed and why some have yet to receive their due recognition. The book's version of history, while not claiming to be finally conclusive, is backed up by copious notes and source references. Having had the privilege of being a student of two important figures in the story, I was particularly interested to learn more about their roles. A second edition of the book would be worthwhile. It could include the discovery of the Higgs boson that took place since publication. Some of the later chapters could also be revised to eliminate some repetition. "

It is also a fascinating account of the personalities and politics behind these discoveries. Whilst Close pulls a few punches, it is clear that the world of physics is not all like minded boffins marching harmoniously onwards. The accounts of some of the feuds and arguments between scientists form the most entertaining parts of the book and are well described. Close even turns detective at points as he searches for the true history. The science bits occasionally left me floundering, but the basic principles are rendered understandable enough, with good use of example and analogy. I would have liked a few more illustrations and particularly photographs of the leading players, some of whom are not depicted at all. I'm not sure that this book would suit someone new to these topics, but if you have some familiarity with the theories of particles and forces, Close provides a fascinating account of the field."
40,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38760-matt,4,"Interesting book about how the 4 powers of Quantum Physics were all brought into the current 'Standard Model'. Similar to Fermat's Enigma, this book follows the scientists who made the major breakthroughs over 70+ years that have coalesced into the invention of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.This book does a good job of explaining how the 'infinity problem' of Quantum Electrodynamics was resolved with renormalization for electromagnetism, quarks for the strong force and bosons for the weak force. There were many other advancements in between necessary to make these discoveries possible.Although the terminology gets more difficult and harder to picture as the story progresses, it makes you appreciate the difficult concepts these physicists dealt with. It does get a little hung up on who won the Nobel Prize and who got left out, but other than that a great read.Also, whoever coined the term Quantum Flavordynamics deserves a Nobel just for that."
41,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7403320-jeffrey,4,"This is a pretty good book about the history of particle physics late 1940s to about 2010. It's a pretty interesting read and does help one get a better understand that science isn't always a smooth progression from start to finish. It also gives you a feel for the types of rivalries, political pressures, and personalities can get entwined with the endeavours of understanding the universe.Necessarily to understand the progression of physics, the author regularly goes into some detail trying to put the discoveries and theories into the proper context. At the risk of repeating other reviews, this can be quite dry and fairly mathematical. That being said I do think I learned a fair bit anyways. This leads to sections of the book is fantastic and there are sections when the book is just boring, which I'm sure has to do more with the subject matter then the author or writing style."

So while I was happy to learn a lot of details about the Standard Model and its construction, I wasn't so interested in the details of who published what paper when, and what conversations they had about who discovered things first.If you are a physicist who wants to know who to properly credit for various discoveries, this is the book for you.

At times it almost reads like an homage to those deserving individuals who missed winning the Nobel Prize for various reasons. Frank Close, an Oxford particle physicist, who knows most of the others involved in the story (and the physics) well, attempts to take as objective a view as possible, having gone through a huge number of archived documents and interviewed the men themselves -- well, at least those who were still alive."

Both the people/stories are discussed, as are the theories themselves, as much as they can be explained without too much math/physics for those of us who are not quantum physicists. The writer is a theoretical physicist who worked during the times the theory was formed, and knows the people, and complements his memories with interviews with many of the players. I appreciated his balanced, cautious approach when history is not very clear."
45,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15284685-zach,5,"Awesome book. I enjoyed how everything was explained when presented and the summaries after every 2-3 chapters were a nice recap. It was also nice to hear the 'stories' of each of the theorists involved and how there is still some lasting debate as to who actually discovered what and when. I would recommend to the interested reader that it would be very useful to first read and understanding somewhat the birth of quantum, circa 1900, as well as a brief overview of QED (I recommend Feynman for QED). "
46,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1037250-gabriel,4,"This was a fun and interesting book on the history of particle physics. As a professional in the field, I can attest that the usual, formal physics education is full of lore and urban legends about how we figured out what we think we know, but Close provides a lot of perspective and new information here. The Infinity Puzzle is definitely worth reading for history buffs or fans of science. It's one failing as a history text is the lack of any attempt to tie the narrative into a broader picture of the world, but as a story of the ivory tower from the tower, looking in, this book succeeds."
47,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1563200-stephen-davis,4,"Provides an overview of the development of particle physics and the gradual understanding of the strong and week forces along with the new concepts to help make the math work out. It approaches the journey from the various scientists involved, and how they made steps forwards and steps backwards along the way."
48,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19123495-jeff,4,"Listened to it on audio -very good - starting to understand the whole attempt to join the very large with the very small, including quantum gravity, and the ""perturbatively non-renormalizable"" (or asymtoptically unsafe) infinities involved. I am re-reading it on Kindle, bits at a time, to try to understand and retain it better."
49,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,2,This book was an absolute slog for me and was much more of a blow-by-blow on the development of the standard model. While there are some pauses to explain things the latter half of the book is almost a forensic work as the author tried to determine priority. If the whole book had been this way or had been less in the weeds regarding technical issues I feel I would have enjoyed it more.
50,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14624441-kumar-ishan,5,"What began as a theory for photon-electron interaction, QED with its Infinity started an era of particle physics. In this non-linear epic, titans discovered distinct forces of nature and partially united them. Written in 2011, this book sums up with the possible discovery of Higgs Boson. But without end, it still continues, as today scientists after the discovery struggles to unite them all."
51,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51782736-michael-funck,3,"This is a pretty interesting look at the development of quantum field theory over the past 60 years, leading up to the possible discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. Some of the blow by blow accounts of discovery get a little tiring but overall the story, players, and ideas are interesting."
52,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308754-brendan-mcauliffe,3,"This is good ( where else will you find "" Recall that structure occurs because fermions are like cuckoos, whereas bosons are like penguins.

53,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7959845-aline-soules,5,"So much is great about this book. The author makes quantum mechanics understandable as well as an adventure in discovery. As a reader, I felt caught up in the adventure and part of an exciting news story. It's not only fascinating, but timely, in light of recent discoveries."
54,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9617038-paul-guzman,4,"Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was written well, and the author made everything easy to understand for those of us who aren't physicists. The history of the entire process is really fascinating, and I would recommend this to anyone who may be interested in physics."
55,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273793-mark,2,"Spends A LOT of time focused on who and when theories were proposed (with emphasis on who should get the credit) and not so much on the content of the theories. While no doubt this is of great interest to many who have connections to the scientists, it didn't do much for me as a total outsider."
56,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2979157-david,5,"Not done with this yet... but it's an exciting book in that it combines the stories of the people involved in the discoveries and theoretical speculations, along with the timelines and explanations of the science as the book moves along, written for the general reader rather than the specialist."
57,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,3,"Interesting account of how we discovered Quantum Field Theory. I didn't quite understand all of it and I gotta be honest - particle physics is pretty crazy. I miss the proton + neutron + electron model, but progress marches on..."
58,0465021441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16567371-rob,2,"There are so many fascinating concepts in this book, but unfortunately they're buried under an avalanche of inadequate and confusing exposition, jumbled narrative, and poor prioritization.
