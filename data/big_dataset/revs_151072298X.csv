Its capacity is basically unchanged since the dawn of humanity, a feature that can be a problem in modern society with all its stress factors. But change is possible. Just go for a run.Psychiatrist Anders Hansen has compiled current research regarding brain development and physical activity, and written a somewhat repetitive book about it.The brain is the part of your body which benefits the most from exercise.The effects of physical activity are so extensive that you can call it a mental upgrade.Scientific studies show your creativity can increase 60 percent if you have been exercising before taking the testMemory tests have shown that people can improve the number of foreign words they learn by 20 percent while exercising.New brain cells are formed, and the brain is actually getting younger.And so it goes on. And on. And on.Yeah, yeah, Anders. I get it. You’re probably right. But being a complete physical wreck right now, due to illness, this book actually makes me feel my feeble excuse of a brain melting away even more. It’s quite depressing, you know. But I’ll try. Promise. Maybe tomorrow. And if I don’t, I’ve at least read another book."
1,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3844387-emelie,4,"Quite fitting that I finished the book just when I finally am about to get physiotherapy to aid my recovery. The book is about how the brain benefits from exercise - particularly fitness training like running or walking. It's a popular science book so Hansen describes in easy terms and wording what science, biology and evolution says about how and why the brain benefits from exercise. Hansen describes personal stories from his patiens as well, about a woman that came to the hospital really stressed out and how she got better just by exercising. Hansen does make a point that he doesn't dismiss medicine but that he thinks exercise is a major key point. To further his point he adds in evolution, and how the brain is wired to like running and moving about because the brain then thinks that you are out hunting for food and want to encourage that by making you feel great running. Maybe the book is a bit too sugary and raises exercises to the sky - are there scientists, results and discussions that doesn't agree on this? Hansen doesn't tell. I mean, there's no secret that exercise is good, and that it can help depression, strengthen you mentally, perhaps help against other diseases. But is exercise such a big curer all on it's own?I don't know. It was an interesting, easy read though, and food for thought and hopefully a good motivator to get better with exercise. "

When it comes to the effects of aerobics to human brain, in this regard, treated as a special part of the body, the knowledge is not so well established. The author is filling this gap in an excelent way. Some repetiveness in the writing style shoud be forgiven due to the importance and clear presentation of the message itself. A must read in the age of sedentarism."

I started excercising again in the beginning a couple of weeks ago and now I have made it a top priority to do it at least 3 times a week. I always ""knew"" that excercise was good, and it mostly felt nice afterwards. But I have never before felt this level of motivation. Now I know I just have to do it, and it is all thanks to being convinced by reading this book.Because of this impact I have to give it a five star rating."
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108060422-ella,1,"To be honest, this is an overrated book. Anders Hansen has gained popularity (especially in Sweden) and people who are desperate to be seen as intellectual claim to love him and his research. Sure, he makes a few good points, but he is very repetitive and the book could have been cut in half. Overall, it is an okay book that mostly gives scientifical explanations for things you already know."

Bottom line is simple enough: the most effective way to develop brain functioning is to keep on exercising. Low intensity is fine as long as exercising is regular. Author's way of writing is witty - he'd do a great career in solution sales.

12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60322420-filip,3,"Incredibly important message and the author continuously hammers home how exercise improves various aspects of the brain and our health in general. Somewhat repetitive and almost appears biased, but I haven't heard of much disputing the science behind it. Even though most people know that exercise is important, it helps to understand why and how impactful it actually is. I can feel my brain trying to diminish or discredit the benefits, as it has become an expert at finding excuses not to move. My theory is that we just don't want to hear it. I know I feel much worse when I stop exercising, such as when I've been sick and haven't started again. It's interesting to learn why that is to avoid falling into the trap of comfortably not starting again.Five stars for the message, but the book could've been shorter, more interestingly written, or have dived deeper into the anatomy of the brain."
13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826430-colette,4,"4.5 stars. This book is terrific. I learned so many amazing things about the brain and the benefits of physical movement. I’ve read several books about the brain, including Ratey’s “Spark,” and still learned more details and enjoyed updated research. The translation is well done. The writing is very accessible. The author’s personality shows through, but not in an annoying, preachy way. Like another reviewer said, if only a small fraction of Hansen’s claims are true, we should all be outside running. The chapters each focus on a different benefit. Super interesting. I think this is one I will recommend and revisit."
14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6205992-nina,5,"Learned so much from this book. So I'm just going to note down some ideas I took from the book, for my future self. Stress starts in the amygdala, which is the engine of HPA axis (interaction between hypothalamus, pituitary gland and adrenal gland). Amygdala has the size of an almond, we have one in both parts of the brain and it functions like an alarm system, it wakes us up when something puts us in danger. This little thing is what differentiates us from previous versions of humans before Homo Sapiens and Homo Erectus. This is one of the reasons why Homo Sapiens was the final version that survived, according to science anyway. The hunterer survived. The one that could stalk pray, kill it and eat it, the one who felt fear and had sense of danger. So the amygdala not only causes stress, but it's an important instinct for our survival. How it functions: the hypothalamus sends signals of danger to the pituitary gland, which further sends to the adrenal glands. The stress hormone is released into your bloodstream and makes your heart beat faster and harder. Amygdala can also be triggered by the stress function, it feeds on itself in a vicious circle. The hippocampus in turn, works like a break, so we dont overreact emotionally. Exercise leads to the creation of new brain cells which are extremely active. While training causes new hyperactive cells, instead of having more stress and anxiety, you become calm.Dopamine levels need to be stabilised/increased to be able to focus. By moving your body you can concentrate better, in general. Dopamine levels rise a few minutes after the training and remain there for several hours. It makes you feel sharp, focused and calm after exercising. The more intense the exercise, the better.Always choose running over walking! Effective medicine for improving concentration.Serotonin = calms overactive brain cells. Creates calm, harmony, inner strength. If you lack this, you are anxious and fretful.Noradrenaline = affects how alert, attentive and focused you are. Dopamine = Affects your motivation and drive. Good food and sex raises the levels and makes you want more. Same with drugs like cocaine and amphetamines. Dopamine is important for decision making and concentration. Persons suffering from depression have low levels of all the three substances, plus low levels of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factors), and fewer new brain cells are created. You can increase the level of all these substances by training. By reading this book you also realise the miracle that our bodies are, the way they are constructed and how everything is connected. Like with the brain, if it has a stroke, or very low amount of oxygen, the brain sends a rescue Squad in an effort to save itself - BDNF. Like the white blood cells produce antibodies to fight an infection. Or how the blood coagulates when you have an injury. Engaging in physical activity is one way to break the vicious circle of depression. You go out, you meet people, you become less solitary, you create new brain cells through moving. I didnt know that the brain has its own morphine (called endorphins) that are effective in suppressing pain and creating euphoria. Just like drugs (opium). Called ""runner's high"" by James Fixx, American long distance runner, getting euphoria after running long distances. Exercise has huge effect on memory, strengthened by physical activity. Hippocampus is the brain's memory center. It can enlarge with endurance exercises, rejuvenate with even two percent!To check the level of creativity: alternative uses test. Given one word, e.g.brick. Say as many ways as possible if using brick: building a wall, doorstopper, etc. There is a closeness between highly creative people (geniuses) and mentally ill (schizophrenic). Both cases have a huge flow of information and depends on the brain if its resilient enough. Physical activity makes us smarter. The more fit a person is, more IQ. Generally. Children's brain function better overall and do better academically if they are physically active. That's why is also important for kids to go out in their recess in between classes, play, run or walk. It works like a ""refresh"" button for the brain. Humans went from being hunter gatherers to agrarians, to industrialised , to digitalised era. Consequently, we move less and less. Nowadays we move around 6000/7000 steps a day, while our ancestors were walking around 18 000 steps a day. We've made gigantic changes in our lifestyle that have cut our need for physical activity in half. Conclusions: You should walk at least 30 minutes if you want good results. Every day. Ideally, run 45 minutes at least 3 times a week. Very important to raise heart rate. If you want to ensure the best possible conditions for yourself, stay physically active."
15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52247297-thepagemaster,4,"After having read some atrocious books on pedagogy, the time had come to immerse myself in something different and hopefully a bit more scientific than the aforementioned. As such, I picked up the book ”Hjärnstark”, written by a popular author by the name of Anders Hansen. It serves to explain how and why exercise is the best thing since Jesus. It seems that everyone’s talking about his work, and it launched him straight into the spotlight. I have been aware of the book’s existence for some time, and was initially skeptical, thinking it would be a mish mash of idealistic balderdash and wishful thinking. My preconceived pessimism is largely based on believing exercise to be a complete and utter waste of time. At least compared to say, reading or doing something creative. There are many reasons as to why I’ve been holding that notion. For one thing, if exercising is truly the magnificent miracle some have claimed it to be, then mailmen would be the happiest and most intelligent people on the planet, as opposed to scientists and people who clearly don’t exercise all that much. Of course, just as I wrote the previous sentence, I realize that if the intellects of mailmen were brilliant from the get-go, they would probably not be mailmen in the first place. Yet, as I came to discover, my assumptions about Hjärnstark didn’t hold much water.It didn’t take more than ten or fifteen pages for reading for me to realize that this guy might be on to something. The tone of the book is scientific, yet simple and accessible. The author pulls it off in a way that works, and apart from it being a little too repetitive, I don’t have much to hold against it. It’s one of the few modern works I think deserves the credit it’s gotten. The parallells and connections to the brain’s anatomy, functions, mechanisms and so on are many, and Hansen doesn’t lose the reader’s interest by digging too deep into the more advanced pieces of the puzzle. Rather, he states that if anyone is interested to learn more about it and in greater depth, they should check out the works cited on the final pages. The sources are vast in numbers and judging from a quick glance, also quite varied.As previously mentioned, the book does tend to get repetitive, and is in danger of veering off in the wrong direction at some points. Yet, like a good movie with an unexpected twist at the end, Hjärnstark redeems itself from falling into the pits of mediocrity, and it does so by a fantastic final chapter. It deals with the evolutionary history of mankind (which is something Hansen makes references to throughout the book), and presents some new research I was previously unaware of. What arrested my attention above all else was that researchers at the Max Planck-institute recently (2015) discovered a gene called ARHGAPIIB or something like that. Apparently, this gene is a fragment of an earlier gene, and if I’ve understood it correctly, it’s some form of mutation. Supposedly, it enables the growth of the brain’s cortex. According to the information given in the book, Homo Sapiens is the only species with this gene. Experiments have been conducted on mice, and from the limited amount of time that such research has been possible, they have observed some growth in the brains of the mice. Not only had there been growth, but the texture of their brains had become more wrinkled. In other words: more like the human brain. If this checks out or not I can’t say, but it’s certainly an interesting discovery. The myth of Adam and Eve comes to mind, where the forbidden fruit of knowledge catapulted them into the blooming buzzing confusion of the intellectual mayhem we presently find ourselves in.In summary, the author makes a convincing case when presenting and arguing for the legitimacy of his thesis. The simple setup and structure is highly compatible with the common folk, and one doesn’t have to be particurlarly scientific or academic in order to comprehend it. Instead of firing pulverizing criticism the author’s way, I’m now recommending it to my colleagues and will likely tell my friends about it as well. I also recommend it to YOU, who have endured this lengthy review, whatever your thoughts on exercise and its potential benefits may be. I may not dust my running shoes off any time soon, but I certainly have gotten some respect for the lifestyles of the healthier among us.4/5"
16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4184441-sofia,4,"A fascinating, fun and inspirational look into how regular exercise improves our brains and can help with anything from depression and anxiety to creativity and preventing dementia. I think we all know exercise is good for us, but I've never before understood to what extent our BRAINS need it. This book not only lays it out in a way that is easy to understand, it also lacks the judgmental tone of a lot of these ""motivational"" self-help and exercise books.In actuality, the author doesn't ask more of us than a 30-minute walk every day, and I think that's achievable for most of us. As a future teacher, I also appreciate the insight into how I can use exercise to help my students.If there are any drawbacks, it's that the book is a bit repetitive. It could also be considered ableist, not at all touching upon the conditions of someone bound to a wheelchair or such. However, this might just as well be due to the author not wanting to dabble in an area he doesn't have any expertise. His focus is on showing us how exercise develops, improves and sometime ever rejuvenates our brains, regardless of our physical conditions. And on that front, I think he does a great job."
17,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59182533-david-luthman,4,"A very interesting topic and worth taking to heart. It does become somewhat repetitive in a way but since he - for a layman such as myself at least - does go into some (simplified) details regarding the inner workings of the brain and its parts I found it good to get the repetition. After all, he did go through several different aspects such as stress, depression, focus, creativity which are quite diverse and the fact that working out - spoiler alert! - helps all of these areas then of course gets repeated in each chapter with some variation. And the message is worth repeating over and over:Get out and exercise!Everyone needs to hear the message inside of this book. Even if it’s just reading one of the chapters on a subject that relates more to that person, I think that would go a long way. And that does work quite well for this book I believe, as he cross-references to other chapters when he mentions something that he has explained previously, so that the reader can catch up on it if needed.Or you can do as I did and listen to the audiobook version while running. After all, that should help you remember it better according to the book! ;)"
18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28077762-mattias,4,"I am blown away by this book, if 20% is true then I think this it the book everyone should read. Humans are made to move, not sit in front of a computer screen every day. By doing as little little as running 3 times a week for 30-45 min with a heartbeat of 150 or more can actually improve your memory, remove depression, increase you IQ, start production of new brain cells and prevent dementis. All this by just running, even walking 5 days a week for 45 minutes can have similar outcome. If you did not have any motivation to exercise vascular cardio based training my this book will change your mind. From today I will not leave 1 day without minimum walking 10000 steps. Only complain is that it is only available in Swedish at the moment so I can not share it with my friends and the book is somehow a bit repetitive. Could have been 200 pages shorter."
19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24329080-hampus-wessman,5,"Good book about the effects that physical (cardio) exercise has on the brain. The book only discusses specifically this and is very explicit about that and why (which I personally find good). Great reading for anyone who is interested in what the latest research has to say about how we can protect and improve our brains and resilience to stress (and more) purely by exercising. This is good popular science and should be easy to understand for most people. Quite a quick read too, so I don't mind occasional repetitiveness. Exercise has nothing short of amazing effects on both general health and the brain. Great stuff to know about! It's getting easier and easier to make informed decisions about a healthy lifestyle and this book offers one piece of that puzzle.This information is starting to spread more and more, but I would still recommend anyone interested in (brain) health to read the full book and get inspired!"
20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108813509-jesper-carlsson,4,"This book is written by someone with alot of experience in the field in which he studied, therefore more nuanced and informed opinions as compared to how media would summarize the same studies. The thing I wished was done was to be more clear when conclusions are his, and how other people in the same field would use the same studies but conclude differently. The book is very scientificically written but in the format as popular literature, so it has to be clear what the studies actually concluded (or in some case, didn't). Overall a great book based on optimismic and opportunistic towards the future as compared to fear and/or anxiety awakening over what could have been done differently in the past. "
21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64968481-james-murray,4,"I feel everyone needs to know what's written in this book. The author describes the positive impacts that exercise - specifically aerobic exercise - has on stress, concentration, mood, memory, and creativity. His explanations are founded in studies that he includes in his bibliography. He admits in the book that converting a vast volume of scientific literature into a readable and enjoyable format for the layman was a challenge; I personally would have enjoyed a more scientific tone and style but understand he had a hard choice to make there.Great book and easy to get through - recommended!"
22,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16225503-henrik,4,"This book goes over studies relating exercise to things other than fitness, e.g. memory, happiness, cognitive function, etc. It makes a *very* strong and compelling case for why one should do some running (or similar) even if one does not care much for the fitness side of it.

As a book, sure, there is a lot of repetition through the chapters and it could have been written with a little bit better flow, but it is absolutely not a bad read in that sense either. It is very quick and easy to get through - but I will definitely make my own summary of the best take aways - it shouldn't have to be more than a few pages. Five stars anyhow because the message is sich an important one, and the point the book makes is very clear - move yourself more and your brain will improve."

I love how Hansen writes and outlines super complicated facts about the brain in a highly actionable and understandable fashion so that people who don't study the brain for a living can reap all the tasty benefits from his research. This is a book you must read if you are looking to produce the best work of your life, remember everything you read, and stay healthy throughout your entire life. Period. One of my favorite books."
