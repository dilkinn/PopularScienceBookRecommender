"
2,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,0,"I feel totally terrible on giving up on this book. It is a very good book, but I believe it will not be readable for many. Or maybe I should put it this way – it cannot be appreciated as it should be unless you either have a thorough knowledge of chemistry or are willing to read the book slowly and do the experiments, look at the pinecones and sunflowers and investigate alongside the author as he speaks of his childhood in London. His family is one of scholars. These people were those very few who can take book knowledge and in an instant give you an example in nature that demonstrates what is in the books. His parents, although certainly no gilded pair since they were absent for much of the time, infused in him the wonder of knowledge. Every paragraph in the book prompts one to go out and do an experiment, look at a pinecone or a sunflower. To appreciate this book as it should be you should do and see what he saw as his parents and aunts and uncles guided him through science, giving him a hands-on visual, auditory and olfactory knowledge of what happens when you mix this chemical with that or view and touch an object of nature. To understand and really remember each paragraph one should do the experiments he did and carefully observe what he looked at in nature. It was too much for me to read example after example of experiments, such as the formation of colorful crystals when you put a thread in a solution of x and add a pinch of this or that. There were so many examples that I drowned and lost count and felt bereaved by my lack of knowledge. Clearly there is nothing wrong with this book, but it is simply better appreciated by someone who is willing to read it slowly and investigate all the marvels it speaks of. For me it was too jam packed full of things that I had not seen. This is why I am continuing no further. I am too lacking in knowledge. This book is too smart for me. If you are able to relax and not demand that you see what he saw through each of the experiments and tests he carried out, then maybe you will enjoy the book. It is perfect for those of you who already have the scientific knowledge he speaks of. It is an autobiography of his childhood in London starting with the events of the Blitz and his first stay in one of those horrible English boarding schools where the headmasters are despicable. You come to understand why he is who he is and how his youth shaped him. I highly recommend this book to those who are well educated in the sciences, particularly chemistry. "
3,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2671549-anastasia-hobbet,5,"This is a five-star jealousy rating. Oh, to have had the intellectual riches of Oliver Sacks' childhood. It's not possible anymore, even if you have equally intelligent, indulgent, slightly disconnected parents, who let him do what he wished, when he wished, how he wished--allowing him, over years, to play in an under-the-stairs chemistry lab, where he nearly blew himself and the house sky-high many times. Safety glasses? Fire protection? Concerns about poisonous fumes? Never mind! And how pale all my relatives look in comparison to Sacks'. I have eccentrics in my bloodline, but the eccentrics in Sacks' family were brilliant polymaths. Ah, for a time machine and a genetic makeover. "
4,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"Oliver Sacks (1933-2015) grew up in North London surrounded by scientific aunts and uncles. Both his parents were physicians. His mother was a well-known obstetrician and one of England’s first female surgeons. His brothers also went on to become physicians, as did Oliver.Oliver’s Uncle ‘Tungsten’ Dave owned a light bulb factory on Farringdon Road. Uncle Dave helped Oliver with experiments in the laboratory and taught him about all the elements. Oliver was fascinated with Tungsten and its properties and resilience. When age 6 in 1939, he was sent off to Braefield, a boarding school. The school moved from London to the countryside because of the war. The school was run by a sadistic headmaster. Sacks tells the usual horror stories of the British boarding school. Sacks provides a history of the development of modern day chemistry and compares this to alchemy. As he learned about the founders of modern chemistry he followed their experiments step by step. He was primarily interested minerals.Sacks taught himself photography and had a passion for chemistry. He found its elegant simplicity in a world of chaos during World War II. The book ends at adolescence. At age 14 he decided he wanted to be a physician.The book is well written and the curiosity of young Oliver shines through. Sacks went on to become a famous neurologist and has written many books. His most popular one is called “Awakening” about sleeping sickness. His parents were ardent Zionist and he discussed his Jewish faith. Oliver was surrounded by relatives that were physicians and scientist; it is no wonder he was fascinated by the world of science and had a gift for scientific inquiry.I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. Jonathan Davis did a good job narrating the book. Davis is a voiceover artist and a three-time winner of the Audie award for audiobook narration."

6,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4590295-autumn,4,"Great for a beginning college Chemistry class - to get students to understand and get hooked on the world of Chemistry. I learned a great deal. At times a little dry, but not for long amounts of time, and the pay off is worth it."
7,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22110057-debbie-zapata,2,"Mother ordered this book some time ago and wanted me to read it. While I was very interested in all the parts that spoke directly about the author's life and family, I could not maintain that interest for all the other (and much longer) parts telling the history of various elements, details and more details about chemical properties of many things, and biographical sketches about various scientists. I began looking for paragraphs that contained ""I"" and skimming the rest. I thought the author was lucky to get through his younger days mentally intact, and I appreciate how Science helped him manage that, but I would have enjoyed the book much more if there had been more of those ""I"" bits."
8,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1012909-curtiss,5,"This is the very personal memoir of Dr. Oliver Sacks, who is known as the author of numerous anecdotal stories involving case-studies of his patients' neurological disorders.As a young boy he experienced a profound excitement over the study of chemistry, which helped him cope with his own neuroses which had their origins in the brutal treatment he and his brother Michael received at a boys' school that they attended during the early years of World War II.This was a period which Oliver considered a form of ""exile"" from his family, and it resulted in severely disturbed behavior on his part and in his brother Michael's own nervous breakdown. But he was helped by his love of metals, and chemical compounds and experimentation, guided by his Uncle Dave, who owned a company which specialized in Tungsten filament light bulbs; hence his family nickname ""Uncle Tungsten."" With his Uncle's friendly help and advice and affection, and support from the rest of his very extended family (Oliver had 17 Aunts & Uncles on his mother's side alone, and nearly 100 1st cousins), he experienced the joyous fraternity of science, and the adventure of reliving within himself the discoveries of the founders of Modern Chemistry, Boyle & LaVoissier, Becquerel & the Curies, Rutherford & Bohr.Dr. Sacks interspersed intensely personal family anecdotes throughout his own chemical adventures, and I wept when I read how he watched as his cherished Aunt Birdie died in his mother's arms of a coronary occlusion."
9,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858854-timothy,4,"A very vivid and poignant account of Oliver Sacks childhood fascination and love for chemistry. He makes us all feel sad for the loss of that childlike curiosity and attachment to science. he found delight in exploring the physical world. How many of us has the abillity to do experiments on chemicals during our childhood days?How many of us dream of chemistry?How many of us delight in travelling the journey of science;asking questions and given answers to satisfy our eager curiosity? These are what we have to marvel at Sacks childhood. It was filled with chemistry and a pure love and fervent for science. However, it was saddening to know that he was later persuaded to give up chemistry for medicine.Afterall, he was bornt in a family of doctors. In his words, he said, ""what had been a holy subject for me full of poetry, was being rendered prosaic, profane."" Such was his regret and the kind of ecstasy he felt for science."
10,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,4,"Great fun romping inside the mind of Oliver Sacks as he reminisces of childhood days. Insightful, funny, sometimes somber, sometimes lighthearted, always engaging. What strikes me as its most important quality is that it bears a restorative effect on those minds seeking to explain their own childhoods. A great story-teller, of course, and he has produced a well-crafted literary work.Everything that I would write would be a spoiler, of course, because it is a memoir so I'm just adding my voice to all those who think it is a good read.Not a full five stars, just because I wanted more, and didn't get it. "
11,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1258173-fred-jacobson,4,"I went on a mini-Sacks ""bender"" this year, reading Uncle Tugsten, Musicophilia, and then dipping into one of his earlier books (An Anthropologist on Mars). What I have always loved about Sacks is his ability to present the scientific, social, personal and emotional aspects of his subject as a balanced entity. You can see, through his writings, how he develops a rapport with his patients. Uncle Tungsten is a memoir of Sacks, growing up in Britain under the Blitz, a child of a remarkable family. Perhaps because of the subject, it reminded of my other beloved chemical memoir, Primo Levi's Then Periodic Table. As a chemist, I found Uncle Tungsten to be a wonderful description of the joys that many of us found as children in learning about, and playing with, chemicals- in those pre-litigation times when you could still by ""Chemistry Sets""."
12,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2881115-ed,3,"This is an odd book--part autobiography, part history of chemistry. Sacks, a neurologist who writes beautifully about unusual people. In doing so he always reminds me not only of our common humanity, but of just how strange and wonderful our humanity is. In this book he is the subject of his narrative and he manages to depict himself with the same grace and wit that uses to characterize others. The heart of the book is his experience being evacuated Along with many other children from London during World War II. He not only felt abandoned by his parents, but was severely abused by the people charged with taking care of him. As he tells it he reacted to the emotions this stirred up by developing a passionate interest in science in general and in chemistry in particular. He was aided in this by two uncles [one nicknamed Tungsten:] who were professionally involved in chemistry, and by two rather indulgent parents. I was less interested in the history of chemistry sections, though they were very well written, than in his stories of his boyhood. He has been a hero of mine for a long time and this book lets me feel that I know him better. "
13,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26262898-roshani-chokshi,0,"Exuberant and informative. Oliver Sacks' memoir is full of love and childlike wonder, and the voice at times reminded me of Roald Dahl. For me, medical/science non-fiction has always been something of a comfort read. Most members of my family are scientifically inclined* and so I often reach for nonfic when I am homesick. What I also loved about Sacks' memoir is how much I learned! In school, I needed extra help with math and science. I think part of my aversion to the subjects was how mortified I felt if I got an answer wrong or received a confused look from my math/science teachers. Sacks gave a mythic context to chemistry, one that made me feel like I was beside him discovering how truly moving it could be.*I'm sure they were a little surprised over my whole ""Thanks for immigrating! Imma write fantasy now!"" But they have been nothing but supportive and loving <3"
14,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,3,"Really a combination of the history of chemistry and the story of the early life of the author. It can be argued that the chemistry is part of the biography since, as a child, it was the most important interest of the author. A bit boring if you know some chemistry and a tad superficial to my taste on the biography part. Still, fun to read."
15,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5892502-katya-epstein,3,"I had a very strong personal reaction to this book (Sacks reminds me very much of my late father), so it's hard for me to judge whether it's a good book in any objective sense. It is not a standard memoir, in that you don't learn very much about Sacks' life or family outside of his explorations of chemistry. This can be frustrating. For instance, at one point he describes how as a teenager his brother Michael suffered from paranoid delusions (was he schizophrenic?), but then never goes on to say what happened to him or his delusions. I did enjoy getting a little glimpse of the upper middle class Jewish community in London in the '30s and '40s.Nor is it really a popular introduction to chemistry. If you don't already know a fair bit about chemistry (for instance, the meaning of the word valency), most of the book will be utter gibberish to you. If you do remember some of your high school chemistry, you're not likely to learn much more.It could be described as a popular history of chemistry. What makes his experience with chemistry so unique is that he seems to have learned it in the same order that it was discovered historically, allowing him to experience the awe and wonder of the new discoveries for himself, making his education far more enthralling than most people's. (But even here he seems to be assuming a lot of prior knowledge on the part of the reader. At one point in the book he talks about how as a child he had a kind of gut feeling that the colours of the different elements had some sort of deeper significance, but if you don't already know about spectroscopy (which is covered much later in the book), this sentence is pretty meaningless.)As somebody who is very interested in chemistry (I have tried to teach myself as an adult) and who intends to home-school, this approach has been quite an eye opener. Sacks certainly gives the impression that the way chemistry was taught to my generation is backwards: It seems to me that most textbooks start with the structure of the atom or types of bonds or molecular formulas or the definition of atomic number (the most recent discoveries), thus not allowing students to see how astounding it was to find that there was an underlying structural explanation for the physical properties of the different elements. But I think it would take Sacks' exceptional circumstances and temperament to learn chemistry the way he did."
16,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176599-z,4,"I enjoyed this considerably more than  The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, which partly just reflects my relative levels of interest in chemistry and neuroscience, but also reflects the way this book interleaves scientific and wartime memoir -- the Second World War being a topic which interests me more than either of the above, at least from a pleasure-reading point of view. (Plus, I learned a few more obnoxious chemistry trivia facts, the better to torment family and friends.)"
17,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1096594-darcy,5,"This book was great because you can really sense the boyhood excitement, and you pick up a lot of little chemistry trivia (which I, as a chemist, especially appreciate). I don't think it's too technical, however, and I hope its chemistry content does not deter non-chemists of any type from reading it. While reading, I was frequently reminded that the world has changed significantly in the past ~60 years. Oliver Sacks grew up in a time where you could essentially run down to the store and buy some pretty dangerous stuff- even at the age of 10! I liked reading about his discoveries much more than I liked reading about them in chemistry textbooks."
18,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971962-kimberly-lightle,4,As a kid I really liked my chemistry set - maybe that is why I grew up to teach high school chemistry. I'm also a really good cook. The stories in this book really spoke to me - the relationship of the author and his uncle and that science is really cool!
19,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22241323-judy,5,This is Sacks at his best! What a nice way to learn something about the history of science. Every Chemistry student (and teacher) should read it.
20,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,0,"DNF for now at chapter 17 63%A nice book when he's talking about his own experiences, but it slows down when he switches to the histories of famous chemists and discoveries (sort of relating them to how and what he learned). I may come back to it, but it's not stimulating enough for me right now. Sorry Mr. Sacks - it's not you. It's me."
21,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4633519-steve-smits,3,"I enjoy Oliver Sack's works. For one who is such an accomplished scientific figure in the medical world, his prose writing is so good. ""Uncle Tungsten"", published first in 2001, is his memoir of his life and times in pre and immediately post war England. Sack's family were Jews who had immigrated to England around the turn of the 20th century. His parents were physicians and his uncles (he came from quite a large family) were scientists and entrepreneurs. Uncle ""Tungsten"" owned and ran a factory that produced light bulbs and he was deeply knowledgeable about heavy metals that could be used as filaments in these early bulbs. In addition to Uncle Tungsten, Sacks's family members were brainy and colorful characters who are quite fun to read about.Through Uncle (Dave) ""Tungsten"", Sacks's intellectual curiosity in chemistry was aroused. (Mathematics was also an obsession.) At an early age, he acquired all manner of chemicals and set up his own laboratory where he conducted experiments to understand better the chemical properties of various elements and compounds. One amazing aspect of the story is how easy it was for Sacks to acquire chemicals that are quite dangerous and how tolerant his parents were of the goings-on in his lab in an attached shed. One cannot imagine such liberality or forbearance today.In many ways, Sacks's memoir gives the history of chemistry advances in the 19th and 20th century. He describes the breakthrough work of many of the icons of early chemistry -- Boyle, Lavoisier, Davy, Faraday, Mendeleev and others. His burning impulse to understand how the physical world was constructed and interacted is plain to see and marked him as an unusual young person of great intellectual potential.What's perhaps even more compelling in Sacks's story is his depiction of life before and during the war. Sacks, born in 1933, was shipped off to boarding schools away from London during the Blitz and his memories (many were not happy ones) give a fascinating view of life during this time. His family was closely connected to the Jewish community in London and his stories about this culture are interesting and evocative; he says that this tight knit society ceased to be after the war.His path through the world of chemistry progresses through increasing levels of complexity. Some of his descriptions of chemical laws and processes are above my understanding; they made me aware of how much about chemistry I have forgotten, or, more likely, never knew. When he reached atomic realms of the periodic table of elements and structure of atomic entities, I was quite lost. Notwithstanding, it's worth slogging through the esoteric parts of the book, if for nothing more than to gain an appreciation of this young man's remarkable intellectual focus and his passion for knowledge. "
22,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,4,"This is Sacks' inspiring memoir of his early teenage years, when his growing scientific mind recapitulated the history of chemistry through reading and his own hands-on experiments. It can be read either as a record of one person's education, or as a high-level history of chemistry. The magic of this book is how Sacks combined the two into an engaging narrative.He begins by telling of his earliest observations, when not yet ten years old, of simple material categories. This grew into differentiating the elements by their properties. When he saw the periodic table for the first time in a museum, along with samples of each element, it all came together in a blinding mind-storm. His romance with chemistry continued for another year or two, eventually leading him to flirt with basic nuclear processes at the dawn of the atomic age shortly after WW2. Then it all changed for him when adolescence barged in, bring with it other imperatives.How fortunate Sacks was to have mentors (outside of the school system, of course) who recognized his non-conforming abilities and encouraged him. We see the universal, and despicable, bullying given to boys who are different and talented—a theme shatteringly taken-up in his 2015 memoir covering adulthood On the Move: A Life. We also see the amazing ability of the (even young and formative) human mind to understand the universe, one that is available to anyone curious."
23,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7161051-r-ta,5,"Wonderfully inspiring, even more so because the book revolves around the great love of mine - chemistry.Through his memories of childhood/adolescence Oliver Sacks tells the simplified (short?) version of the history of chemistry. I've come to realize that his ""reasons"" for chemical curiosity are rather similar to my own - to find certainty in this world, to understand the origins and reactions of things all around me, and so I was not enthralled to read the last chapter, ""The End of the Affair"", in which Sacks writes that he gradually lost his interest in chemistry as a teenager and moved on to biology/medicine. Nevertheless, the book chronicles the ways natural sciences developed and flourished from 1800's to early 20th century. (Although the topic fascinates me, I would never bother googling it.)I would recommend it to everyone, for I wish more people were into sciences - chemistry in particular - but reading without background knowledge in chemistry may be difficult."
24,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2417209-tim-weakley,4,"I think this is the most personal of Sacks' books. The premise is an autobiographic one. It's the story of his boyhood during wartime Britain, and his experiences with both his multi-talented family, and his youthful love of science and chemistry. It also becomes woven in with the history of chemistry and the periodic table. I love history of science books, and biography so to get both in one book was a surprise and a treat! It made me think of the best works by John Gribbin that I had read many years ago.I would suggest that anyone who has read other books by Sacks pick this one up at the earliest opportunity."
25,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3802397-s-m-johnson,4,"This book was just as great on my second readthrough as it was on my first. Sacks has the rare talent to combine science, art, and humanity, and the result is a beautifully written account of both his childhood and the early science of chemistry and the people that were involved. These days it's easy for us to take things like the modern-day conception of a quantum atom for granted, but this book brings you back to a time when this was an amazing discovery and, more than that, tells you exactly why it was such. Definitely recommended reading for chemistry fans."
26,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/421140-justin,5,"This is a memoir of a brilliant man's curious evolution as an inquiring mind. His family is super-brainy and it's no wonder that he is too, since they gave him his own chemistry-lab at age 10 to start blowing shit up. This book is also a superb primer for anyone interested in the history of chemistry, from alchemy to the most recent discoveries."
27,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,4,"I enjoyed this memoir of the young Oliver, able to explore 'what happens if...' in his home laboratory and the natural world around him. Here you see the brilliant family that produced the extraordinary man Sacks became."
28,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1956252-nancy,2,"Many interesting passages, but far too scientific for me. I was lost among the tables and metals. I liked it best when he became more personal in discussing his family and upbringing."
29,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1987120-tonya,4,I really enjoyed this autobiography. Sacks is such an engaging writer. I got to go listen to him speak a few years ago at Mayo - he was just as delightful in person as in print. 
30,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6720564-ryan-lally,0,"Uncle Tungsten is an autobiographical account of Oliver Sacks' childhood, yet in parts, it also reads like a young boy's open love letter to Science; affectionately named after Sacks’ uncle (due to his lifelong obsession with metals, in particular, tungsten, whose filaments he used daily in the manufacturing of incandescent light bulbs). Born in Cricklewood, London, the youngest of four children born to Jewish parents (both physicians), his early memories of growing up are punctuated by reverberations of the war. The frantic carnage of the blitz, the torment he endured in school at the hands of a cruel headmaster and the mental health problems of his older brother perhaps all play a part in directing the shy insular Sacks toward the magnificent order and laws of Chemistry, a domain which was “solid, invariant; they stood unmoved in a chaotic world”. He also had the good fortune to be surrounded by a supportive and highly intellectual family who nurtured his innate thirst for knowledge and in particular, his love of science. Sacks’ speaks so lyrically of metals, numbers and physics that it is hard not to find the earnesty and poetry of it truly affecting. He recalls with great detail the experiments he carried out as a boy and the enchantment which filled him as the universe revealed its underlying principles and almost holy logic to him. His account of seeing the periodic table for the first time is especially momentous, captivating the young Sack’s for his entire life, stating, “...to have perceived an overall organization, a superarching principle uniting and relating all the elements, had a quality of the miraculous, of genius. And this gave me, for the first time, a sense of the transcendent power of the human mind, and the fact that it might be equipped to discover or decipher the deepest secrets of nature, to read the mind of God.” It’s possible however that the lengthy descriptions of metals, chemicals and mineralogy may prove slightly arduous for the casual reader.He also bears a special place in his heart for the scientists themselves and their stories (the book features a myriad of footnotes delving into he finer details of these accounts). As a youth he devoured biographies and texts onMendeleev, Marie Curie, Neils Bohr among many others. Not only did their thought processes and magnificent intuition fascinate him, but also their lifelong dedication to discover, not master, the principles of the universe, with the intent to further the knowledge of mankind. Ultimately it would be Sacks’ work on neurology which would make him famous. However this vivifying account of a young mind bursting into life reminds us of the awe and beauty to be found in science. Sacks reminds us that science is a thoroughly human endeavour and retaining a sense of wonder about the laws which govern our universe only enhances the human experience and makes our time here more profound."

Before I talk about why I liked it I want to give a few heads up about some not so pleasant things. Near the beginning of the book the author is sent to the country to a newly established school because of the bombings in London (during the war) and the way he talks about it and about his feelings toward his parents because of it and things like that felt very much like he should have been talking to a therapist and not writing it in a book (even if it is a memoir). There is also a section later in the book when it talks about his mother (who was an OB) drowning babies that she felt would have died painfully or had “no quality of life” and also that she would sometimes bring them home and dissect them or make him dissect them (he had a very strong revulsion to this and it is not painting in a positive light at all). And finally, he’s talking about a vacation after the war and describing floating around on a board and how peaceful and relaxing and other worldly it was and then he says, “it was only after I changed that I realized I had had my first orgasm.”So, those things were distasteful but I’m still having my high schooler read this along with chemistry because it really was a delightful living chemistry book. Sacks was about to easily get many different elements and had his own “lab” in their house and he describes so many different experiments he was able to preform, talks about why the elements fascinated him, the history of chemistry, and so much more. I felt like This book drew together and formed connections with so many other books I have read such asThe Mystery of the Periodic Table, A Briefer History of Time, high school chemistry, Apoligia Chemistry that I did with my kids years ago, biographies of Einstein, Marie Curie, and so many others. If “education is the science of relationships” as Charlotte Mason says, then this book was very educational for me because it really helped bring out and solidify so many of these relationships for me. (And if you or your child has been doing AmblesideOnline they will have read many of these books already! The actual “chemical” relationships, such as information about vacancies, came more from the actual chemistry classes I’ve had.)"
32,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76671542-cole,5,"So this was a required read, but it was actually extremely good. Sacks strikes a good balance between personal life stories and history on the discovery of chemical elements. Highly recommend, especially the chapter on Humphry Davy."
33,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,2,"2.5 Stars!I am a huge fan of Oliver Sacks and his writing, his boyish love and enthusiasm for learning and his enduring curiosity comes across from a really early age, and it clearly translated into adulthood. His family, in particular his mum and uncle did a lot to encourage his inquisitive nature as they fed him knowledge and passed down their wisdom. This is an autobiography, but it is also about many of the scientific elements, and it is as much about chemistry as it is about Sacks. This peculiar mix leads us to some fascinating and maddening places.There are many times when the main body of the text is almost overwhelmed by the footnotes, pages where more space is taken up by the actual footnotes than the text, and so, often it’s like David Foster Wallace is re-interpreting Bill Bryson’s “A Short History of Nearly Everything”. The chapter on Mendeleev started off so promising and then quickly descended into a punishing slog and a total mess, due to the bombardment of footnotes. What’s so bad about an appendix?...There is a lot of science in here, a whole lot of science, some of it is very interesting, but even more of it is not very interesting at all, and can become tiresome to read. “On The Move”, his most recent autobiography, was an excellent read, and was bursting with exhilarating details of a life embraced and lived to the full, whereas this is more like being stuck in a double period of chemistry. If you love chemistry then this is obviously a good thing.His experiences of war time England are interesting. Some of his memories throw up many vivid and surreal snapshots that really give us a feel for the time. His years spent enduring the English public school system is the stuff of cruel nightmares. Sacks’ is mostly good company, and a very likeable man, who's sense of reason and curiosity takes him to some intriguing places. There are some lovely moments, like his feverish excitement during his repeated visits to the Science Museum, when it reopened after the War in 1945. There are dark ones too, like the story of him being taken to a mortuary at the age of 14, where he is left alone with a 14 year old female cadaver, and told to dissect her. It’s the stuff of nightmares and understandably had a lasting impact on him. His story of making damper with the scouts and being too scared to ask for more flour, has some pretty funny results too.Sacks is a fascinating character who has accomplished a great body of work over his long and impressive career, his enthusiasm is often infectious and he is rarely dull, but I felt this book would have been so much better had it focused more on him, instead of the science, and of course the footnotes. I enjoy footnotes, but there is a balance to be struck, and there comes a point when you have gone too far, then you begin to serve more to disorientate than to inform, or disrupt the flow, rather than enhance it. After all, that is what the appendix section is for. "
34,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,3,"Several GR friends recommended The Disappearing Spoon as a narrative approach to chemistry for the science-challenged like myself. I thought Dr. Sacks' memoir might be the same. Unfortunately, I think I should have read The Disappearing Spoon first because I did not have the background for this memoir. It's one thing to push myself through the dull sections of a history book, but with science, I might as well be reading a foreign language. That's not to say I got nothing out of the book, but I certainly wasn't getting enough to continue with it.To Jews, I recommend the chapter called ""Home Life."" It's almost 100% personal narrative and is mostly about the Sacks' family's religious life. The first few chapters about his early life are also all narrative. Heck, even some of the science is narrative. It was interesting to know that Boyle, the father of modern chemistry, regarded chemistry as ""fun,"" just a big kid making things explode. It sure didn't match my memories of learning Boyle's Law back in high school. Similarly, while I do remember enjoying learning about the periodic table way back then, I'm sorry I didn't remember enough of it to really appreciate Sacks' reverence for it. Perhaps someday, after I've read The Disappearing Spoon, I'll get back to this book. But for now, I'm regretfully leaving it unfinished. "
35,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"I love Oliver Sacks, memoirs, and science. This was a wonderful book: a great memoir, and I learned a lot about chemistry, a field/branch of science where I am almost 100% ignorant. Who knew chemistry could be so entertaining! And because I’ve enjoyed Oliver Sacks books, I especially enjoyed reading about his childhood. "
36,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26071992-nooilforpacifists,3,"I like Chemistry, but didn't care much for his discursive and Olympian style."
37,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,3,"As a reading experience, this was not great. At times, I skipped sections on the history of chemistry or the details about various metals, chemicals, and elements. Those are mostly things I'd read before and retained to some extent, and I felt no need for a refresher.As a memoir, this book gives a lot of insight into the background and thinking processes of Oliver Sacks as a youth. It added to the ways that I find him endlessly captivating and endearing.Sacks grew up in London in a large Jewish family in the WW2 era, and was evacuated to the country with other London children for several years during the war, a very traumatic experience. The trauma, together with his natural leanings and his very scientific family, led him to a preadolescence-through-age-15 intense love affair with science, mostly chemistry and some physics. He loved and was obsessed with metals, the history of chemistry, chemical properties and reactions, and the periodic table. Uncle Tungsten was the nickname of one of his uncles, who taught him a lot of chemistry. His parents encouraged his interests - he had a laboratory in the house and did many experiments that few parents now would sanction. They and other relatives taught him more about various chemicals and other scientific subjects.In writing this book, his enthusiasm was rekindled, and it's contagious. I love his intense curiosity and his devotion to the scientific method, which shaped the man he became. The details of the science illustrate his enthusiasm. But, if you don't have equal enthusiasm, those details can be boring; and if you do, you already know themVery much worth reading if you're an Oliver Sacks fan. "
38,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552420-dorien,4,"While looking for homeschool recommendations for history books, I read a blog by a mom who used Uncle Tungsten as her daughter's chemistry curriculum. I sure wish I had been taught chemistry with this book as guide! It certainly evokes a lot of curiosity and fascination for the realm of chemistry. I didn't know much about chemistry before I started, but that didn't hinder my enjoyment of this book. It doesn't explain all topics that are discussed, for it is not a textbook, but when an obscure topic sounded interesting, I found a quick visit to Wikipedia usually sufficient to understand the larger context and enjoy Sacks' description of it.I especially liked reading about how the elements were discovered, how the field of chemistry developed throughout history, how there's always more to discover and how chemistry is in a way poetic. For most people, the chemistry encountered in daily life is magic, and sure enough, Sacks really had a magical childhood. I highly recommend this book to all curious people, with or without background in chemistry. "
39,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6179719-catherine-davison,0,"I shan’t give a rating because I feel it’s probably a brilliant book for some folk but for me it was tedious and dry. I did enjoy his descriptions of chemistry experiments conducted in his family home and surrounds and I did learn a few interesting facts along the way. However overall as a memoir it was less about Oliver Sacks and more a potted history of great scientific minds and discoveries, there’s nothing wrong with writing about such discoveries but this book didn’t keep my attention in the way Sam Kean’s writing can. Stephen Fry would probably like it, he’s used a few of the spectacular chemical experiments as magic tricks on QI."
40,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36404945-chaitalee-ghosalkar,3,"This autobiographical account of Dr. Sacks' life is a very interesting way of depicting his childhood and early teenage years. If you've read his books, you may know him to be the neurologist who has documented the cases of his patients that range from bizarre to awe inspiring. And yet, here you come across a Dr. Sacks who's so different than the person you know him to be.Uncle Tungsten describes Dr Sacks' early fascination with chemistry, courtesy his mother's brother, who he refers to as Uncle Tungsten owing to his profession involving the metal. Through his eyes, we are introduced to the wonders of chemistry, and are at times taken back to your own chemistry lab times when your eyes would light up with wonder at the practical demonstrations of various reactions. Each chapter on chemistry is alternated with personal anecdotes of his early school life, descriptions of his extended family (most of them were an educated lot). At times though, when chemistry gave way to physics, the book slipped. But let it not take you away from the fun you have in the initial chapters."
41,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"After finishing this I wasn't sure whether to hold Sacks in awe or envy. When he wasn't being tutored in various fields of science by his relatives (medicine, botany, chemistry), he was being indulged in his own studies of the same -- encouraged to experiment in the basement with all manner of reagants, including those that could have killed him had he not been both lucky and clever. One of his uncles even gave young Oliver a portable spectroscope! Sacks had diverse hobbies that fed his scientific interests, like photography. There was never a boy better equipped for a life of scientific enterprise, that's for certain! "
42,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74391147-alex,5,"While I enjoyed listening to Sacks's story throughout the memoir including his reminiscing of bits of chemical/physics history. His last chapter discussing his transition away from Chemistry into Medicine was the most striking. I found it disconcerting that formal study of a subject would make someone with such a love for a discipline to lose interest. Although, I took heart in knowing that more than that went into the equation. In particular, his parent's desire for him to study medicine and the quantum chemistry portion of chemistry being so troubling for him."

To my eyes it is a timeless love story, on par with the greatest ones in literature and cinema - of a precocious young boy's love for Chemistry. His discovery of Chemistry, of its history has the manner of absolute and uncompromising devotion. The funny incidents and the somewhat odd, perhaps troubling behaviour that he displayed found echoes in my own memories of my childhood (though I was hardly a genius of that calibre). Do read. "

46,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6787926-ashwini,4,"In the true spirit of Oliver Sacks, this book fuses chemistry with aesthetic beauty. It relives a part of his journey of discovery through the history of chemistry itself. As it also explores his childhood, the excitement and silliness (and fun) of that period are also part of this book. There should be more people like Oliver Sacks who write about science and its relation with their human, emotional selves. "
47,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42320745-emily,2,"Not my favorite - I expected much more of a memoir and much less chemistry. I skimmed through a decent chunk of the book, as I didn’t feel like reading in depth about the history of various elements, despite probably liking chemistry more than the average person. These parts are of course extremely well-written, but it wasn’t what I had hoped for (as an Oliver Sacks fangirl). "
48,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8742827-jack,5,This book was terrific. A friend recommended it and I was expecting jus a memoir. Instead Sacks describes a history of chemistry intertwined with a voyage of personal discovery . Really entertaining stuff.

54,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12739236-ornella-riquelme,2,"The story that the Oliver Sacks begins in the 1930’s, before World War II. He tell us about his childhood and his curiosity in science, specifically, chemicals. He explains how since he was a child he was interested in, metals and their properties. For example, when he was little he would ask his mom about chemicals, and sometimes his mom wouldn't know how to answer it, but his uncle will answer the questions. His uncle was known as Uncle Tungsten, and it was because he form lightbulb out of tungsten filaments.His Uncle will often demonstrate Oliver chemicals reactions. During those times, Uncle Tungsten taught Oliver that Tungsten was the perfect element. Oliver’s family was well educated that his family was spread around the world studying. But then World War II began. He and his brother were sent to a boarding school named Braefield. There he was mistreated and his parents wouldn't come that often, he felt alone and that affect him mentally. When he got out of school, he imprisoned his dog and the dog almost died. Also his friends from his school notice him different because he wouldn't stand up for himself anymore. However the only thing that he hadn't lost was his interest for chemicals. His uncle, and his parents support and encourage him to do experiments. So he got his own space for experiments at the laundry, there he tries different chemical reactions. Sometimes his experiments will go wrong and he will just throw them in the yard. He was interested in the colors, the smell, and the explosions of his different results of his experiments. His brothers will often help him with his experiments. However when Oliver turned 14, his parents thought that he should stop doing experiments because it was something childish.He became a neurologist but he often misses his experiments. So basically the author’s investigation were chemical reactions, the color, and the smell of his explosions.The area of science that the author integrate in his story was at first metals and then chemicals. At first it was metals because he would ask his mom about her ring. He would often get his mom’s ring and will test with it. He would know a lot about silver, copper, zinc, gold, and many other metals. “I badgered my parents constantly with questions. Where did coor came from? Why did my mother use platinum loop that hung above the stove to cause the gas burner to catch fire?” (Page 5) The Oliver would ask about the properties. “Why were they shinny? Why smooth? Why cool? Why hard? Why heavy? Why did they bend, not break? Why did they ring? Why could two soft metals like zinc and copper, or tin and copper, combine to produce a harder metal?....”(Page 7). Then after he was interest in chemicals composing, and decomposing elements. “I decomposed water, using electrolysis, and then recompose it, sparking hydrogen and oxygen together” (Page 114) Then afterwards he was more into the elements of the periodic table. “ I had, by this time, become familiar with the properties of many elements and I knew they formed a number of natural families, such as the alkali metals, the alkali earth metals, and the halogens” (Page 188) I notice that each of his studies made him get interested in other things. Like when he was interested in metals, then he got interested in the properties. When he see how each metal react to the test of the properties, then he got interested in chemical reactions. He like chemicals, and he had to learn the name for each element he decomposed and composed, and the he like the periodic table. It is like one thing lead to another during his studies.The questions that this book raised was how could he decomposed water. I know that water is made out of one hydrogen and two oxygen, but he said he decomposed water and separate the molecules. I have no idea on how to do that, so I would like to know how he did it. Also did something happen to Braefield (school he went during World War II)? Like did they had any student that was strongly affected by the way it was? For example, it was said that in the school students were mistreated, and the food was scarce, or sometimes not even right to be eaten. Also, when his parents told him that he had to stop with chemicals because he was supposed to become a doctor, what was his brothers reactions? Like, did they support him, or support their dad, and what about Uncle Tungsten?"

Sacks's family is fascinating, a great swath of brilliant relatives, especially his mother's siblings, and Sacks uses them, individually and collectively, as touchstones for his introduction to the sciences. Sacks himself is erudite, eclectic, likable and produced some of the most engrossing studies of the human mind and neuroscience ever recorded. Thing is, I find his writing style soporific and tedious, so I can't give him the personal attention he deserves. He's badly in need of editing (I've found this true in his otherwise fascinating studies of mental peculiarities), which always drives me nuts – my weakness far more than his. For those of you (like my wife) who find his writing more approachable, you'll like this. He was a genuinely good guy in every respect, and I'll continue reading his other works."
57,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2070884-self-propelled,5,"Oliver Sacks' childhood memoirs are, like everything he wrote, infused with humanism, passion, and the kind of delicate sensibility that allowed him to become a unique chronicler of human nature. This and Primo Levi's The Periodic Table are surely the two greatest books ever written on chemistry - as well as two of the greatest memoirs, and two of the greatest books on science of any kind. I enjoyed Uncle Tungsten more than The Periodic Table, perhaps because the insights it offered into its strangely brilliant and sensitive author were so fascinating, and because Sacks is such a genius at weaving the chemistry together with other aspects of his life.Levi's writing seems harder, less sentimental, but having just re-read his masterworks, If This Is a Man and The Truce, also slightly limited by his subject matter. Perhaps it is unfair to expect other works to reach the incredible depths of clarity and profundity expressed in those two books, however. If a modern Great Library of Alexandria were burning and I could only save an armful of works, I would take them without hesitation. Yet there are moments: here is Levi, years later, reflecting on the twist of fate that separated him from someone he once loved: We are not dissatisfied with our choices and with what life has given us, but when we meet we both have a curious and not unpleasant impression that a veil, a breath, a throw of the dice deflected us onto two divergent paths, which were not ours.Two masterful works to be enjoyed by everyone, even if they don't know their phosporous from their phlogiston. "
58,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828254-cailean,4,"Oliver Sacks has such an engaging style of writing! He is clearly very intelligent and absolutely fascinated with the world. This book focuses on the early years of his childhood and the influence of his relatives, who were primarily in the science and medical fields. He grew up in England during WWII and was deeply affected by his experiences due to the war. Most of the chapters focus on Chemistry and his obsession with investigating the world around him -- doing his own experiments, visiting his Uncle Dave (who worked with Tungsten in a factory), reading and studying, etc. He concludes that while he eventually moved away from his living-and-breathing obsession with Chemistry, he realizes that learning about science in such a fashion was a way to give him stability in an unstable pre-during-post WWII world. We all know where his life went as he got older, but he only vaguely discusses this. I found that refreshingly humble. He really wanted to pay homage, I think, to the people who helped him on his way in the world (his parents who encouraged him in his experiments and allowed him a special room in the house, doing very dangerous things!), to his relatives who inspired him, and to the scientists who came before...who he devotes various chapters to. I would say this book is best suited for those who admire Dr. Sacks AND who are similarly fascinated with Chemistry. Some of the minutia is so detailed that I had to skim paragraphs because I simply didn't quite understand/couldn't visualize what he was talking about. Overall, it's an enjoyable read and you will come to love Dr. Sacks even more. "
59,0330390287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3049657-victoria,2,"I greatly enjoyed Sacks’ The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat & Other Clinical Tales, but this book, simply put, was too dull for me. I don't have an interest in chemistry so that alone should have stopped me from buying the book, but I thought that my interest in Sacks himself, plus the WWII London setting would be more than enough to interest me in this... unfortunately, WWII London serves as little more than a backdrop to a shockingly small portion of the book. And for all of the effort that Sacks put into chemistry as a child, by the ending... well, it shocked me to see the apparent ease with which he abandoned it. I guess I really don't know how I feel about the book... some sections were just very slow moving for me and I didn't really have anything to relate to or a common interest in it. There were a few funny anecdotes, but not really enough. I even toyed with the idea of not finishing it for an hour or so... which is a rarity for me! And in the end, I am glad I finished it, but really, this is a book best suited for science buffs, not history buffs. "
