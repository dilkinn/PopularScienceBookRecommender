0,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7154232-phil-sykora,5,"If you want to get better at anything, this book is your starting point.As a sophomore in high school, I remember asking my favorite English teacher if he would sign off on my application to an advanced writing class. The look on his face was shock: mouth open, eyebrows raised. I felt stupid for even asking.Needless to say, I took a general English class my junior year.But I decided I didn't want the other kids to get ahead of me academically. I didn't have that elusive, all-important trait that everyone calls ""talent."" I had a brain that was geared more towards science and math, so when I read in Geoff Colvin's Talent is Overrated that there was a science behind improvement, I was blown away. I emailed K. Anders Ericsson, asking for research on how to use deliberate practice to improve my writing skills, and, to my surprise, he actually emailed me back. In this book, he made all of that research even simpler. Soon I began writing and reading every night for about an hour, focusing on improving my weaknesses, imitating my favorite writers, and stepping out of my comfort zone.The following should speak for itself:I took an AP writing course my senior year.I scored a 5 on that test (the highest score possible).I aced a creative writing course in college.I began submitting my fiction to literary magazines (at this point I was churning out at least one story a week).I became a professionally published short story writer at 20 years old (""Elite Slugger"" in Cracked Eye).I still have a long way to go, but one day I want to be a New York Times best-selling novelist. Without Mr. Ericsson's research, I would still be a sub-par writer. Instead, I developed a passion for something that no one thought I could do.More importantly, though, I developed a passion for improvement, and that doesn't really depend on some outside factor, like whether or not a publisher wants to buy my work. Improvement is an intrinsic, driving force. Whether or not I ever become a New York Times best-selling novelist isn't the point. The point is constant improvement. The extrinsic goal is a side effect.If there is some skill or ""talent"" that you always wish you had, then buy this book and follow its principles. I guarantee you can have it."
1,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2318453-paul,2,"K. Anders Ericsson writes a good book with lots of practical applications that falls victim to the classic type 2 statistical error (false negative). Let's start with the good stuff. Ericsson tells a lot of cool anecdotes about the utility of deliberate practice. He never really defines deliberate practice. But basically it means getting a coach and performing focused exercises to get better while analyzing results. Easy enough. There is also some cool material about improving mental representations. The stories are encouraging, and they widen one's perspective of what is possible.Now for the negative. Well, first, the ""what should I do?"" portion of the book could have been written in about 5 pages. But that's not the big deal. This is the big deal: ""And this, more than anything else, is the lesson that people should take away from all these stories and all this research: There is no reason not to follow your dream. Deliberate practice can open the door to a world of possibilities that you may have been convinced were out of reach. Open that door. ""That, my friend, is really destructive nonsense. Because Ericsson falls prey to the type 2 error. His life's research is based on taking really successful people, moderately successful people, and sort of successful people and trying to find what the difference is. There, in music, in chess, in hockey, and in baseball, he finds that a strong correlation between deliberate practice and expertise. But I would bet a lot of money that Dr. Ericsson never played sports at a young age. Because he misses the type 2, the false negative. He doesn't take into consideration the kids who practiced harder, longer, with better coaching than anyone else, and still sucked. That is a common story. Do you remember the kid that had incredible explosive speed but had no coordination? Coaches spend all kinds of time with those kids because of their potential. But after years of deliberate practice with great coaches, some of them just can't catch. They are uncoordinated. In explosive sports, basketball, football, sprints, jumping, boxing, talent is king. Check out this article, for example, Lombardo, Michael P., and Robert O. Deaner. “You Can’t Teach Speed: Sprinters Falsify the Deliberate Practice Model of Expertise.” PeerJ 2 (June 26, 2014). doi:10.7717/peerj.445.In skill-centric sports, hockey, baseball, tennis, skill practice makes a big difference. In any sport, practice is what differentiates the great from the good. It is important, and that's why it is so evident in Ericsson's research. But Ericsson didn't spend his time trying to find all the people that put in years of hard, smart work with great coaches and just never became good. They didn't learn how to sing, or how to catch, or how to run fast or jump high. Genes do not guarantee success, but they are still important. The same is true of public speaking, art, science, math. There's a reason why most theoretical physicists are really smart and it's not because the less smart people just didn't work hard enough. Don't lie to people and tell them to chase whatever dream they have regardless of their situation. That's a recipe for heartbreak. Be honest and tell people to work hard and train smart. Tell people that they can always improve if they are willing to pay the price. That's enough. But it doesn't sell many books.Here are a few of my favorite quotes:Without feedback—either from yourself or from outside observers—you cannot figure out what you need to improve on or how close you are to achieving your goals. (p.34)In the brain, the greater the challenge, the greater the changes—up to a point. Recent studies have shown that learning a new skill is much more effective at triggering structural changes in the brain than simply continuing to practice a skill that one has already learned. On the other hand, pushing too hard for too long can lead to burnout and ineffective learning. The brain, like the body, changes most quickly in that sweet spot where it is pushed outside—but not too far outside—its comfort zone. (p.58)That was okay, however, because the real action occurred once the pilots landed, in what the navy called “after-action reports.” During these sessions the trainers would grill the students relentlessly: What did you notice when you were up there? What actions did you take? Why did you choose to do that? What were your mistakes? What could you have done differently? When necessary, the trainers could pull out the films of the encounters and the data recorded from the radar units and point out exactly what had happened in a dogfight. And both during and after the grilling the instructors would offer suggestions to the students on what they could do differently, what to look for, and what to be thinking about in different situations. Then the next day the trainers and students would take to the skies and do it all over again. (p.131)One of the implicit themes of the Top Gun approach to training, whether it is for shooting down enemy planes or interpreting mammograms, is the emphasis on doing. The bottom line is what you are able to do, not what you know, although it is understood that you need to know certain things in order to be able to do your job. This distinction between knowledge and skills lies at the heart of the difference between traditional paths toward expertise and the deliberate-practice approach. Traditionally, the focus is nearly always on knowledge. Even when the ultimate outcome is being able to do something—solve a particular type of math problem, say, or write a good essay—the traditional approach has been to provide information about the right way to proceed and then mostly rely on the student to apply that knowledge. Deliberate practice, by contrast, focuses solely on performance and how to improve it. (p.145)All of these elite players were committed to chess, and in the beginning the ones with higher IQs had a somewhat easier time developing their ability. The others, in an effort to keep up, practiced more, and having developed the habit of practicing more, they actually went on to become better players than the ones with higher IQs, who initially didn’t feel the same pressure to keep up. And here we find our major takeaway message: In the long run it is the ones who practice more who prevail, not the ones who had some initial advantage in intelligence or some other talent. (p.248) -- I don't agree with this quote, but I think that there is a lot of truth in it."
2,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,I don't think this had to be a whole book but that said I do think the idea behind the book is a meaningful one. I know I personally spend a lot of time practicing things without getting better because I don't actively engage in what I'm doing and try to improve on whatever part of the skill I struggle with most. I also thought the writing was really good and appreciate that it was based on so much research evidence. Definitely was something new that I hadn't really thought of before.
3,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a wonderful book about the method of deliberate practice. While Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: The Story of Success popularized the concept that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in any field, this book shows that 10,000 hours of repetition does not make one an expert. Gladwell gave as an example The Beatles, but he was wrong. While in Hamburg, they played about 1,100 hours, not 10,000. And they did get useful feedback but it wasn't deliberate practice. What made them famous was not their performance capabilities, but their song-writing abilities. But, Gladwell was correct in that a tremendous amount of effort over many years is required to become an effort in any field.Deliberate practice requires going outside one's comfort zone. Practicing exactly the same thing over and over does not improve performance. In addition, immediate feedback is necessary. You must identify what the best performers do that sets them apart.People who are usually considered to be experts often are not. As an example, older doctors and nurses do not usually improve with experience. They don't gain expertise from experience alone. Doctors try hard to keep their skills sharp. Continuing education for doctors is popular, but it doesn't really help much! The reason is that most continuing education is in the format of lectures, in which the audience passively accepts the message delivered by the lecturer. But the best continuing education has an interactive component--role play, discussion groups, case-solving, and hands-on training. These approaches have been shown to improve doctors' performance.The principles of deliberate practice are:1) Find a good teacher2) Engagement and focus3) Practice outside of your comfort zone4) Set things up so you constantly see signs of improvement5) Share your activities with like-minded peopleThere is no such thing as ""natural talent"". Most of the stories about experts having a natural talent are incorrect. There is no evidence that any genetically-determined abilities play a role in deciding who will be among the best. Nothing came easily to these experts; they worked hard at their craft, very hard. A high IQ can help someone initially improve a skill. But experts show no correlation between IQ and skill level. What matters most is their ability to make mental representations. The book has a very interesting description of how a deliberate practicing method was experimentally applied to a university physics course. The emphasis was placed on skills vs. knowledge.I thought it was fascinating that, despite the fact that perfect pitch is quite rare in the West, children who were taught musical chords between the ages of two and six all developed perfect pitch. Deliberate practice increases the sizes of certain areas of the brain for violinists, pianists, mathematicians, cab drivers, swimmers, gymnasts, and glider pilots. In the case for pianists, the brain growth is only in accordance with practicing during childhood, not as an adult. Deliberate practice changes the neural circuity to produce specialized mental representations, to make possible incredible memory, pattern recognition, and problem solving.If you want to become an expert in a field (or your have a child you want to push), then start young, very young for an athlete or a musician. For other fields, age doesn't seem to matter much. It's just a matter of following the methodology of deliberate practice. This book is filled with fascinating anecdotes about people who became experts. Blindfolded chess players, memorization experts, athletes; they achieved expertise by following the methodologies explained here."
4,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6766462-franta,5," Anders Ericsson reasons that expertise is best developed by deliberate practice and the existence of innate talent is an unconfirmed hypothesis.Deliberate practice means doing - knowledge by itself is not indicative of expertise.This is a positive book as its message is that the power to become great in any area is in everyone's hands. Here are the insights.Gaining expertise is largely a matter of improving one’s mental processes.If you never push yourself beyond your comfort zone, you will never improve.Purposeful practice has well-defined, specific goals. “Play the piece all the way through at the proper speed without a mistake three times in a row.” Without such a goal, there was no way to judge whether the practice session had been a success.Break it down and make a plan: What exactly do you need to do. Putting a bunch of baby steps together to reach a longer-term goal.You seldom improve much without giving the task your full attention.Purposeful practice involves feedback. You have to know whether you are doing something right and, if not, how you’re going wrong. The main thing that sets experts apart from the rest of us is that their years of practice have changed the neural circuitry in their brains to produce highly specialized mental representations, which in turn make possible the incredible memory, pattern recognition, problem solving, and other sorts of advanced abilities needed to excel in their particular specialties.The relationship between skill and mental representations is a virtuous circle: the more skilled you become, the better your mental representations are, and the better your mental representations are, the more effectively you can practice to hone your skill. Deliberate practice requires a student to constantly try things that are just beyond his or her current abilities. Thus it demands near-maximal effort, which is generally not enjoyable.Once you have identified an expert, identify what this person does differently from others that could explain the superior performance.The traditional approach has been to provide information about the right way to proceed and then mostly rely on the student to apply that knowledge. Deliberate practice, by contrast, focuses solely on performance and how to improve it.How do we improve the relevant skills?Get some personal sessions with a coach who could give advice tailored to your performance. An experienced teacher watching you and providing feedback. Someone who knows the best order in which to learn things.Focus. Feedback. Fix it. Break the skill down into components that you can do repeatedly and analyze effectively, determine your weaknesses, and figure out ways to address them.Shorter training sessions with clearer goals are the best way to develop new skills faster. It is better to train at 100 percent effort for less time than at 70 percent effort for a longer period.Cross-training - switch off between different types of exercise so that you are constantly challenging yourself in different ways.Push yourself well outside of your comfort zone and see what breaks down first. Then design a practice technique aimed at improving that particular weakness.Strengthen the reasons to keep going or weaken the reasons to quit.Belief is important."
5,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86598133-amora,3,"If you’ve read Malcom Gladwell’s book “Outliers” you would know that much of the research in that book comes from the authors of this book. Since the publication of Gladwell’s book, Ericsson and Pool have conducted extra research on persistent practice and in this book show off their excellent new research. In the research they spotlight they show that persistent training is the best way to master a skill no matter how difficult it is. The first chapter and last chapter are especially spectacular."
6,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808339-kony,4,"Talent is made, not born. Specifically, according to Ericsson & Pool, it's made through years and years of deliberate practice: the process of learning to recognize and emulate existing models of elite performance, through active trial-and-error, regular expert feedback, and self-motivated resilience. Deliberate practice is necessarily painful, but rewarding for those who keep at it. Key implications: There's no ""genius"" gene, and in any case it doesn't take genius to become an expert or elite performer. Most of us are born with the potential to excel in many fields. What derails most of us from excellence isn't any lack of innate ability; it's the fact that we give up in response to early failures and/or external discouragement. By applying this understanding to the ways we raise kids and train professionals, we might unleash into society a great deal of otherwise-untapped human potential. I've seen these arguments before, but I like how they're articulated here: in clear and engaging prose, with sparing anecdotes, and with concisely explained scientific evidence. In deciding how to present and illustrate their ideas, the authors have applied their understanding of human learning, and to good effect. I recommend this book as a clarifying follow-up to the many fluffy ""pop science"" books on this topic (including Malcolm Gladwell's). If short on time, read this instead of those. "
7,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29328847-michael-payne,5,"Everest! There is no vantage point higher on the subject of expert performance than Anders Ericsson’s lifetime achievement in sharing this book. Through years of deliberate practice in observing what truly sets apart the best from the rest, Ericsson has guided many to new heights of accomplishment through his insights that sparked a paradigm shift of our understanding of “experts”. The ideas shared in these pages will no doubt help propel countless others for decades to come as they make even greater summits of human achievement.If you are looking to get better at any skill, from athletics, to medicine, to teaching, to science or business, then read this book. The answers are not easy, but they are clear. The world owes Anders Ericsson a deep debt of gratitude for helping shift our collective understanding of expert performance, talent, and extraordinary human results. Malcolm Gladwell most effectively popularized parts of Ericsson’s insights in his book Outliers: The Story of Success. Carol Dweck’s Mindset: The New Psychology of Success is a very complementary and convergent idea. Angela Duckworth’s, Grit: Passion, Perseverance, and the Science of Success magnificently illuminates the insights of persistent deliberate practice. Joshua Foer, met with Anders Ericsson in preparation for his own summit in winning the US Memory Championship and writing his book, Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything. Geoff Colvin cemented and extended many of Ericsson’s thoughts in his book, Talent is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else. Matthew Syed, became a notable athlete and author of Bounce: Mozart, Federer, Picasso, Beckham, and the Science of Success, with insights owing to Ericsson.In searching for any subject, finding a great teacher is often best performed by looking the world over to see who is most often cited as an authority figure. Powering Google’s search engine is an algorithm that at its core leverages “citation analysis” to find authority figures, also called hilltops; or in this case a towering Peak on the search for expertise. In your quest for a great teacher to help guide your personal journey there is no living author with greater authority than Ericsson.If you want to do better, read this book."

The secret to peak performance was revealed in the first chapters, now the author simply insists on telling anecdotal story after story to support the theory. I imagine if you're an athlete or a musician it must be wonderful to read about your peers but for someone interested in other areas, the book peaks in the early chapters and plateaus after."

10,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38664303-zac-scy,5,"Before I say anything else, this is the single most rewarding book I've read this year. I recommend anyone and everyone to read it. It's one of those books that busts the myths that have been floating around about ""natural talent"" being something that only a select few possess.Back in 2008 Malcolm Gladwell introduced K. Anders Ericssons research on expertise to the masses. Those who read up on the research understood that there was more to it than the version presented in Gladwell's book. Unfortunately the press just ran with the ""10.000 hour rule"" as a headline and failed to delve deeper into what expert performance and deliberate practice really entails.I found the research intriguing and now, after almost 8 years of waiting, it's finally available in a more digestible form.The examples and explanations for how to go about achieving greatness in any pursuit is something everyone can benefit from. Whether you're just starting out with something new or if you've been at it for decades already.What I'm most excited for is the fact that perhaps we can finally get rid of the excuses and false beliefs that have held so many people back from pursuing the things they want.Maybe we can finally start to teach the next generation of kids the greatest lesson not all of us got to learn: How to learn."

It's a very liberating and democratic thesis--you are not genetically restrained from being a master of anything. You just need to do deliberate practice. 
12,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29338898-seth-braun,5,"The book answer the question: How do we develop expertise?The premise is: We develop excellence through deliberate practice. Context: This is Anders Ericsson and Robert Pools' mainstream distillation of The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance, which was made famous through Gladwell's reference of the ""10,000 Hour Rule"" in Outliers. I am sold on the idea of deliberate practice and did not need to be convinced, however there is plenty here to persuade the reader to adopt the author's point of view. The primary instructions I took away:1. Identify an expert in the field you wish to develop expertise2. Identify what this person does differently than explains superior performance (specifically, adopting the mental models the expert uses when preacticing)3. Practice with this influence 4. Adjust based on results5. When possible, work with a coach or teacher that can objectify your practice for youWhat helps you succeed with deliberate practice?A belief you can succeed. The results you experience after getting through a plateau. Minimizing interference, distractions and obstacles. A desire to improve (generally a passion or purpose for developing the skill).Pushing your comfort zone. Surround yourself with people that will encourage and support you. Create general social reinforcement Create or define stages of improvement so growth can be measured in time. Three Myths That Hinder Improvement:1. The belief that one's abilities are limited by character traits.  I am not this way or that way2. If you do something long enough you will get better.  Without deliberate practice, this leads to getting good at being mediocre.3. All it takes to get better is hard work or effort. If you want to be a better (fill in the blank), just try harder. Finally, build better mental models:1. Learn more about the topic through study and from teachers and coaches2. Apply the mental model to hone the skill3. Honing the skill improves the mental model4. This creates a virtuous cycleThis final idea, mental models, is tricky in leadership development versus say, playing classical violin or hitting a baseball. This is one of the challenges we face at Stagen Leadership Academy; how do we objectify what is subjective in the experience of world-class leaders?In summary, Peak asserts that we have greater mental adaptability that we generally acknowledge; we have enamored ourselves with the idea of ""talent"" and this cripples our ability to pursue excellence. Deliberate practice, not natural proclivity, creates masters of form and technique."
13,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,5,"This book relates the research that Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers was based on and referenced inaccurately. Ericsson is a passionate advocate of deliberate practice, which is NOT the ten thousand hours that Gladwell popularized, but rather a lot -- a lot more than you think -- of practice, but practice focused on specific goals, measurements, and development of mental schemas that help you become a more expert chess player, or high jumper, or physicist. Ericsson's great insight is that there is no such thing as innate talent. We all learn things the hard way or we don't really learn things at all. And the world's top experts get there in any field by working harder than anyone else. Put the time in, and ye shall reap the rewards. If you still don't believe this idea, then for heaven's sake read the book."

Traits favorable to a task help at the beginning, but don't make a difference at high levels — it all comes down to effort.Mastery is possible through deliberate practice, focused training with an expert who can push you to a higher understanding of the craft.

The book makes the point that there is no such thing as innate talent (or if there is, it only helps one at the very beginning of learning a new skill). Deliberate practice and building mental models (referred to as mental representations) are the keys. This book reinforced to me that having my kids take music lessons is worthwhile.

Anders Ericsson argued that while practice is important, it's not the whole story. Besides the quantity of hours spent practising, there's also the quality of that practice, which allows us to learn more efficiently. The trick is what he coins as ""Deliberate Practice"":1. Create a feedback loop - surround yourself with experts and get their feedback2. Focus very delierately on the sub-skills that make up an overall skill3. Be a teacher - ""If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself."" - EinsteinOverall, I think it's an interesting book that challenges me to think about how I can pick up skills more efficiently, rather than just jump into practice, practice, practice."

Cal Newport, He based a whole book called 'Deep work' on the 'Deliberate practice' theory that Dr Ericsson states that it's needed to reach expertise level in any fields.

This book gives more detailed information and better explains his theory and research. The ideas and premise of this book kept popping up in discussions with my family, and especially children, and I was grateful for the hope and motivation it provides. Basically, besides body type and size, talent is not born, but developed. If you want to learn or become great at something, you can with consistent ""deliberate practice.""

The podcast was very interesting, so I had to get my hands on a copy of the book. After reading glowing reviews, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, the book was subpar, in my opinion. There are moments when I am captivated, but the discussion quickly becomes drawn out, and I find myself waiting for the chapter to end. Don't get me wrong – there's a lot of great material here. Most of all, I'm glad to see someone completely debunk Malcolm Gladwell's ""10,000 hour"" theory, which I never completely bought.

Among a myriad useful, insightful things-- the importance of mental representations in expert performance, naive vs purposeful vs deliberate practice, why skills trump knowledge--the core message of the book is an inspirational one: apart from a few areas (say swimming) you are not predisposed genetically to be bad at something, to never be an expert in something, you just need tons of deliberate practice (or just a good amount of purposeful practice if you are not aiming to get to the peak). So some people aren't just ""not good at maths"". It's only because they might not have a good mental representation at the foundational level and are then led to believe, without any intended malice, that they simply aren't ""mathy"". (Kind of tangential but Sal Khan's ""Let's teach for mastery-not test scores"" also relevant somewhat).It's a big change in mindset, a shift from ""Wow, she's so talented!"" to ""Wow, she must have put in a lot of practice"", from ""I could never do that"" to ""I can get good at it if I were to put in a good amount of the right kind of practice"". It's liberating in a way to think that it would just need a lot of smart kind of hard work. Of course, the hard part is still there. And the work..."

It explains the science behind how everybody can become better at almost anything. I have been discussing this topic for a long time with my children and focusing on growth mindset and grit. This book brings a new concept called deliberate practice and proves that ""practice makes perfect"" should be perfect practice makes perfect. In this book by the Swede Anders Ericsson he explains the principles behind the ""10000 hours to become an expert"" that Malcom Gladwell made famous in Outliers. The only thing that is a little minus is that deliberate practice needs to be adjusted to every subject and hence we don't know today how deliberate practice looks like exactly, but more in general terms, but at the same time this makes the research so exciting and the potential for the impact on humankind endless."
26,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, Some good advice my favorite takeaways that frequent and regular feedback can accelerate learning and practice and that beliefs in innate talent rather than an ethic of practice can make one quite when frustrated and make people doubt if they have what it takes. What we see on the surface of skilled performance looks like innate talent but actually is the fruit of long hours of long intense practice. Good stuff those two takeaways are the most important things in the book.
27,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,3,"'Peak' by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool is focused around the concept of 'deliberate practice'. The authors use many examples to show that it is practice and not 'innate talent' that creates experts in a particular field. They also dispel the myth of the 'ten thousand hour rule' as popularized by Malcolm Gladwell.Many wide ranging stories hold Peak together and it is easy to relate to a few of the case studies. But I was left feeling dissatisfied. The stories felt a little laboured, the case studies seem to pick and choose data to prove their hypothesis. The examples are influenced by survivorship bias. The authors seem so keen to convince us of their points that they keep repeating it.Another thing which I disliked is that a 'how-to' non-fiction book needs to be written in points and not in prose.- experts practice more than those who are just good- get an expert teacher or mentor and get lots of feedback on what you are trying to learn- practice skills, don't just acquire knowledge - make sure to analyze what those skills are - indulge in deliberate practice, not merely practice"

30,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14739955-carmel,5,"I found this read completely fascinating. I am interested in the study of expertise and how people become the best (or really, really good) at something. Not because I want to be the best, but because as a teacher, I want to understand how best to encourage students to become their best possible selves.A few great takeaways from this book:1. If you are unsure if this book is for you, read the introduction. I found it spellbinding (it deals with the idea of ""perfect pitch"" and questions whether anyone is ever born with innate talent or if all talent must be procured). 2. The idea of motivation versus willpower. Perhaps this is semantics, but the underlying idea is that someone who is motivated to learn/become better is going to be successful. Willpower is more of an innate characteristic. Maintaining motivation, according to the book, has two parts: reasons to keep going and reasons to stop. When you quit, it's because you've reached a point where the reasons to stop outweigh the reasons to continue. Those who find a way to power through either find a way to strengthen their reasons to keep going or weaken their reasons to quit. As a teacher, I think this is important, and I hope to find ways/words to encourage students to maintain motivation (not ""increase willpower""). 3. The idea of creativity. I've found the question of, ""What is creativity?"" extremely interesting over the past few years. Typically, we tend to define creativity in terms of artistic expression. But creativity has a broader definition, looking at a person's ability to create something new. The book goes deeper with this line of thought, arguing that ""creativity goes hand in hand with the ability to work hard and maintain focus over long stretches of time"" (ie: deliberate practice). Creativity, the book explains, ""will always remain a mystery...because it generates things that have not yet been experienced."" But the underlying thought here is that creative people start earlier, work harder, and stay focused enough to produce lots of results (both bad and good) that eventually lead to the creation of something good. In short: creative people work hard, make stuff, and some of it is good. I would highly recommend this book for parents, educators, management, and anyone interested in knowing how great people become great. We can't all be the top 1%, of course, but being as good as we can at something is a great place to start. "
31,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,5,"I should have read this book a decade ago! I curse myself for giving up on reading, non-curriculum books. That would be the gravest mistake of my life.This book is impressive, extremely useful to understand how to develop skills and not merely knowledge. The author shatters the pipe dreams of born a genius kind of myths, he also dispels the deep rooted belief that all it takes is 10,000 hours. The author differentiated between purposeful practice and deliberate practice as a means to explain this concepts. The various case studies of Pianists, Violinists, Basket Ball players, Writers, Teachers and professionals in this book have been very educational, though the author could not put in extreme detail about all the possible ways in which deliberate practice techniques can be used for all the arts or skills but this books helps to generate a standard outline, which will help us design our own practice sessions, choosing mentors and choosing mind maps to get a better grasp of the skill in practice. I love the book from the first page to the last. This book is a prerequisite to FLOW, i.e. only after you become a master of an art that you can enjoy practicing it or using it. I liked the examples of deliberate practice employed by Benjamin Franklin to master the art of writing, I also liked the way the author uses Benjamin Franklins in ability to master chess, the way he did writing for the lack of appropriate environment (access to other top notch players in USA vs Europe), or the lack of tools, i.e. good books detailing the chess moves of Grand masters during his time. Thus stressing the importance of environment, tools and techniques for practice over mere potential due to inheritance (genes) or through extreme GRIT, yes GRIT is s prerequisite but it is not the necessary and sufficient condition to become an expert. All experts have GRIT but all those who have GRIT might not become experts. I found answers to many of the questions that I have been trying to find answers to, for more than 10 years to this point.I author has also tackled the fringe cases of rainman genius i.e. genius with a disability or the cases of prodigies and addicts.One of the best books that I have read, comparable to the likes of BLACK SWAN, OUTLIERS, THE POWER OF HABIT, WHERE GOOD IDEAS COME FROM and other FIVE STAR RATED BOOKS.Keywords: Jump Math, Instructional ScaffoldingOther books mentioned in this text:Poor Richards AlmanacHouse of CardsBenjamin Franklins Auto BiographyMoonWalking with EinsteinThe Sports Gene"
32,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39362386-cp-wayne,4,"If I had to summarize this book in one sentence: A heavy read built around the ideas of deliberate practice and how anyone has the potential to obtain any skill they desire.This book was well researched and used a lot of case studies to demonstrate its ideas. In my opinion, this book may get mixed reviews depending on the type of reader you are;For those who are trying to find straightforward practical advice to help you obtain a skill. You might find this book a bit frustrating as you have to sift through the chapters to find the information you need. The case studies can drag on and make it feel like a psychology textbook at times.For those who are curious about the topic of human optimization and how experts acquire abilities in their chosen field. You will likely enjoy the read a lot more. You will read several interesting analogies on world class performers and be introduced to many inspiring ideas backed up by detailed scientific research. Overall, I think the main ideas of this book can inspire anyone to pursue any skill they set their mind to. An inspiring segment in the book supports this idea by saying: “Deliberate practice is for everyone who dreams. It’s for anyone who wants to learn how to draw, to write a computer code, to juggle, to play the saxophone, to pen “The Great American Novel”….it’s for all those people who want to take control of their lives and create their own potential and not buy into the idea that this right here right now, is a good as it gets.” A few inspiring takeaways I got from the book:- Our brain is a powerful tool. It adapts to the demands we place on it. We have tremendous capacity to improve our skills and performance. Through methodical training, we gradually develop new skills and perform tasks that once seemed impossible. - Deliberate practice along with informative feedback and proper mental representation are key factors in helping one become an expert in their field.Through deliberate practice, we have the potential to develop any skill throughout our lifetime.  -Many of us misinterpret the famous 10,000 hour rule. We assume that the more hours we accumulate the more we will improve. -Talent is developed, not born! Natural talent or child prodigies don’t really exist! For an extended version of this review come to my blog (www.firetoinspire.org)"
33,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7470463-corina-anghel,5,"I loved this book because it proves a truth we don't talk enough about: real performance takes practice. Not just any type of practice, but the one that requires conscientious reflection and hard work.There are three types:1. Naive practice: when you just spend time in the activity, in mindless repetition, without real focus on improvement 2. Purposeful practice: when you set an objective, you deconstruct, you reflect and integrate feedback3. Deliberate practice: it's when you can follow a benchmark and you use a personal coach that can give you very specific insights and tips (the most powerful of them all)Key to a good practice are the mental representations you form - how you visualize the end result. And, of course, the ability to deconstruct and improve every tiny detail until you match that representation. The better you are able to see it, the better you are at knowing what to do to get there. Engagement is also important - when practicing you need to really focus on what you are doing, to analyse and improve, otherwise you can just slip into naive practice.And although body's and brain's natural ability to adapt in the face of challenges outweighs any genetic differences (that may, in the beginning, give some people an advantage), there's no rule of how much it will take you to reach a certain level. The 10.000h rule is not a rule, it's just a bad, catchy, interpretation of a study's results.In business it's hard to apply deliberate practice because benchmarks as in sports or ballet are hard to get, but we can still apply a lot of principles that can significantly improve our development processes, creating exercises and learning while work gets done. Now we focus too much on knowledge at the expense of skill, and that needs to change."

Written by the guy who’s research Malcolm Gladwell based his 10000 hour rule on, it is possibly the most influential book I’ve read on developing skills and maximising potential. Not only was it a fascinating read (“the 10000 rule” is BS), but it actually changed the way I think about getting better and I was able to immediately put what I had learned into practice. The premise of this book - to be the best at something, your genetic background matters very little. No nature, all nurture. While this sounds like a fairytale everyone would like to hear, it’s backed up by solid research from a whole field of science.The only thing I felt was seriously out of place - the authors strong belief in human supremacy. At some point he suggests we use a more effective way of training doctors to discover malignant tumors from X-ray pictures. While it would definitely improve results, it has been pretty clear for a while now that machines will outperform humans at pretty much any task requiring pattern recognition. The book was published in 2016 so I’m puzzled. There always has to be something. In any case…If you have even the slightest ambition to get better at something (your job, sports, a hobby, raising kids…) this book has to be your next read."

This book gives you techniques, mental models to develop skills and improve in any particular area. The biggest takeaway for me is the deliberate practice as a lens to deconstruct any expert or superstar in a topic and understand them better."

38,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12620775-trung,5,"The book has taught/reaffirmed the following for me:-	Continual practices do not necessarily lead to improvment. So the rule of Malcomn Gladwell about 10,000 hours practice will make you an expert is not so correct. To be an expert, you need to follow the correct practice and the correct practice is either Purposeful Practice or the best is Deliberate Practice.-	Anyone can improve, but it requires the right approach. Refuse the following myths: o The first is our old friend, the belief that one’s abilities are limited by one’s genetically prescribed characteristics. o	The second myth holds that if you do something for long enough, you’re bound to get better at it. o	The third myth states that all it takes to improve is effort. -	There is (almost) no such thing as Innate Talent. Expert performers develop their extraordinary abilities through years and years of dedicated practice, improving step by step in a long, laborious process. There are no shortcuts. Various sorts of practice can be effective, but the most effective of all is deliberate practice. Deliberate practice takes advantage of the natural adaptability of the human brain and body to create new abilities. Most of these abilities are created with the help of detailed mental representations, which allow us to analyze and respond to situations much more effectively than we could otherwise.-	Knowledge is just Potential Power. The bottom line is what you are able to do, not what you know, although it is understood that you need to know certain things in order to be able to do your job.-	Remember this cycle for any practice/training: try, fail, identify the root cause, try again differently, improve/pass, try harder, fail, and repeat-	Adaptability of: o Body: push it hard enough and for long enough, and it will respond by changing in ways that make that push easier to do. You will have gotten a little stronger, built a little more endurance, developed a little more coordination. But there is a catch: once the compensatory changes have occurred— new muscle fibers have grown and become more efficient, new capillaries have grown, and so on— the body can handle the physical activity that had previously stressed it. It is comfortable again. The changes stop. So to keep the changes happening, you have to keep upping the ante: run farther, run faster, run uphill. But if you push too far outside your comfort zone, you risk injuring yourself and actually setting yourself back. o	Brain: How does the brain change according to training given that mostly the neurons do not grow: in most parts of the brain the changes that occur in response to a mental challenge— such as the contrast training used to improve people’s vision— won’t include the development of new neurons. Instead, the brain rewires those networks in various ways— by strengthening or weakening the various connections between neurons and also by adding new connections or getting rid of old ones. Purposeful Practice: Get outside your comfort zone but do it in a focused way, with clear goals, a plan for reaching those goals, and a way to monitor your progress. Oh, and figure out a way to maintain your motivationDeliberate Practice:-	Deliberate practice develops skills that other people have already figured out how to do and for which effective training techniques have been established. The practice regimen should be designed and overseen by a teacher or coach who is familiar with the abilities of expert performers and with how those abilities can best be developed. -	Deliberate practice takes place outside one’s comfort zone and requires a student to constantly try things that are just beyond his or her current abilities. Thus it demands near-maximal effort, which is generally not enjoyable. -	Deliberate practice involves well-defined, specific goals and often involves improving some aspect of the target performance; it is not aimed at some vague overall improvement. Once an overall goal has been set, a teacher or coach will develop a plan for making a series of small changes that will add up to the desired larger change. Improving some aspect of the target performance allows a performer to see that his or her performances have been improved by the training. -	Deliberate practice is deliberate, that is, it requires a person’s full attention and conscious actions. It isn’t enough to simply follow a teacher’s or coach’s directions. The student must concentrate on the specific goal for his or her practice activity so that adjustments can be made to control practice.-	Deliberate practice involves feedback and modification of efforts in response to that feedback. Early in the training process much of the feedback will come from the teacher or coach, who will monitor progress, point out problems, and offer ways to address those problems. With time and experience students must learn to monitor themselves, spot mistakes, and adjust accordingly. Such self-monitoring requires effective mental representations. -	Deliberate practice both produces and depends on effective mental representations. Improving performance goes hand in hand with improving mental representations; as one’s performance improves, the representations become more detailed and effective, in turn making it possible to improve even more. Mental representations make it possible to monitor how one is doing, both in practice and in actual performance. They show the right way to do something and allow one to notice when doing something wrong and to correct it. -	Deliberate practice nearly always involves building or modifying previously acquired skills by focusing on particular aspects of those skills and working to improve them specifically; over time this step-by-step improvement will eventually lead to expert performance. Because of the way that new skills are built on top of existing skills, it is important for teachers to provide beginners with the correct fundamental skills in order to minimize the chances that the student will have to relearn those fundamental skills later when at a more advanced level."

What is genius? Are some people just born with the ability to be outstanding writers, musicians, painters? I've spent much of my life writing fiction and poetry. I've always pretty much believed that ""success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration"" (Edison). And as Stephen King has said, ""Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work."" Of course, it's the follow-through that's the tough part. Most of us are never taught how to learn, how to master a skill. And just putting in the long hours doesn't always (or even usually) result in expertise.The results of decades of research couldn't be more clear. Regardless of whether we're talking about violin virtuosos, sports stars, or math wizards, there's really no such thing as inborn genius. Some people may have more of an aptitude for, a leaning toward, or love of, one skill or art than another. But no one succeeds without hard work. And even someone with no particular aptitude can develop astounding expertise with — important! — the right kind of work, that is focused, deliberate practice that includes setting the right kind of goals, ""chunking"" (breaking down a task into smaller units and mastering them), getting feedback, and correcting course when necessary. The work of Ericsson and others is mind-blowing in a way. And it proves that just about anyone can achieve excellence in a field or skill. It still won't be easy, but it'll be possible.This is an amazing book. It should give everyone hope and confidence in their own abilities. No matter their age or interest. "

47,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85649072-investingbythebooks-com,4,"Anders Ericsson is the world’s leading expert on expertise. Ericsson who is a professor at Florida State has spent 30 years researching human performance – and yes, he is Swedish. Together with the journalist Robert Pool he gives the inside view of how experts are made.There are several myths when it comes to expertise. Perhaps the most prevalent one is that ability is innate and by this predestined – “I’m simply not good with math”. In fact Ericsson’s research shows that genetic predisposition plays a very marginal role compared to the work put in when it comes to developing a skill. And it isn’t too late. Our brain retains much of its adaptability through out life, so while some things might be easier to learn as a child we can all develop. Other misconceptions are that one gets better the longer one does something, or that all it takes is effort – or 10,000 hours of practice specifically.What it takes to become an elite performer is instead dedicated training that rewires the brain – so-called deliberate practice. What Ericsson has found is that while true elite performers practiced a lot they all practiced in essentially the same way. Without this specific type of practice, 10.000 hours and spent effort will not amount to much. The hands-on almost physical ring to the expression deliberate practice is carefully chosen. There is a difference between knowledge and skill. The bottom line is what someone is able to do, not what they know. Expert skill in this respect is the practical application of something.Deliberate practice is purposeful and informed in that it is guided by an understanding of what makes elite performers great and has a clear understanding of how they achieved their excellence. A large part of being an expert is in developing and internalizing what Ericsson calls mental representations, “a mental structure that corresponds to an object, an idea, a collection of information, or anything else, concrete or abstract, that the brain is thinking about” allowing the expert to see patterns where non-experts only sees randomness. The concept is similar to, but broader, than Charlie Munger’s mental models. Ericsson’s concept for example also includes physical and musical skills.So what is this magic formula? Well the short version is to identify the real experts, identify what makes them great (generally what they do differently) and design a practice that leads you to do the same. The practice should preferably be overseen by a coach that has set up a plan with a number of milestones that in combination leads to a bigger change. The coach also monitors the progress. The practice should be designed to stay just outside the trainee’s comfort zone and as such it requires effort, attention and isn’t always enjoyable and importantly the process involves feedback and modifications of the practice in response to the feedback. The training focuses on aspect after aspect (or mental representation) of something and improves them specifically. Over time new skills are built on top of old skills and skills regarding different aspects combine to form something larger than the sum of the parts.I must admit that I was initially skeptical of this book as it might well be the tale from the horses mouth, but still a tale that has been told several times as Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, Carol Dweck’s Mindset, Daniel Coyle’s The Talent Code, Geoff Colvin’s Talent is Overrated and so many other books have already presented Ericsson’s research to the general public. Not unsurprisingly however it turns out that listening to the original source gives a special depth – then the reader will have to accept that he probably has heard all the examples previously and that in the name of being perfectly clear the authors repeat themselves slightly too often.In the end this is a book of hope and enthusiasm – after having read it you find yourself making plans for how to improve the sub skills that are holding you back from reaching the next level; Focus. Feedback. Fix it."
48,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93627893-joel-e,2,"Severe Confirmation Bias. The author seems to be looking for evidence that supports his hypothesis.The book is well-written and engaging. Certainly deliberate practice is effective. However, the evidence is not enough to support the author's surprising claim that the only physiological/hereditary factors to limit a healthy person from elite abilities in any endeavor are body size and height. That seems an extraordinary claim, but the evidence to support it is not extraordinary. The author's cherry-picked examples do not refute all notion of inherent talent or selective advantage through physiological diversity. We know that there are significant variations among human individuals in the ratio of the three different kinds of skeletal muscle fibers (type 1, type 2b, and type 2a) that affect explosive strength vs endurance strength, and that they are evident in rates of innervation under resistance. Analyses of endurance runners and sprinters have corroborated differences. Though training makes skeletal muscle larger and stronger, it is as yet unclear if training can have a significant effect on the inborn number of each kind (hyperplasia) or change one kind of muscle fiber to another. There is also significant variance in the starting point of neural firing to the muscle, and although that can be trained, it seems some people hereditarily start from a more efficient baseline and progress at getting stronger much more rapidly under identical training protocols because of this. Additionally, in mathematics, capacity of working memory is important and why most mathematicians accomplish their greatest works before their fifties. What would the author say about the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who, without any formal higher math training and working in isolation from other mathematicians, developed his own notation in order to come up with and solve theorems that had stumped the greatest mathematicians of his day? How can there not be something remarkable and rare about the man's brain?From personal experience, I have observed that there were certain skills (mainly involving physical coordination, such as tricks on roller skates) that others were able to learn quickly through observation and imitation alone, that I could not master after longer concerted effort. You might say that my mind could not figure out the pattern. On the other hand, I was able to pick up words and communicate in foreign languages, recognizing patterns and sounds, much faster than some of my peers. I do not take any pride in this because it wasn't something I earned, but rather something that seems to be acquired naturally in just the way more physical skills seem to come to others. Also, who is to say that motivation itself, crucial to success in any practiced skill, is not in some measure hereditary or ingrained? It is the hubris of the elite to claim, ""if I could do it, anyone could."" Those who say that commit a lie of a false modesty that takes credit for the work put in, discounts the work that others put in, and shows ingratitude for the very gifts and circumstances that were bestowed upon them that in fact ensured the efficacy of their practice. This book in a way encourages that, and blames the rest of us if we don't reach an elite level now that we have the formula.I think there are several valid points in the book about the methods and benefits of deliberate and purposeful practice (though none of them were really groundbreaking, or new to me in this book), but the claims that the only hereditary limitations in any elite human endeavor are body size and height, are very doubtful when evaluated against the observations in one's own experience."
49,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61655715-tomislav,5,"I have to say, in lot of ways, this book changed the way I see practice or performance of any kind.Remembering my guitar practice back in the childhood, I used to repeat my favorite licks for hours, thinking I’m actually improving, while the truth was I never went out of my comfort zone, it was a mindless jam most of the time, and mindless practice brings almost no improvement.Purposeful practice on the other hand tells us to get out of our comfort zone, it’s supposed to be hard and expect your brain to resist you every step of the way. Get yourself clear goals, and a plan for reaching those goals, and a way to monitor your progress. Force your brain and body to adapt, and once you do that, learning is no longer just a way of fulfilling some genetic destiny; it becomes a way of taking control of your destiny and shaping your potential in ways of your choosing.The author debunks the myths of innate talent by saying; “Expert performers develop their extraordinary abilities through years and years of dedicated practice, improving step by step in a long, laborious process. There are no shortcuts.”Ericsson logically addresses the problem of modern education. With the advancement in the science of learning and practicing, the necessary reforms in the educational system should be made. “Professional schools focus on knowledge rather than skills because it is much easier to teach knowledge and then create tests for it.”If you assume that people who are not innately gifted are never going to be good at something, then children who don’t excel at something right away are encouraged to try something else. The clumsy ones are pushed away from sports, the ones who can’t carry a tune right away are told they should try something else other than music, and the ones who don’t immediately get comfortable with numbers are told they are no good at math.Imagine indeed a future where most people had a chance to unlock their full potential. Imagine a world in which doctors, teachers, engineers, pilots, computer programmers and many other professionals honed their skills through the years of deliberate practice. Imagine a world in which 50 percent of the people in these professions learn to perform at the level that only top 5 percent manage today.Imagine."

Still 5 stars.Started the book with the Vietnamese version but ended up reading 70% the material in the original Language (English). Just a matter of convenience (in Kindle) and some of the technical terms were better grabbed by using the English version.DELIBERATE PRACTICE: In any field of learning, the objectives should be skills, not knowledge. In figuring out the particular way students should learn a skill, examine how the experts do it. In particular, understand as much as possible about the mental representations that experts use, and teach the skill so as to help students develop similar mental representations. This will involve teaching the skill step by step, with each step designed to keep students out of their comfort zone but not so far out that they cannot master that step. Then give plenty of repetition and feedback; the regular cycle of try, fail, get feedback, try again, and so on is how the students will build their mental representations.It is quite possible that this new understanding couldn’t have come at a better time. Thanks to technology our world is changing at an ever-increasing pace. Two hundred years ago a person could learn a craft or trade and be fairly certain that that education would suffice for a lifetime. People born in my generation grew up thinking the same way: get an education, get a job, and you’ll be set until you retire. That has changed in my lifetime. Many jobs that existed forty years ago have disappeared or else have changed so much as to be almost unrecognizable. And people coming into the work force today should expect to change careers two or three times during their working lives. As for the children being born today, no one knows, but I think it’s safe to say that the changes won’t be slowing down.People should start researching and understanding this concept and applying it in almost every field of life."

Basically, the message of the book is that if you want to be really good at something, you have to work hard it. Talent or intelligence may help you become better at something at first, but in order to become an expert, you have to put in the work. You have to engage in deliberate practice to intentionally improve your skills, and the more you practice the less talent or intelligence is a factor. In fact, at the expert levels, talent and intelligence are not factors at all. This is encouraging, surprising, and even, in a sense, a little bit discouraging. It's encouraging because it means that I could become an expert at pretty much anything; it's surprising because it flies in the face of popular wisdom; and it's a bit discouraging because I know that I won't have time to become an expert at everything I'd like to be really good at. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book to anyone. It will lay out the tools you need to be really good at just about anything."

The methods sometimes sound a bit robot-like, and deliberate practice is not so clear outside of the studied fields (chess, ballet, playing a musical instrument or professional sport).

65,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65610262-karim,3,"The book was average for a couple of reasons. The author's layout and flow of ideas was not smooth regarding purposeful and deliberate practice, given the thin difference between them. Moreover, I don't believe that deliberate practice is the only trait for being a high performer. An awesome book that discusses being a high performer in a structured way is ""Grit: the power of passion and perseverance"" by Angela Duckworth. Below is a detailed summary of Peak. The main thesis of the book is that the right sort of practice will make you an achiever or an expert. The author talks about the difference between traditional practice, purposeful practice and deliberate practice (details below).Naive practice:  Whether it is playing tennis, baking a cake, or any million activities, we start off with a general idea of what we want to do. We acquire knowledge about how to do it. We practice it whether alone, or with an instructor until we reach a satisfactory level where doing the activity becomes more automatic. From this point onwards, performing the activity for more and more time won't simply make you better at it. ""The reason is that these automated abilities gradually deteriorate in the absence of deliberate efforts to improve"".In short, naive practice is ""doing something repeatedly and expecting repetition alone to improve one's performance.""Purposeful practice:  1- has a well-defined specific goal, which is take a general goal and divide it into subgoals each with a realistic and measurable pace of improvements. 2- staying mentally-focused while doing the activity at improving your skills. 3- involves direct feedback from yourself or outsiders. You have to know whether you are doing something right, and if not, how you are doing it wrong? Otherwise, you can't figure out what you need to improve. 4- requires getting out of your comfort zone. Do something you couldn't do before. This will challenge you mentally or physically to acquire the necessary skill to pass your new goal. If you can't pass it, don't just try harder, but try differently other ways at getting past the barriers and reaching your goal. 5- stay motivated. So here we have purposeful practice in a nutshell: Get outside your comfort zone but do it in a focused way, with clear goals, a plan for reaching those goals, and a way to monitor your progress. Oh, and figure out a way to maintain your motivation.Deliberate Practice: Essentially, it is purposeful practice with extra traits: 1- identify the experts in your field, knowing what they do which sets them apart from average performers, then reflect that in your purposeful practice.2- The many more hours devoted towards solitary practice that way exceeds any average performer. 
 For reference, good to know sections: 
 Adaptability: The general belief was once we become adults, our brain wiring and structure become fixed. And that by learning, you try to reach your brain ""predetermined"" potential. A common analogy ""depicted the brain as a computer. Learning was like loading some data or installing new software—it allowed you to do some things you couldn’t do before, but your ultimate performance would always be limited by such things as the number of bytes in your random-access memory (RAM) and the power of your central processing unit (CPU).""Our brains grow and change as we are challenged mentally ""in response to intense mental training"", exactly like what happens with bodybuilders. ""Regular training leads to changes in the parts of the brain that are challenged by the training. The brain adapts to these challenges by rewiring itself in ways that increase its ability to carry out the functions required by the challenges.""With deliberate practice, the goal is not to reach your potential but to build it, to do things you were not able to do before and forcing your brain or body to adapt, for it reaches homeostasis. And you don't stop! you search for the next challenge.. you search for another goal outside your comfort zone again! so you are not fulfilling your genetic potential, but rather you are building and controlling your own potential.Mental Representations: The author defines at as mental structures or encodings that you build as you practice to enhance your skill. For chess players for instance, they encode patterns of chess pieces on their mind. What sets high performers apart from the rest is the quality and quantity of their mental representations. The author states that through years of practice, experts develop highly complex and sophisticated representations of the various situations they are likely to encounter such as the vast number of arrangements of chess pieces that can appear during games. These representations allow them to make faster, more accurate decisions and respond more quickly and effectively in a given situation. This, more than anything else, explains the difference in performance between novices and experts.Mental representation is not just about having the knowledge or scattered information about a particular field, it is more about having this knowledge organized and connected in a way that helps you excel! And deliberate practice's purpose is to enhance your mental representation.. No one starts with an efficient mental representation about the field he/she wants to master. They start collecting information, forming a naive mental representation which has many flaws... It might be missing many pieces which will hinder your ability to do your job faster, or more accurate, or even accurately. but with deliberate practice, you work at enhancing one skill after another, building more effective mental representations, which will eventually make you an expert. The authors summarizes it as the following:It’s like a staircase that you climb as you build it. Each step of your ascent puts you in a position to build the next step. Then you build that step, and you’re in a position to build the next one. And so on. Your existing mental representations guide your performance and allow you to both monitor and judge that performance. As you push yourself to do something new—to develop a new skill or sharpen an old one—you are also expanding and sharpening your mental representations, which will in turn make it possible for you to do more than you could before."
66,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117278-simmoril,5,"Some time back I read a Salon article (http://bit.ly/1S3LiCK) that was adapted from Peak, in which Ericsson and Pool essentially refute the claims Malcolm Gladwell made in his book Outliers, largely on the back of Ericsson's research. While I did enjoy Outliers, I always felt that there was something a little off about the ""10,000 hours = expertise"" rule. As the authoritative source on expertise, Ericsson's book was definitely a no-brainer for me (of the four books listed in the testimonials on the back cover, I've enjoyed them all).Ericsson's book is a natural extension of a number of other books I've read, including The Talent Code, in that it is a scientific, in-depth look at what it takes to not only gain expertise in a given field, but to become an absolute top performer that truly pushes the limits of human ability. His book centers around the concept of 'deliberate practice', which he immediately distinguishes from other forms of practice that may seem like deliberate practice but are decidedly not. Ericsson demonstrates that the ultimate goal of deliberate practice is the development of mental models which allow the fluidity and creativity that are the hallmark of true expertise. While obviously most prominent in the world's top performers, Ericsson goes to great pains to show that deliberate practice and expertise are applicable to everyone in many areas of everyday life, and that 'innate talent' is largely a myth best left to fiction. Peak is definitely one of the best books I've read in a long time. I think Ericsson did a fantastic job of organizing the book around his key, central ideas, and I appreciate the effort he took in showing how to apply the concepts of deliberate practice to areas such as education and job performance, which at first glance may not seem amenable to it. I enjoyed the examples he picked to demonstrate the benefits of deliberate practice (especially his anecdotes about Benjamin Franklin), because they were not solely focused on competitive areas like sports. His advice is highly actionable, which for me is always the gold standard for books like these. I highly recommend checking out Peak, and I hope that it will motivate to look beyond your current abilities and understand that with the right kind of training, there are no limits to what you can do."
67,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"I genuinely have no idea why this book was in the business section of my local Barnes and Noble as it has nothing to do with that. That placement had me worried that this was a psycho-babel laden tract to help everyone think they can become a millionaire or help current millionaires feel more exceptional about their fortune.Fortunately, none of that is the case. What this text is, primarily, is a manifesto for the idea and function of, ""Deliberate Practice."" Those of you in a highly specialized and practice-driven discipline with longstanding methods and traditions are likely aware of some of this already. Being a musician a lot of these notions are part of my own practice and my teaching but the in-depth explanation of the practice across several fields laid out here was highly informative and provided a wealth of genuinely new information as the title promises. Their summary is specific and cogent but still a bit too lengthy to quote fully. However the main feature of the book I found most compelling was the relentless, ""pulling back of the curtain,"" that Ericsson engages in as relates to the notions of so-called artistic savants or, ""innate talent,"" and on the opposite end of the spectrum the idiotic labels of: tone-deaf, untalented, or no natural ability. Likely you can think of several anecdotes and stories you've seen on the news of seemingly inexplicable abilities however there never is much examination beyond that to make you amazed how such incredible ability could have just occurred. Spoiler alert: it didn't. In each case from Mozart through the latest kid you saw on the news doing something incredible there is a history of experiences, study, and practice that are as exceptional as their abilities. Explaining their abilities does not diminish them and it is this explanatory power that will make and keep this text a favorite in the field for a long time. Highly recommended especially if you found the shorter and more narrowly-focused work, ""The Talent Code,"" by Daniel Coyle compelling as well. "
68,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82584149-hossein-jamshidifarsani,4,"I'm too lazy to write a full review.It was a fascinating book to read. Full of inspiring stories, most of them exprienced by individuals working with the authors themselves. The book starts with differentiating deliberate practice from naive or mindless practice. For me, the most important principles of deliberate practice are:1- Actively focusing on improving your performance rather than practicing for fun (deliberate practice is effortful, not enjoyable)2- Closely monitoring your performance, identifying weaknesses, and then creating a specific plan to improve your weaknesses3- A qualified instructor or coach can help a lot in giving feedback and providing the best strategies for overcoming weaknesses and plateaus.4- Deliberate practice always requires your full attention and focus, and mindless repetitions are a recipe for stagnation.At this point, I should mention that there are much more to training and practice in general than the principles of deliberate practice outlined in this book.Then the book put forth a really environmental theory of expert performance, which claims that the level of expertise is solely dependent on the amount of deliberate practice, regardless of your innate talent. This claim, however is not fully backed by scientific studies, and there are some important studies in this field, which show that deliberate practice is responsible for around 20 percent of the variations we observe among expert performers, and other factors such as genetics, psychological and etc. are responsible for the rest. This last part of the review is not in the book though :D"
69,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1290013-kathleen-flynn,0,"I wish this book were better known. Utterly fascinating. It seems one of those rare books capable of changing how one thinks about things. It provides not just information, but a new way of thinking about the world.Peak argues, basically (using research to back its claims) that greatness in any field of endeavour -- sports, music, surgery, chess -- is not the result of innate talent but instead is the product of long hours of effortful, focused practice. That human potential is much greater than is currently understood. And that if we could figure out how to teach people more effectively both to understand this principle and to design curriculums around it, we could all be a good deal better at stuff, raising the bar both of what is possible and what is ""normal.""The implications of this are huge! Imagine a world where the majority of people are really good at and interested in what they do -- not just genius scientists and musical prodigies and star athletes but nearly everyone. There would be a lot less pointless mayhem, I think, and a lot less retail therapy, if people were in the main happier because they were good at something and had a purpose in life. There would be greater respect for expertise, because even people not at the very top of whatever they do would have a better understanding of what it takes to get there. Scientific and statistical literacy would be much higher if people were taught it more effectively in school. I read this book with the hope that it would give me some ideas about how to write novels better. But it's left me feeling more hopeful about humanity."
70,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27285494-roberta,5,"Ok. Would it be an overstatement if I'd say that this book is one of the most important books ever?Well, I don't think it would be. At least for anyone who's interested in education, improvement and learning skills. At first, I wasn't all that blown away. The whole deliberate practice thing seemed a bit like common sense, but the more it was talked about schools and universities, the more I started thinking about how dumb the current education system is (everybody's aware of that I guess). And it makes me so ridiculously angry this review could turn into a rant real quick. Besides the education system thing, this book is quite inspirational despite the fact that the general idea is that ""talent"" is non-existent. Reading this you actually are relieved that science can't prove ""talent"" and that expertise in a skill is really just practice. The old saying turns out to be true - practice does make it perfect. But it's also important how you practice. And in telling that, this book debunks the very popular 10 000 hour rule (personally, I'm ecstatic about that, because, my god, 10 000 hours is a lot of time).I don't want to get into the details. My main point is that this book is great and that literally everyone should read it. ESPECIALLY THE ACADEMIA (thanks in advance, dear teachers, and professors)."
71,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8331026-antti-v-rt,5,"Ericsson is the worlds foremost expert on expertise: he has researched what separates the best from the merely very good, and what separates the very good from the good. The secret, according to Peak, is practice. Innate talents don't matter much: they might have some role when beginning practice, but when you get to the ""very good"" level, hours spent practicing dominate all other variables. But not all practice is equal. Simply playing guitar will not make you a better guitarist, after you've progressed to the level where you can play a tune. After that, more playing will be automatic repetition, but it does not make you better. You need to challenge yourself constantly, step outside your comfort zone and practice specific sub-skills. This is ""purposeful practice"", and it helps people develop. Even better is ""deliberate practice"", where you have a coach or a teacher, who can give you instant feedback and use the best practices developing specifically those skills that are holding you back. Ericsson is most famous from the 10'000 hour rule , although he points out that there is actually no such thing as a 10'000 hour rule: if you practise more, you get better, and the time required to be among the best of the best varies according to field. It's much harder to be the worlds best violinist that the worlds best ondes martinot -player, for example, simply because there are many more people trying to be the best violinist than best ondes-martinotist.Overall an excellent book, much recommended to anyone interested in education, coaching, learning and/or psychology."
72,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76596539-kristoffer-sand-n,5,"4.5/5This highly motivating book is so important, bringing up several fruitful arguments with meaningful societal implications. It’s quite academic, yet surprisingly entertaining (sorry academics, but that’s my sincere rather generalized opinion) utilizing relatable and sensible examples throughout. I especially enjoyed the systematically presented convincing arguments, for instance why natural talent is a myth. The origin of that hypotheses is potentially just rooted in a human bias; seeking a simple explanation to complex phenomena.Potentially, I would argue that it’s a tad bit too long, but with the entertainment aspect and its exhaustive nature in mind, that’s just a minor thing of the entirety. Also, not to forget, I loved the concrete strategies communicating how to apply the insights from this area of research. Especially useful, is the understanding of this book for the kids of tomorrow in combination with the strategies of upbringing, in Carol S. Dweck’s book Mindset. When that superb combination finally becomes the true reality, kids are in for such an upgraded childhood."

It's nice to see scientific confirmation of them.This book shows that to get great, you should practice a lot. But it's not any practice, it has to be ""deliberate"", as the authors name it. It needs to be smart, have clear goals and ways to measure your performance.There's also interesting information about lives of successful people and how they achieved unbelievable results in their fields. After reading this, you probably won't think that it's impossible. This book will motivate you and will show you that with practice, you can get really amazing at any skill."

If you're looking for specific practical tips on how to become an expert, this might not be the book for you. But if you're looking for a book to convince yourself that you can take charge of your own potential—that you can control your abilities and not be held hostage by the idea of natural tallent—then this book comes highly recommended."

I like the fact that this book simplifies the the ideas and makes them accessible (as others have done with his work - the 10,000 hours argument is a misrepresentation of his research). But as he tries to popularise his work by making it accessible he cheapens it at times into a guide for pushy parents on how to push expertise. It is sad and troublesome, and suffers terribly from some cognitive biases which his more academic work is free of.. I am assuming there was pressure from a publisher somewhere. It feels like when your favourite band, you thought had great integrity appear in a really bad commercial. I suppose I am saying that the chapters on pushy parenting feel like someone selling out their integrity for the sake of being popular and widely read."

This book spoke to me directly both as someone who unconsciously devoted years of practice to artwork as a child, and as someone who was told that I was never going to be good at mathematics. Sure enough, as the book explains, I neglected mathematics in favor of what I was being praised for, thus devoting more hours of practice to art and becoming even better at it - a self-fulfilling prophecy. This book made me reflect deeply about my own personal experiences and I will certainly keep its lessons in mind during my current and future studies/practice sessions."

It encourages everyone who wants learn something new, through an efficient method that it can be done and that human brain is still capable of doing amazing things. Data intertwined with stories give us a compelling view that hard, focused and methodical work cannot be replaced by anything. I recomand it with my whole heart!"

Top experts develop their ability by working constantly, progressevly, year after year, without shortcuts. If I stockpile something by reading this book is that using methodical exercise, perseverence and a strong mental representation everyone could improve in any direction and that the ""myth of born genius"" is obvious only a mith and it's all about exercises and hard work. I strongly believe that the potential exist in each of us, we just have to find a way to develop it. I also feel that the richest gift we could give for our children is supporting the ability to reinvent themselves over and over again. Break the ice and get out of your comfort zone, there is the future."
79,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8097460-sai,4,"Thought this book was longer than it needed to be, since there's overlap in the material that the author tackles with that of some other books like The Practicing Mind, The Power of Habit, Flow and OutliersThe central thesis I got from the book was that expertise requires good mental models that need to be constantly sharpened by practice which has strong feedback loops to signal what's working and what isn't. The key differentiator between people who practice and people who use ""deliberate"" practice is that they're looking to constantly make their mental model of what they're trying to do more high resolution, so to speak. And those mental models are what help in practicing better next time and hence making them an expert in the long term. Author has done some fascinating research that others books have quoted"
80,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28643351-tom-cross,3,An interesting book that discusses a framework to improve physical and/or mental performance. The author’s do caution that some performance is limited by inherited traits such as height and mental acuity. I think the author’s give too much weight to deliberate practice and minimize too much inherited traits and personal motivation. And the examples provided are too extreme and frankly not applicable to a wider population.
81,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27331649-nathan,5,"This was a phenomenal book written on the area of expertise. I thought it was concise and easy to understand, with the authors giving plenty of real world example of experts and studies done on peak performance. They also laid out their definition of deliberate practice, which through Ericsson's research he believes to be the way to improve with rapidity and move towards expertise. This is a book I hope to add to my library one day and read again."
82,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89638222-steve,5,This book has reinforced my views on personal growth and my belief that anyone can learn how to do just about anything with practice. But not just any practice—the right kind of practice. It has also inspired me to take up learning new skills which I previously thought were mostly too difficult to learn. But now I’m a true believer in my ability to learn how to do whatever I want. 
83,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59085810-becky-wade,5,"I learned so much from Peak and thought the authors did a great job weaving together personal stories, research studies, and science / evidence-based findings. The chess emphasis was a little heavy for my liking, but I am biased towards running and appreciated all of the running-related gems scattered throughout. Peak has changed the way I perceive time spent practicing (running and writing), and will influence the way I go about it moving forward. Highly recommended to anyone looking to improve at anything!"
84,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30726337-missie,5,"Five stars for inspiration. It's not just 10000hrs of practice it's deliberate practice under a mentor/tutor, pressing against your natural limits. The most powerful concept was mental representations-invisible guides to breaking the mold. Genes/predispositions apparently useful to begin with, but are overcome by those who lack them but persist in deliberate practice. "
85,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102301031-itai-makate,3,"Fascinating book on expertise. I loved the whole concept of deliberate practice. It gave light on “perfect practice makes perfect” and not practice makes perfect. Repetition alone is not sufficient to attain mastery in any field. Rather, breaking down a goal to minute tasks that can be incrementally improved with real time feedback is key. "
86,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75771032-reaz,5,"Now this is the kind of book I like, one firmly grounded in research. I'm glad it set the record straight on Malcolm Gladwell's erroneous, overly simplistic interpretation and presentation of the 10,000-hour rule on expertise."
87,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57905314-gabriel,5,"Everyone should read it. The concept is simple. Deliberate Practice is the way to go. The author simply, clearly demonstrate that talent doesn’t exist. Or that we all have the same talent : adaptability. We can all learn anything and become excellent at it. How do you find, where where does that motivation come from is the question that lasts. the last two chapters could have been more condensed and were a bit repetitive.Go read that book. It will motivate you."

89,0544456254,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011274-brian,5,Excellent! Best book I've read this year. Inspiring and fascinating. It makes you think about talent in a new way.
