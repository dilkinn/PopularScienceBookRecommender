0,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"Ramachandran is not as touchy-feely an author as Oliver Sacks, but the pair of them cover the same ground. They both write about neurological problems, the symptoms expressed as behaviour and anecdotes concerned with the people who suffer from them. Ramachandran's approach is that of a scientist and doctor first, the people he describes are very much patients. Sacks is more 'oh look - this is interesting, maybe even exciting, we (he and the patient) can explore this together'. They both know their subjects and, both are erudite in many different spheres including literature, history and philosophy which illuminates their writing and although Ramachandran concentrates quite more on the science and both are equally enjoyable and 5 star writers.If you like Sacks you will almost certainly like Ramachandran, but he is not as immediately accessible, so persevere. I look forward to reading more from this author.__________________""He had the arrogance of the believer, but none of the humility of the deeply religious.""Best line so far. Doesn't that line just describe so many people who profess great faith and think that and attendance at their house of worship is quite enough. They don't actually have to live the spirit if not the practice of it as well.It was written about a patient experiencing the religious revelations that are a known component of certain types of epilepsy. This is where the patient is always convinced he has had a revelation which is sometimes ecstatic. Very often they carry this through to the rest of their lives. Sometimes every fit will bring ecstatic religious revelations with it which convinces them that this is not a brain malfunction but that the Divine has come to them. Dostoevesky had this kind of epilepsy and it was possibly behind his writing of The Idiot."
1,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,5,"Francis Crick—the ""Crick"" half of the famous ""Watson and Crick"" duo that discovered the structure of DNA—coined a term (and used it as the title for his book on the subject) called The Astonishing Hypothesis, which represents the idea that all human cognition and perception—every emotion, belief, existential crisis, perceived sight, sound, smell, etc—is essentially the product of (or equivalent to) complex clusters and pathways of neurons and the synaptic connections of neurotransmitters that bind them, encased in bone, and in flux like most things. And as Crick once said:
""There is no scientific study more vital to man than the study of his own brain. Our entire view of the universe depends on it.""
And just as matter of historical perspective and novelty: Lucretius, a brilliant Roman poet and Epicurian philosopher (circa 99 BC) proposed the same basic idea that lies at the heart of The Astonishing Hypothesis:
""At this stage you must admit that whatever is seen to be sentient is nevertheless composed of atoms that are insentient. The phenomena open to our observation do not contradict this conclusion or conflict with it. Rather they lead us by the hand and compel us to believe that the animate is born, as I maintain, of the insentient.""
V.S. Ramachandran has run with The Astonishing Hypothesis in ways like no other pop-science writer has—with the possible exception of Oliver Sacks (who writes a wonderful intro to this book, by the way).Let's start with a quote from Rama (as I’ll lovingly call him for the rest of the review) that isn’t from this book but gives some sense of scale and scope to what we’re dealing with here when we pursue the implications of The Astonishing Hypothesis:
""The human brain, it has been said, is the most complexly organised structure in the universe and to appreciate this you just have to look at some numbers. The brain is made up of one hundred billion nerve cells or ""neurons"" which is the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system. Each neuron makes something like a thousand to ten thousand contacts with other neurons and these points of contact are called synapses where exchange of information occurs. And based on this information, someone has calculated that the number of possible permutations and combinations of brain activity, in other words the numbers of brain states, exceeds the number of elementary particles in the known universe.""
A quick word on Rama’s overall style: He prides himself—like any good pop-science writer—on being able to make technical, complex topics comprehensible to the layperson. He accomplishes this in spades. He doesn’t condescend and he doesn’t dumb anything down, rather he’s just charismatic (you should see him speak in person), well-educated in more fields than merely his specialty (he’ll drop Shakespeare quotations, references to pop culture, sociology, history and cutting edge philosophy all in the same page), and just knows how to turn a pleasing phrase (rich metaphors and lucid prose abound). He really captures the childlike wonder and openness to evidentiary trajectories and discovery that is an ideal in science. He often compares his work to that of his boyhood hero Sherlock Holmes. He’s a brain-detective tracking down the roots of these various strangest of strange phantoms found lurking ‘round the human brain. Basically, this is the purest antidote to dry, technical writing, and it seems to sacrifice none of the scientific rigor in the process. A truly stunning feat that I’ve only seen a few other authors pull off as well (Steven Pinker and Oliver Sacks both come to mind). This particular work of Rama’s focuses on some of the strangest, most fascinating, and philosophically rich territory that’s been eked out in the relatively young but incredibly productive and conceptually-expansive history of cognitive neuroscience. At many points I found my jaw dropping further than I thought possible as each page went by. He covers SO MANY interesting neuro-psychological/-behavioral phenomena that it’s difficult to know what to highlight and what to gloss over—there’s just too much for a GoodReads review. Plus, some should be left for you potential readers to happily find on your own (and what I summarize is extremely brief and surface-level anyway).
Phantom Limbs
One of the areas Rama is most well-known for is the revolutionary work he’s done with understanding and curing phantom limb pain. Most people know what this phenomenon consists of: a person loses a body part, most often some section of their arm or leg or the whole thing (though he also mentions rarer instances of phantom penises and phantom breasts) and they begin to have very, very vivid sensations that the limb is still there. The problem often times is that they can’t control what this phantom limb does or how it feels. Commonly, people have the painful sensation that their phantom hand is clenched as tight as can be, to cite one of many examples. Rama discovered a simple and ingenious way to sooth and eventually eliminate these pains. He set up a box with a mirror in it that looks like this:

When he first tried this out on a person who was in agonizing pain they immediately felt a torrent of relief--the phantom limb sufferer described it as an instantaneous and entirely vivid sensation of being able to finally unclench his excrusiatingly painful clenched phantom fist, immediately. The basic idea is that the brain is tricked into believing that that missing limb is present and when the actual remaining limb moves it gives the equally vivid sensation that the phantom limb is moving in that same willful way. This exercise is done and as time goes on it becomes less and less necessary as the phantom pains become less and less frequent. He cracks a great joke about being the first person to ever amputate a phantom limb. It’s utterly brilliant and a fine humanitarian service that he’s brought to many, many people suffering from what was until his fairly recent discovery such a baffling phenomenon. 
Capgras Syndrome
This one’s really interesting and rife with all kinds of psychological and philosophical implications. Capgras syndrome is when a person begins to think that people they know and recognize perfectly well are imposters. One main example in the chapter ""The Unbearable Likeness of Being"" is a young man who had a near fatal car accident which put him into a coma for three weeks. All of his normal functions like talking and walking were restored through physical therapy, but one very peculiar feature remained: he insists that his parents are not his parents. Though he acknowledges the perfect physical similarity and is otherwise perfectly rational he simply cannot be convinced that these kindly older people taking care of him are anything but doppelgangers. Fucking weird, right? Well, there are many more cases of this syndrome than this, so it’s not even quite as rare as one would first guess, and Rama gracefully travels through the cognitive neuroscientific netherworld that lies behind this phenomena with some amazing theories guiding him along the way and developing in his wake. If for no other reason, read this book because of what you’ll learn about Capgras syndrome and...
Cotard Syndrome
In Synecdoche, New York, the most recent film by (and directorial debut of) Charlie Kaufman, the central character’s name is (non-coincidently) Caden Cotard. While he doesn’t have the neurological syndrome he does spend large parts of the film fretting about death (it’s a wonderful film, don’t let this description fool you). Actual people with Cotard’s syndrome are either completely convinced that they are already dead or are decaying. They often swear that they can smell their own rotting flesh, etc. Before we jump to the conclusion that these people are just wrist-slitting goth kids prone to hyperbole or just crazy, we need to take the brain’s eye view with Rama as our guide. And a note about the ""just crazy"" remark I just made: He stresses throughout this book that it is a profound mistake to send the patients he describes straight to the psychiatrist or the loony bin. And he’s always right to do this. There is some time spent arguing against old paradigms of psychology and psychiatry and cultural theory and sociology—even though he does give Freud credit where credit is due and shows us how Freud had seeds of wisdom, but that the seeds need to be fostered by all of the new knowledge and innovation and (most importantly) positive results brought about by the paradigm-shift of cognitive neuroscience when it comes to treating people with these strangest of mental states and behaviors.Alright, there are so many other major points of interest I could go into but I’m calling it quits for now. A short list of other great topics: —Phantom pregnancies—People literally laughing themselves to death—The ins and outs of the placebo effect—Mirror neurons and their relationship to empathy—Blind sight (an incredible phenomenon, look it up)—The pros and cons of evolutionary psychology—People who completely neglect one entire side of their body and do not—and cannot—realize it—The neurological underpinnings of religious revelations and ecstasies—And more! One last word on...
Consciousness
I tend to approach all of neuroscience with the eyes of a philosopher—meaning, I don’t really have an aptitude for the finer, more technical details, and that there’s basically a constant running commentary in the back of my mind (at least) when I approach the brain which is pondering the ever-increasing philosophical discourse about the nature of consciousness itself. This also easily lends itself to more ""existential"" thoughts about the obvious which can be more or less boiled down to this: if a person’s conscious experience is the brain or is a product of the brain (the distinctions here will cause most of your eyes to glaze over, so I’ll be be silent on that for now) then its dissolution is our dissolution. In other words, this kind of stuff practically urges a person to consider the inevitability of mortality to some degree or another. While Rama bypasses all extended musings on the meaning of life and death, he does take a mighty swing at the philosophical debates about consciousness in the final chapter. He’s quite philosophically astute for a neuroscientist with no formal philosophical education. He’s also collaborated with fellow UC-San Diego professor (of philosophy) Patricia Churchland which—for fans of philosophy and science—is basically a dream team. Patricia and her husband Paul are basically the forebearers of a subfield of study called neurophilosophy, which I see as the wave of the future and one of the only hopes for academic philosophy to remain (or become, depending on your station in life) relevant and exciting, and also as a useful clarifying tool for cognitive neuroscience and perhaps science and all the other seriously probing disciplines generally.I'll continue to urge many people to read this book. It’s maximally eye-opening, entertaining and thought provoking."
2,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"I think this was a good book to read after reading Susan Sontag. While Sontag says that the more we attribute a disease to our mind and to our attitudes the more it betrays our ignorance, Ramachandran tries to answer questions like ""Can your mental attitude really help cure asthma and cancer?"" - For example, VSR is courageous enough to venture into esoteric areas such as mind-body connection and divine visions and sound them out with the backing of science and a curious imagination.The Victorian attitude that VSR brings to these explorations make the book a pleasure to read and you too can play Sherlock with the neuroscientist as he goes about snooping in the recesses of the mind in each of the cases.The most basic questions about the human mind are still mysteries to us - How do we recognize faces? Why do we cry? Why do we laugh? Why do we dream? Why do we enjoy music and art? and the really big question: What is consciousness?And more generally, how does the activity of tiny wisps of protoplasm in the brain lead to conscious experience? - These are the questions that VSR tries to address as he stitches together an elaborate network of clinical case studies into a coherent tapestry. He does not claim to have all the answers but shows the daring to face up to these toughest of questions without the grabs of a philosopher or a mystic but with the probing flashlight of a scientist. And that is why both his books are so captivating.He opens the book with an overview about how our brain works. After a few pages of diagrams and explanations about those weird Latin names, he gets to one of the important points that he wants to address through all these wandering with patients and obscure questions - Modularity Vs Holism - What is the nature of our brain's workings? Is it modular with separate areas for separate functions or is fundamentally holistic with all the functions arising from an intricate interaction of all regions?Consider the following examples:Many stroke victims are paralyzed on the right or left side of their bodies, depending on where the brain injury occurs. Voluntary movements on the opposite side are permanently gone. And yet when such a patient yawns, he stretches out both arms spontaneously. Much to his amazement, his paralyzed arm suddenly springs to life! It does so because a different brain pathway controls the arm movement during the yawn— a pathway closely linked to the respiratory centers in the brain stem.Or consider the unfortunate story of a patient known as H.M., who might as well have risen straight out of Memento: H.M. suffered from a form of epilepsy and his doctors decided to remove his 'hippocampus', a structure that controls the laying down of new memories. We only know this because after the surgery, H.M. could no longer form new memories, yet he could recall everything that happened before the operation.After this lengthy introduction, the book finally takes us to the deep end - the clinical cases and their implications:
The Phantom Limb
To understand Ramachandran's approach to this strange malady, you have to get your mind around something called the Penfield homunculus - A map of the entire body surface exists in the brain like a miniature body drawn on the brain surface. Some parts like lips and hands are overrepresented and the locations of the different body parts is not as it is in actual anatomy. Literally a miniature map of your body in your brain. Perform a google search for more.Ramachandran while experimenting on patients with phantom limbs soon found that the penfield map for their missing arm seems to be on their face now. So now if he touches the patient's face, the patient feels the touch on his non-existing arm! Apparently, the part of the map corresponding to face in the brain is very close to the part corresponding to the arm and following the surgical removal, the 'face map neurons' has invaded the part reserved for the arm and is now making the brain believe that sensations are coming from that arm when the face is touched. Stimulated by all these spurious signals, Tom's brain literally hallucinates his arm.He gives a number of examples involving phantom feet and arms and breasts and even sexual organs.One patient, in his description, stood up, letting her stumps drop straight down on both sides. ""But when I talk,"" she said, ""my phantoms gesticulate. In fact, they're moving now as I speak."" - This reminded me so powerfully of Munnabhai and his chemical 'lochas' talking of Gandhi.One of the main problems with patients is paralyzed phantom limbs that are in weird positions that cause pain. To address this, VSR postulates that the phantom limb experience might derive from this explanation: Imagine that your brain area that gives motor commands do not know that the arm is no longer there. So it sends a command, ""move"". Each time the motor command center sends signals to the missing arm, information about the commands is also sent to the parietal lobe which houses the penfield map containing our body image. In the case of an actual arm there is another source of information - the impulses from the joints, ligaments and muscle spindles of that arm. These impulses let the brain know that it is actually moving. The phantom arm of course lacks these tissues and their signalsNow imagine that the actual limb was paralyzed before amputation. Every time the brain sends a signal to move, all the responses from the arm and the visual response gives feedback that ""nope, the arm is not moving."" This process repeats till, eventually the brain learns that the arm does not move and a kind of ""learned paralysis"" is stamped onto the brain's circuitry and when the arm is later amputated, the person is stuck with that revised body image: a paralyzed phantom.So in a burst of intuitive insight or creative genius, VSR wonders if he can give feedback to the brain visually that the arm IS moving, then maybe it will ""unlearn"" this paralysis - visual feedback telling him that his arm is moving again while his muscles are telling him the arm is not there? The only way his beleaguered brain could deal with this bizarre sensory conflict was to say, ""To hell with it, there is no arm!""He does it with his famous mirror box contraption that does exactly that thus performing what he calls the first successful ""amputation"" of a phantom limb!
BlindSight
VSR gives a few clinical examples of patients who are blind in all conventional sense but can still navigate rooms an around objects and can even put envelopes through slits even when they can't see the slits or its orientation. to explain this strange almost extra-sensory perception, we need to understand more about how we see and how we process what we see:What happens when you look at any object?The light from the object reflects back to your eye, activating corresponding optic impulses in the receptors in your retina. These impulses then travel through the optic nerve and then they take tow pathways - one called 'old' and a second, called 'new'.The ""older"" pathway goes eventually to higher areas in your brain. The ""newer"" pathway, on the other hand, travels from through a sort of 'relay station' en route to the primary visual cortex. From there, visual information is transmitted to the thirty or so other visual areas for further processing. The ""new"" pathway after going to the visual cortex diverges again into two more pathways —a ""how"" pathway in the parietal lobes that is concerned with grasping, navigation and other spatial functions, and the second, ""what"" pathway in the temporal lobes concerned with recognizing objects.Why do we have an old pathway and a new pathway?VSR postulates that maybe the older pathway has been preserved as a sort of early warning system or a quick response system. When time is too short to not have the luxury of processing information etc, this pathway allows you to quickly get out of the way of anything that looks vaguely threatening - hard-coded threats and symbols etc. For example, if a large looming object comes at me from the left, this older pathway tells me where the object is, enabling me to swivel my eyeballs and turn my head and body to look at it. This pathway only gives you a sense that 'something' is there.At this stage you have to deploy the 'newer' system to determine what the object is, for only then can you decide how to respond to it. Damage to this second pathway, particularly in the primary visual cortex, leads to blindness in the conventional sense.So, coming back to patients with BlindSight, the paradox is resolved when you consider the division of labor between the two visual pathways that we considered earlier. In particular, even though these patient might have lost his primary visual cortex, rendering him blind, their primitive ""orienting"" pathway was sometimes still intact, mediating BlindSight, allowing them to react to objects that they cannot see and with no conscious acknowledgement that they are aware of these objects. It becomes an unconscious reflex reaction for them.They have BlindSight and can see without seeing.
Imagination and Reality
Ramachandran explores the difference between imagining an object and seeing one. Are the same parts of your brain active when you imagine an object, say, a cat, as when you look at it actually sitting in front of you?He first takes us through a variety of intriguing experiments that we can perform on ourselves to play with our visual 'blind spot' I am reproducing one here but for more off these fun games, go here.
[image error]
Blind spot demonstration: Shut your right eye and look at the black dot on the right with your left eye. From about one and a half feet away, move the screen slowly toward you. At a critical distance the circular hatched disk on the left will fall entirely on your blind spot and disappear completely. Notice that when the disk disappears you don't see a dark void or hole in its place. The region is seen as being covered with the same light gray color as the background. This phenomenon is loosely referred to as ""filling in.""If you did go to the link and perform the tests, you have now experienced what VSR calls ""Perceptual Filling In"" which is very different from just imagining the continuities in those lines etc. When you fill in your blind spot with a carpet design, it is carried out by visual neurons. Their decisions, once made, are irreversible.If you got this much, let's return to the distinction between seeing a cat and imagining a cat. When we see a cat, its shape, color, texture and other visible attributes will impinge upon our retina and travel through to the primary visual cortex, all the information combining to tell us that this is a cat.Now think of what's going on in your brain when you imagine a cat. There's good evidence to suggest that we are actually running our visual machinery in reverse! Our memories of all cats and of this particular cat flow from top to bottom—from higher regions to the primary visual cortex—and the combined activities of all these areas lead to the perception of an imaginary cat by the mind's eye. Indeed, the activity in the primary visual cortex may be almost as strong as if you really did see a cat, but in fact the cat is not there.Why don't you see a cat in the chair when you simply think of one?The reason is similar to what we explored in the case of the Phantom Limbs - The actual signals from your retina informs your higher visual centers that there is no cat image hitting the retina - thereby vetoing the activity evoked by top−down imagery. But if these early visual pathways are damaged, this baseline signal is removed and so you hallucinate - vividly!This then forms that elusive interface between vision and imagination.He talks about the Charles Bonnet syndrome to illustrate this where the brain does not receive confirming visual stimuli and is free simply to make up its own reality.
The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat
In Ramachandran's own version of the story that Oliver Sachs made immortal, we meet Arthur who suffers from a condition called The Capgras' delusion: As Arthur said, ""That man looks identical to my father but he really isn't my father. That woman who claims to be my mother? She's lying. She looks just like my mom but it isn't her.""Remember the 'what' pathway we talked of earlier? This pathway connects to the 'temporal lobes' which contains the regions that specialize in face and object recognition. In a normal brain, once the 'what' pathway conveys the visual signals to these areas, these face recognition areas (found on both sides of the brain) relay information to the 'limbic system', which then helps generate emotional responses to particular faces.What if Arthur's case arise from a disconnect from these two functions of 'recognition' and 'emotional response'? He can recognize his parents' faces but feels no emotional response as the limbic system is damaged in some way? What if he copes with this lack of emotional response by telling himself that they can't really be his parents? Ramachandran then proceeds to test and confirm this outlandish theory using GSR which is used extensively in Blink by Gladwell too.
The God Delusion
Ramachandran in this scintillating chapter lays into the god hypothesis with all the innocent charm of an avenging angel. He argues that the limbic system, especially the left temporal lobe is somehow involved in religious experience. Every medical student, he says, is taught that patients with epileptic seizures originating in this part of the brain can have intense, spiritual experiences during the seizures. Patients may then have deeply moving spiritual experiences, including a feeling of divine presence and the sense that they are in direct communion with God. Everything around them is imbued with cosmic significance. They may say, ""I finally understand what it's all about. This is the moment I've been waiting for all my life. Suddenly it all makes sense."" Or, ""Finally I have insight into the true nature of the cosmos.""Ramachandran finds it ironic that this sense of enlightenment, this absolute conviction that Truth is revealed at last, should derive from limbic structures concerned with emotions rather than from the thinking, rational parts of the brain that take so much pride in their ability to discern truth and falsehood.
The Origin of Smileys
This ""false alarm theory"" is the explanation that Ramachandran puts forth as the fundamental basis for humour. He gives the example of people who have uncontrollable fits of laughter when they have lesions in certain part s of the limbic system. Is it not strange, he asks, that the same system that controls our flight or fight response also governs our laughter mechanism? This is because laughter is a form of social signaling that lets us tell others that a potentially dangerous situation is really harmless or 'silly'. It is contagious as the more people convey this ""all right"" message, better it is for the society - they will waste less effort on these false alarms unnecessarily.
Mind-Body Connection
There was once a woman who was pregnant. She was very excited and happy. FInally after nine months, she started experiencing contractions and rushed to the doctor for delivery. The doctor examined her and got ready for the delivery procedure. He was an experienced doctor and he sensed something was wrong though. he examined her once more and some signs like a down tuned belly button told him that this might be a case of Phantom Pregnancy. He told her he will anesthetic her for delivery and once she woke up informed her that she had miscarried. She was dejected and went home. Several days later she came rushing back. She had a pregnant belly gain and all the other accompaniments of pregnancy. She plopped down on the examining chair and told the doctor - ""You forgot to deliver the twin!""Pseudocyesis or false pregnancy is a condition in which some women who desperately want to be pregnant develop all the signs and symptoms of true pregnancy. Their abdomens swell to enormous proportions, their nipples become pigmented, as happens in pregnant women. They stop menstruating, lactate, have morning sickness and sense fetal movements. Everything seems normal except for one thing: There is no baby.Ramachandran treated phantom pregnancy as a potential example of the kind of mind-body connection he had been looking for. He meditates, If the human mind can conjure up something as complex as pregnancy, what else can the brain do to or for the body? What are the limits to mind−body interactions and what pathways mediate these strange phenomena? And assures us that, contrary to what many of my colleagues believe, the message preached by physicians like Deepak Chopra and Andrew Weil is not just New Age psychobabble. It contains important insights into the human organism— ones that deserve serious scientific scrutiny.Phantoms in the Brain is a wonderful book. It explores some deep and strange ideas and tells us that it is only through exploring questions such as these that we can begin to approach the greatest scientific and philosophical riddle of all - the nature of the self.
Freudian Analysis on Ramachandran
Ramachandran spends a lot of time either supporting or critiquing Freud and I am having to struggle hard to resist the temptation of conducting a Freudian analysis on him. Even though I will not engage in it here, I will leave you with a clue why: It is about the number of times he refers to the two primary sexual organs in the book. One is referred to almost constantly (in addition to his numerous sexual innuendos) and the other is mentioned absolutely never.
Disclaimer
In many parts my explanations are simplistic versions of the ones presented in the book. I removed most of the scientific terms and omitted a lot of the examples and have concentrated on concepts that I found more interesting. If your interest was evoked by this short summary, I would urge you to pick up the book and read it. I would also add a qualifier that if you have read The Tell-Tale Brain, a lot of this book will seem very repetitive with almost word for word similarities between the two, and contains almost nothing which has not been covered in The Tell-Tale brain, which is the better work as it is more developed and coherent and just more fun to read for the general reader."
3,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72975-marley,5,"HOLY CRAP.This is the best book about neuroscience and cog sci for a popular audience ever written by someone not named Oliver Sacks. Ramachandran is, as one of the cover reviews says, profoundly sane, and has a real sense of what you can get from the scientific method and what you can't, and really understands the way questions that used to be philosophical are inching into the realm of the empirical.He also is sometimes hilarious, really up on the other great popular scientific thinkers out there right now, and has examples and experiments that will completely blow your mind, ""Man who mistook his wife for a hat""-style and THEN some. Then, once it's blown, he will spend a great deal of time fitting it into the context of just what that means about our understanding of the large-scale structure of the brain right now.SO EDUCATIONAL, SO FASCINATING, SO GOOD."

The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales
 and was amazed by the cases presented. This book is even more astounding; human brain is such a mystery even today.I knew about amputees’ phantom limbs but not to this extent. And these are not the only cases: one woman did not recognize her arm, saying it’s his brother’s; others completely lost perception of their left part of the body and surroundings. Another, after a car accident, did not recognize his parents, saying they look alike but they are imposters; and they are not the only ones. All these strange behaviors because of minor or not so minor damage to the brain.There are also quite a few experiments done to understand how brain works and how it remaps the body, like this one which I saw some time ago:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1...Both fascinating and frightening in the same time; human body is such a fragile organism.

6,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1844416-ruchita,5,"This is a book about psychology, neuroscience, all the good stuff. Ramachandran is delightfully witty and approaches the big and small questions of psychology and neuroscience with curiosity and equal doses of scepticism and speculation alike. One of the truly good things about Phantoms in the Brain is that it is written with humility and humour. Ramachandran manages to expound whilst being hilarious and without 'dumbing down', so to speak. The book isn't an overtly serious-nature thesis so it follows a rather non-stuffy style, which is refreshing. It mainly consists of anecdotes and cases culled from wide-ranging medical literature, so it serves as a ground for inquiry into the nature, symptoms, effects and treatments of the various psychological anomalies. The book doesn't shy away from supporting the cases with evidence and providing the necessary scientific context and explanation for the problems at hand. I think that's the most crucial thing for any 'popular science' book. Science shouldn't be downplayed or given the back seat at the cost of 'making it easy.' A popular science book fails if it doesn't bring out the science bit in. Because, you know, it popular science after all.What I also liked was that every chapter begins with quotes taken from sources as wide as the books of Sherlock Holmes, the Vedas and Shakespeare. That adds a nice touch.But I think the most important thing I took away (when I read this at 16) was the spirit of scientific enquiry and sense of wonder that this book carries with it. At the heart of it, it's all about trying to understand Life, the Universe, and Everything. And that sense of wonder - that joy of scientific discovery - is contagious. I love science."
7,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359025-jigar-brahmbhatt,4,"I begin to like Dr. Ramachandran. Such a remarkable, intelligent, and humble man, someone who would make a nice companion during long campfires. The phantom limbs this book famously talks about is well-known now. But it talks about much more than that. The brain is after all a complex thing. We hardly understand how it ticks and many things that pass on as bogus, like clairvoyance, are not completely unprovable given the limitations of brain study. That Ramachandran is willing to stray into the tall claims made by mystics is a wonder and a joy because most of the self-serious scientists don't like to get their hands dirty.The book informs us that phantom limbs occur because the brain's ""body image"" - the mapping of each body part in the brain - gets altered due to shock or some other reason. This is a plausible theory. Consider a man who has an amputated leg and whenever he reaches an orgasm he feels it in his phantom leg and not in the penis. The reason is not, as Frued suggested years ago while explaining foot fetish, that the feet resemble the phallus. But because the sensors for the leg and the penis are quite close in the ""body image"". This is interesting. Consider also that in female brains the sensors for earlobe and nipples are quite close - the rest is elementary. But this ""body image"" may get altered, resulting in messed up, baffling signals, the kind patients with phantom limbs feel. In fact, normal people can also feel something like it. Take this experiment:Ask two of your friends to join you. Call them A and B. Sit in a chair. Ask A to sit in front of you in another chair. Blindfold your eyes. Now ask B to take your hand and periodically tickle A's nose and at the same time tickle your nose with another hand. Simple. But after some 30 to 40 seconds you will feel that A's nose is your nose, the one being tickled by your hand, and not the one on your body. This ""nose outside my body"" experience happens because the ""body image"" gets slightly altered because of the experiment. The fact of the matter is as Dr. Ramachandran explains:""Your body image, despite all its appearance of durability is an entirely transitory internal construct that can be profoundly modified with a few simple tricks. It is merely a shell you have temporarily created for successfully passing your genes to your offspring.""Along the way he sheds light on a new discovery about how we perceive the world. A simple act of seeing is distributed among multiple visual areas and division of labor among the two - the ""how"" and ""what"" - pathways. A small imbalance in these pathways can cause disastrous effects. A real case study tells about a woman with such a deformity who could see perfectly well but could never sense motion. This meant this she could never cross a road because she could not see continuous movement, only static snapshots. A simple event of filling coffee was always troublesome because the snapshots won't tell her when her cup was about to spill. It tells us that we don't understand vision completely.Dr. Ramachandran writes: ""If I toss a red ball at you, several far-flung visual areas in your brains are activated simultaneously, but what you see is a single unified picture of the ball. Does this unification come about because there is a later place in the brain where all this information is put together - what the philosopher Dan Dennett calls a Cartesian Theater? Or are there connections between these areas so that their simultaneous activation leads directly to a sort of synchronized firing pattern that in turn creates perpetual unity? This question - the so-called binding problem, is one of the many unresolved riddles in neuroscience.""Stroke patients sometimes go into denial or repress the fact of the paralysis and although these baffling acts confuse doctors, some brave neurologists actually find parallels of these behavior with Freudian concepts like ""repression"", ""denial"", ""reaction formation"" and the like. It is an opportunity for them to test Freud's theories because although we all display such behavior in our day to day life, in these unfortunate patients the intensity is tenfold, giving enough material to hold an experiment. Even though Freud bashing is a popular intellectual pastime, Ramachandran believes that he had some valuable insights up his sleeve about our psychological defenses. Many strange sightings of ghosts, angels, UFOs may be due to ocular pathology, a malfunction called Charles Bonnet syndrome. The pleasure of this book arises from Dr. Ramachandran's enthusiastic writing style, presenting one case study after another, giving us proper details that lead to the ""wow"" moment - the discovery of something new about the brain, and along the way he makes us feel like Sherlock Holmes (a figure that significantly inspired him to join medicine). During the reading of the book I was mostly agile and curious to know what would come next. Not many popular science books are like that. Though some present excellent ideas, they hamper the reading experience by either being too verbose/dull or too technical.We learn from this book that a lot of what we know about the curious sounding functions of the brain is by studying patients with deformities or malfunction, a method used by psychoanalysts in the past, but today's neurologists rely on sophisticated observations and not educated guesses. What does all the case studies tell us? That most of the brain processes run by comparisons and not by absolute values. You never know what you may end up finding next. I don't know about others, but I take comfort in that idea. That this reality, my reality, the way I perceive it, the things that I understand, the things that I don't, everything has my brain at its center. It makes me who I am. I am not speaking as an Idealist, but a lot of what goes around in life is constantly scanned by my brain. I cannot deny its influence. The brain is powerful enough to generate a religious experience. Even intense religious experiences are traced to the limbic system, but Dr. Ramachandran is humble enough to state that the existence of God cannot be denied on empirical grounds. In the later chapters he dwells on pseudocyesis - a condition in which a woman experiences all the signs of pregnancy, swollen belly, lactating breasts and the like, but there is one thing missing: the baby! The fake pregnancy is the result of a delusion. How f*ed-up is that! Listen to this now: a rare few men who show extreme sympathy towards their pregnant wives start showing signs of pregnancy. They even start lactating. People, lets all bow down to the power of the mind! Reading this book, I have secretly started believing that if it can make such improbable things true, if only one could train it in the right direction and draw amazing fruits from it (the way new age mystics claim all the time). It helps me to know that something intriguing may happen tomorrow that today I find impossible. It would not be a miracle. It would just be a new thing I would learn about myself, about my mental abilities. We may not end up knowing everything about the brain, because it looks like an infinite machine, but there is comfort in the fact that there is a lot more to learn. It will be exciting. It will keep us busy. "
8,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2585926-stela,4,"This is the second book about neuro-psychology I've read and it has been an entirely new experience. ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" was (and reflected in the title as such) mainly amusing. On the other hand, ""Phantoms in the Brain"" is (as, again, suggested by the title) quite disturbing. The first focused on weird cases per se, collecting stories only because they were odd, hence unique. The second looks at the same kind of stories as unexpected ways to understand and generalize the inner workings of the brain.And the message is unsettling, even if not entirely surprising. It's one thing to presume that sometimes appearances are tricky and a totally different one to learn that you can never totally rely on your senses or your judgment, because almost everything can be simulated by your brain as proved by the symptoms patients develop after a blow, a stroke, a tumor or any other damage, and sometimes even without any visible damage. How can be explained, for example, the pain someone feels in an amputated limb? Maybe by the hypothesis that ""...pain is an opinion on the organism's state of health rather than a mere reflexive response to an injury."" There are many syndromes of the same kind that lead to the same uncomfortable conclusion: that the ownership of our body is an illusion: - Charles Bonnet syndrome: a damage in the visual pathway causes a special sort of blindness - reality is replaced by some vivid visual hallucinations; - Capgras' syndrome - the patient, otherwise mentally lucid comes to regard his close relatives as impostors; - Cotard's syndrome - the patient claims that he is dead, that his flesh smells rotten and that worms crawl over his skin; - Fregoli's syndrome - the patient keeps seeing the same person everywhere (here is a possible explanation for racism - one person generated the race hate after an unpleasant episode). Whether these syndromes could be explained by some damages in the brain, there are other examples with not so evident answers: the idiot-savant syndrome - persons whose IQ are very low but have islands of astonishing talent; or the fact that when stimulating the temporal lobes you can experience God. Through conscious beings the universe has generated self-awareness. This can be no trivial detail, no minor by-product of mindless, purposeless forces. We are truly meant to be here.Are we? I don't think brain science alone, despite all its triumphs, will ever answer that question. But that we can ask the question at all is, to me, the most puzzling aspect of our existence.In other words, we know that self-awareness is our greatest gift. The question is: is it not also our greatest punishment?"

I love all the brain stuffs, especially all the weird (quite lol) cases of patients!how can a person feel that one half of his body is not present or feels like someone's (say his friends/brother...) how can a person feels pain in his left hand and yelling ""god, its hurts like hell""??actually his left hand is amputated, just a phantom hand)why a person feels orgasm in his left leg while having sex with his girl friend? (again its a phantom leg, not his penis)God must be crazy for creating the ingenious species called ""Homo Sapiens"".we all are CRAZY!!A MUST READ FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVES TO KNOW AT LEAST HOW OUR BRAIN WORKS??.."
10,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,4,"This book ended up on my reading list for several reasons, but I didn't decide to really get into it until I noticed that Oliver Sacks had written the foreword. Having read a few of his books, I decided to give Dr. Ramachandran's look into the peculiar world of outlier psychology a shot.The book is a fascinating read. It talks about the brain's elusive behavior and how it is possible that so many bizarre cases of abnormal psychology exist. Many cases that we would describe as crazy, he breaks down into meticulous detail, explaining how different parts of the brain interact with each other to yield odd and otherwise inexplicable behavior. We've all heard of phantom pains, or the phenomenon experienced by amputees where they can still feel their now-gone limb, often feeling pain or other sensations. Logic would dictate that given the absolute lack of skin, flesh, or nerve endings, that this would be impossible. And yet, we can't objectively say that people are wrong if they legitimately feel something. So what can anyone do about this and how do we explain its existence?Dr. Ramachandran attempts to answer these and many other questions in the course of this book. We read about blind spots in the eye and how our brain ""fills"" them in; about otherwise normal people who believe their parents are impostors who look identical to their real parents; about women who show every single sign of pregnancy except the baby and other remarkable psychological anomalies.Some of these cases are incredibly interesting because they discuss the tight relationship between sight and experience. One woman who has suffered a brain injury is given an envelope and asked to insert it into a slot. Given her condition, she is unable to do so. But when placed near the slot, she automatically aligns it perfectly. He discusses optical illusions that make it seem like one circle is larger than the others, when they're actually the same size. In a controlled experiment, when asked to pick up any of the circles, participants would reach out and a camera would measure how wide their fingers separated. Curiously, they were always the same distance, regardless of which circle they had chosen. So while the brain tells them that they are different sizes, the body seems to ""know"" differently. Ramachandran calls this, and other cases, an example of a ""zombie"" in the brain, acting on our behalf without our conscious input.So the book's most intriguing aspect isn't necessarily its encyclopaedic selection of strange cases. I'd give that prize to the philosophical undertones that accompany each examination. These musings range from discussions on free will (the brain seems to do a lot of thinking and acting on its own), to pondering the nature of self (questioning the idea of the ""ghost in the machine"" and whether we should even be talking about souls anymore).Towards the end, I did get a bit lost, mostly in his discussions of qualia. But given that the book isn't very long (shy of 300 pages), that didn't sour my enjoyment."

Very interesting topics.He uses many experiments to probe and investigate. He's influenced by Thomas Kuhn and uses his terminology very often.Preface by Oliver SacksV. S. Ramachandran. Phantom limb. Other topics too that show how our brain works in what Rama calls ""experimental epistemology"".The books he liked when he was young. Praises the book.Preface by RamaGalileo, Darwin, Huxley, Faraday, Humphrey Davey and others all wrote popular science books.Francis Crick influenced by Shrodinger's book What is life.Paul Dicrove (or Decroff), The Microbe Hunters was an influential popular science book as well.Author influenced by books of George Gammo, Luis Thomas and Peter Medower.Also Oliver Sacks, Steven J. Gould, Carl Sagan, Dan Dannet, Richard Gregory, Richard Dawkins, Paul Davies, Steven Pinker and Colin Blakemore.Story of Galileo. Discovery of H. pylori (by Marshall). He was just a medical resident and didn't need any sophisticated equipments. Discoveries are just under our noses waiting for us to discover them.Speculation and imagination is a very important process as a starting point for discoveries in science. This productive even when the speculations are wrong.Many open questions in neurologyChapter 1: The Phantom withinMany inspirational quotes.Religious experiences and temportal lobe epilepsy. Phantom limbs. Large blind spot in vision, with cartoons appearing. Anasgnosia patient who doesn't identify her paralyzed arm as her. Patient who kept laughing all day until he died. Patient after an accident who though his parents were duplicate imposters.All these are due damage in a certain part of brain.Neuroscience is in the stage of Faraday and didn't develop yet to the stage of Maxwell.Describes parts of the brain.2 models for how brain works: modularity vs wholism.Case. Patient who is fighting with her left hand which she can't control. This started after a stroke. Did the stroke damage the corpus colosum and therefore the left hemisphere inhibitory messages were interrupted.Smiles when natural are produced by a different process (basal ganglia) than when told to smile or when looking at mirror (motor cortex). This is clearly seen in patients with stroke in motor cortex who perform full natural smile, but their forced smile was only half (vice versa for patients with basal ganglia stroke).Hippocampus responsible for forming new memories. When removed their new memories are shortly lived only.The region of brain responsible for calculation. A patient who can't calculate. He understands what numbers are and what is an infinity. Laughed aylt a joke involving numbers. Stroke in Angular Gyrus. Has Discalculia and finger agnosia.These examples are pro-modularity.Chapter 2: Knowing when to scratchTom. Phantom limb after an RTA. Wants to link this to nature vs nurture debate - are body maps in brain fixed by gene or do they change with experience [says the debate is still open. It isn't, both play part in us and cannot be separated.].Phantom breast and phantom appendix. Other examples with penis, uterus, face..No sufficient medical explaination. Only observations recorded and no experiments done.Human huminculus map. Proportions of each organ.Touching Tom's face and upper shoulder gave him perceptions in his phantom limb. The face and shoulder area in brain are next to hand.MEG to map brain (very similar to human huminculus results, but this one non-invasive). Their map is changed from the normal. What is the significance of this?Phantom legs felt when genitals were stimulated or at orgasm (again due to their near location on brain sensory cortex).A dude with ambutated leg felt orgasm not in his oenis but in his leg which made it feel much better. The man who mistook his foot for a penis.Could this explain the reason behind foot fetishes? Lol.Ear lobes stimulate phantom breasts.Chapter 3: Chasing the phantomJ. B. S. Haldane God must love beetles. Rama God must be a map maker (so many maps in brain - 30 for vision alone).Lady born with no hands, but feel phantom limbs. But the phantom limbs are shorter than the prosthesis arm.A telescoped phantom limb. The guy felt pain when the dr pulled the cup while the phantom fingers were around it. This rasies questions about the role of vision in this sensation.1/3 of phantom limbs are frozen/immovable.Motor cortex and supplementary motor area (for more complex movements such as doing good bye sign). Cerebellum and parietal lobe (for feedback? body image?)Phantom limb depends on two processes:1. Remapping of brain areas.2. ?Here he got the idea of creating the illusion that the arm was intact. Virtual reality was very expensive so he had to think about another method. Mirrors and boxes.First done on Philip Martenes in 1984. It worked from the first attempt, immediately, but his eyes had to remain open!This supported his theory of ""learned paralysis"".After a while the phantom arm was gone for gone. The shoulder was gone, but fingers were still there. This was a first in medical history. Speculates on why this has happened.The process of remapping after limb loss is a pthological one, and errors in this could give rise to the pain people with phantom limb pain have. Also pain memory from the lost limb.The mirror box works 50% of the time. Is the box a cure or merely a placebo? This possibility was eliminated.Is the pain due to brain giving orders to clinch more and more as there is no negative feedback from properioception or skin surface since the limb is amputated? The mirror might then provide the feedback needed for the brain to stop giving these orders which seem to be the source of pain?You the normal person can imagine the pain without feeling it, because we have skin in our limbs which gives signals to our brain telling it what is reality and what is imagination.Experiment on a patient. Made her think it was her hand movong when it was another hand. She still felt it was the phantom hand moving. This shows the role of vision in giving this illusory feeling.Anatomically impossible positions work too. They can hurt.Says his findings show that modularity of brain is wrong.Phantom limb arises from a complex interaction between nature and nurture.Leprosy patients don't experience phantom limbs when losing their limbs slowly via disease. But when amputations are made they get phantom limbs.Two body images in brain, one genetic unchanging and one up to date. They compete when limb amputation happens (it disturbs the equilibrium in favor of the genetic body image).Pain like all other sensory perceptions is an illusion created in the brain. Using one illusion to destroy another is no surprise afterall.Nise tapping experiment to show how our body image can change within seconds. Dummy hand/table experiment too. [Isn't this the same when he extend our sensation to car? He addressed this point and extends it to other people].GSR device (to measure skin changes for fear). Works with the table experiment.Body image is a transient internal construct. A mere shell that you have temporarily created to pass off your genes to your offspring.Chapter 4: The zombie in the brainDyan, a patient with a special case. CO poisoning. Coma and had brain damage associated with vision. She was practically blind, but had unconscious vision. Blind vision.The puzzle of the symbolic language used by brain for vision perception. Vision is a subtle (unconscious) form of inference [all observation is theory-laden].30 areas for vision: motion (a case of a patient without it), color area (damage to this area is different from the hereditary color vision -which is about photo receptors in the eye-, in this one -located in visial cortex- you see everything black and white),2 paths for vision: Superior Coliculate (old pathway) and Lateral Gyniculate Nucleus (new pathway). The old pathway is blind sight (vision for action pathway or the how pathway). Why does the new pathway (the what pathway) have a privileged space in mind?What would happen if the how pathway is removed? Ballet's syndrome (damage of paratiel lobes). Reaching to things becomes harder and a tunnel like vision dominates.Binding problem.The problem of vision is soluble, discovering the pathways and visial regions is a big step forward.The many ""zombies"" (i.e. unconscious controls) within youThe self ""I' as an illusion.Chapter 5: The secret life of James TherberBlindness caused him visual hallucinations. Were so wonderful and facinating. Charles Banney syndrome. This affects millions of people worldwide.These involve logically impossible things.Difference betweeb seeing and imagining. Vision is an active constructe process. ""Filling in"" or perceptual completion. Vision is an educated guesswork, and so is science.Blind spot, decapitating people with it (lol) and its creative use.The filling by the brain can compensate even big loses in vision (schatoma), and it does it very well that it takes effort to notice it (e.g. not seeing the ""wo"" in women and thinking it's the men bathroom).An experience which shows process of filling in happening live (the two lines were gradually completed by his brain until they were linked).Confabilation ruled out by using big X's and small x's. He said only the small ones were completed. Number completion doesn't work, they look like heroglephics.Author concludes this shows that perception is not a single process, but several.Perceptual and conceptual filling in (the first happens by itself and you don't have a choice about it - it's simple and not guesswork or deduction like the latter).Guesswork is economic and saves energy as it doesn't need to scrutinize all the surface.Charles Bonne (discoverer of Parthinogenesis). The guy who discovered the visual hallucinations of blind or visually impaired people.Mentiones several cases of this syndrome. The hallucinations are up down (from memory) rather than bottom top (from perception).In normal people the normal sensation from the organs limits the hallucinations, whereas for impaired people no such inhibitory feedback is presentChapter 6: through the looking glassHemineglect following a stroke (completely ignoring one side of your visual field). This is neglect and not blindness [lazy eyes]. This happens only with right paraietal damange (and not left).The reason behind this asymmetry is not well understood, but here's a speculation. Right hemisphere has a large global search light, while the left has a small searh light because it's so busy with other things.Cases of neglect patients and how they are managed. Mirror experiment; very strange result, she tried to grap the object from behind the mirror. Named it ""Mirror agnosia"" or ""Looking glass syndrome"".Only a minority of neglect patients responded positively and correctly reached to the left neglected side.Mirror agnosia as a cheap test for right paraitel lesionsThis makes us reflect in the reality of what we normal people see and how our sensations can distort the rules of nature (such as that of optics for mirror agnosia patients)Chapter 7: The sound of one hand clappingAnosagnosia (unaware of illness). Paralyzed in half of their body due to a stoke, yet she vigorously denies it. She is otherwise very smart, sane and knows what happened to her.Claims to be moving her paralyzed hand despite all the contrary evidence to the opposite! Claims to be seeing it move. Claims to be clapping. Astonishing confabilation.Other similar patients bring up excuses ans rationalizations as to why their paralyzed parts won't move (e.g. I'm just tired of people examining me and don't want to move my arm, or claim to have painful arthritis or to be bad at aiming).All of these are methods of self-deception. Freud wrote about how we deceive our selves when faced with unpleasant facts about ourselves.Others claimed the paralyzed hand wasn't theirs (their brother hand). This is known as Somatoparaphrenia.Two ways to explain this: Freudian and neglect syndrome. Problems with both explainations. He looks at differences between the hemispheres. His explaination is a combination of the two.Left hemisphere is like a conservative dude who would believe in all sorts of delusions and not change his model. He represses and denies info that doesn't fit. Right hemisphere as a revolutionary who wants to change the model and detects discrepancies. When the right is damaged, the left wins by default.Denial is part of human nature, wether about addiction, debts or the finality of death.Rwo tests to make sure of the denial of anasgnosia patients.Strange comments by these patients about doing activities with both hands as if somewhere in their brain they knew about their paralysis and were resisting it.Experiment to show that the denial is present even with other body parts such as the other functioning hand (right hand). There are degrees of denial between patients, some global and some more limited.The right hemisphere discrepancy detection confirmed by PET scan.Experiment for reverse denial? Cold water in ear worked as a truth serum and made the patient recognize her paralysis. Her denial personality returned few hours later and she denied confessing to being paralyzed. It is as there are 2 different consciousnesses, one truthful and one in denial.Normal people too have more than a personality; example from dreams where you tell yourself things you don't know or laught wholeheartedly at jokes.REM sleep to have a semilar effect to cold water in ear in removing denials. Freud!Memory, the holy grail of neuroscience. Repression and selective amnesia.After getting out of denial, patients become amnesiac about their denial and claim they had always told the truth.What about when we make it acceptable for the belief system of patients to admit their paralysis such as injecting them with just water and telling them this would cause their (paralyzed) hand to be paralyzed. He calls this ""experimental epistemology"". The patient said her arm was paralyzed!When the same thing was done to the functioning arm, it was not paralyzed even though both were given the same injection. The patient rationalized this by saying it was mind over matter.""What we call rational grounds for our beliefs are often extremely irrational attempts to justify our instincts."" - Thomas Huxley.Freud wrote a whole deal of nonsense. His discovery of the unconscious mind and Defence Mechanisms however were amazing. He didn't do experiments to confirm his ideas, but Rama patients displayed the whole list of these mechanisms right before him.Denial. Repression. Reaction formation. Rationalization. Humor. Projection.Science humbles man. The reflection into the cosmos is a way to be religious for scientists.Chapter 8: The imbearable likeness of beingArthur, after a head injury, thinks his parents are imposters. They decide to fool his brain back into sanity.Kapgrass delusion.Rejects psychoanalytic explainations in terms of oedipus complex (son wanting to fuck their mother and vice versa etc), and favors a neuroanatomic approach.Face recognition areas in temporal lobe and emotional regions in limbic system (e.g. Amygdala).Arthur was tested for GSR (skin dampness) and this showed he had no emotional reaction to his parents which confimred Dr Rama speculation. In other situations Arthur had normal emotional life (i.e. his amygdala wasn't disfunctional).He recognized his parents on phone, but not upon seeing him. This is because they is a separate wiring to the Amygdala for vision and hearing, the hearing wasn't damaged.This teaches us that our brains have special emotional reaction by which we recognize the close people to us. There are also vision centers in the Amygdala (e.g. about gazing).Author speculates that those who think they are dead and rotting might have complete detachment of the Amygdala.To test Arthur for gaze detection. He was really bad at it. Interestingly, he thought the same model was 3 different people. He duplicated things, including Panama (the country), his hair (thought it a wig) and even himself (thought he was not the real Arthur). This probably tells us that the ability to store memories in the same category needs some glow or signal from the limbic system.People with amnesia would forget the person and retain the eomtional memory of him. Mirror of Arthur case. People with Ferguli syndrome think that all people are a certain person or group of people impersonating them, this may be due to excessive connections to the Amygdala.The case of Arthur calls into question the axiomatic assertion that we are a one unified self that endures through space and time.Chapter 9: God and the limbic systemMichael Persinger and the God helmet which stimulates the temporal lobe.Religion as giving solace and meaning to life.The limbic system. Named by French neurologist Bruka. Epilepsy there as causing religious experiences. Temporal lobe personality. See cosmic significance in everything and write many notes on that (hypergraphia).Paul, a textbook case of temporal lobe seizures causing religious experience delusions.Makes speculations on evolutionary psychology. Endorses it, but warns against taking it too far. Makes a speculation on the natural origin of religion.Author chickens from saying this is evidence against God, saying it could also be used as evidence for God (he doesn't endorse either), for if we say this is an illusion then are colors an illusion too? [Yes they are an illusion created in our brain as representation for wave lengths, incidentally the author has mentioned previously that pain is an illusion.]GSR of religious people show they have inhabced reaction to religious things and diminshed one for other things, especially sexuality. If we removed the temporal lobe from these patients would they become atheists/agnostics? that is yet to be tested.Theory of evolution between Darwin and Wallace. Wallace's wondering about why our brains seem to posses capabilities which we do not need for survival (such as math, music etc), this is used to argue for a role for God in making human nature [will he reply to this nonsense?]Rejects general intelligence explainations. Explains how some genius traits are not associated with general intelligence. Savant syndrome patients as an example.Left Angular Gyrus has a role in math and computation. Right angular gyrus and art skills.Brain large size as a side effect of evolving for other purposes. Creativity is what makes us human.Chapter 10: The woman who died laughing25 year old man involuntarily laughing out loud at his mother funeral. Continued for several hours. Died 2 days later due ti subarachnoid hemorrhage due to an aneurysm. A lady with same laughing fit to death. A girl whose brain was stimulated during surgery laughed out of controlLaughter and its function. Endorses evolutionary psychology while still describing it as controversial and warning against going too far with explainations (e.g. trying to explain cooking with genes) or adoping gene-determinism vs environmental-determinism dicotomy.

13,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,5,"Fascinating bottom-up tour of the brain via studies of brain-damaged patients. Rama’s now well-known classic studies are covered in some detail - phantom limbs, synesthesia, Capgras delusion (impostors), mirror neurons (e.g. hijacking evolution via culture). Plenty of other less familiar (at least to me) studies are also covered – vision experiments (multiple pathways, hallucinations, ‘filling in’ strategies), left-right brain studies (e.g. ‘paradigm-shift’ vs ‘conservatism’ modalities), plus some truly fascinating theories on linking temporal lobe epilepsy with various forms religious experience (e.g. breakdown in amygdala connectivity leading to massively enhanced emotional response).Thankfully and contrary to many other neuroscientists and cognitive scientists Rama tries to steer away from philosophy and/or grand theories of mind/consciousness. Instead he concentrates on the specific experiments and biological explanation of the results. Some experiments yielded pretty well-defined explanations while some others ended up in more speculative ones, and Rama is pretty good at distinguishing between the two. His theories/commentary, even when speculative are often quite ingenious and are well-worth knowing.Still given the subject matter it is hard not to slip into occasional implications for higher level theories of self, identity and consciousness. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that Rama is leaning towards the “self doesn’t exist” camp of thinkers but without associated dogmatism and inductive jumps. For example it is pretty clear that our perception of our own body can be very easily manipulated as can our sense of agency/ownership, but the mechanics/manipulation of the rest of the “self” perception needs much more work, let alone the other open yet-unsolved problems of qualia and consciousness. Interestingly and in contrast to Francis Crick and Christof Koch who want to solve qualia question first (via NCCs) and then move on to the self question, Rama speculates that the problems of qualia and self will have to be solved together – after all without the self, there is no qualia and vice-versa. Some other speculations I found worthwhile: -	Rama thinks that eventually, once we can more precisely talk about and explain different aspects of consciousness, the question of consciousness per se will cease to exist. -	Favors reductionism but at the right level of abstraction – not sure how it would work in practice though. -	On free will :o	likes the argument of “being able to change your mind” if/once the prediction of your action (through external observer) is revealed to you. Heisenberg uncertainty principle as applied to free will if you will.o	thinks that Libet’s timing discrepancies are a red herring. There is no reason to expect the timing of perception of decision and neural signals behind it to coincide.My only gripe with the book is the last chapter where he went the pure grand-theory route in trying to explain cogent characteristics of self that any theory of consciousness would need to address. Too messy, imprecise, and wishy-washy, quite unlike the rest of the book. For a much more coherent theory see Thomas Metzinger.  "
14,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2308090-jennifer,5,"Completely in awe of this scientist and his exciting work. I'd be interested to know how Ramachandran's work is viewed by other neurologists in the field (and philosophers too - he ventures daringly into their sovereign terrain a few times) since he adds a coda onto certain chapters explaining many of his own as of yet untested hypotheses and the experiments he still dreams of doing. He often tacitly invites the reader to play detective in-step alongside him and walks the reader through the information in a very specific way, unlocking little bits of the mystery, giving you just enough information that you could perhaps come to the next question on your own, teasing you to use your own logic and come up with the next experiment or formulating the question on your own. It is not just a book informing you of the latest brain research but a warm, funny, often winking invitation from a scientist in the thick of one of the hottest research topics on earth to take a little journey with him, hand in hand. It is a treat to be allowed into the thought process of this brilliant scientist and his very compelling way of doing science to study how the mind works. Never would have imagined that so much valuable information could be gathered from strange exceptional cases like the man who thought his father was an imposter, but Ramachandran convincingly elucidates through many case studies why one particular kind of strange case here and there can sometimes offer more clues than studies on massive numbers of ""normal"" patients. I finally have an answer to the annoying standard interview question....if you could invite three people living or dead to dinner......forget the three people, forget the dead ones, it would be me, this book and my list of questions provoked by the case studies, and Ramachandran. I would serve polenta with truffles. There are some hints in the book that he has expensive taste in food and a thing for truffles. "
15,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A solid set of neurology case-studies, in the tradition of Oliver Sacks. Ramachandran seems to have made his name explaining how different kinds of phantom limb syndromes function, and he's at his best when he's explaining the weird and miraculous ways the brain copes with the sudden loss of a part of the body. Also very good is the middle portion of the book, when he expands his survey to related neurological problems, including temporal lobe epilepsy (which seems to put some patients into direct rapport with God) and anosognosia (where the patient refuses to recognize a part of the body is paralyzed). Some of the later chapters, where Ramachandran goes further afield into evolutionary psychology (a/k/a sociobiology), and various theories of consciousness, feel a little light and overly speculative-- for that stuff I'd stick with E.O. Wilson or Daniel Dennett. But overall, a very interesting read, made easier by frequent diagrams and Ramachandran's engaging prose style. "
16,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879647-donnie-edgemon,3,"I found this book interesting, but not fascinating. Ramachandran wrote the book for laymen. It was probably not easy for him to keep the content digestible for non-scientists, but he did a nice job of presenting complex concepts simply. The book is an overview of neurology, and Ramachandran demonstrated the functioning of the brain as it relates to human behavior through interesting studies of curious conditions such as phantom limbs, illusions of perception, and personality change. If you are a non-scientist interested in learning about neurology, I recommend this book. If you are just looking for a fun pop - science read, there might be better options around."

19,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5055213-bhavesh-mehta,5,"Book on Neuroscience and that too for a layman? Without overtly pretentious? Interesting and also hilarious at times? Yes! Yes! This is the book for you if you are looking to dive into the abyss of scientific works on Brain and Neurology. Reading this book enlightened me about the complexity with which different processes required for our existence are carried out by our Brain without our conscious knowledge. And it also made me recognize the outcome of years and years of evolution on the code of our Brain and what makes us what we are compared to the animal kingdom in terms of Brain anatomy. It is fascinating to know how our Brain at a minute level gives us the amazing capability to perform incredibly complex actions and think unimaginable thoughts. Book is divided into 12 chapter and each one talks about a specific disorder that a patient with the issue must have faced that is accompanied by his engaging life story. This is followed by the author’s ingenious experiments and hypothesis to discover the possible cause of the problem. The narration style keeps your inert curiosity alive while explaining the complex terminologies. But the most important thing about the book is the relentless quest to know the unknown and the way the author transfers his sense of wonder to the readers with his mind-blowing (literally) discoveries. At the heart of it, the book also tries to explore the philosophical space and gives us a science-backed answer to the great questions about of the meaning of consciousness and why we believe in a deity and follow a religion.In the words of Mr Ramachandaran “Science tells us we are merely beasts, but we don’t feel like that. We feel like angels trapped inside the bodies of beasts, forever craving transcendence”"

I think if he was to live in our time he would have removed the word”will” from it. The key idea is that although we take sight, hearing and all other sensations for granted as simple smooth processes, they are a way more complex than we can imagine.Neither Seeing is like videotaping nor hearing resembles recording.You(ironically by the final chapter you will understand that such propositions like “you” and “I” are themselves far from the truth! There is no me or you.. Sorry)are locked inside a bony box(Skull) isolating you from the surrounding world.You communicate with this world through your sensory systems that receive the information from the physical reality, translate it into electric impulses, interpret, edit(and sometimes censor!), relate to previous memories then project it to”you”(your conscious part).There are many differences through this whole pathway among us that make our individual experience of the same”reality” is always unique! Through 360 pages, Dr.Ramashandran presents a punch of bizarre cases he encountered through his career.The defects & abnormalities these patients have are the keys that helped us to figure out how normal brains working.The interesting thing is that the strangeness of these cases reflects how strange our brains are.

21,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein,4,"Dr. Ramachandran is a brilliant mind and easy to follow. His ability to walk through case studies and apply them to the theories of medical science in the field makes him incredibly easy to follow and to see the connections between the symptoms and the best theories about the underlying condition.It's tough for me to read something outside my field because I always wonder what will happen if the author is misrepresenting areas of his field, creating strawmen or simply failing to point out that there are opinions which differ from his own. Ramachandran is humble in expressing his own opinions and good at articulating differing positions in ways that allow the individual to understand where the opposition does differ.The book is highly specialized, and while I have to say there were parts of his work towards the end that I didn't entirely agree with as I felt they were an unfair representation of the positions of most contemporary philosophers, his presentation of the material (which is fascinating) more than does it justice. If you're interested in what's going on in your brain and how that ties to bigger questions, as well as the ways in which it impacts everyday life, it's a fantastic read. And since the book covers a pretty enormous swathe of information on complexes which emerge from brain trauma, there's bound to be something in here that drops the jaw."

27,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7119084-rebeccahowden,4,"Like a lot of people, I’m fascinated by the brain. I love reading about neuroscience and psychiatry, but I’ve never formally studied science beyond year 10 in high school – so it’s always exciting to find a book that covers interesting aspects of the field in a way that is accessible and engaging to someone like me.In Phantoms in the Brain, neuroscientist VS Ramachandran (with the help of writer Sandra Blakeslee) weaves together the stories of some of his most interesting cases and the discoveries he has made about the “phantoms” that lurk inside the human mind. These phantoms are the things that cause the most absurd of disruptions, like being able to feel and even move a limb that has been amputated, or seeing cartoons in the middle of a giant blind spot, or becoming convinced that your parents are in fact imposters who just happen to look exactly like your real parents.It’s these strange disorders that provide insights into the normal workings of a functioning mind – it’s when things go wrong that we can start to learn how things should be working. Amazingly, the entirely bizarre starts to sort of make sense, and even if his theories don’t necessarily explain everything (as no theory in neuroscience ever really can), or even turn out to be correct they are definitely thought provoking.Over the first few chapters, Ramachandran presents a fascinating theory to explain phantom limbs – the peculiar phenomenon in which a person who has had a limb amputated continues to feel as if the limb is still there. Some experience the sensation of being able to move their phantom limbs – like Tom, whose felt that his phantom arm could reach out for objects, and even experienced the sensation of picking them up – and some suffer intense pain, which can’t be treated because to our limited knowledge it doesn’t exist.Through his discussion of phantom limbs, Ramachandran provides a clear illustration of the way our brain constructs our body image, which opens up so many interesting ideas. Maybe the most interesting sidenote (which will be useful for pulling out when the right moment comes up in conversation) is a theory he puts forward about foot fetishists. When you look at the way the body is mapped out onto the brain, the genitals are located right below the foot. There are some interesting cases of people who have had a leg amputated and say that whenever they have sex they feel it in their phantom foot. When you think about it, it makes perfect sense – it’s the same theory as cases where touching the face causes a sensation in phantom arms or hands. So it could be that even in “normal” people, who don’t have phantom limbs, a degree of cross-wiring in the body-brain-map between the feet and genital regions can occur, so that sexual feelings can actually be experienced in the feet.This same concept and ideas about the relationship between the body and the mind keep returning throughout the book, and we start to see potential links between all these seemingly disparate conditions. For example, there is a chapter devoted to “hemi-neglect”, a phenomenon in which a patient who has suffered a stroke in the right side of the brain seems to ignore anything that lies to their left side, including their own body. They might apply makeup to only the right half of their face, and eat food only from the right side of their plate, only becoming aware of the left side of the world when you draw their attention towards it. Similarly, “denial” sometimes occurs in patients who have been paralysed on the left side of their body – their brain simply will not acknowledge the paralysis. They will claim to be able to move their left hand and perform complex tasks with it, and even make up elaborate excuses when they are challenged.Ramachandran’s theories provide some insight into why these conditions might occur, but just as interestingly, he connects it to the everyday functioning of a “normal” human brain. “What I didn’t realize when I began these experiments is that they would take me to the heart of human nature,” he says. “For denial is something we do all our lives, whether we are temporarily ignoring the bills accumulating in our tray or defiantly denying the finality and humiliation of death”.I started to wonder more about how this body-mapping, along with ideas about denial and neglect, could impact body image in the way we usually think of the term, and how maybe some of Ramachandran’s ideas could be used to treat (or gain a better understanding of) conditions like body dysmorphia and eating disorders. What if you could somehow “trick” the brain into seeing what it is unable to see?Ramachandran briefly touches on the possibilities of this and I hope one day he or someone else looks into it more closely, because I think it could be fascinating.Other case studies Phantoms in the Brain explores include Diane, who suffered carbon monoxide poisoning that left her completely blind – but was able to grasp objects and navigate complex tasks with startling precision. For example, if you asked her to post a letter through a mail slot, she could do it perfectly, with no knowledge of being able to see. This is a phenomenon called “blindsight”, described by Ramachandran as almost like a zombie inside Diane performing those actions without her being aware of it. Cases like these open up a complex discussion about what vision actually is – over 30 regions in the brain are involved in seeing, and only a small few of them are responsible for the consciousness or awareness of sight.The book touches on a number of other interesting conditions, like Carpgras syndrome, where a patient believes his close relatives are imposters, and pseudocyesis, known commonly as phantom pregnancy. In the last few chapters, he turns his focus to spiritual experiences – not, as he is quick to clarify, to determine whether or not these experiences are “real”, but to gain an insight into what happens in the brain when one experiences them.This is a book that is engaging and easy to read, without being too simplistic. Key concepts are explained to provide enough of an understanding for the layman to connect with the theory, so that no matter what level of scientific knowledge you come to the book with, you’ll still go away from it with some fascinating ideas about that eternal puzzle of how our brains work to perceive reality.Cross posted: http://rebeccahowden.com.au/review-ph... "
28,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11758887-udit,5,"This is the first book I have read about neuroscience and it was a breeze. Ramachandran knows how to catch and hold the attention of his reader. Of course, neuroscience is interesting enough by itself to most people, but to explain it to an average reader from a non-scientific background like me is no mean task.One thing I noticed early on was how well structured the book is. Each chapter talks about a specific disorder which it introduces with a story about a patient, followed by the author’s theories/hypotheses/conjectures which he tests by conducting ingenious experiments. He further discusses his inferences and relates them to other scientific work and real life examples of similar (but of a smaller degree) behaviour in normal people. At various places throughout the book, he illustrates how certain questions that were always assumed to be philosophical can now be, or at least be attempted to be, answered using empirical data. And in the last chapter, Ramachandran explores some very interesting and logical ideas about what consciousness means.I would recommend this book to anyone who has even a fleeting curiosity or interest in neuroscience. It’s easy to understand and follow, irrespective of whether you have any existing knowledge of the field or not. It’s intelligent, interesting and in places, it’s quite funny too. Neuroscientists may not be able to explain laughter yet, but that does not deter Ramachandran from making his reader chuckle every once in a while."
29,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64527256-alex-dontre,5,Books on neuroscience are often fascinating but few are as entertaining as this.
30,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,5,"This is a path-breaking book investigating the architecture of the human brain. Questions are asked and answered in diverse subjects ranging from 'what is the Self?' and 'what is a religious experience?' to 'why someone with a severed arm feels his phantom fingers and routinely counts on them or feels pain in them'. What is interesting about Dr.Ramachandran's approach is that he probes and experiments with these questions in simple, non-invasive and shall I say, 'non-violent methods' and answers them. Some of the most interesting work in the book that appealed to me are as follows:1. The ""phantom limb syndrome"" which occurs when people continue to experience the presence and 'use' of one of the amputated parts of their body. Dr.Ramachandran says that the experience of the phantom limb arises because the region of the brain which controls the (now amputated) limb gets populated by neurons from the physically adjacent regions of the brain. For example, in the brain, the regions which control the arm, the face and the foot are adjacent to each other. So, neurons from the 'face' occupy the now vacated space of the 'arm'. When this happens in an affected person's brain, she would feel her non-existent arm being stimulated when her face is stroked. An even more striking example of such remapping occurs in some people with their phantom foot. The regions for control of the genitals and the foot are next to each other in the brain. Such people experience orgasms in the phantom foot! Dr.R wonders about our attempts at playing 'footsies' in this context as part of our sexual rituals!2. Zombies in the Brain -- Dr.R shows how we are unaware of 90% of what goes on in our brain! Our conscious mind is simply a facade! His experiments demolish our image of being a single, unified self fully in charge of ourselves. There are a multitude of 'zombies' inhabiting our brain which simply go on about their business without our awareness and in fact, are responsible for our actions! Kudos to Freud who said that our conscious mind is only a smokescreen!3. Our Defense mechanisms -- The book has interesting light thrown on the various concepts advanced by Freud almost a century ago and confirms the validity of many of those ideas through Dr.R's clinical experience. This is courageous because it is so cool nowadays to denounce Freud. Many kinds of self-deception that Freud described are shown to have clear-cut, amplified evidence in Dr.R's clinical experience. Denial, Repression, Reaction Formation (the propensity to assert the exact opposite of what one suspects to be true of oneself), Rationalization (through Confabulation), Humor and the well-known Projection mechanism have all been discussed at length and validated by Dr.R 4. Religious or God experience -- We have long known that people with temporal lobe epilepsy often talk about having found ""God"". Temporal lobes are the interface between perception and action. Dr.R says that during an epileptic attack, the closeness between the Amygdala (emotional center of the brain), Memory (the hippocampus) and the sensory areas of the temporal cortex could involve enhanced connections between these regions of the brain. This would then result in the communication between them to amplify substantially and people would experience themselves and all events as being deeply significant and highly imbued with consciousness.Dr.R contrasts this with people who suffer from Cotard's syndrome which makes them feel emotionally remote from the world to the extent that they will make the absurd claim that they are dead. Both these discussions leave us wondering about our tenuous grasp of what we call Reality!The book is very accessible even to a novice reader like me who doesn't know much about the brain. It is rare that one comes across a presentation of such revolutionary ideas in such engaging manner for the readers of popular science. Thanks to Dr.Ramachandran. "
31,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,4,"This book gives an intriguing look at how the brain works, from the perspective of sometimes bizarre disorders. The author explores the way the various parts of the brain act and interact to give us the experiences in our lives. Thinking, emotions, perceptions—it’s all a product of a complicated set of processes. Phantom limbs that hurt, or that feel like they can be moved. People who’ve had strokes and refuse to believe that one side of their bodies is paralyzed. Blind spots in our field of vision in which we fill in the surrounding shapes, colors, or patterns. Capgras’ syndrome, where a person believes that important people in her life have been replaced by imposters or robots. People with epilepsy who have religious experiences during their seizures. The author looks at all these and much more, outlining what science knows about how the brain creates these scenarios and the larger part that isn’t yet known.I was fascinated by the chapter that covered significance and religious experience. What people assign importance to is something that I find important. It is most likely not important to most people. Why is that? I developed my interest through a series of events (in the 60s) in which I also had some of the classic spiritual experiences. I noticed that my value system was changing; I assigned importance to a different set of things. My opinions about them weren’t necessarily different; just the significance I gave them. I believe that those experiences were produced in the same way as the experiences of the people, including those with epilepsy, that the author discusses. My experiences were produced by so-called entheogens. Being an atheist, I did not associate them with any “god” until I realized that doing so would give me a framework to look at (but not participate in!) religion. It is fascinating that there’s a part in everyone’s brain that can perceive a transcendence, or an identification broader than the individual. And significance—imagine! You think of a friend and the phone rings and it’s her. You might think, how amazingly telepathic—it’s supernatural! Or you might think, what nice synchronicity. Most days, everything you see seems “normal,” of average significance. But on a rare day, everything might seem hugely portentious. Two people might see a bird fly by. One thinks, with heightened emotions, that it’s a sign from a recently deceased friend that there is an afterlife. To the other, it's just a bird. Some people have a chronic heightened sense of significance to the point where it’s pathological. And all of that is a result of things that happen in the brain. Specific things, though we don’t yet know exactly what they are. The author predicts a breakthrough in knowledge of how the brain works in coming decades, on the order of the breakthrough in genetics with the discovery of DNA. I also like his re-re-evaluation of Freud. Freud saw people with a lot of oddities in their thinking. He attributed the oddities to more-or-less acts of will, based on his own and his culture’s dysfunctions, especially sexual hangups. But, he was maybe the first prominent person to say that these things were important and worthy of investigation. And the author cites Freud’s “discovery that your conscious mind is simply a façade and that you are completely unaware of 90 percent of what really goes on in your brain.”The last chapter was meant to pull things together and give interesting directions of inquiry into the nature of consciousness, but it didn’t do that for me. The concept of qualia seemed like overthinking. Maybe I am just not getting it.The book was published in 1998, so it’s not state-of-the art—I think I’ve read more recent information about some of the topics—but it’s close enough for those of us who are not professionals in the area. I see that he’s written more books, and I will definitely read them soon."
32,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4693835-aaron,4,"Despite brief and infrequent flashbacks of some of my college Psych classes, by which I mean my eyes would start glazing over while looking at BioPsych babble like ""angular gyrus"", ""thalami"", and ""sensory homunculus"", this book was an enlightening experience. Dr. Ramachandran brings his life's work - which is basically the study of human freak shows - into the layman's hands with his boyish energy and charismatic enthusiasm and humor. He takes something the size of a melon (the human brain) and surgically unfolds it into something infinite and unconfined and totally mysterious. Going through his case studies and experiments would make me feel wonder and awe, and at times something similar to fear, when I'd start daydreaming about how impossibly complex and miraculous this thing inside of us really is. A few examples of case studies I thought were fascinating:-A woman almost died of carbon dioxide poisoning and lost patches of brain tissue responsible for vision. She was saved by her husband, but would be forever blind. She could no longer see shapes, faces, or recognize her own husband. A mail slot was placed in front of her in random positions either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally and she was given an envelope to place into the slot. She thought it was a ridiculous exercise because of course she couldn't see the slot. After being coerced to just try it, her hand would automatically move into the correct position and would fit the envelope into the slot, without any conscious realization of doing so, as if an internal zombie separate from her mind were guiding her actions. -Another woman experienced a stroke which led her to completely neglect the left side of her world. She'd put makeup on the right side of her face and have no realization that the other side was bare. She had no idea that she was eating only the right half of her dinner plate. When asked to draw a flower, it would only have petals on one side but would look completely normal to her. An experiment was conducted - first a mirror was placed directly across from her. If a pen was placed behind her head on the right side, she would reach out and grab it immediately when asked to. But if the mirror was placed to her right, and then the pen was placed on the neglected side of her body, she'd attempt to reach through the mirror on her right to grab the pen and would become frustrated at her inability to grasp it; her left world had simply ceased to exist.-A boy lost a connection in his brain that linked visual stimuli to his emotion pathways. After his accident, everything functioned normally except for the fact that he would swear that his parents were complete imposters. When talking to them on the phone, he'd recognize them and have normal affection, but when face to face he could not realize them for what they were. Because the emotional response associated to viewing a loved one was severed, the brain's natural adaptation was to assume something completely illogical - that they were imposters that just happened to look exactly like his parents. -A woman went to the doctor after feeling her baby kicking and realized that labor was beginning. All signs of pregnancy were there: nipples mottled, breasts swollen, abdomen enlarged, menstruation had stopped, lactation began, morning sickness, etc. The doctor began the process of delivering the child but realized something crucial missing - a baby. The woman had completely forced herself into believing she was pregnant and her body had adapted accordingly!-Or the savant that is able to tell the time of the day, to the second, without any clock or tell you the exact width of something from twenty feet away, like ""that rock is exactly 2 feet, 3.75 inches wide"". Omg wtf!!!"
33,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3217989-jared-della-rocca,2,"I have become incredibly well-versed in the happenings of the brain over the past few months. A little while back I read Icognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain by David Eagleman. Prior to that was The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Julian Jaynes (as thrilling as the title suggests.) And coming up soon I've got The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge and The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat by Oliver Sacks.Each of these books brings their own interesting perspectives to who and how we are. They mix science with the anecdotal in order to liven up the reading. But inevitably, some are just more interesting than others, and for various reasons. I felt Phantoms In The Brain was a little lacking. Lacking in what? I'm not sure I could put a definitive finger on it. There was a lot of ground covered, and so many pieces of the brain discussed, that I often felt swamped and confused. Each chapter typically covered three or four different anomalies and as many as or two or three times more parts of the brain. Trying to keep it all together felt more studious and less leisurely. Part of the problem is, by Ramachandran's own admittance, his interest in the various anomalies. By not settling on one particular issue, but rather a wide variety, you're kept constantly jumping and never really feel like you've got a good handle on one piece. Instead, he'll present an anecdote, quickly followed by his theory, then three or four alternative theories - both historical and present - then back to the anecdote, then some testing and how it relates the brain, then back to theory, and then to anecdote, etc. It was overwhelming.Finally, and this may just be related to the edition I was reading, I felt like I was slogging through the book. Despite its relative shortness (260 pages), it felt three times as long. I've whipped through books twice as long, non-fiction and particularly science, so it wasn't the subject matter. But about halfway through I noticed something that I had never noticed in 25 years of reading: paper and font matter (at least to me.) The book was paperback, where I usually prefer hardcover. Not that big of a deal, but notable. The paper itself was more textured and slightly browned, indicating age. That subtly bothered me when reading. And the font, that was the biggest difference. It seemed like the line spacing was slightly smaller, and same for the font. Compared to Incognito, which had the same page size, Phantoms had 40 lines per page compared to 35 for Incognito. Without noticing it, it makes a huge difference. Now, I'm not suggesting Large Print is the way to go, but reading a book with short chapters, you tend to read more pages since ""It's only three pages to the end of the chapter, might as well to the end."" And the same when the font is slightly larger, or there are less lines on the page. You will read more in one sitting since it's both easier on the eyes and you feel like you're getting further. On a random sample, there were less words per line than Incognito, but the words were frequently scientific terms (""We know that certain parts of the limbic system such as the insular cortex are connected to the hypothalamic ""appetite"" centers and also to parts of the parietal lobes concerned with body image."") and so each word took longer to process. What am I trying to say here? I'm saying that this book isn't really worth picking up as other books do the same for the topic in a better format; that paper and font matter; and that it's the first time I've really noticed how much that matters."
34,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12138532-guillermo-galvan,5,"Phantoms in the Brain is one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. Ramachandran, world-renowned neuroscientist, revolutionizes our traditional notions of self-awareness. The title ""Phantoms in the Brain"" perfectly captures the essence of his thesis: countless process are being executed by our brain without our knowledge. In fact, our self-awareness is only a tiny aspect of our neurological existence.While this is a science book filled with technical information, Rama is always concerned with the people involved. We're introduced to individuals on a name basis who have suffered extraordinary injuries that reveal how the brain operates. One patient developed a blind spot filled with cartoon characters. Another person has a stroke and swears their paralyzed arm doesn't belong to her. Rama is utterly fascinated by these bizarre occurrences because they are clues leading to the bigger mystery of how our brain works.In each chapter, Rama is like a detective. He's given an apparently unsolvable case with a handful of facts. Slowly he begins putting together a neurological scenario, calling in the suspects: frontal lobe, hippocampus, thalamus. Finally the validity of his theory is tested by the patient's recovery.Lastly Rama is more than a scientist. He's a philosopher to neurology much like Carl Jung is to psychology. His more radical ideas of our mental lives verge on mysticism and outright science fiction.""I think. Science--cosmology, evolution and especially the brain sciences--is telling us that we have no privileged position in the universe and that our sense of having a private nonmaterial soul ""watching the world"" is really an illusion (as has long been emphasized by Eastern mystical traditions like Hinduism and Zen Buddhism).""New discoveries have always disturbed people. Rama's research is powerful enough to elicit a paradigm shift in the same way Galileo presented irrefutable evidence that the earth revolves around sun. We, as our self-awareness, are not the center of our mental universe.""Once you realize that far from being a spectator, you are in fact part of the eternal ebb and flow of events in the cosmos, this realization is very liberating. Ultimately this idea also allows you to cultivate a certain humility--the essence of all authentic religious experience."" "

For me this was one of the few books that shifts your internal paradigm for evaluating people, situations your environment and people's behaviour. Dr. Ramachander writes beautifully and makes difficult neurological concepts accessible and understandable by keeping jargon low, using lots of l case studies and interspersing the writing with a healthy dose of humor. Some of the key takeaways1. Concept of free will or awareness: Our brain functions by creating shortcuts to get through this world which is full of stimuli- visual, auditory, sensory... So most of the time we are running on auto pilot while thinking that our actions are well deliberated. In reality, they are not. Dr. Ramachander gives many many examples of how our brains makes its own calls so many times- phantom limbs being an extreme case. That is why awareness of what you want, why you behave a certain way, what drives you becomes very important because without that awareness you can live your whole life driven by the zombie in your brain. 2. Why early years are critical: While Dr.Ramachander does not directly address this in the book, I was relating so much of what he was saying to my field of early years education. These shortcuts of the brain that drive our thoughts, behaviour, actions through our life are formed in bulk during the early childhood years. Once in place it is hard to displace or change later years. Therefore it is paramount for parents, teachers and policy makers to understand the importance of these years and work accordingly.3. Concept of self: we go through life having an image of our 'self' . What defines this self? Does this stay constant. My takeaway was that the self is ever changing and ever evolving. My self is a little different now than it was yesterday because of the people I have met, situations I encountered, books I read and the changes in the brain in reaction to that. At the end of the book, dr Ramachander describes his understanding of the different kinds of selves which was quite intriguing. A must read for anyone who has an interest in how our brains functions, why we behave the way we do and the role our brains plays in our lives. "
36,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1277173-brent,3,"This book is great. I love the author's style of writing (colloquial and accessible), his way of thinking (humble but free), and his philosophy of science (acknowledging human fallibility and the limits of science). It was fascinating learning about the author's own reconciliation of Eastern religion, Western medicine, and science. This was more implied than explicit, but still intrigued me. The subject matter has virtually no overlap, but I was reminded of Reza Aslan in No god but God in that someone of Eastern faith and Western education taking a stand and defending themselves and in the process defending humanity and its quirks, as opposed to peddling forward the great conformity machine.But besides that, neurology, psychiatry, and philosophy are all fascinating and important to me and this book was about all three. Ramachandran's stated goal is trying to answer many classical inquiries for instance, ""What is real?"" with science and empirical evidence, instead of just rational thought. And it's amazing how much of such a daunting question can be explored in the human brain studying people with different conditions. I tend to think of history in terms of journeys more than destinations. It's rare for me to see something as an end and I'm skeptical if ends exist at all, but I don't feel like ends are what I'm looking for. I don't see thinking as going anywhere so much as just a way of going. A friend loaned this book to me back in the summer and it sat around in my room neglected for a while until I finally gave it a turn. When I finally did pick it up, I stayed up all night until it was finished. Then I returned it. The time between is just astounding and I've already conjured up a phantasmagoria of serendipity and serenity to explain it all. I was happy to see them, smiling while we talked, and dancing in my car the whole way home.Maybe it's all in my head, but that doesn't mean it's not real. And maybe I'd be better off without it, but that doesn't mean it'll go away."

Not as good as it could have been, but that might be due to my biases — what I disliked might be someone else’s favorite aspect.This was clearly patterned after Oliver Sacks’ 
The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat
 — indeed, Oliver Sacks wrote the introduction.It has been many years since I’ve read Sacks’ book, but I suspect I liked that one more. The principle trouble Ramachandran got himself into was his tendency to philosophize. That started to creep in perhaps halfway through, but towards the end of the book the overwhelming majority of the text consisted of his speculations on how neurological research might reveal insights into some of the fundamental mysteries of existence.The earlier topic had been, as with Sacks’ book, a series of mysteries of human behavior that were explored and shown to be the result of neurological problems (or, perhaps in some cases, “peculiarities”). That was fun and deeply fascinating. The latter topic was somewhat interesting while it was closely tied to specific cases (such as the curious trigger of exalted and religious thoughts when certain portions of the left temporal lobe), but grew drearier as the author drifted into reveries more and more distant from his actual research.Still, my delight for the first two-thirds and more of this book earns it a solid four stars.­"

This is the first book I’ve had to read twice to really understand and then I still don’t understand.
 Now I am not saying that this book is boring or way too technical. I enjoyed reading this book, what intrigued me were several case files that were discussed throughout the chapter how how each case was scientifically explained with a dash of humour.There were certain points in the book that made it too cumbersome to follow. Sometimes Ramachandran gets way too technical and the diagrams!!! Please don’t get me started on the diagrams, I have no idea how many times I might have turned back the pages and touched my own head for reference whenever any part of the brain was mentioned for a particular case. Reading this book obviously made me recognize what years and years of evolution have done to the brain and how even at a minute level the brain gives us the amazing capability to perform complex actions and think unimaginable thoughts. It is just as Ramachandran said “No other living creature questions the origin of its existence as much as we do.”Give this book to anyone who is curious about how we do the things we do, wants to have fun while doing it and not want to studies the tons of complex jargon one gets when trying to research this stuff online.As for the rating, I would give it three stars for the simple reason that this book is not my cup of tea. No matter how hard I try, a hard-core computer geek like your truly will perhaps never truly fathom the depths of the one of the greatest mysteries that is our brain (and here I thought that just women were that hard to understand "
39,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1370488-blyden,4,"Learning about various neurological disorders, the theories behind their causes, and case studies, including many of Ramachandran's own cases was absolutely fascinating! Spellbindingly so! What he has to say about phantom limbs, blindsight, the distinct processing centers of the brain and how they relate to consciousness are likely to reshape your understanding of how the brain works. The implications for sense of self, and identity are also very interesting. The weak parts of the book are when the author wanders into sociological speculations, and particular his general acceptance of a evolutionary, sociobiological perspective on some social phenomena, which often come across as teleological. He also seems to have a gratuitous tendency to include examples and reference that relate to sex. I wasn't sure if this was because he felt some need to spice up his topic or whether it reflected some other aspect of the author's personality. This book pairs very well with The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat by Oliver Sacks, who also wrote the forward for Phantoms. The two books overlap somewhat in the kinds of case studies they cover, and have similar approaches to the material, though Phantoms provides more clinical depth and has the advantage of years of further progress in neurology. If you like this book and haven't already read Sacks' classic work, you would probably very much enjoy doing so."
40,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1937339-s-p,4,"Fascinating stuff. Ramachandran explores the relatively new field of neuroscience, through speculation, hypothesises and some fairly low-tech experimentation – conjuring an image of a brain that perceives reality through complex pathways which can warp reality in strange ways when damaged, revealing to the neuroscientist how these pathways interconnect, how the mind works. Throughout the book examples of patients that have suffered damage to their brains are used to illustrate the function versus non-functional pathways operate and what this reveals about the self. Much of the latter chapters are highly speculative, however there are suggestions for ways to test the theories. There are, towards the end of the book, many pages of additional notes in supplement and these are equally interesting adjuncts to the main text. The overall feeling the book is that we are at the beginnings of understanding the way human consciousness (and unconsciousness!) works, but there is much more to be done. That said, the hardest part, the conceptual understanding of what ‘we’ are is mostly there, so that it is just a matter of time before the brain and its contents reveal themselves, as DNA and Darwinism have done previously."

Why would people who've lost an arm still feel it there and feel it on their faces?! How does a woman fill in her eye's blind spot with cartoons?These are the fascinating, playful bits that Ramachandran presents you with, numerous case studies of weird neurological disorders and how he used them as gateways to peer into our brains and see how they might work. The book is fascinating in many respects. It's for the lay reader, so the science isn't thick, and he makes it make sense and you'll come away with a greater understanding of our minds and brains and what-have-you. For instance, there's a map of our body on our brains and if you lose a limb, the adjacent part takes it over (hence feeling the phantom arm on your face). Or, how the brain ""fills in"" missing information in blind spots. Or how different modularities in the brain cause recognition and then the appropriate emotional response and, if the linkage is broken, you think people aren't who they really are.Endlessly awesome and speculative, which is the fun bit. Ramachandran isn't afraid to admit that they don't know shit, really, about the brain, but bit by bit they're learning, usually via exceptions, like the ones discussed."
42,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68131317-amy-grondin,4,"This was an awesome book -- absolutely fascinating and very accessible for someone like me who isn't extremely well-versed in neuroscience already. The case studies were mind-blowing and often unsettling (in a good way), and the combination of Dr. Ramachandran and Ms. Blakeslee was fantastic -- their combined authorial voice is clear, engaging, charmingly funny, intellectually honest, and curious. There are a lot of chapters and excerpts about perception and the self that would make for great conversation in one of my English classes. I also really appreciated balance they struck between neurology and philosophy -- focusing mostly on the former, but never ignoring or (worse!) dismissing the philosophical (even theological) questions that correspond to or arise from some of the research that has been done on the brain. While reflecting on ways in which neurological research may suggest answers to some of the ""big questions"" of life, and never sacrificing their scientific approach, I felt that they still managed to honor uncertainty, ambiguity, and belief -- something that I appreciate in any author."

Ramachandran brings the reader on an interesting, enlightening, and entertaining journey through the human mind by exploring abnormal psychological cases. I enjoyed the book for it's conversational quality (it reads as if V.S. Ramachandran is in the room with you, Indian accent and all, explaining the details of his work!) The book is intended for the lay population; a background in psychology certainly will help understanding, but is by no means necessary to enjoy the work. Ramachandran probes the ""phantom limb"" syndrome (where an amputee still feels an amputated limb), psychological neglect and denial, and even the question of self and self-representation, all the while dropping quotes from Sherlock Holmes, Through the Looking Glass, and a great deal of Shakespeare's catalog. The work is engaging, and also very informative."

Sure, we know so phenomenally little about such an important part of our body. Ramachandran weaves an accessible book devoted to everything about that squishy, slimey ball of grey matter. He starts off explaining how neurology holds the answer for different behaviors observed in people which are sudden and inexplicable. He gives a number of examples involving various neurological cases, to explain about the phantom limbs, blind sight, Capgras Delusion, about the evolutionary causes of smiles and laughter, God, mind-body connection... Oh what not! The most basic questions about the human mind are still mysteries to us – How do we recognize faces? Why do we cry? Why do we laugh? Why do we dream? Why do we enjoy music and art? and the really big question: What is consciousness? At some points I wondered if it was a spiritual book! Highly recommended if you want your mind blown. :) "

Dr. Ramachandran writes this book in way where he makes it easy for an average person to understand. He writes this book with wit and cleverness. He takes specific patients and goes deeply into how and why they do things in a certain way. Why their brain reacts in certain ways and which parts of the brain is the patient using. He does not solve the mystery of why the brain acts in a certain way rather he pushes the limits to try to get to an answer.. He says scientist and researchers should always ""Challenge conventional wisdom"" i find that he does that in all of his work and research. Phantom limbs! I never new such thing existed. "

It all sound like work of magic, when in fact it's true as you and I. Ramachandran has a very smooth, very entertaining, style. he added his sense of humore and a fair dose of comedy to discuss a relatively dry field (neuroscience) in an amusing and simple way.

He takes a case by case example approach, and takes you step by step into areas of cognitive psychology that are fascinating. Great read on neurology understood by exploring pathology. Ramachandran does warn that results are preliminary and far from incontestable, but it's real easy to spot that. A fun read for the science minded guys. "

Despite being an economist who has worked with financial investments during my whole career - and being fascinated by it - the amount of psychology books I have read during my lifetime is similar to the investment related ones. At some point, I concluded piling up more psychology readings were not adding enough marginal learnings to justify the time devoted to them, like a good economist and the law of diminishing marginal utility would predict. But sometimes you are surprised, and that's exactly what Phantoms In The Brain did.This book is marvellous. Many of you have read enough about confirmation bias, but few would know how it actually works in the brain and why structuring the brain this way is so important. That's the kind of learning and insight you get from this baby. Ramachandran is very knowledgeable about the neurological aspects of the brain, while also making the proper links with philosophy and psychology. He writes in a clear and fun way without dumbing it down to lay people like you and me. If that's not enough, he also cites Shakespeare! If he also included lyrics of Rush songs, that would definitely close the loop.His approach reminds me of the one in a book I read last month, Stuff: Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things: by thoroughly studying bizarre cases we can better understand the unusual particularities of our own ""normal"" brains and behaviors. His experiments are ingenious and I definitely wouldn't be creative enough to devise them. And if you thought compulsive hoarding was bizarre, then you should read Ramachandran's book to finally get to professional league. The study cases include a woman whose left hand would try to strangle her every now and then, amputees who go extreme lengths to convince others their lost limb still exists, a woman whose brain constantly creates Walt Disney cartoons hallucinations throughout the day, a son who is convinced his parents are impostors, a woman who died of laughing too much and people who neglect everything on their left-hand side, including the left side of their own bodies. Ramachandran also investigates the neurological science behind deeper issues, such as our religious impulses and our consciousness and sense of self. He would love to get closer to answers on these issues and, even though he obviously can't, the debate is still worthwhile (sorry for you guys who thought you could find the meaning of life in this book).Just stop reading me and run to pick this one up."

It goes something like this - ""philosophers say that consciousness is hard to reason about because it is subjective and there is no objective way to determine if something is conscious or not, however, if we define consciousness as having these three properties that conscious entities (humans) have, we then have an objective measure of consciousness!"" The flaws in reasoning here are obvious - the first is that simply redefining the term ""consciousness"" doesn't actually tell you anything about the phenomenon of consciousness, it just tricks you into thinking that you're talking about that. The second is that just because you know conscious entities that have certain properties does not mean that all conscious entities have those properties, or that all entities with those properties are conscious.If you read this, take everything in it with a massive grain of salt."

Self?- Why do people laugh?- What are links between brain and religion?- How can mind affect our body? How our body affects our mind?

And, the larger evolutionary questions on the conscious, the idea of self, the lies, the rationalizations can one day be experimented and understood by thoroughly examining this 1400g of flesh. A whole new meaning for the phantoms. What! Why? How? A must read this to be at least aware of the numerous phantoms in our brains."
72,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87014511-stan,5,"In ""Phantoms in the Brain"", V.S. Ramachandran attempts to unravel the mysteries of the human brain, with a number of bizarre, endlessly illuminating neurological conditions as his clues. It's worth reading even if only as a compendium of the most fascinating neurological patients that have been described over the years; from a man who authentically believes his parents to be imposters to paralysed patients who deny that parts of their body are unable to move. Ramachandran's ability to weave colourful, highly detailed stories about these cases without losing track of the science that underlies them is refreshing given the plethora of books written by neuroscientists that are rather dry/tepid even if the science is sound. Ramachandran is humorous, elegant and vivid, all the while being scientifically rigorous; he finds the critical balance between style and content that eludes so many science writers. The breadth of the book is also impressive, covering diverse neuroscience phenomena such as motor control, somatosensation, memory, vision, consciousness, and even laughter. The common thread running through all these topics is that the human brain (and its underlying neurophysiology) is the architect of our reality. Altogether, its probably one of the best popular science books out there, even if some of the conclusions are somewhat outdated today.SummaryThe book begins by describing some astonishing cases of the phantom limb disorder, where the sensation of pain or touch is sustained in a limb that has been lost through amputation or accident. Patients with phantom limbs can sometimes experience the most excruciating pain imaginable in areas of the body that do not physically exist. Other patients experience sensations in their phantom limbs when other areas of the body are touched, the most curious case here being a man who experienced orgasms in his amputated leg when having sexual intercourse. Ramachandran shows that these bizarre, ostensibly inexplicable conditions can be untangled by appreciating some distinctive features of the human brain. One reason he suggests for phantom limbs might be neural rewiring in the cortical homunculus, where brain areas responsible for the conscious perception of the (now absent) limb are ""colonized"" by neighboring cortical inputs. A second possible reason is the phenomenon of masking, whereby there is redundancy in sensory input to the somatosensory cortex to begin with. Normally these redundant, secondary inputs are overridden by the primary input, but when the primary input is extinguished due to limb loss than these secondary inputs are unmasked. Another fascinating neurological disorder that Ramachandran tackles is Capgras syndrome, where a person fails to recognize his closest family members after a brain-related accident. The disorder is odd to the extent that normal face recognition is intact with non-familiar individuals, precluding the possibility that an face recognition area like the FFA is damaged. Rather, Ramachandran hypothesizes, the connections from the FFA to the emotional control center of the brain, the amygdala, might be damaged in this disorder. That would provide a neat explanation of why the patients experience no attachment even if the family member is in some sense recognized in terms of visual features. The lack of the emotional response is inferred to mean that the viewed person is not family-associated. A variety of phenomena related to human vision (Ramachandran's expertise) are discussed, and two are particularly striking. First, Ramachandran describes patient DB who has a sizeable scotoma (blind spot) in his visual field due to damage in the V1. There are different theories about what a person sees in this area of the visual field (which we can only infer from the patients subjective experience), with Ramachandran favoring the view that the visual system ""fills-in"" the missing information. What is remarkable about patient DB is that when asked to describe a set of lines presented to his/her blind spot as either vertical or horizontal, the patient will determine the orientation of the stimulus correctly around 90% of times, while denying throughout that he/she can see the stimulus. In essence, the patient perceives the information without that information being accessible to conscious access. This phenomenon of ""blindsight"" has profound implications for consciousness research, as it shows a clear discrepancy between information processing and conscious awareness in the brain (some researchers have argued that the two are equal). Second, Ramachandran details a curious disorder called Charles Bonnet Syndrome, where elderly people developing blindness concurrently begin to have the very vibrant, lucid and life-like hallucinations. Ramachandran suggests that in the normal brain, the V1 spontaneously activates but we never consciously experience this activity due to retinal input overriding it. When blindness develops, there is no retinal input to override this spontaneous activity and the result is hallucination. Ramachandran suggests that this disorder might be quite common among elderly people, but is seldom reported due apprehensions about being labelled mentally unstable. Curiously, patients who are diagnosed with the syndrome experience relief that they are not schizophrenic or plainly ""crazy"". In some sense, the latter are no different from the syndrome in that they stem from certain neurophysiological deficits. Yet this suggests that these deficits are perceived as much less objectionable when well-defined and restricted to specific sensory pathways, in contrast when they are subjectively appraised in which case they are often perceived as a state of global disorderliness in one's mental life. Ramachandran also posits an interesting hypothesis about the nature of brain lateralization. Patients with paralyzed limbs will occasionally experience anosognosia, namely the unawareness of the existence of their physical disability. Bizarrely enough, such patients confabulate (not intentionally though) in the most creative ways to cover-up their conspicuous disabilities. One interpretation of how this comes about is neglect, a phenomenon where individuals are oblivious to objects in one visual hemifield. For instance, they will ignore food on one side of their plate or apply make-up to only one side of their face. The disorder is not one of sensation, since no pathway related to immediate perception is damaged, but rather attention (some neat experiments have managed to glean subliminal perceptual information from the neglected hemifield). According to the neglect hypothesis, the patient with neglect sends out motor commands from the frontal lobes to areas including the parietal lobes, which encode intention regardless of whether the movement is carried out. Thus the patient experiences the intention to move in the paralyzed limb, but no sensory input is sent back (to show that no movement actually happened) due to the neglect. Though this account is certainly compelling, Ramachandran argues that the anosognosia might have more to do with the cognitive functions of the two hemispheres. He suggests that the left hemisphere might be responsible for creating a belief system, something akin to Freud's ego-defensive behavior that aims to protect cherished beliefs about the world. In contrast, the right hemisphere might be a devil's advocate of sorts that looks for inconsistencies in incoming information to ultimately undermine held beliefs. In anosognosia patients, damage to the right hemisphere might result in the left hemisphere being impervious to any information conflicting with established beliefs, such as that one has a functioning, moving limb. A clever experiment is described that supports this hypothesis, where anosognosia patients believe that they see their functioning arm in a mirror but in fact it belongs to a stooge. When the patient keeps their normal hand still but the stooge moves it, the patient will still verbally report to be moving their arm (in short, they continue to confabulate). Since this occurs in the non-damaged hemisphere (right limb), then the neglect cannot be an adequate explanation. Rather, following Ramachandran's reading of lateralized brain functions, the damaged right brain leads to conflicting sensory information about the body being suppressed in favor of what is believed (i.e. visually seen). Finally, in the last chapter Ramachandran addresses what is arguably the most perennial question in all of neuroscience, namely consciousness. Ramachandran is somewhat skeptical of claims that the uniqueness of sensory experience renders consciousness intractable for science (i.e. the hard problem). To overcome the problem of first person experience, he imagines a ""neural cable"" that would transmit sensory experiences from one person the next. In fact, a rudimentary form of such a ""neural cable"" might exist already today in the form of transcranial magnetic stimulation, which has been used on blind patients to evoke vivid images for the first times in their life. Ramachandran suggests that this illustrates that physical mechanisms will not have trouble accounting for qualia with time. This thought-experiment is fascinating, but perhaps it would be more compelling if Ramachandran pushed it to its logical implications. One might transduce the sensory experience of green from person A to person B, but the nature of that color experience will nevertheless be different due to the innumerable other factors that account for qualia at any moment in time. For instance, person B might have different memories of green than person A, and this would have an impact (even if very subtle) on how that colour is experienced. One would have to continue transducing other mechanisms that account for experience (e.g. attention, memory, executive functions) in order for person B to truly experience what person A feels. In the end, pretty much all of person B would have to be replaced with the make-up of person A for the sensory experience to be trully equivalent. Yet paradoxically, person B never actually gets to experience A's qualia of green in this scenario, since he/she is no longer person B, but rather an exact copy of person A. In other words, person B never got to know what it is like to experience green from the point of view of A."

Keep in mind that Ramachandran is one of the most prominent neurologists so he is not purely presenting his ""beliefs"" or ""wishes"" but his findings based on experiments (in his introduction he explains his approach and methodology). I am still very shocked and his ideas are still wandering my mind and I am permanently thinking about it. He shows us how powerful is our brain, how logical and precise it is, how it unconsciously selects what we see, hear, feel,... Then, I am not surprise that people see ghosts (is it only our brain activity?), or why we believe in God (there is ""a special place"" in our brain dedicated to this spiritual matters) - or to what extent is it a result of our brain activity... Well, now when I hear someone saying: ""I have seen it..."", I start to think what everything (memory, logic, experience, biases, emotion...) influenced the final perception and understanding of that person. Just imagine, if you look at something, you may see some patterns, but why somebody else is not seeing the same? What is helping you to see these patterns? To what extent they are real? What is real? It is not possible to touch all fascinating areas this book deals with, but all I can say is that if we want to understand ourselves, this book gives us a great tool - and very important tool. Keeping my mind open, knowing that science is evolving, this is just a small step, but I trust Mr Ramachandran, and I want to know more, therefore Mr Sacks is another one on my reading list. P.S. I must have this book in my library! "
74,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27471372-satyajit-ranjeev,5,"Had this book not been written by a Neurologist one would think the stories were absolute fiction. The case studies in ""You forgot to deliver the twin"", ""The woman who died laughing"" are just so bizarre that it borders on insanity. Yet Ramachandran empirically shows the origin of each of these cases are from the brain. He gives just enough examples of strange cases to get you immersed into the book. "
75,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7606532-emperador-spock,5,"I found out about this book after seeing Dr Ramachandran's intriguing and eloquent talks a couple of years ago, and, if you forgive the cliche, the only regret I have now is that I haven't read it much earlier, since it has all the sharp wit, ingeniousness and thought-provocativeness that Ramachandran's lectures have, with the only difference that a 350-page book is a much more voluminous source of enjoyment than a speech squeezed into a 30-minute time frame, and indeed the bigger format is worth every page.The book is very similar in some respects to Oliver Sacks' 'The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat' (a book to which Ramachandran alludes himself); however, I have found 'Phantoms' so much more enjoyable, since it goes beoynd simply presenting oddities and curious neurological cases, it presents real and systematic attempts at getting some sense out of them and coming anywhere close to treating the unusual conditions described. The deceptively simple and clever (and 'devilish' and 'devious') experiments are the biggest attraction of the book, making you not want to part with it and see what comes next.If I could give the 'Phantoms in the Brain' 6 stars, I would."
76,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33354409-an-l,5,"Mind blowing book.I wonder if the Ramachandra in the movie Matrix Revolutions is a tribute to Dr. Ramachandran. Essentially, the discussion in the movie between the program Ramachandra and Neo about human emotions sounds very similar to the part of the book on 'qualia'.Dr. Ramachandran seems to discuss that the main problem is the semantics we use to describe emotions. For instance, the word 'red' conveys a certain experience in the speakers mind but it would be non-sensical if the listener is color-blind even if he knows all the scientific significance of seeing red, i.e the wavelength, the part of the brain that is involved in processing the information, etc. However if there was a way to 'connect' the speaker's neurons to the listeners visual cortex the experience would be vivid without any discrepancy in the experience.I found this eerily similar to the conversation between Ramachandra and Neo in the train station. It was something like following while talking about 'love'.Neo (puzzled): I have never seen a...Ramachandra: ...a program speak about love?Neo: it is a human emotion...Ramachandra: No it is a word. What matters is the connection the word implies.."
77,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42136548-sarah-faltesek,2,"Did Not Finish. I was excited for this book, having read a few of his articles during college. However, I had to stop reading due to the problematic manner in which he made some of his scientific claims. There were several fascinating bits of information, but so many of them were presented without going on to provide specific research to support them. It felt very anecdotal, as though we were just supposed to take his word that everything he related was true.The final straw was in the 4th chapter, when he described an experiment he had done once, on only 20 people, which had never been re-produced by another neurologist, where the desired result had only occurred in half of those tested. He went on to state that this clearly proved his theory. NOPE. A single experiment, with a small sample size and a 50 percent success rate doesn't prove shit.  I am willing to believe that he has done some good research; his descriptions of various neurological functions were clear and his work seems to be pretty well known. However, I could not continue reading this book. When I read science, I want SCIENCE, not endless anecdotes and grand claims made on shaky grounds. "
78,0688172172,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4836984-sumanth-haradwaj,5,"This book is intelligent, simple, scientific, and humorous. Galen once believed that wounds and diseases are mirrors into the mind and body. Ramachandran just runs with that notion and actually uses mirrors to mitigate and sometimes cure the symptoms of certain brain disorders. His work into the nature of neural remapping is clearly some of the best simplification of the complex processes underlying grand-scale brain activity. After reading the book, studying neuroscience with Ramachandran, and suffering from a skating accident I was able to fully understand the way remapping happens in my body. Now if I use a pen to stimulate the Meissner's corpuscles on my left leg my left pinky vibrates to the same frequency of stimulation. Thanks Rama for teaching me why this is so. =)"

It's very accessible and engaging (in contrast to e.g. the synaptic self, which I found challenging to read) and offers a lot of food for thought for curious readers. The nature of conciousness and the self remains one of the greatest misteries of science. While scientists are far from reaching a final conclusion, Dr. Ramachandran's research offers some answers and certainly posts many more questions."

I found myself thinking, after almost every page, ""That's crazy,"" or ""That's insane,"" but at the same time having the concept make sense.

The thrust of the book is that brain function can only really be studied when part of the brain is damaged, which is nigh-impossible to replicate in a widespread, ""scientific"" fashion. So, this is a bunch of case studies of individuals with various forms of trauma, the effects of said trauma, and how this explains the function of memory, sensory perception, and other phenomena such as phantom limb syndrome.Too cool!"

A basic interest in biology and neurology is enough to sustain you through this book. It's a fascinating narrative about the intricate functioning of the brain. My only grouse would be that the last chapter ""Do Martians see red"" was a little out of whack and too intense. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't make head or tail of it.
