0,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,0,"I only read a few pages because the author, despite being a professor of astrophysics, doesn't sound very scientific at all. I abandoned the book on page 7 when he says, ""The burden of proof now falls on the pessimists"", meaning, those who don't believe there are advanced civilizations ""out there"" are the ones who have to prove they don't exist. Uh, hello? Any neurons firing up there? The burden of proof always lies with those making an assertion that something exists, not on those who don't believe it without proof.He also says that our history of life on Earth shows that we are not the first. Um.... OK, where exactly is that shown? With what scientific method? And two paragraphs later he admits that science has proven no such thing, and yet he makes these grandiose claims and expects us to just swallow them? What, are we in church? I am of the mind that there is probably life out there, intelligent life too, but until/unless we have proof, we cannot say that there is or accept someone's assertion that there is, scientist or not. Until there is proof, it's mostly just wishful thinking. I find it hard to believe that we're the only life when there are billions of galaxies teaming with stars and planets, but that is not proof that there are advanced alien civilizations. If the rest of this book is like the first few pages, then I think Adam Frank probably needs to revisit Science 101. Perhaps if I continued reading, I would find that it gets better, but I have absolutely no reason to think Adam Frank will be different in the rest of the book when he's anti-scientific in the beginning. I would have a very hard time putting any credence in his words."

Frank covers where studies of Venus and Mars by probes elucidated issues we face on Earth and how the Exoplanet discoveries of the 1990s put some numbers to the Drake equation with the discovery of so many exoplanets and many that seem to be rocky worlds in their star's habitable zone. The author shares how our understanding of Martian dust storms gave us insights to nuclear winter and changed the game in regards to cold war policy with nuclear weapons. How Venus's runaway greenhouse effect added to our own climate change theories How the exoplanet revolution made us think our civilization's prospects as we become a major player on our planet's systems. The message is that as we grow more powerful like the magician's apprentice we have to figure a way forward in our civilizations climate crisis bottleneck and figure a way forward for ourselves. It is not to save the planet, the planet will hardly notice if we leave the stage but to save ourselves and guarantee our future. Definitely a book for big thinkers."

Light of the Stars is a brilliant and fascinating look into the world of astrobiology and its implications for Earth’s future. Using a combination of science, history, and narrative, Frank illuminates how humans, as an intelligent civilization, are driving the course of Earth’s evolutionary fate. He asserts that we are most likely not the only intelligent civilization to have existed in the cosmos, and by taking this concept seriously, we can begin to understand our full impact on our planet. He illustrates how we can learn from other planets and other universes throughout time and (literally) space to broaden our understanding of what it is like to be an intelligent civilization in the driver’s seat. Frank’s ability to take complex scientific theory and break it down into palatable portions is a gift. Light of the Stars is indeed brilliant, both in substance and execution. "
3,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"In Light of the Stars, Frank surveys the last decades' leap into space and exo-planet discovery, as well as the burgeoning field of astrobiology. It is a fascinating read, both for its history and its futurism. This book would also be a great textbook for an astrophysics class: accessible and comprehensive in scope.I recently read The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History, and that served as a great companion piece to this: looking at earth's changes, shifts over the millenia, and then this book, putting Earth into context amongst all the other systems and galaxies."
4,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"98th book for 2018.I can't work out why this got so many five-star reviews. You'd think from the title and description it would be interesting take on the latest findings on exoplanetary research and it's application to the environmental management of the Earth. However, it's nothing of the kind. It's mostly a very padded rehash of old stuff (Fermi's Paradox; the Drake Equation; the Venus and Mars landers). Whole chapters are devoted to what could have been summarized in a matter of sentences. The final part of the book talks about exoplanets and their implications to earth sciences, but is very superficial. This would have made a nice article somewhere, but never deserved to be bloated into a book. 2-stars."
5,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,5,"It's all about the experiment that the universe is conducting on the planet Earth - this civilization project. We've made it this far. It's a question of how long will humanity survive.The book basically starts out with the creation of the planets in our solar system, specifically Earth and goes through the harsh eons as it cools, develops water, develops continents, life, oxygen, and variations that we see outside our windows, in a zoo or a museum. The writer then goes into how we began investigating our closest neighbors - Venus and Mars - and the investigations of various climatic models. Eventually the question of other worlds and alien civilizations received more focus. Which, in turn, lead to the Drake Equation and Fermi Paradox. Parts of the equation have slowly been answered over the decades. We now have an idea of how many stars are in the galaxy as well as how common exo-planets are.Previously, it was thought that nuclear war was the last part of the Drake Equation. But what if it is actually climate change and the impact humanity has on the planet? Millions of years ago, the first microbes produced oxygen as a waste product. Produced so much that it led to a massive extinction event which has forced what few anoxygenic phototropes to survive into the dark depths of the ocean near geothermal vents which are close to the Earth's surface at the time of their dominance.What if the human impact on Earth did the same? Drove the climate into conditions which made human life unsustainable? We, as a civilization, would become extinct, the Earth would simply create another new major species and continue spinning merrily on it's way.And that is a major point that Frank - I believe - is trying to make. The impact that the major species has on the planet and in order to achieve technological advances, must continue to make that impact when using energy. Thousands of computer models have been run with variations of population growth, changes in energy sources (high-impact to low-impact) and whether the civilization develops sustainability or drives itself into extinction.And that part of the Drake equation is still unknown. Frank can call it bio-technical probability or pessimism lines on how long an exo-civilization can survive but it basically comes down to whether or not our civilization experiment will survive. And no one knows that answer.In the end, it was not what I expected but I am glad that I got the chance to read it."
6,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10270148-mac,5,"Wherever there's a book (or lecture or podcast) about the size of the universe, count me in. I'm fascinated by the subject, and Light of the Stars is an excellent addition to the genre. Frank writes clearly about the possibilities of technologically advanced civilizations throughout the universe--how many there might be and how long they might last. He writes persuasively because he includes a range of scientific inputs (astrophysics, astrobiology, sociology, evolutionary science...) to develop his analysis and because he's willing to distinguish scientific endeavors from speculation. I can't say I'm convinced by his ideas; however, I am persuaded to consider them seriously. Additionally, this book is about a whole lot more. Frank uses thinking about alien worlds, i.e., he uses the ""light of the stars,"" to give fresh insights into the evolution of the earth, the evolution of civilization here, and the interdependence of those evolutions. He then proceeds to look at the possibilities for the future of the earth and human life. His tone seems just right, neither scolding about our doomed fate nor denying there's a problem. He has a point of view, an argument, but he's not argumentative. I won't replay Frank's thinking here, but I will say Light of the Stars is mind bending and paradigm shifting. Frank provides new ways to think about climate change and the interplay between mankind and the earth, as well as what we can learn from possible alien worlds. I'm no scientist so I can't confirm or rebut his thinking. I can say I'm a bit wiser having read Light of the Stars, and I enjoyed the journey along the way."
7,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"To date, there are 528 reviews of this book and its average is only 3.86 stars. This seems vexing, considering the fact that it is probably one of the most important books to come out in 2018. My only guess is that his inclusion of his ""skepticism line"" might have muddied that waters. I feel unqualified to know whether the skepticism line is something I should accept. As of now, I am not sold. However, the rest of the book was top notch. In fact, this book is exceptional not simply for its subject matter -- keeping the planet habitable for humans and other oxygen greedy species -- but even more so for the vast ground it covered when recounting the history of climate research. If you don't know who Vladimir Vernadsky is, that is because until now, he has not really gotten his due. Adam Frank brought his research front and center and showed how from the time of Vladimir Vernadsky onward,  climate research / earth's systems science flourished. If we do not understand the history of climate research, and indeed the history of our planet  -- a history that created the very atmosphere we depend upon for our lives -- than we cannot make informed decisions. In fact, even if we take into account everything we know, which is a lot, it is still difficult to know what changes we need to make and actions we need to take in order to save our planet. We do not even know if it can be saved. In an effort to help save it, Frank and others are running computer simulations that will hopefully play a role in informing policy. The programs are far from giving optimal answers. There are just so many possible scenarios of how this can all play out. Even if we get fairly solid answers from his latest work, which is extremely important work, will the politicians take it into account? Will it filter down to voters in society enough for them to take action? Who knows, but these are extremely meaningful things to think about. I read this book twice because it was clear that once I finished, I needed to go back and take notes. In Light of the Stars, Adam Frank not only detailed how Earth's climate changed over time and why it matters, but also provided an extradorinaiy history of climate change. Frank's history reached all the way back to Carl Sagan's research on Venus (if you are unfamiliar with this research, this will be a real treat) as well as investigation into the climate on Mars and then Frank took the reader all the way through present day and into the future of exoplanet research, which will inform society even more about how and why climates change. Frank wrote about the ways in which we probed our in order to unlock the record or its changing climate over the past 4.5 billion years. The incredibly detailed manner in which the history was told ensured that the average reader can answer, ""What do we know about climate change on Earth and other planets and *how do we know it*?"" Most importantly, Frank's focus is ultimately on the thermodynamic process that creates and changes climate. For example, is life itself something a planet uses to do work? The great biosphere scientist Vladimir Vernadsky asked this question. The public freaked out at the mere mention, from any scientist, that Earth might be a living system. Yet, all work from later scientists working on the biosphere demonstrated that Earth does indeed regulate itself like a body does, breathes like a body does, and uses life (the biosphere) to remain active and alive. In my estimation, looking at the planet from this perspective, that of thermodynamics, is the only meaningful way to do so.One important thing this book does is give credit to the work of Lynn Margulis. Just like many other scientists, Margulis didn't get it all right, but she was a revolutionary in what she got right. Way ahead of her time, strong in the face of criticism and the politics of science, and because of all of that, she was able to change the way we thought about evolution. I was extremely happy to see that Frank didn't jump on the band wagon of scientist who have, of late, been trying to destroy her well earned reputation for her work on the theory of endosymbiosis. At the same time, Frank skillfully created an exceptional history of others who contributed to our knowledge (especially Vernadsky) as well as clear up some misconceptions left by pasts scientists, such as Vernadsky, Lovelock, and Margulis. He also made it clear why the naming of the Gaia hypothesis was so unfortunate. Lovelock and Margulis would have received a lot more credibility if the crystal-loving hippies hadn't latched onto their Mother Gaia notions and misunderstood them so. But, that is what you get when you go to your neighbor William Golding, who wrote Lord of the Flies, for advice when naming your hypothesis.  A name really can make or break an idea. Renaming Gaia ""Earth Systems Science,"" was surely a help. Early on in the book, Frank discussed the chemical composition of the atmosphere and how the climate will change if the chemical composition changes. We have a wonderful blanket of greenhouse gasses, to which we owe our very existence. Without greenhouse gasses, the planet would not have been habitable for humans at all. So, it's not that green house gasses are ""bad"". It's just that they have to be at just the right concentration to support fragile human life. Consider oxygen. Current levels of oxygen hold steady at about 21% of Earth's atmospheric composition. What would happen if those gasses rose a bit higher, to about 30%? The atmosphere could not support life because any old lightning bolt could set the atmosphere on fire. Luckily for us, life itself regulates the percent of oxygen in the atmosphere. As long as we don't mess with the living things too much, we can keep that percentage pretty steady. The same complex regulation is present with other greenhouse gasses such as carbon or methane. They need to be at trace amounts to optimally support life on the planet. If too much CO is sent into the atmosphere, but volcanoes or by human made factories (and other human made contributions), then it changes the atmospheric composition and if it changes too much, it can become what is called a ""runaway greenhouse effect,"" in which it is too late to bring levels back to where they need to be for life to be sustainable. Calculating the equilibrium temperature of Earth is very simple math that can be done by first year undergraduate astronomy students. I hope politicians read this book and learn just how simple it is to understand about how energy flows and cycles through and out of Earth. If you do not understand this simple formula, you should not be allowed to join in any discussion of climate change policy. Of course there are many complex aspects of climate change that still need to be worked out. For example, other books examine the net effects of the 22 year sunspot cycle on Earth's climate. These are more difficult to determine. But, the least someone should know is how to calculate the equilibrium temperature of Earth. A simple version goes sort of like this:  Earth without an atmosphere would have an equilibrium temperature of zero  degrees Fahrenheit . But, with an atmosphere, the equilibrium temp is the climate  we experience now. Change that atmosphere and the climate will change too much. In order for the earths climate to remain fairly stable over time and not be in long periods of a boiling cauldron or a frozen snow mall, the amount of energy that comes in from the sun needs to equal the amount of energy that is radiate it out, at the right rate. If too much energy is trapped inside the atmosphere by the greenhouse gases, a planet will become too hot. Trapping energy makes things hot. Consider Venus' atmosphere, which is all CO2. The COS trapped greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, creating a runaway greenhouse gas effect that resulted in an absolutely sweltering planet that cannot support life. If too much energy is allowed to evaporate out and not get trapped, it will make a planet too cold.This is what happened with snowball Earth. The greenhouse gasses of Earth have only a spattering of CO2. If CO2 levels rise, then of course too much energy gets trapped. Our place in the solar system is called the Goldilocks Zone for a reason. We are at just the right distance from the sun to have an atmosphere that can support earth *IF* we do not mess with the composition of the atmosphere too much. When too much CO2 is present, such as on Venus, hydrogen gas is allowed to float away. Volcanoes already produce a lot of CO2. There is no question that humans should be very careful about adding more if they plan to continue depending on Earth as a home planet. One good thing about the aftermath of volcanic eruptions is that water can bring much of the CO2 back underground. But if humans spew more CO2 into the atmosphere, the hydrogen that floats away can no longer participate in making the water that sucks the CO2 underground. So many climate change deniers like to pretend the ""science just isn't settled."" Most of the science is settled. Basic chemistry has been ""settled"" for a very long time. We know what happens when you add or subtract chemicals from a medium. Different reactions happen. We know that when you add CO2 to the other greenhouse gasses found in the atmosphere, it helps to dissociate hydrogen from the oxygen that makes the water we need to keep us from experiencing a runaway greenhouse effect. Similarly, we know from studying Mars, that if CO2 levels are high but there is *no atmosphere*, the CO2 cannot be trapped. It radiates out too quickly. No trapped energy means cooler temps. It's very basic science backed up by very basic math (energy in v energy out). It's not unsettled.Adam Frank asked his readers to think about that for a second and reminded the reader that all of these people denying climate change seem to understand nothing about basic physics. Where a rock is formed on the earth determines its shape, color, density.  Being closer to a heat source makes up the salt, further from that heat source makes it granite, and even further makes it less dense rock.  How hot or cold and entire planet is is merely an extension of this simple physics. Depending on what you have in the atmosphere and what you have coming out of the earth it’s going to change not just rock but temperature on that rock it’s not rocket science  it’s just rock science.  The best thing about Adam Frank's discussion in this book is that it follows the slogan, ""Follow the money."" When you want to understand corruption, of course you follow the money. In Frank's case, the slogan would be, ""Follow the energy"". Once you do that, things become very clear. Frank also included a really nice section about Trade winds and Hadley Cells. Our planet spins, which makes wind patterns much more interesting and complex. Every rotating planet with an atmosphere has trade winds. Warping winds can bring things like the polar vortex of 2014. His inclusion of trade winds was to show that Earth is not a special case. The principles of physics laid out in this book apply to all planets. If scientists know if a planet has or does not have an atmosphere, spins or does not spin, is close to or far from a star, and so on, they can make predictions. The more we know about other planets in the universe, the more we will continue to inform our knowledge of how planets work in general.  In addition to including what we know about other planets, Frank, of course, included what we know about our own. He looked at how the Earth developed from a young planet to now and how organisms developed upon its surface. He went through all the extinctions, well covered in many books but beautifully covered in this one. Most notably, it is essential for humans to understand the history of cyanobacteria (my very, very favorite bacteria). When cyanobacteria came on the scene, it, like all species, ingested energy and created a waste product. That waste was oxygen. **Oxygen was poisonous to everything living on Earth at that time, including cyanobacteria. We love their waste. We take nice deep breaths of that waste. In fact if we are having trouble breathing, we humans often go to the hospital and breathe in the purest form of that waste. Yum! But make no mistake, oxygen killed the vast majority of species alive at the time. Those who survived did so only if they were able to find new niches like an animal gut or the hot springs of Yellowstone. We humans create a lot of waste. Our waste from factories, farming, and just about every aspect of daily living is CO2. It's poisonous to us. Maybe not to whatever AI will come later. Who knows. But there is no question that the living green stuff on Earth and the vast majority of species that eat all that green stuff are poisoned by high levels of CO2. Basically, we are changing the atmosphere just as cyanobacteria did. We are in danger of killing most of what is currently living on our planet. We can keep choosing to do that or we can make ourselves even slightly scientifically literate and make informed choices that give our species a better chance at survival. "
8,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"What practical use is research into possible extraterrestrial live and civilizations?We need a new frame to think about our own planet and our relationship. It's just false to all the evidence that we don't affect the habitability of Earth. It's unhelpful, providing no useful path forward, to think of ourselves as a completely malign, destructive force.We need a new story to tell ourselves, that correctly places us as an active force on Earth, currently doing a lot of damage out of our ignorance until now, but able to change direction and, through use of our growing knowledge, able to make different, more useful decisions.Adam Frank looks at both the history of our thinking and investigation of the idea of alien life, up to and including the recent explosion of discovery of extrasolar planets and what that means for the likelihood that other technologically advanced civilizations at least have existed, and the history of our growing understanding of our real impact on the habitability of Earth for us and our technologically advanced civilization. It turns out that that history of growing understanding of the crucial factor of our contribution to global warming goes back not to the 1970s, but to the latter part of the 19th century.He looks at how early life changed our planet to make in habitable for life like us, the crucial fact that it's not Earth we need to worry about protecting, but ourselves (Earth, and life, will go one almost regardless of what we do, but we might not), and how even the study of certainly lifeless Venus and so far not proven to harbor life Mars have enhanced our understanding of Earth and our relationship to it. Even understanding that planets, at all sizes and types, are fairly common in the universe, and that therefore it's wildly unlikely that we're the first technological civilization to exist, expands our understanding. We further need to understand whether it's common, possible, or wildly unlikely for civilizations to survive the technological and environmental bottleneck we are currently struggling through.We want to be a civilization that survives.It's a fascinating book, and well worth reading. Recommended.I initially borrowed this book from my local library, and then bought it."
9,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64752900-madeline-o-rourke,5,"Light of the Stars wasn't quite what I expected (I don't remember what I did expect), but I'm so glad I read it, because I loved it.One element that I totally didn't expect was the discussion of climate change. Specifically, how a lot of our understanding of climate change has come from studying other planets, as well as looking deep into our own planet's history. It was unexpected, but so interesting. The book also largely focuses on the idea of an equation that could provide a very concrete idea about the possibility of life on other planets. Normally, the idea of following the creation of an equation would not interest me at all, but this one is a really interesting equation. Moreover, Frank is a really good writer, which only improves what is already an interesting topic.I've seen reviews from other readers who didn't love this book because it covered a lot of information they already knew. Certainly, this is a book for the everyday person interested in space and aliens, and it doesn't expect much background knowledge of the reader. So it probably wouldn't be all that entertaining to those who already know a lot about astrophysics and the like. However, for me, someone still testing these waters and very much a humanities student, it was a very interesting book. And I'll emphasise again, because it's not always the case, it's very well written, too!So if Light of the Stars sounds interesting to you, I absolutely recommend it. It's fun and interesting and informative. I was engaged from start to end, which is rarely the case for me with non-fiction, even if the topic is interesting."
10,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56268132-pop,4,"I found this book fascinating as I do all things space. Adam makes a compelling case that there’s very likely millions and millions (or more) of other planets that have produced not just life, but intelligent life. So where are they? Adam methodically describes the stresses created by that intelligent life on the host planet as they develop the technology and energy sources to support their lifestyle. These stresses may have lead to the destruction of these intelligent civilizations and their host planets which is at least a partial explanation of no contact with us. More importantly, we need to manage our own planet and resources intelligently to ensure our own survival. A fascinating and thought provoking read!"

It might take up to a minute to stumble across the news that a repeating FRB had been discovered in 2019 - the first of its kind.Humanity became aware of Fast Radio Bursts over 10 years ago. But they were all singular events. However this signal is long-lasting and has a 16 day pattern to it. It comes from a galaxy 500 million light-years away. That raises the next point: that even if this is a sign of intelligence, of if the collaboration between SETI and the New Mexico array does reveal anything, it won't be a local phenomenon."
12,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40413234-sean-carlin,5,"Let me preface with this brief point: I am a Climate Reality Leader with former vice president Al Gore's Climate Reality Project; as such, I am steeped in the subject of climate change, from green-tech initiatives to public-policy proposals to the science of global warming itself. There's new information on those different facets of the subject coming out all the time, but seldom are there new perspectives on the climate crisis. To my delight and wonder, astrophysicist Adam Frank offers exactly that in Light of the Stars.In this thought-provoking and accessible book (no PhD required!), Frank makes the compelling case that anthropogenic climate change would be the inevitable byproduct of any energy-intensive, technologically advanced civilization, and that we are likely not the first intelligent lifeforms in the vast history of the cosmos to have impacted our planetary climate, and by extension threatened its very habitability -- a consideration which prompts an unsettling cosmic question:""How do we know there is such a thing as a long-term version of our kind of civilization? Most discussions of the sustainability crisis focus on strategies for developing new forms of energy or the projected benefits of different socioeconomic policies. But because we're stuck looking at what's happening to us as a singular phenomenon -- a one-time story -- we don't think to step back and ask this kind of broader question. To even pose it seems defeatist. But it must be addressed if we are to make the most informed, intelligent bets on the future"" (Adam Frank, Light of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth, [New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2018], 169–70).With climate change finally becoming a regular fixture on the front page, and a new generation of congressmembers calling for committees and introducing legislation to address the problem, Frank's book is a welcome contribution to a long-overdue public conversation. If you're unfamiliar with the basic science of climate change or how you can take meaningful action to mitigate it, there are other books worth reading first: An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power and 
This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate
. But this one frames what's happening -- our entry into the Anthropocene -- in a grander contextual narrative that offers an astonishingly sobering perspective, one that just may help us strike that elusive balance between panic and denial to take the steps required to give our project of civilization the best shot at enduring and prospering. That's a renewable resource we'll need in abundance to fuel the Sustainability Revolution of the coming decades..."

It sorta then just ended up being a summary of a lot of other work - most of it real cool! - but that never really turned into what I expected. Prolly a 3 star, but I just felt let down at the end.Lot of really cool thought experiment stuff, though! I also prolly read it too fast."
14,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9517361-blaine,4,"Climate change scares the crap out of me. After a lifetime of being a careful student of nature, culture, astronomy, and evolution, I can easily visualize how the ravages wrought by climate change can eventually bring down civilization as we know it. In addition to being a climate activist, I employ numerous daily strategies to keep my spirit from dropping into an abyss of existential anxiety and dread. One of them has been reading this book which takes a big-picture view of our little planet and its crisis. Frank helps us understand our climate crisis from the cosmic perspective of astrobiology and planetary science - everything we've learned about our solar system neighbors but also what we're beginning to learn about a galaxy and universe teeming with planets, millions with their own conditions for the possibility of harboring life and civilizations. Frank shows how astronomy, earth history research, recent discoveries in our solar system, plus the new knowledge streaming in from exoplanet research, provides us with a new context for understanding how planets evolve, what conditions allow for life to arise, what conditions alter a planet’s habitability, and what the chances are for our own continued existence as a civilization. As much as I love Frank’s big picture context, as a Buddhist and retired integralist, it’s not big-picture enough for me (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...). One thing that bothered me about the book was a certain cavalier ethical attitude towards the destruction of biodiversity, extinction of species, and the immense suffering of the earth’s living beings due to human activities. Maybe earth doesn't care, but caring humans care. Yes, holding the view that “humans suck” is unproductive, and yes, we have to see that it doesn't matter to the earth whether human civilization survives or not, and yes, as biologist Lynn Margulis quipped, “earth is a tough bitch” and will recover, and yes, this is a science book and not one about the ethical dimensions of climate change but… but… it would have helped towards the end of the book if Frank had said more about how an ethical awakening, not just an awakening based on astrobiology and planetary evolution knowledge, would help us grow up from being a teenage fossil fuel civilization and into a fully-mature sustainable civilization. Alas, perhaps nothing will awake enough of us in time. If you care about the earth and its inhabitants, if you love big picture science and cosmic Carl-Sagan-grand-evolution stuff, you will love this book. Frank’s book has provided us with an important new planetary perspective on the global crisis facing humanity in this second decade of the 21st century. Let’s just hope it doesn’t become, like this review, one among millions of relics of our civilization to be discovered by some distant future alien archaeologist."
15,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,4,"One of my favorite scenes in the original Cosmos series, hosted by Carl Sagan, is when he scribbles out the famous Drake equation. This is a rather simple equation which wonderfully expresses the likelihood of there being other intelligent life in the universe. Through Sagan’s clear conversational style, and some practical math, we begin to make worthwhile hypotheses about the likelihood there is intelligent life beyond our solar system.Adam Frank’s book, Light of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth, builds on Drake’s equation as well as other foundational ideas regarding life in the cosmos. Like Sagan's style, Frank’s clear and conversational style becomes a big selling point for this book. It’s the second of his works I’ve read, the first being About Time: Cosmology and Culture at the Twilight of the Big Bang. I read this book on the strength of that one.Rather than pound away on one thesis using a single discipline, Frank pulls many things together: geology, astrobiology, evolution, climate change, and exoplanet studies. They all relate. Understanding how they relate will be crucial to our survival. Using what we’ve learned studying Mars and Venus, as well as what we are beginning to learn about planets orbiting other stars, perhaps its time to rethink the questions we are asking about life. How does it start? What conditions allow life to become technological? How might life and its home planet affect each other’s story? Lastly, can life ever truly be sustainable?Thanks to ongoing scientific research, these are questions which have begun moving out of the realm of hypothesis and into the realm of serious theory. Light of the Stars is not a book which reveals some grand new answer. Frank even goes out of his way to downplay the frequently unwise headline/click-bait writing in the media which exaggerates research findings. At its boldest, this book makes an assertion: hey, we have figured out the most useful questions to research going forward! In science, as ought to be the case in any area of life and knowledge, arriving at the right questions is a great thing.I enjoyed Light of the Stars for the way Frank arranged an ensemble of scientific fields into a cohesive project for all of humanity. I value this multi-disciplinary approach. As humanity grapples with the reality and potential effects of climate change, books like this give non-scientist readers a way to grasp the issues and make desperately needed sense of them."
16,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"If you're looking for a book that speculates on the particulars of what alien life might be like, this isn't your book. Frank takes a macro approach, looking at what we currently know about exoplanets and applying to them all the things we know about planetary formation and development using the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) as models. He covers the major thinkers in this area and topics like the Drake equation and the Kardashev scale and puts some modern spins on them to come up with probabilities of other civilizations and the likelihood that civilizations in general can last for long periods of time. You may not be surprised to hear that the odds aren't good. What I like about this book is Frank's ability to just push aside the question of human-powered climate change (it's settled, people) and focus on that fact that we've entered a period in which we are in charge. By luck of location in our system and the way our planet has developed, we're here. But now, by dint of our effect on our biosphere, we need to step up and make sure our home survives. He's optimistic that we can do this, but it's going to take planet-wide goal-setting and planning. And we need to get started yesterday. "
17,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724453-matt,5,"This book is a stunningly fascinating exploration of the possibilities of life on other planets, as well as the broader impact of species' co-evolution with the planet, namely the ways life dramatically affects the other systems of a planet. From discussing how micro-organisms oxygenated the Earth to predicting the weather patterns on Mars, the author is always rigorous and yet clear in his explanations. The conclusions of the book are as profound as they are unsettling: statistically, it is highly improbable that there *haven't* been many instances of other intelligent life on other planets, and the capacity of species to pass the point of no return in terms of climate change is pretty high, given the nature of self-reinforcing feedback loops.In short, we are just one small part of the story of life in the universe, and our choices will decisively impact how much of that story the human species gets to be around for."
18,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69884122-karynn-campbell,5,"Light of the Stars is a brilliant narration of our history as a planet and a civilization from an astrobiological perspective, with specific emphasis on planetary cycles of climate change and the role biology plays as an earth system. I listened to this one on audio and promptly pre-ordered the hardcover as it hasn't been released yet, and I would love to read the print version. Adam Frank did an excellent job of developing a cohesive story through time, sharing scientific theories as they were developed and built upon by a number of key scientists through the ages. I loved how accessible Frank made the science to non-science majors, while including the formulas and data to support his claims. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the human/biological role in planetary evolution during our common era!"
19,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10248355-steve,2,"I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, but I was left with a general sense of ""Why did he write this?"". There's a fair amount of speculation about alien worlds ( reasonable, yes, but speculation nonetheless) and the applicability of their situations to us, a whole lot of background that just doesn't seem particularly relevant, and not much in the way of a conclusion that would inspire anyone. Perhaps the author had to produce this as a justification for an extended sabbatical. Perhaps I entirely missed his point. Either way, I wouldn't recommend this book very highly."
20,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15728519-r-hul,4,"Astronomer and Physicist Adam Frank approaches the central problem of our time, the formulation of a societal response to anthropogenic climate change, in the context of astronomical evidence from other planets. Starting with our earliest observations of Venus and Mars, then the outer planets and later exoplanets, we have found evidence of changing ""climate"" in multiple planets. Earth itself has has experienced multiple climate swings over geological time. Frank argues convincingly that the sudden climate change we face risks not the earth, as is the popular conceit, but the particular state of earth in which we thrive. The earth is perfectly capable of thriving, even developing other sentient, intelligent life, if we pass from its stage. However, considering the work of Drake, Sagan, Kardashev and many other astrobiologists of the latter half of the 20th century, Frank points to the multiple bottlenecks any advanced civilization inevitably has to cross, and how climate change may be the latest one humanity faces, one that we are not guaranteed to clear. Kardashev's scale that ranks civilizations by the energy they can commandeer to their purposes rang as a particularly useful categorization of universal value. The organizing principle of human society today being intra-species competition makes any action on mitigating climate change a common good that has negative marginal utility to the individual actor. An extra-planetary perspective like Frank's here is important in reimagining the climate change conversation and recasting salutary actions as an exciting story in the larger narrative of civilization than mere belt-tightening. "
21,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"I kind of expected this book to mainly be about the potential of other life in the universe, which it certainly discusses, but I thought this book was the best explanation of Earth's climate change that I have read. Much of our knowledge of what may happen on Earth stemmed from our understanding of other planets, Venus for example. By studying and confirming what has happened on other planets, we can be very confident of what will happen to Earth, and Frank does a great job explaining this from an angle I was unfamiliar with. There is plenty more research explained around climate change that I have not heard that Frank discussed, and I thought it was very good.Much of the rest of the book is interesting, and it is all accessible and well written"
22,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2084139-bryce-holt,4,"It's probably a 3.5, but I'm giving Adam Frank the benefit of the doubt. After watching Frank on JRE, I saw a man who was passionate, knowledgeable and genuine about space, discovery and alien worlds. What could be better? While much of that enthusiasm translates into the written word, it feels in places that we retread much of what has been cherry-picked from other sources. We spend quite a bit of time dealing with the Drake equation, the Kardashev scale and other variations of alien civilization predicting regarding whether there is intelligent life out in the cosmos. He spends the majority time comparing the likelihood of intelligent life on other planets, past-present-future and whether they will make the leap through their own version of global warning to make it to a true Type 1 civilization. It's all very good, but it isn't great, and after hearing him talk, I truly expected great here.I don't want you to think it isn't worthy of a read. It is. If you are unfamiliar but interested in the question of life on other planets and how we have to look in the mirror to understand the likelihood of that, this is a great foundation. I highly suggest it to anyone who loves prognosticating on our own and other interstellar species' futures. Just accept that there are equally beneficial books out there on the subject."

26,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9498305-william-adams,3,"Frank, Adam (2018). Light of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth. New York: W.W. Norton, 262 pp. When you look into the star-spattered night sky (as you still can from the Arizona desert), it's hard to avoid wondering if aliens are out there looking back across the black void. At least, that's what I think about, but I write sci-fi, so maybe I'm not normal. This book, by a professor of astrophysics, asks, ""What are the chances of that?"" It seems unreasonable to me that humans are the only intelligent life in the universe, but it is possible. How can we know? To get at an answer, Frank uses the well-worn device of the Drake equation, a rough calculation by astronomer Frank Drake, made in the 1960s, of relevant probabilities. Author Frank talks us through the Drake formula, which is the compound probability of several factors estimated from scientific evidence. For starters, to guess whether extraterrestrial life is likely or not, you have to know how many stars and planets are out there. Do we know that? Drake estimated how many new stars are formed in our own galaxy each year and then estimated how many of those have planets around them. The assumption is that life would appear on planets, not in the stars themselves. It's a question that can be answered scientifically.Then, of the number of planets, how many are in the ""Goldilocks zone,"" not too hot and not too cold for life (as we know it). In other words, how many planets have liquid water and gaseous oxygen, assuming those are requirements for life. Mercury is too close to the sun (too hot), and Jupiter and the outer planets are too cold. Only Earth and Mars are habitable in our solar system, but Mars lacks sufficient oxygen to support life. Its thin atmosphere is nearly all carbon dioxide. Those are the first three of Drake's seven factors, just to give a sense of how the discussion goes. For each factor, the author presents a well-written history of what we know about it, and how we came to know it. The short biographies of the scientists involved are well-done and the scientific information is well presented for the average reader. He tries to put scientifically informed numbers on the terms of the Drake equation. Moving along, we ask of the Goldilocks planets, how many are likely to support life? All of them? No, that's not right, because as far as we can tell, Mars is lifeless. Mars might have had life long ago, before most of its atmosphere evaporated into space. The key to making a guess about this question is knowing what kind of chemistry is necessary to support life (as we know it). Unfortunately, ""life"" is not explicitly defined in this book. One infers from the discussion that ""life"" means ""has DNA, or RNA."" That means we require chemistry involving hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and phosphorous, at a minimum. I find that requirement extremely sketchy, but the last three Drake terms verge on the unknowable. Frank strives valiantly to evaluate them scientifically nevertheless. The fifth term is, how many habitable planets with any kind of life have intelligent life? That's tough to answer, given that no definition of intelligence is offered, a fatal flaw in all SETI books. Frank suggests that intelligent life is capable of building civilizations, but doesn't say what a civilization is. Ignoring complex insect societies and other rich animal cultures, he simply assumes that humans are the only intelligent life on Earth. Okay, then. Drake's Term Six asks, of the planets with intelligent life, how many would have a technologically advanced civilization. Frank writes, ""So, while the Romans were certainly a civilization, from Drake's point of view, they don't count as a technologically advanced one."" (p. 49.) Again, terms are not defined. ""Advanced"" seems to mean, ""uses radio telescopes."" The final Drake term puts an estimate on how long an advanced civilization could last on any planet. It's possible that advanced civilizations tend to self-destruct after only a few hundred or thousand years. If they do tend to flame out quickly, the chances of us finding one still going are greatly reduced. The Drake equation is not a bad infrastructure from which to begin examining the probability of life on other planets. You have to start somewhere. But scientists who take the Drake equation seriously need to collaborate with philosophers to avoid absurdity. It's one thing to count the number of stars in the sky (latest estimate: 5E20, where ""E"" stands for exponent, so a five with 20 zeroes after it). And it's fascinating to learn how extrasolar planets were discovered and what they're like and how many have been found, and where they are, and who discovered them and so on. That's all very interesting scientific reading. But beyond the bare-bones astrophysics, there is virtually nothing useful to SETI because of the ridiculous built-in assumptions of the discussion. For example, ""Life"" is implicitly defined as DNA? Really? Is that the best we can do? If the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is to look for entities that are the same as us, why not just look in a mirror and save a lot of money on unnecessary telescopes? Similarly, without solid definitions of terms like ""intelligence,"" ""civilization,"" and even ""technology,"" the discussion defaults to navel-gazing.The last term of the Drake equation is particularly difficult because it is ""ungrammatical."" It asks how long a technologically advance civilization (whatever that is) is likely to last. But the prior six terms are answers about how likely something is to exist, rather than not exist. Even ignoring the incompatibility of data types (years of lasting versus probability of existing), it makes no logical sense to multiply the last term by the previous six terms.But the Drake ""equation"" is just a tool for thinking, not a real mathematical equation, so perhaps we should ignore its solecisms. With that attitude, I can appreciate the author's concern that our own ""technologically advanced civilization"" seems headed for almost certain self-destruction, based on climate data. He barely discusses the probabilities of nuclear war or pandemics which are also looming, end-of-life scenarios for homo sapiens. But the climate data are compelling enough in themselves.Those prospects make you take a larger view of history. The dinosaurs ruled the planet (happily?) for 165 million years without us. Nobody voted for us, but here we are. If we snuff ourselves, as seems likely, maybe the cockroaches will dominate for the next hundred million years. Would that be so bad? Does it have to be us? Despite its logical flaws and philosophical naivety, Light of the Stars is a good scientific read that offers a lot of information, interesting recent history, and it makes you think deeply about our status in the universe.  "
27,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3748306-sean-meriwether,4,"For anyone somewhat versed in astrobiology or space exploration, this book might come across as a refresher. For anyone interested in exploring the subject Frank's clean and easy to digest prose will give a comprehensive introduction. The author explores the statistical possibility of other life (hopefully intelligent) in the universe by defining the parameters of The Drake Equation, and outlines the emergence of astrobiology and exoplanet discovery. While the statistics are on the side of life outside of our galaxy--we can't possibly be alone--the logistics of making that determination, or tapping into alien radio transmission from a minimum of 10,000 years ago, make it difficult to have a dialogue with extraterrestrial life. What Light of the Stars offers to the conversation is using space exploration, particularly of our neighbors, Venus and Mars, to understand the limitations of our own planet. Discovering the rules of physics and chemistry outside of the earth allow us to understand how those same dynamics work here (without any political interference). Additionally, for our civilization to develop the ability to explore space, we had to leverage the resources of our planet, putting our over-sized thumb on the scales of the delicate planetary balance, sending us into the Anthropocene epoch. Our challenge is to find a way to achieve these ends more sustainably before our civilization burns out... but the planet has seen worse. Recommend this for earth science deniers."
28,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41129900-ashley,4,"What a great book. Frank catches you with the title, and then does an amazing job of connecting things most people probably didn't even know had any connection. This book is largely about the science of climate change - how it evolved, what it means for us now - but it's written in a very accessible way. There is so much good information (some of it a little terrifying), but what comes out of it is an attempt to show that climate change is not a myth - it is science-based fact, with decades of recent evidence to back up the truth of human-driven climate change. It is a call for action in some ways, but mostly it's a way to educate and push us to face the reality of how we have changed the world. There is no moral judgment on this from Frank's part, only a hope that we will come to our senses soon enough to keep our project of civilization from collapsing in on itself.My favourite quote from the book comes from the early chapters: ""People often cast the climate crisis in terms of 'saving the planet.' But as the biologist Lynn Margulis once put it, the Earth 'is a tough bitch.' It's not the Earth that needs saving. Instead, it's us and our project of civilization that need a new direction. If we fail to make it across the difficult terrain we face, the planet will just move on without us, generating new species in the novel climate states it evolves. The 'we suck' narrative makes us villains in a story that, ultimately, has none. What that story does have are EXPERIMENTS - the ones that failed and the ones that succeeded."""
29,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7434712-sandeep-tammu,4,"Who doesn't like Alien Worlds? As a child, I remember being absolutely blown away by the movie 'War of the Worlds'. It was so cool to think that there could be some other life forms elsewhere in the universe. But, alien attacks are probably the last thing we might have to worry about. It is more likely that human-caused climate change could be the cause of our demise unless we stop acting like a bunch of immature teens and cooperate on a grand scale.'Light of the Stars' tries to bring out this epic narrative. New scientific data is showing us that there are so many planets that could potentially have life. There could be actual people, societies, love and even artificially intelligent robots. Even such a civilisation would have to overcome this bottleneck of energy generation without destroying their planet. Lucidly written, Adam did a great job at explaining the science. This new perspective of viewing climate change as not a singular problem but something that is happening in so many planets right now brings a new philosophical side. Science always does that for you. Recommended read!"
30,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,3,"This one started off very interesting and sort of petered out over the second half of the book. I think I mostly found the hard actual science in the beginning to the speculative and future possible science of the later portions of the book. The first portion of the book really found me thinking a lot of the Carl Sagan’s Contact, because it’s essentially dealing with the early approaches of searching for other life in the universe (Including the records Sagan was heavily involved with getting on the Voyager space probes.) Once the book started to delve into theory and odds of there being other intelligent live in the universe and the odds of contact etc, I lost interest rather quickly. It’s not that the book is poorly written or researched, it’s solid, it was just not all that interesting to me. I’m more for hard science here and while some of that was mixed in, such as the use of the Hubble Telescope to find other planets, it just wasn’t enough. "
31,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35537079-andy,1,"This book doesn't deliver what it promises at all. I was very disappointed. It promises to tell us ""what the latest thinking on alien civilizations reveals about our own"", but in reality it just gives four or five simple points, none of which are based on even recent research. For instance, one whole chapter is dedicated to pointing out that Mars and Venus have had various climates over their history. Another chapter tells us that Earth has too. Each of these chapters could have been boiled down to single sentences. The rest of it is filler: ""dramatic"" retellings of astronomers making observations, biographies of scientists, etc.If you were hoping for a volume that reported the latest research on exoplanets, this is not it. I honestly don't think there's anything here that someone who just casually reads about this topic whenever it makes the news wouldn't know already."
32,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,This is an excellent book using the latest information about exo-planets and what they can tell us about our own planet’s health. The book examines the history of life on earth and of space exploration of the planets in our solar system and also the history of our search for other planets around other stars and what that can tell us about our own world. It also explores the search for other life in the universe and the possible meaning for humans. The bottom line that this book brings home is that climate change is real and people have caused it because people are the major life form on our planet. It’s no longer a matter of saving the planet but of saving ourselves. A reasoned and informative read.
33,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22093539-audra-falk,4,"After reading this book, I have a much bigger view of the universe. WOW.I also now have what is probably a more accurate perspective of our own tiny place within time and space--and a greater appreciation of the privileges and responsibilities we as humans have on this planet and at this time.For someone who struggled with physics and chemistry classes in school, I was happy to find that I was able to understand the vast majority of this book. This is a credit to the author's ability to speak to the layperson. Overall a great book for anyone who is interested in an overview of astrobiology or astrophysics-- or who is just curious about the great universe that surrounds us. "
34,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4865450-david-davy,5,"I've long thought that biggest obstacle to solving or dealing with climate change is that it occurs outside boundaries of normal, everyday perception. Light of the Stars attempts to address this by expanding the field of observation to planets other than our own, real and imagined, given the data at hand. We and all other life here are a natural result of the myriad changes that have already taken place across the entirety of the existence of the planet, and the odds that we are the first planet to have this outcome, of civilization, is virtually nil. The long term survival of our civilization depends on a better understanding of how planets work and of our place on them. "

38,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12275862-sigurgeir,3,"I did want to give this book a higher rating since I did like it. It is full of good information, it's fun to read and quite frankly I really enjoyed it. The reason I can't give it a higher rating though is that I'm not quite sure who it's for. It seems to be for those who already accept the science of climate change and just want a little more information. But at the same time the author does say that the intention of the book is to change the narrative of climate change to something where we humans are not the villains of the story but rather the protagonists facing a challenge.I do like all this but I would say that in either case, but for one the information probably could be a lot more and a lot deeper. I mean, as someone who did pick up the book looking for information and I did get some of it. But I couldn't help but feel that there could have been a hell of a lot more. Quite honestly, with that in mind when picking up the book, I really would have liked it to be a hell of a lot thicker and more detailed. I got interested in it after hearing an interview with the author on the podcast Probably Science, an excellent podcast which I recommend to everyone, and it seemed that the hour and 20 minute interview pretty much covered the entire book. I was really hoping that the book itself would give me extra information but it really didn't feel like it. I suspect that the author wanted to appeal to as a wide variety of readers as possible, but I really could have done with more. I suppose I'll have to give other works reading.Along with that I felt that the author could have been more convincing as well. As I said, the book seems to be geared to those who already accept the science of climate change. That in on itself is perfectly fine. But the tone of the book comes off as if he also already expects us to simply accept what he wants to do, that is change the narrative around climate change. It feels like he's simply preaching to the choir. Now, personally I do think he is correct, another part of why I like this book, but when I am reading a work that does centre around making an argument. Whether it is for changing a narrative, making a philosophical argument or trying to make an argument for a stance, I really want the author to not only to state his facts but to make his case as if he wants to convince me. I do feel like I am being overly critical here, but I must say that if I didn't already accept the science of climate change and think that the author was correct after the very interesting and fun interview on Probably Science, I don't think I would have been convinced whatsoever. Even if I would already have accepted climate change but still be sceptical about the authors version of the narrative, I don't think that the author would have convinced me of it.Continuing that thought into thirdly, I really would have thought that the author would have wanted to convince as many as he could and reach the widest base. But since he seems to focus on those who already accept climate change and since, in my opinion, his arguments kinda feel like he already expects you to agree with him, I really don't feel like he's reaching as wide a base as he could.Now I'm not saying that he needed to do all three of these. But I would have liked to see at least something of this done better. I would have given this book full five stars if it either had been thicker and more informative, a bit more convincing, again I'm saying that as someone who already thinks the author is correct, or if he had not quite sounded as if he was simply preaching to the little choir that already. That said, I still highly enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about climate change and some of the history around it. "
39,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465139-leftjab,4,"This would actually be a 3.5. I’m really interested in astrobiology and Frank’s writing here makes me feel like I’ve grasped it. I was reading this as a follow up to Asimov’s Extraterrestrial Civilizations. Not quite sure if this really was what I was wanting – felt that some of the science involved was glossed over for Frank to illustrate why his approach to extraterrestrial life he would consider optimistic while many of the nay-sayers would be pessimistic. I gotta be honest, I don’t see what the big deal about the Drake Equation is. It just sounds like math that has no hope of being proved until there’s contact with some other advanced civilization and while Frank yes is optimistic that there must be other life of some sort in the universe because of the sheer number of stars and the possibility of planets around them – I’m not disputing that at all. It’s just that the conclusion of the equation is arbitrary. Beyond knowing that there are literally billions of planets the math would lead one to think that yes, there is a strong possibility for life on one of the planets. Any speculation about what that alien life could be like – to remove it from science fiction and place it closer to reality (to put it one way) – can only be postulated based on our extremely limited explorations of our solar system. So yeah, we have a good grasp on Mars and Venus, but beyond that, even exploring moons and planets within our solar system is so difficult and dangerous that getting into exoplanets is really vague at best.I’m not going to take away from Frank’s presentation of the information out there – I read the book quickly and actually made some notes of some of his sources to explore these concepts deeper in the future. And of course, the book possesses more sad resignation about the state of Earth and climate change. I liked Frank’s approach that a global civilization is going to affect the planet by nature of its being. I think that is a good approach to take – of course, I can’t stomach climate deniers and I don’t think they would even open a book like Light of the Stars to convince them that their “gut instincts” are incorrect.Why I bump the 3.5 to 4 though, is personal – as Frank speaks my language in the concluding chapter of the book, and summed up my shared belief about not that climate change is occurring, but how we as participating members of the global community should start to see ourselves and how that self-awareness (based in the scientific process but then could be utilized philosophically and ideologically – not to mention how there could be a religious aspect to self-analysis – I don’t see how religion and science cannot co-exist and getting past this political bullshit would be extremely helpful in trying to survive the next decade) should be utilized in terms of how people can attempt to tackle climate change – i.e. as a world instead of as individual nations:“Gaining the astrobiological perspective is the first, essential step in our maturation and our ability to face the Anthropocene. It means recognizing that we and our project of civilization are nothing more than the fruit of Earth’s ongoing evolutionary experiments. Any civilization on any planet will be nothing more than an expression of its home world’s creativity. We are no different from those we would call ‘alien.’”Well said. Nigel Kneale would agree."
40,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901146-arvind,4,"I picked up Light of the Stars after watching Frank animatedly discuss possibilities of alien life and world girdling civilizations with Joe Rogan. What caught my attention then, and part of what I think makes his book worth reading, is Frank‘s almost contrarian framing of global warming. For sure it’s happening, but the popular narrative about saving the planet and the polar bears isn’t compatible with life’s long history on Earth. Frank asserts that we, humanity, are the ones that need saving. Earth and life have co-evolved for billions of years and will for many more, with or without us.Light of the Stars takes an exogenous view of the way Earth, life (read humanity), and the climate interact. While describing how Earth’s climate and life have co-evolved over eons, Frank tells the story of how observations of Mars and Venus, for instance, have lead to greater understanding of climate processes here on Earth, and even influenced international politics. Later he takes the ultimate frequentist approach, based recent exoplanet discoveries, and poses Earth and our civilization as one of many in the galaxy and universe. He even uses the word 'experiment' to describe us and these other conjectured civilizations. Borrowing probably from Kardashev and others he assumes, modulo specific histories, anatomy, etc., all civilizations go through an Anthropocene type phase. Over the whole distribution of planets with civilizations, some master the transition and their planets, and some die off. It’s a powerful idea; and he, and coworkers, even made crude models of ""parametrized"" civilizations, seeded them with varying initial conditions, and analyzed the survival outcomes of the civilizations. The whole approach is pretty cool.Woven throughout is a story about the search and speculation about extraterrestrial life, and it’s interesting on its own. Frank really pays homage to Sagan, Tarter, Kardashev, and many other scientists that thought seriously about extraterritorial life. Before reading the book I had the same opinion of the Drake equation as Colonel Janus from the Expanse: „That’s not a equation. It’s a big fat guess.“. But the Drake equation really helped guide the search for extraterrestrial life. Along the same lines, Frank proposes his own equation, updated based on recent exoplanet discoveries.Overall, Light of the Stars is an interesting, light, nontechnical read, with a unique framing of climate change and our place in the universe."
41,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7649288-matt-ward,2,"One of the greatest things about popular science as a genre is how it can take topics that are somewhat dry and boring and bring life to it. We get to feel what's so cool about the topic that excited the scientists to work on it (The Elegant Universe, The Shape of Inner Space, The Selfish Gene, and Fermat's Last Theorem come to mind). Adam Frank is clearly fascinated by this stuff, but he doesn't spend enough time motivating it to get an uninterested person interested. The second chapter is basically a dry list of what makes up the environment on various planets and a recounting of probes that went there and a tedious history of the discoveries. It's only at the end of the chapter that it becomes clear why any of this is being discussed (namely, that climate models have been tested outside of Earth). That motivation needs to come at the beginning.It's not clear what niche this book is trying to serve. Most people with enough interest to pick this book up will already be familiar with the Drake equation and Fermi paradox. He doesn't even discuss the most interesting aspect of it (namely, the reason its a paradox).The end of the book gets better, but so many other books have covered similar ground in more detail and more interesting ways (see Jared Diamond's Collapse). So, I again wonder what niche the book is attempting to fill. Sorry to be such a downer. I heard a pretty interesting interview with him that turned me on to the book. I'd love to sit down and pick his brain over lunch. I'm not that interested in reading another of his books."
42,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43813529-celia-reaves,3,"Frank is a scientist with solid credentials and a strong reputation. In this book he tries something that’s probably impossible to pull off, so it’s not surprising I found it underwhelming. He is trying to use what we know about how stars, planets, biospheres, and civilizations evolve to draw conclusions about two separate things: whether there are or ever have been alien civilizations on other planets, and whether our civilization will survive the climate crisis we are now facing. He has good science about how stars develop. He pulls together information from geology and the study of planets in our solar system to support a strong argument about the development of planets. When he starts to draw conclusions about the evolution of large and complex biological organisms, and then about intelligence and technological civilizations, though, he loses me. I don’t see any way to extrapolate meaningfully from a sample of one. He does the math to show that in order for us to be the only technological civilization ever in our galaxy, the probability for such an event would have to be ridiculously small (one in ten billion trillion). Therefore, he concludes, we are not the first such civilization. I’m unconvinced by this argument. Just because a probability is vanishingly small doesn’t mean it actually vanishes. There is a lot of interesting information here, about stars and planets and the search for planets around distant stars. For me, though, he goes a step too far in the conclusions he draws. The evidence we need to get there is just not available yet."
43,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3512830-elmwoodblues,3,"Adam Frank himself makes clear that the subtitle of his book, 'Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth', could read '...and the Fate of Humanity.' Our earth is a pretty big place, and it didn't always look like it does now, what with the lava and the no oxygen and all. So, like Venus or Mars or (Carl Sagan voice here:) billions and billions of other worlds, when the water all floats away or the greenhouse effects take hold, whatever big round rock this happens to will be mostly okay. It is just the, you know, living stuff, that will have the bad day.It is a little frustrating to know that we all agree on how a greenhouse works out in a field, trapping solar radiation in the form of heat; Harbor Freight sells small ones for $300, near the $6 car-window shades. We all know that no use of energy is 100% efficient, so waste is produced with ANY work done; there are no free lunches in the universe. (Wind power? ""...extracting energy from wind power on a scale massive enough to power our current civilization would leave a global imprint akin to mild global warning."" Page 191. Sorry)So, why 'denial'? Because 'causes' is the big bugaboo, and we need to blame something? It's not the 'how' of using energy, it's the amount, the scale of it, the inevitability of it. It's thermodynamics, and thermodynamics are a bitch. Ask Venus."

The author does a good job of bringing together numerous different interrelated theories in terms of planetary feedback loops, systems and climate to make probabilistic claims on the likely number of planets that exist in the universe that are within the habitable zone and thus able to sustain life. The probabilities continue to look at just how many of those planets are likely to see the development of intelligent life and civilisation building life, like our own of earth. Unsurprisingly, the odds diminish at each stage, but even with the most pessimistic of predictions from the biggest doubters in the scientific community, we are still talking about a healthy number of planets that have or may host civilisation building life throughout all space and time.It’s a fascinating book well worth a read for anyone who loves science."

The focus of this book is on Fermi's Paradox, which states that with the near infinite number of opportunities in the universe for intelligent life to form, why is there no concrete evidence of any intelligent life other than ourselves? Are we really alone in the universe?It turns out that with the recent discoveries of numerous exoplanets, there can now be little doubt that life, and even intelligent life has sprung up elsewhere, outside of our solar system. What is still much in doubt, however, is how long those civilizations have lasted. There is currently great concern that our own technological civilization may be very short-lived. Is rapid development followed by rapid decline the norm for technological, energy-intensive civilizations like ours?There were some very good insights that this book brought up, but in the end I was still left with skepticism that, because of the great distances involved and the short-sighted direction our civilization seems to be taking, our species will never learn much about the true answers to these questions."
46,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,5,"This book is about our growing knowledge of exoplanets, and what the emerging science of astrobiology can teach us about the fate of our own planet. Yup, it’s a pretty heavy subject, but the science is not difficult, and is facilely explained by Adam Frank. He uses as his central principle the famous Drake Equation, which estimates the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence. With at least 1200 confirmed exoplanets, and thousands more sure to lurk in data captured by the Kepler space telescope but not yet analyzed, we have quite a bit of data to start filling in the variables in the Equation. Further, Frank looks back at two planets we know very well (Venus and Mars) to explain why they DON’T currently host life. The famed astronomer Carl Sagan appears in several threads of this story, both as an early enthusiast in SETI and as a member of the team which created the term “nuclear winter” (evidence for which comes from the history of Mars). The point of the book is basically to help us understand climate change on Earth, but the science it uses to get there is broad and endlessly fascinating. If you are in any way interested in any planetary science, this is a must-read.Grade: A"
47,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Over the years, many works of fiction have discussed the possibility of other worlds. In the 1950s, a group of prominent scientists sat down to lunch, and Enrico Fermi asked an important question; ""Where is everyone?""Here is a little backstory; we had known for some time that other stars might also harbor planets capable of supporting life. If we only look at the Milky Way Galaxy, we are looking at a cosmic neighborhood of approximately four hundred billion stars. So finally, a scientist sat down and wrote out a simple equation. It isn't necessarily a law of nature like Einstein's Equations. That scientist was named Frank Drake, and Drake's Equation became famous.Drake's Equation is easy to understand. It has seven parts. First, you figure out the birthrate of stars. Second, you multiply the number by the fraction of stars with planets. Third, you figure out which planets are in a habitable zone. Fourth, you figure out which planets develop life. Fifth, you figure out whether or not it has intelligence. Sixth, you figure out if they have the technology required to receive and send radio signals. Finally, you have to figure out the average lifetime of a technologically advanced civilization.The book is fascinating. I enjoyed it a lot."
48,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"The subtitle, preface, and marketing materials seem to indicate that this is about what astrobiology will reveal about climate change. Except that turns out to be almost backwards; there are indeed chapters setting up planetary science and the Drake equation about the likelihood of detectable life elsewhere in the galaxy, but then abruptly turns to computational models of ecology with very limited extraterrestrial input (except maybe a slight assist from Venus and Mars) to compute how likely civilization is to destroy itself. The doesn't seem to really know how Idea A is supposed to relate to Idea B, only that it thinks both ideas are interesting.It was mostly absorbing enough, although Frank's presentations were sometimes baffling -- his example ecological model was about ""bunnies,"" and although I'm pretty sure a professor of astronomy at the University of Rochester understands statistics, he handled them so cavalierly that a lot of his inferences seemed flat-out wrong as stated. But don't go in thinking that there's going to be a clear central thesis."

Though there was some great information on scientists and research I wasn't familiar with, this ended up being a very long persuasive piece about global warming/climate change. Now I completely believe humans are causing a potentially devastating change to our planet through the reckless use of fossil fuels, refusing to invest in renewable energy sources, and the clear-cutting of vast areas of the globe. I was clearly not the audience for this book. And I felt like I had been hoodwinked into reading this because I thought this would be a book about something else.Mainly aliens. I thought it'd be about aliens. And like 20 pages were. Sorta. :/ It's a well-written book and I recommend it to people who want to read about climate change. But if you came to it for aliens, you'll be disappointed. "

Light of the Stars is a popular account of the current understanding of the evolution of planets, ours and others throughout the universe. Frank addresses climate change by saying that science tells us we are changing our climate, but we should not feel guilty about it. Developing civilizations are part of the planet and do impact the development of the planet. We will not destroy the planet. It is not a question of whether or not the earth will survive, but rather whether or not humans will survive. If you are looking for details of the physics behind Frank's arguments, you will be disappointed. There is only one equation in the book and it is well explained. If you are not up to date on current scientific understanding of our planet and its possible future, Frank provides an easily read book to fill that gap."

It seems to me that while there are a lot of important questions to ask about the long-term future of humans on this planet, and maybe more generally technological civilizations on any planet, a better integration of ecological and evolutionary concepts is currently a missing ingredient. I would guess that this bias stems from the fields that astrobiology emerged from, and the generally short timescales ecologists tend to limit themselves to. This book would certainly support the idea that we need to think on big scales - as well as smaller scales - to better understand the magnitude and nature of our changing world in the context of the larger universe."

That's not to say its not good, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting, and that made it really drag for me. I had originally thought this book was solely focused on the possibilities of aliens, and inhabited planets. That is certainly part of the story, but in reality, this book is about what other planets can teach us about our own experiences on Earth, primarily climate change and how to respond to it, or the risks it might present. Whilst a valuable endeavour, coming off the back of 'The Glad Shout', and given what I thought the content was to be, I really not enthused for the topic. Nonetheless, Frank's book is a compelling argument for human created climate change, and how planetary science can teach us how we need to respond to ensure we're still here in a thousand years. So, if you've got a friend who doesn't believe in climate change, might be a worthwhile read for them."

The author calculates the number of planets the are similar to Earth and concludes that it's overwhelmingly likely there's life out there. But, of course, this is a bad argument: a large number of Earth-like planets (without any information about the probabilities of life arising within those conditions) is not enough to know how likely life is... (If you don't know how many sides a die has, you can't conclude from (even a very large) number of tosses that it's likely to land on ""1""). I enjoyed the author's emphasis on the geological scale of Earth's history and future. Humans are such brief players on the world's stage and may be too stupid to keep from killing ourselves.

The introduction of the books says that, Astrobiology is the main content of the book. Still, we don't get any possible explanation of what could be biology on a distant planet with regards to their atmosphere.

This dual theme is runs rampant throughout this book. Good writing supporting dubious science doesn't make for a good book - neither does mixing contempt for Republicans - of which I happen to be.Sadly, ZERO STARS to what should have been a good book ruined by Professor Frank's devotion to his totally unscientific dual cults.Not Recommended.

Along those lines, this is a fantastic book for people who have a base understanding or are being introduced to topics such as Fermi's paradox, Carl Sagan's work, and the SETI program. For those reader who are already well versed, this book may seem something of a review. Frank's research into the how exo-civilizations survive their experience with climate change is fascinating. "

I think I mostly found the hard actual science in the beginning to the speculative and future possible science of the later portions of the book. The first portion of the book really found me thinking a lot of the Carl Sagan’s Contact, because it’s essentially dealing with the early approaches of searching for other life in the universe (Including the records Sagan was heavily involved with getting on the Voyager space probes.) Once the book started to delve into theory and odds of there being other intelligent live in the universe and the odds of contact etc, I lost interest rather quickly. It’s not that the book is poorly written or researched, it’s solid, it was just not all that interesting to me. I’m more for hard science here and while some of that was mixed in, such as the use of the Hubble Telescope to find other planets, it just wasn’t enough. "

For instance, one whole chapter is dedicated to pointing out that Mars and Venus have had various climates over their history. Another chapter tells us that Earth has too. Each of these chapters could have been boiled down to single sentences. The rest of it is filler: ""dramatic"" retellings of astronomers making observations, biographies of scientists, etc.If you were hoping for a volume that reported the latest research on exoplanets, this is not it.

It also explores the search for other life in the universe and the possible meaning for humans. The bottom line that this book brings home is that climate change is real and people have caused it because people are the major life form on our planet. It’s no longer a matter of saving the planet but of saving ourselves. A reasoned and informative read.

Light of the Stars attempts to address this by expanding the field of observation to planets other than our own, real and imagined, given the data at hand. We and all other life here are a natural result of the myriad changes that have already taken place across the entirety of the existence of the planet, and the odds that we are the first planet to have this outcome, of civilization, is virtually nil.

It is full of good information, it's fun to read and quite frankly I really enjoyed it. The reason I can't give it a higher rating though is that I'm not quite sure who it's for. It seems to be for those who already accept the science of climate change and just want a little more information. But at the same time the author does say that the intention of the book is to change the narrative of climate change to something where we humans are not the villains of the story but rather the protagonists facing a challenge.I do like all this but I would say that in either case, but for one the information probably could be a lot more and a lot deeper. I mean, as someone who did pick up the book looking for information and I did get some of it. But I couldn't help but feel that there could have been a hell of a lot more. Quite honestly, with that in mind when picking up the book, I really would have liked it to be a hell of a lot thicker and more detailed. I got interested in it after hearing an interview with the author on the podcast Probably Science, an excellent podcast which I recommend to everyone, and it seemed that the hour and 20 minute interview pretty much covered the entire book. I was really hoping that the book itself would give me extra information but it really didn't feel like it. I suspect that the author wanted to appeal to as a wide variety of readers as possible, but I really could have done with more. I suppose I'll have to give other works reading.Along with that I felt that the author could have been more convincing as well. As I said, the book seems to be geared to those who already accept the science of climate change. That in on itself is perfectly fine. But the tone of the book comes off as if he also already expects us to simply accept what he wants to do, that is change the narrative around climate change. It feels like he's simply preaching to the choir. Now, personally I do think he is correct, another part of why I like this book, but when I am reading a work that does centre around making an argument. Whether it is for changing a narrative, making a philosophical argument or trying to make an argument for a stance, I really want the author to not only to state his facts but to make his case as if he wants to convince me. I do feel like I am being overly critical here, but I must say that if I didn't already accept the science of climate change and think that the author was correct after the very interesting and fun interview on Probably Science, I don't think I would have been convinced whatsoever. Even if I would already have accepted climate change but still be sceptical about the authors version of the narrative, I don't think that the author would have convinced me of it.Continuing that thought into thirdly, I really would have thought that the author would have wanted to convince as many as he could and reach the widest base. But since he seems to focus on those who already accept climate change and since, in my opinion, his arguments kinda feel like he already expects you to agree with him, I really don't feel like he's reaching as wide a base as he could.Now I'm not saying that he needed to do all three of these. But I would have liked to see at least something of this done better. I would have given this book full five stars if it either had been thicker and more informative, a bit more convincing, again I'm saying that as someone who already thinks the author is correct, or if he had not quite sounded as if he was simply preaching to the little choir that already. That said, I still highly enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about climate change and some of the history around it. "
69,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465139-leftjab,4,"This would actually be a 3.5. I’m really interested in astrobiology and Frank’s writing here makes me feel like I’ve grasped it. I was reading this as a follow up to Asimov’s Extraterrestrial Civilizations. Not quite sure if this really was what I was wanting – felt that some of the science involved was glossed over for Frank to illustrate why his approach to extraterrestrial life he would consider optimistic while many of the nay-sayers would be pessimistic. I gotta be honest, I don’t see what the big deal about the Drake Equation is. It just sounds like math that has no hope of being proved until there’s contact with some other advanced civilization and while Frank yes is optimistic that there must be other life of some sort in the universe because of the sheer number of stars and the possibility of planets around them – I’m not disputing that at all. It’s just that the conclusion of the equation is arbitrary. Beyond knowing that there are literally billions of planets the math would lead one to think that yes, there is a strong possibility for life on one of the planets. Any speculation about what that alien life could be like – to remove it from science fiction and place it closer to reality (to put it one way) – can only be postulated based on our extremely limited explorations of our solar system. So yeah, we have a good grasp on Mars and Venus, but beyond that, even exploring moons and planets within our solar system is so difficult and dangerous that getting into exoplanets is really vague at best.I’m not going to take away from Frank’s presentation of the information out there – I read the book quickly and actually made some notes of some of his sources to explore these concepts deeper in the future. And of course, the book possesses more sad resignation about the state of Earth and climate change. I liked Frank’s approach that a global civilization is going to affect the planet by nature of its being. I think that is a good approach to take – of course, I can’t stomach climate deniers and I don’t think they would even open a book like Light of the Stars to convince them that their “gut instincts” are incorrect.Why I bump the 3.5 to 4 though, is personal – as Frank speaks my language in the concluding chapter of the book, and summed up my shared belief about not that climate change is occurring, but how we as participating members of the global community should start to see ourselves and how that self-awareness (based in the scientific process but then could be utilized philosophically and ideologically – not to mention how there could be a religious aspect to self-analysis – I don’t see how religion and science cannot co-exist and getting past this political bullshit would be extremely helpful in trying to survive the next decade) should be utilized in terms of how people can attempt to tackle climate change – i.e. as a world instead of as individual nations:“Gaining the astrobiological perspective is the first, essential step in our maturation and our ability to face the Anthropocene. It means recognizing that we and our project of civilization are nothing more than the fruit of Earth’s ongoing evolutionary experiments. Any civilization on any planet will be nothing more than an expression of its home world’s creativity. We are no different from those we would call ‘alien.’”Well said. Nigel Kneale would agree."
70,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901146-arvind,4,"I picked up Light of the Stars after watching Frank animatedly discuss possibilities of alien life and world girdling civilizations with Joe Rogan. What caught my attention then, and part of what I think makes his book worth reading, is Frank‘s almost contrarian framing of global warming. For sure it’s happening, but the popular narrative about saving the planet and the polar bears isn’t compatible with life’s long history on Earth. Frank asserts that we, humanity, are the ones that need saving. Earth and life have co-evolved for billions of years and will for many more, with or without us.Light of the Stars takes an exogenous view of the way Earth, life (read humanity), and the climate interact. While describing how Earth’s climate and life have co-evolved over eons, Frank tells the story of how observations of Mars and Venus, for instance, have lead to greater understanding of climate processes here on Earth, and even influenced international politics. Later he takes the ultimate frequentist approach, based recent exoplanet discoveries, and poses Earth and our civilization as one of many in the galaxy and universe. He even uses the word 'experiment' to describe us and these other conjectured civilizations. Borrowing probably from Kardashev and others he assumes, modulo specific histories, anatomy, etc., all civilizations go through an Anthropocene type phase. Over the whole distribution of planets with civilizations, some master the transition and their planets, and some die off. It’s a powerful idea; and he, and coworkers, even made crude models of ""parametrized"" civilizations, seeded them with varying initial conditions, and analyzed the survival outcomes of the civilizations. The whole approach is pretty cool.Woven throughout is a story about the search and speculation about extraterrestrial life, and it’s interesting on its own. Frank really pays homage to Sagan, Tarter, Kardashev, and many other scientists that thought seriously about extraterritorial life. Before reading the book I had the same opinion of the Drake equation as Colonel Janus from the Expanse: „That’s not a equation. It’s a big fat guess.“. But the Drake equation really helped guide the search for extraterrestrial life. Along the same lines, Frank proposes his own equation, updated based on recent exoplanet discoveries.Overall, Light of the Stars is an interesting, light, nontechnical read, with a unique framing of climate change and our place in the universe."
71,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7649288-matt-ward,2,"One of the greatest things about popular science as a genre is how it can take topics that are somewhat dry and boring and bring life to it. We get to feel what's so cool about the topic that excited the scientists to work on it (The Elegant Universe, The Shape of Inner Space, The Selfish Gene, and Fermat's Last Theorem come to mind). Adam Frank is clearly fascinated by this stuff, but he doesn't spend enough time motivating it to get an uninterested person interested. The second chapter is basically a dry list of what makes up the environment on various planets and a recounting of probes that went there and a tedious history of the discoveries. It's only at the end of the chapter that it becomes clear why any of this is being discussed (namely, that climate models have been tested outside of Earth). That motivation needs to come at the beginning.It's not clear what niche this book is trying to serve. Most people with enough interest to pick this book up will already be familiar with the Drake equation and Fermi paradox. He doesn't even discuss the most interesting aspect of it (namely, the reason its a paradox).The end of the book gets better, but so many other books have covered similar ground in more detail and more interesting ways (see Jared Diamond's Collapse). So, I again wonder what niche the book is attempting to fill. Sorry to be such a downer. I heard a pretty interesting interview with him that turned me on to the book. I'd love to sit down and pick his brain over lunch. I'm not that interested in reading another of his books."
72,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43813529-celia-reaves,3,"Frank is a scientist with solid credentials and a strong reputation. In this book he tries something that’s probably impossible to pull off, so it’s not surprising I found it underwhelming. He is trying to use what we know about how stars, planets, biospheres, and civilizations evolve to draw conclusions about two separate things: whether there are or ever have been alien civilizations on other planets, and whether our civilization will survive the climate crisis we are now facing. He has good science about how stars develop. He pulls together information from geology and the study of planets in our solar system to support a strong argument about the development of planets. When he starts to draw conclusions about the evolution of large and complex biological organisms, and then about intelligence and technological civilizations, though, he loses me. I don’t see any way to extrapolate meaningfully from a sample of one. He does the math to show that in order for us to be the only technological civilization ever in our galaxy, the probability for such an event would have to be ridiculously small (one in ten billion trillion). Therefore, he concludes, we are not the first such civilization. I’m unconvinced by this argument. Just because a probability is vanishingly small doesn’t mean it actually vanishes. There is a lot of interesting information here, about stars and planets and the search for planets around distant stars. For me, though, he goes a step too far in the conclusions he draws. The evidence we need to get there is just not available yet."
73,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3512830-elmwoodblues,3,"Adam Frank himself makes clear that the subtitle of his book, 'Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth', could read '...and the Fate of Humanity.' Our earth is a pretty big place, and it didn't always look like it does now, what with the lava and the no oxygen and all. So, like Venus or Mars or (Carl Sagan voice here:) billions and billions of other worlds, when the water all floats away or the greenhouse effects take hold, whatever big round rock this happens to will be mostly okay. It is just the, you know, living stuff, that will have the bad day.It is a little frustrating to know that we all agree on how a greenhouse works out in a field, trapping solar radiation in the form of heat; Harbor Freight sells small ones for $300, near the $6 car-window shades. We all know that no use of energy is 100% efficient, so waste is produced with ANY work done; there are no free lunches in the universe. (Wind power? ""...extracting energy from wind power on a scale massive enough to power our current civilization would leave a global imprint akin to mild global warning."" Page 191. Sorry)So, why 'denial'? Because 'causes' is the big bugaboo, and we need to blame something? It's not the 'how' of using energy, it's the amount, the scale of it, the inevitability of it. It's thermodynamics, and thermodynamics are a bitch. Ask Venus."

The author does a good job of bringing together numerous different interrelated theories in terms of planetary feedback loops, systems and climate to make probabilistic claims on the likely number of planets that exist in the universe that are within the habitable zone and thus able to sustain life. The probabilities continue to look at just how many of those planets are likely to see the development of intelligent life and civilisation building life, like our own of earth. Unsurprisingly, the odds diminish at each stage, but even with the most pessimistic of predictions from the biggest doubters in the scientific community, we are still talking about a healthy number of planets that have or may host civilisation building life throughout all space and time.It’s a fascinating book well worth a read for anyone who loves science."

The focus of this book is on Fermi's Paradox, which states that with the near infinite number of opportunities in the universe for intelligent life to form, why is there no concrete evidence of any intelligent life other than ourselves? Are we really alone in the universe?It turns out that with the recent discoveries of numerous exoplanets, there can now be little doubt that life, and even intelligent life has sprung up elsewhere, outside of our solar system. What is still much in doubt, however, is how long those civilizations have lasted. There is currently great concern that our own technological civilization may be very short-lived. Is rapid development followed by rapid decline the norm for technological, energy-intensive civilizations like ours?There were some very good insights that this book brought up, but in the end I was still left with skepticism that, because of the great distances involved and the short-sighted direction our civilization seems to be taking, our species will never learn much about the true answers to these questions."
76,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,5,"This book is about our growing knowledge of exoplanets, and what the emerging science of astrobiology can teach us about the fate of our own planet. Yup, it’s a pretty heavy subject, but the science is not difficult, and is facilely explained by Adam Frank. He uses as his central principle the famous Drake Equation, which estimates the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence. With at least 1200 confirmed exoplanets, and thousands more sure to lurk in data captured by the Kepler space telescope but not yet analyzed, we have quite a bit of data to start filling in the variables in the Equation. Further, Frank looks back at two planets we know very well (Venus and Mars) to explain why they DON’T currently host life. The famed astronomer Carl Sagan appears in several threads of this story, both as an early enthusiast in SETI and as a member of the team which created the term “nuclear winter” (evidence for which comes from the history of Mars). The point of the book is basically to help us understand climate change on Earth, but the science it uses to get there is broad and endlessly fascinating. If you are in any way interested in any planetary science, this is a must-read.Grade: A"
77,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Over the years, many works of fiction have discussed the possibility of other worlds. In the 1950s, a group of prominent scientists sat down to lunch, and Enrico Fermi asked an important question; ""Where is everyone?""Here is a little backstory; we had known for some time that other stars might also harbor planets capable of supporting life. If we only look at the Milky Way Galaxy, we are looking at a cosmic neighborhood of approximately four hundred billion stars. So finally, a scientist sat down and wrote out a simple equation. It isn't necessarily a law of nature like Einstein's Equations. That scientist was named Frank Drake, and Drake's Equation became famous.Drake's Equation is easy to understand. It has seven parts. First, you figure out the birthrate of stars. Second, you multiply the number by the fraction of stars with planets. Third, you figure out which planets are in a habitable zone. Fourth, you figure out which planets develop life. Fifth, you figure out whether or not it has intelligence. Sixth, you figure out if they have the technology required to receive and send radio signals. Finally, you have to figure out the average lifetime of a technologically advanced civilization.The book is fascinating. I enjoyed it a lot."
78,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"The subtitle, preface, and marketing materials seem to indicate that this is about what astrobiology will reveal about climate change. Except that turns out to be almost backwards; there are indeed chapters setting up planetary science and the Drake equation about the likelihood of detectable life elsewhere in the galaxy, but then abruptly turns to computational models of ecology with very limited extraterrestrial input (except maybe a slight assist from Venus and Mars) to compute how likely civilization is to destroy itself. The doesn't seem to really know how Idea A is supposed to relate to Idea B, only that it thinks both ideas are interesting.It was mostly absorbing enough, although Frank's presentations were sometimes baffling -- his example ecological model was about ""bunnies,"" and although I'm pretty sure a professor of astronomy at the University of Rochester understands statistics, he handled them so cavalierly that a lot of his inferences seemed flat-out wrong as stated. But don't go in thinking that there's going to be a clear central thesis."

Though there was some great information on scientists and research I wasn't familiar with, this ended up being a very long persuasive piece about global warming/climate change. Now I completely believe humans are causing a potentially devastating change to our planet through the reckless use of fossil fuels, refusing to invest in renewable energy sources, and the clear-cutting of vast areas of the globe. I was clearly not the audience for this book. And I felt like I had been hoodwinked into reading this because I thought this would be a book about something else.Mainly aliens. I thought it'd be about aliens. And like 20 pages were. Sorta. :/ It's a well-written book and I recommend it to people who want to read about climate change. But if you came to it for aliens, you'll be disappointed. "

Light of the Stars is a popular account of the current understanding of the evolution of planets, ours and others throughout the universe. Frank addresses climate change by saying that science tells us we are changing our climate, but we should not feel guilty about it. Developing civilizations are part of the planet and do impact the development of the planet. We will not destroy the planet. It is not a question of whether or not the earth will survive, but rather whether or not humans will survive. If you are looking for details of the physics behind Frank's arguments, you will be disappointed. There is only one equation in the book and it is well explained. If you are not up to date on current scientific understanding of our planet and its possible future, Frank provides an easily read book to fill that gap."

It seems to me that while there are a lot of important questions to ask about the long-term future of humans on this planet, and maybe more generally technological civilizations on any planet, a better integration of ecological and evolutionary concepts is currently a missing ingredient. I would guess that this bias stems from the fields that astrobiology emerged from, and the generally short timescales ecologists tend to limit themselves to. This book would certainly support the idea that we need to think on big scales - as well as smaller scales - to better understand the magnitude and nature of our changing world in the context of the larger universe."

That's not to say its not good, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting, and that made it really drag for me. I had originally thought this book was solely focused on the possibilities of aliens, and inhabited planets. That is certainly part of the story, but in reality, this book is about what other planets can teach us about our own experiences on Earth, primarily climate change and how to respond to it, or the risks it might present. Whilst a valuable endeavour, coming off the back of 'The Glad Shout', and given what I thought the content was to be, I really not enthused for the topic. Nonetheless, Frank's book is a compelling argument for human created climate change, and how planetary science can teach us how we need to respond to ensure we're still here in a thousand years. So, if you've got a friend who doesn't believe in climate change, might be a worthwhile read for them."

The author calculates the number of planets the are similar to Earth and concludes that it's overwhelmingly likely there's life out there. But, of course, this is a bad argument: a large number of Earth-like planets (without any information about the probabilities of life arising within those conditions) is not enough to know how likely life is... (If you don't know how many sides a die has, you can't conclude from (even a very large) number of tosses that it's likely to land on ""1""). I enjoyed the author's emphasis on the geological scale of Earth's history and future. Humans are such brief players on the world's stage and may be too stupid to keep from killing ourselves.

The introduction of the books says that, Astrobiology is the main content of the book.

This dual theme is runs rampant throughout this book.

The first portion of the book really found me thinking a lot of the Carl Sagan’s Contact, because it’s essentially dealing with the early approaches of searching for other life in the universe (Including the records Sagan was heavily involved with getting on the Voyager space probes.) Once the book started to delve into theory and odds of there being other intelligent live in the universe and the odds of contact etc, I lost interest rather quickly. It’s not that the book is poorly written or researched, it’s solid, it was just not all that interesting to me.

Each of these chapters could have been boiled down to single sentences. The rest of it is filler: ""dramatic"" retellings of astronomers making observations, biographies of scientists, etc.If you were hoping for a volume that reported the latest research on exoplanets, this is not it.

It also explores the search for other life in the universe and the possible meaning for humans. The bottom line that this book brings home is that climate change is real and people have caused it because people are the major life form on our planet.

It is full of good information, it's fun to read and quite frankly I really enjoyed it. The reason I can't give it a higher rating though is that I'm not quite sure who it's for. It seems to be for those who already accept the science of climate change and just want a little more information. But at the same time the author does say that the intention of the book is to change the narrative of climate change to something where we humans are not the villains of the story but rather the protagonists facing a challenge.I do like all this but I would say that in either case, but for one the information probably could be a lot more and a lot deeper. I mean, as someone who did pick up the book looking for information and I did get some of it. But I couldn't help but feel that there could have been a hell of a lot more. Quite honestly, with that in mind when picking up the book, I really would have liked it to be a hell of a lot thicker and more detailed. I got interested in it after hearing an interview with the author on the podcast Probably Science, an excellent podcast which I recommend to everyone, and it seemed that the hour and 20 minute interview pretty much covered the entire book. I was really hoping that the book itself would give me extra information but it really didn't feel like it. I suspect that the author wanted to appeal to as a wide variety of readers as possible, but I really could have done with more. I suppose I'll have to give other works reading.Along with that I felt that the author could have been more convincing as well. As I said, the book seems to be geared to those who already accept the science of climate change. That in on itself is perfectly fine. But the tone of the book comes off as if he also already expects us to simply accept what he wants to do, that is change the narrative around climate change. It feels like he's simply preaching to the choir. Now, personally I do think he is correct, another part of why I like this book, but when I am reading a work that does centre around making an argument. Whether it is for changing a narrative, making a philosophical argument or trying to make an argument for a stance, I really want the author to not only to state his facts but to make his case as if he wants to convince me. I do feel like I am being overly critical here, but I must say that if I didn't already accept the science of climate change and think that the author was correct after the very interesting and fun interview on Probably Science, I don't think I would have been convinced whatsoever. Even if I would already have accepted climate change but still be sceptical about the authors version of the narrative, I don't think that the author would have convinced me of it.Continuing that thought into thirdly, I really would have thought that the author would have wanted to convince as many as he could and reach the widest base. But since he seems to focus on those who already accept climate change and since, in my opinion, his arguments kinda feel like he already expects you to agree with him, I really don't feel like he's reaching as wide a base as he could.Now I'm not saying that he needed to do all three of these. But I would have liked to see at least something of this done better. I would have given this book full five stars if it either had been thicker and more informative, a bit more convincing, again I'm saying that as someone who already thinks the author is correct, or if he had not quite sounded as if he was simply preaching to the little choir that already. That said, I still highly enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about climate change and some of the history around it. "
99,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465139-leftjab,4,"This would actually be a 3.5. I’m really interested in astrobiology and Frank’s writing here makes me feel like I’ve grasped it. I was reading this as a follow up to Asimov’s Extraterrestrial Civilizations. Not quite sure if this really was what I was wanting – felt that some of the science involved was glossed over for Frank to illustrate why his approach to extraterrestrial life he would consider optimistic while many of the nay-sayers would be pessimistic. I gotta be honest, I don’t see what the big deal about the Drake Equation is. It just sounds like math that has no hope of being proved until there’s contact with some other advanced civilization and while Frank yes is optimistic that there must be other life of some sort in the universe because of the sheer number of stars and the possibility of planets around them – I’m not disputing that at all. It’s just that the conclusion of the equation is arbitrary. Beyond knowing that there are literally billions of planets the math would lead one to think that yes, there is a strong possibility for life on one of the planets. Any speculation about what that alien life could be like – to remove it from science fiction and place it closer to reality (to put it one way) – can only be postulated based on our extremely limited explorations of our solar system. So yeah, we have a good grasp on Mars and Venus, but beyond that, even exploring moons and planets within our solar system is so difficult and dangerous that getting into exoplanets is really vague at best.I’m not going to take away from Frank’s presentation of the information out there – I read the book quickly and actually made some notes of some of his sources to explore these concepts deeper in the future. And of course, the book possesses more sad resignation about the state of Earth and climate change. I liked Frank’s approach that a global civilization is going to affect the planet by nature of its being. I think that is a good approach to take – of course, I can’t stomach climate deniers and I don’t think they would even open a book like Light of the Stars to convince them that their “gut instincts” are incorrect.Why I bump the 3.5 to 4 though, is personal – as Frank speaks my language in the concluding chapter of the book, and summed up my shared belief about not that climate change is occurring, but how we as participating members of the global community should start to see ourselves and how that self-awareness (based in the scientific process but then could be utilized philosophically and ideologically – not to mention how there could be a religious aspect to self-analysis – I don’t see how religion and science cannot co-exist and getting past this political bullshit would be extremely helpful in trying to survive the next decade) should be utilized in terms of how people can attempt to tackle climate change – i.e. as a world instead of as individual nations:“Gaining the astrobiological perspective is the first, essential step in our maturation and our ability to face the Anthropocene. It means recognizing that we and our project of civilization are nothing more than the fruit of Earth’s ongoing evolutionary experiments. Any civilization on any planet will be nothing more than an expression of its home world’s creativity. We are no different from those we would call ‘alien.’”Well said. Nigel Kneale would agree."
100,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901146-arvind,4,"I picked up Light of the Stars after watching Frank animatedly discuss possibilities of alien life and world girdling civilizations with Joe Rogan. What caught my attention then, and part of what I think makes his book worth reading, is Frank‘s almost contrarian framing of global warming. For sure it’s happening, but the popular narrative about saving the planet and the polar bears isn’t compatible with life’s long history on Earth. Frank asserts that we, humanity, are the ones that need saving. Earth and life have co-evolved for billions of years and will for many more, with or without us.Light of the Stars takes an exogenous view of the way Earth, life (read humanity), and the climate interact. While describing how Earth’s climate and life have co-evolved over eons, Frank tells the story of how observations of Mars and Venus, for instance, have lead to greater understanding of climate processes here on Earth, and even influenced international politics. Later he takes the ultimate frequentist approach, based recent exoplanet discoveries, and poses Earth and our civilization as one of many in the galaxy and universe. He even uses the word 'experiment' to describe us and these other conjectured civilizations. Borrowing probably from Kardashev and others he assumes, modulo specific histories, anatomy, etc., all civilizations go through an Anthropocene type phase. Over the whole distribution of planets with civilizations, some master the transition and their planets, and some die off. It’s a powerful idea; and he, and coworkers, even made crude models of ""parametrized"" civilizations, seeded them with varying initial conditions, and analyzed the survival outcomes of the civilizations. The whole approach is pretty cool.Woven throughout is a story about the search and speculation about extraterrestrial life, and it’s interesting on its own. Frank really pays homage to Sagan, Tarter, Kardashev, and many other scientists that thought seriously about extraterritorial life. Before reading the book I had the same opinion of the Drake equation as Colonel Janus from the Expanse: „That’s not a equation. It’s a big fat guess.“. But the Drake equation really helped guide the search for extraterrestrial life. Along the same lines, Frank proposes his own equation, updated based on recent exoplanet discoveries.Overall, Light of the Stars is an interesting, light, nontechnical read, with a unique framing of climate change and our place in the universe."
101,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7649288-matt-ward,2,"One of the greatest things about popular science as a genre is how it can take topics that are somewhat dry and boring and bring life to it. We get to feel what's so cool about the topic that excited the scientists to work on it (The Elegant Universe, The Shape of Inner Space, The Selfish Gene, and Fermat's Last Theorem come to mind). Adam Frank is clearly fascinated by this stuff, but he doesn't spend enough time motivating it to get an uninterested person interested. The second chapter is basically a dry list of what makes up the environment on various planets and a recounting of probes that went there and a tedious history of the discoveries. It's only at the end of the chapter that it becomes clear why any of this is being discussed (namely, that climate models have been tested outside of Earth). That motivation needs to come at the beginning.It's not clear what niche this book is trying to serve. Most people with enough interest to pick this book up will already be familiar with the Drake equation and Fermi paradox. He doesn't even discuss the most interesting aspect of it (namely, the reason its a paradox).The end of the book gets better, but so many other books have covered similar ground in more detail and more interesting ways (see Jared Diamond's Collapse). So, I again wonder what niche the book is attempting to fill. Sorry to be such a downer. I heard a pretty interesting interview with him that turned me on to the book. I'd love to sit down and pick his brain over lunch. I'm not that interested in reading another of his books."
102,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43813529-celia-reaves,3,"Frank is a scientist with solid credentials and a strong reputation. In this book he tries something that’s probably impossible to pull off, so it’s not surprising I found it underwhelming. He is trying to use what we know about how stars, planets, biospheres, and civilizations evolve to draw conclusions about two separate things: whether there are or ever have been alien civilizations on other planets, and whether our civilization will survive the climate crisis we are now facing. He has good science about how stars develop. He pulls together information from geology and the study of planets in our solar system to support a strong argument about the development of planets. When he starts to draw conclusions about the evolution of large and complex biological organisms, and then about intelligence and technological civilizations, though, he loses me. I don’t see any way to extrapolate meaningfully from a sample of one. He does the math to show that in order for us to be the only technological civilization ever in our galaxy, the probability for such an event would have to be ridiculously small (one in ten billion trillion). Therefore, he concludes, we are not the first such civilization. I’m unconvinced by this argument. Just because a probability is vanishingly small doesn’t mean it actually vanishes. There is a lot of interesting information here, about stars and planets and the search for planets around distant stars. For me, though, he goes a step too far in the conclusions he draws. The evidence we need to get there is just not available yet."
103,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3512830-elmwoodblues,3,"Adam Frank himself makes clear that the subtitle of his book, 'Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth', could read '...and the Fate of Humanity.' Our earth is a pretty big place, and it didn't always look like it does now, what with the lava and the no oxygen and all. So, like Venus or Mars or (Carl Sagan voice here:) billions and billions of other worlds, when the water all floats away or the greenhouse effects take hold, whatever big round rock this happens to will be mostly okay. It is just the, you know, living stuff, that will have the bad day.It is a little frustrating to know that we all agree on how a greenhouse works out in a field, trapping solar radiation in the form of heat; Harbor Freight sells small ones for $300, near the $6 car-window shades. We all know that no use of energy is 100% efficient, so waste is produced with ANY work done; there are no free lunches in the universe. (Wind power? ""...extracting energy from wind power on a scale massive enough to power our current civilization would leave a global imprint akin to mild global warning."" Page 191. Sorry)So, why 'denial'? Because 'causes' is the big bugaboo, and we need to blame something? It's not the 'how' of using energy, it's the amount, the scale of it, the inevitability of it. It's thermodynamics, and thermodynamics are a bitch. Ask Venus."

The author does a good job of bringing together numerous different interrelated theories in terms of planetary feedback loops, systems and climate to make probabilistic claims on the likely number of planets that exist in the universe that are within the habitable zone and thus able to sustain life. The probabilities continue to look at just how many of those planets are likely to see the development of intelligent life and civilisation building life, like our own of earth. Unsurprisingly, the odds diminish at each stage, but even with the most pessimistic of predictions from the biggest doubters in the scientific community, we are still talking about a healthy number of planets that have or may host civilisation building life throughout all space and time.It’s a fascinating book well worth a read for anyone who loves science."

The focus of this book is on Fermi's Paradox, which states that with the near infinite number of opportunities in the universe for intelligent life to form, why is there no concrete evidence of any intelligent life other than ourselves? Are we really alone in the universe?It turns out that with the recent discoveries of numerous exoplanets, there can now be little doubt that life, and even intelligent life has sprung up elsewhere, outside of our solar system. What is still much in doubt, however, is how long those civilizations have lasted. There is currently great concern that our own technological civilization may be very short-lived. Is rapid development followed by rapid decline the norm for technological, energy-intensive civilizations like ours?There were some very good insights that this book brought up, but in the end I was still left with skepticism that, because of the great distances involved and the short-sighted direction our civilization seems to be taking, our species will never learn much about the true answers to these questions."
106,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,5,"This book is about our growing knowledge of exoplanets, and what the emerging science of astrobiology can teach us about the fate of our own planet. Yup, it’s a pretty heavy subject, but the science is not difficult, and is facilely explained by Adam Frank. He uses as his central principle the famous Drake Equation, which estimates the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence. With at least 1200 confirmed exoplanets, and thousands more sure to lurk in data captured by the Kepler space telescope but not yet analyzed, we have quite a bit of data to start filling in the variables in the Equation. Further, Frank looks back at two planets we know very well (Venus and Mars) to explain why they DON’T currently host life. The famed astronomer Carl Sagan appears in several threads of this story, both as an early enthusiast in SETI and as a member of the team which created the term “nuclear winter” (evidence for which comes from the history of Mars). The point of the book is basically to help us understand climate change on Earth, but the science it uses to get there is broad and endlessly fascinating. If you are in any way interested in any planetary science, this is a must-read.Grade: A"
107,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Over the years, many works of fiction have discussed the possibility of other worlds. In the 1950s, a group of prominent scientists sat down to lunch, and Enrico Fermi asked an important question; ""Where is everyone?""Here is a little backstory; we had known for some time that other stars might also harbor planets capable of supporting life. If we only look at the Milky Way Galaxy, we are looking at a cosmic neighborhood of approximately four hundred billion stars. So finally, a scientist sat down and wrote out a simple equation. It isn't necessarily a law of nature like Einstein's Equations. That scientist was named Frank Drake, and Drake's Equation became famous.Drake's Equation is easy to understand. It has seven parts. First, you figure out the birthrate of stars. Second, you multiply the number by the fraction of stars with planets. Third, you figure out which planets are in a habitable zone. Fourth, you figure out which planets develop life. Fifth, you figure out whether or not it has intelligence. Sixth, you figure out if they have the technology required to receive and send radio signals. Finally, you have to figure out the average lifetime of a technologically advanced civilization.The book is fascinating. I enjoyed it a lot."
108,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"The subtitle, preface, and marketing materials seem to indicate that this is about what astrobiology will reveal about climate change. Except that turns out to be almost backwards; there are indeed chapters setting up planetary science and the Drake equation about the likelihood of detectable life elsewhere in the galaxy, but then abruptly turns to computational models of ecology with very limited extraterrestrial input (except maybe a slight assist from Venus and Mars) to compute how likely civilization is to destroy itself. The doesn't seem to really know how Idea A is supposed to relate to Idea B, only that it thinks both ideas are interesting.It was mostly absorbing enough, although Frank's presentations were sometimes baffling -- his example ecological model was about ""bunnies,"" and although I'm pretty sure a professor of astronomy at the University of Rochester understands statistics, he handled them so cavalierly that a lot of his inferences seemed flat-out wrong as stated. But don't go in thinking that there's going to be a clear central thesis."

Though there was some great information on scientists and research I wasn't familiar with, this ended up being a very long persuasive piece about global warming/climate change. Now I completely believe humans are causing a potentially devastating change to our planet through the reckless use of fossil fuels, refusing to invest in renewable energy sources, and the clear-cutting of vast areas of the globe. I was clearly not the audience for this book. And I felt like I had been hoodwinked into reading this because I thought this would be a book about something else.Mainly aliens. I thought it'd be about aliens. And like 20 pages were. Sorta. :/ It's a well-written book and I recommend it to people who want to read about climate change. But if you came to it for aliens, you'll be disappointed. "

Light of the Stars is a popular account of the current understanding of the evolution of planets, ours and others throughout the universe. Frank addresses climate change by saying that science tells us we are changing our climate, but we should not feel guilty about it. Developing civilizations are part of the planet and do impact the development of the planet. We will not destroy the planet. It is not a question of whether or not the earth will survive, but rather whether or not humans will survive. If you are looking for details of the physics behind Frank's arguments, you will be disappointed. There is only one equation in the book and it is well explained. If you are not up to date on current scientific understanding of our planet and its possible future, Frank provides an easily read book to fill that gap."

It seems to me that while there are a lot of important questions to ask about the long-term future of humans on this planet, and maybe more generally technological civilizations on any planet, a better integration of ecological and evolutionary concepts is currently a missing ingredient. I would guess that this bias stems from the fields that astrobiology emerged from, and the generally short timescales ecologists tend to limit themselves to. This book would certainly support the idea that we need to think on big scales - as well as smaller scales - to better understand the magnitude and nature of our changing world in the context of the larger universe."

That's not to say its not good, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting, and that made it really drag for me. I had originally thought this book was solely focused on the possibilities of aliens, and inhabited planets. That is certainly part of the story, but in reality, this book is about what other planets can teach us about our own experiences on Earth, primarily climate change and how to respond to it, or the risks it might present. Whilst a valuable endeavour, coming off the back of 'The Glad Shout', and given what I thought the content was to be, I really not enthused for the topic. Nonetheless, Frank's book is a compelling argument for human created climate change, and how planetary science can teach us how we need to respond to ensure we're still here in a thousand years. So, if you've got a friend who doesn't believe in climate change, might be a worthwhile read for them."

The author calculates the number of planets the are similar to Earth and concludes that it's overwhelmingly likely there's life out there. But, of course, this is a bad argument: a large number of Earth-like planets (without any information about the probabilities of life arising within those conditions) is not enough to know how likely life is... (If you don't know how many sides a die has, you can't conclude from (even a very large) number of tosses that it's likely to land on ""1""). I enjoyed the author's emphasis on the geological scale of Earth's history and future. Humans are such brief players on the world's stage and may be too stupid to keep from killing ourselves.

The first portion of the book really found me thinking a lot of the Carl Sagan’s Contact, because it’s essentially dealing with the early approaches of searching for other life in the universe (Including the records Sagan was heavily involved with getting on the Voyager space probes.) Once the book started to delve into theory and odds of there being other intelligent live in the universe and the odds of contact etc, I lost interest rather quickly. It’s not that the book is poorly written or researched, it’s solid, it was just not all that interesting to me.

Each of these chapters could have been boiled down to single sentences. The rest of it is filler: ""dramatic"" retellings of astronomers making observations, biographies of scientists, etc.If you were hoping for a volume that reported the latest research on exoplanets, this is not it.

It also explores the search for other life in the universe and the possible meaning for humans.

126,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5913084-blaine-morrow,4,"Frank provides a clear, easy-to-read and understand summary of what we know about exoplanets, the possibilities of alien civilizations, and why this is an important topic. He posits that our current crisis of planetary exploitation may be universal (i.e., throughout the universe) and that other civilizations may have solved this problem."

Adam Frank offers a way forward for our planet and breaks down complex science and math into simpler language."
128,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12275862-sigurgeir,3,"I did want to give this book a higher rating since I did like it. It is full of good information, it's fun to read and quite frankly I really enjoyed it. The reason I can't give it a higher rating though is that I'm not quite sure who it's for. It seems to be for those who already accept the science of climate change and just want a little more information. But at the same time the author does say that the intention of the book is to change the narrative of climate change to something where we humans are not the villains of the story but rather the protagonists facing a challenge.I do like all this but I would say that in either case, but for one the information probably could be a lot more and a lot deeper. I mean, as someone who did pick up the book looking for information and I did get some of it. But I couldn't help but feel that there could have been a hell of a lot more. Quite honestly, with that in mind when picking up the book, I really would have liked it to be a hell of a lot thicker and more detailed. I got interested in it after hearing an interview with the author on the podcast Probably Science, an excellent podcast which I recommend to everyone, and it seemed that the hour and 20 minute interview pretty much covered the entire book. I was really hoping that the book itself would give me extra information but it really didn't feel like it. I suspect that the author wanted to appeal to as a wide variety of readers as possible, but I really could have done with more. I suppose I'll have to give other works reading.Along with that I felt that the author could have been more convincing as well. As I said, the book seems to be geared to those who already accept the science of climate change. That in on itself is perfectly fine. But the tone of the book comes off as if he also already expects us to simply accept what he wants to do, that is change the narrative around climate change. It feels like he's simply preaching to the choir. Now, personally I do think he is correct, another part of why I like this book, but when I am reading a work that does centre around making an argument. Whether it is for changing a narrative, making a philosophical argument or trying to make an argument for a stance, I really want the author to not only to state his facts but to make his case as if he wants to convince me. I do feel like I am being overly critical here, but I must say that if I didn't already accept the science of climate change and think that the author was correct after the very interesting and fun interview on Probably Science, I don't think I would have been convinced whatsoever. Even if I would already have accepted climate change but still be sceptical about the authors version of the narrative, I don't think that the author would have convinced me of it.Continuing that thought into thirdly, I really would have thought that the author would have wanted to convince as many as he could and reach the widest base. But since he seems to focus on those who already accept climate change and since, in my opinion, his arguments kinda feel like he already expects you to agree with him, I really don't feel like he's reaching as wide a base as he could.Now I'm not saying that he needed to do all three of these. But I would have liked to see at least something of this done better. I would have given this book full five stars if it either had been thicker and more informative, a bit more convincing, again I'm saying that as someone who already thinks the author is correct, or if he had not quite sounded as if he was simply preaching to the little choir that already. That said, I still highly enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about climate change and some of the history around it. "
129,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465139-leftjab,4,"This would actually be a 3.5. I’m really interested in astrobiology and Frank’s writing here makes me feel like I’ve grasped it. I was reading this as a follow up to Asimov’s Extraterrestrial Civilizations. Not quite sure if this really was what I was wanting – felt that some of the science involved was glossed over for Frank to illustrate why his approach to extraterrestrial life he would consider optimistic while many of the nay-sayers would be pessimistic. I gotta be honest, I don’t see what the big deal about the Drake Equation is. It just sounds like math that has no hope of being proved until there’s contact with some other advanced civilization and while Frank yes is optimistic that there must be other life of some sort in the universe because of the sheer number of stars and the possibility of planets around them – I’m not disputing that at all. It’s just that the conclusion of the equation is arbitrary. Beyond knowing that there are literally billions of planets the math would lead one to think that yes, there is a strong possibility for life on one of the planets. Any speculation about what that alien life could be like – to remove it from science fiction and place it closer to reality (to put it one way) – can only be postulated based on our extremely limited explorations of our solar system. So yeah, we have a good grasp on Mars and Venus, but beyond that, even exploring moons and planets within our solar system is so difficult and dangerous that getting into exoplanets is really vague at best.I’m not going to take away from Frank’s presentation of the information out there – I read the book quickly and actually made some notes of some of his sources to explore these concepts deeper in the future. And of course, the book possesses more sad resignation about the state of Earth and climate change. I liked Frank’s approach that a global civilization is going to affect the planet by nature of its being. I think that is a good approach to take – of course, I can’t stomach climate deniers and I don’t think they would even open a book like Light of the Stars to convince them that their “gut instincts” are incorrect.Why I bump the 3.5 to 4 though, is personal – as Frank speaks my language in the concluding chapter of the book, and summed up my shared belief about not that climate change is occurring, but how we as participating members of the global community should start to see ourselves and how that self-awareness (based in the scientific process but then could be utilized philosophically and ideologically – not to mention how there could be a religious aspect to self-analysis – I don’t see how religion and science cannot co-exist and getting past this political bullshit would be extremely helpful in trying to survive the next decade) should be utilized in terms of how people can attempt to tackle climate change – i.e. as a world instead of as individual nations:“Gaining the astrobiological perspective is the first, essential step in our maturation and our ability to face the Anthropocene. It means recognizing that we and our project of civilization are nothing more than the fruit of Earth’s ongoing evolutionary experiments. Any civilization on any planet will be nothing more than an expression of its home world’s creativity. We are no different from those we would call ‘alien.’”Well said. Nigel Kneale would agree."
130,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901146-arvind,4,"I picked up Light of the Stars after watching Frank animatedly discuss possibilities of alien life and world girdling civilizations with Joe Rogan. What caught my attention then, and part of what I think makes his book worth reading, is Frank‘s almost contrarian framing of global warming. For sure it’s happening, but the popular narrative about saving the planet and the polar bears isn’t compatible with life’s long history on Earth. Frank asserts that we, humanity, are the ones that need saving. Earth and life have co-evolved for billions of years and will for many more, with or without us.Light of the Stars takes an exogenous view of the way Earth, life (read humanity), and the climate interact. While describing how Earth’s climate and life have co-evolved over eons, Frank tells the story of how observations of Mars and Venus, for instance, have lead to greater understanding of climate processes here on Earth, and even influenced international politics. Later he takes the ultimate frequentist approach, based recent exoplanet discoveries, and poses Earth and our civilization as one of many in the galaxy and universe. He even uses the word 'experiment' to describe us and these other conjectured civilizations. Borrowing probably from Kardashev and others he assumes, modulo specific histories, anatomy, etc., all civilizations go through an Anthropocene type phase. Over the whole distribution of planets with civilizations, some master the transition and their planets, and some die off. It’s a powerful idea; and he, and coworkers, even made crude models of ""parametrized"" civilizations, seeded them with varying initial conditions, and analyzed the survival outcomes of the civilizations. The whole approach is pretty cool.Woven throughout is a story about the search and speculation about extraterrestrial life, and it’s interesting on its own. Frank really pays homage to Sagan, Tarter, Kardashev, and many other scientists that thought seriously about extraterritorial life. Before reading the book I had the same opinion of the Drake equation as Colonel Janus from the Expanse: „That’s not a equation. It’s a big fat guess.“. But the Drake equation really helped guide the search for extraterrestrial life. Along the same lines, Frank proposes his own equation, updated based on recent exoplanet discoveries.Overall, Light of the Stars is an interesting, light, nontechnical read, with a unique framing of climate change and our place in the universe."
131,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7649288-matt-ward,2,"One of the greatest things about popular science as a genre is how it can take topics that are somewhat dry and boring and bring life to it. We get to feel what's so cool about the topic that excited the scientists to work on it (The Elegant Universe, The Shape of Inner Space, The Selfish Gene, and Fermat's Last Theorem come to mind). Adam Frank is clearly fascinated by this stuff, but he doesn't spend enough time motivating it to get an uninterested person interested. The second chapter is basically a dry list of what makes up the environment on various planets and a recounting of probes that went there and a tedious history of the discoveries. It's only at the end of the chapter that it becomes clear why any of this is being discussed (namely, that climate models have been tested outside of Earth). That motivation needs to come at the beginning.It's not clear what niche this book is trying to serve. Most people with enough interest to pick this book up will already be familiar with the Drake equation and Fermi paradox. He doesn't even discuss the most interesting aspect of it (namely, the reason its a paradox).The end of the book gets better, but so many other books have covered similar ground in more detail and more interesting ways (see Jared Diamond's Collapse). So, I again wonder what niche the book is attempting to fill. Sorry to be such a downer. I heard a pretty interesting interview with him that turned me on to the book. I'd love to sit down and pick his brain over lunch. I'm not that interested in reading another of his books."
132,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43813529-celia-reaves,3,"Frank is a scientist with solid credentials and a strong reputation. In this book he tries something that’s probably impossible to pull off, so it’s not surprising I found it underwhelming. He is trying to use what we know about how stars, planets, biospheres, and civilizations evolve to draw conclusions about two separate things: whether there are or ever have been alien civilizations on other planets, and whether our civilization will survive the climate crisis we are now facing. He has good science about how stars develop. He pulls together information from geology and the study of planets in our solar system to support a strong argument about the development of planets. When he starts to draw conclusions about the evolution of large and complex biological organisms, and then about intelligence and technological civilizations, though, he loses me. I don’t see any way to extrapolate meaningfully from a sample of one. He does the math to show that in order for us to be the only technological civilization ever in our galaxy, the probability for such an event would have to be ridiculously small (one in ten billion trillion). Therefore, he concludes, we are not the first such civilization. I’m unconvinced by this argument. Just because a probability is vanishingly small doesn’t mean it actually vanishes. There is a lot of interesting information here, about stars and planets and the search for planets around distant stars. For me, though, he goes a step too far in the conclusions he draws. The evidence we need to get there is just not available yet."
133,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3512830-elmwoodblues,3,"Adam Frank himself makes clear that the subtitle of his book, 'Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth', could read '...and the Fate of Humanity.' Our earth is a pretty big place, and it didn't always look like it does now, what with the lava and the no oxygen and all. So, like Venus or Mars or (Carl Sagan voice here:) billions and billions of other worlds, when the water all floats away or the greenhouse effects take hold, whatever big round rock this happens to will be mostly okay. It is just the, you know, living stuff, that will have the bad day.It is a little frustrating to know that we all agree on how a greenhouse works out in a field, trapping solar radiation in the form of heat; Harbor Freight sells small ones for $300, near the $6 car-window shades. We all know that no use of energy is 100% efficient, so waste is produced with ANY work done; there are no free lunches in the universe. (Wind power? ""...extracting energy from wind power on a scale massive enough to power our current civilization would leave a global imprint akin to mild global warning."" Page 191. Sorry)So, why 'denial'? Because 'causes' is the big bugaboo, and we need to blame something? It's not the 'how' of using energy, it's the amount, the scale of it, the inevitability of it. It's thermodynamics, and thermodynamics are a bitch. Ask Venus."

The author does a good job of bringing together numerous different interrelated theories in terms of planetary feedback loops, systems and climate to make probabilistic claims on the likely number of planets that exist in the universe that are within the habitable zone and thus able to sustain life. The probabilities continue to look at just how many of those planets are likely to see the development of intelligent life and civilisation building life, like our own of earth. Unsurprisingly, the odds diminish at each stage, but even with the most pessimistic of predictions from the biggest doubters in the scientific community, we are still talking about a healthy number of planets that have or may host civilisation building life throughout all space and time.It’s a fascinating book well worth a read for anyone who loves science."

The focus of this book is on Fermi's Paradox, which states that with the near infinite number of opportunities in the universe for intelligent life to form, why is there no concrete evidence of any intelligent life other than ourselves? Are we really alone in the universe?It turns out that with the recent discoveries of numerous exoplanets, there can now be little doubt that life, and even intelligent life has sprung up elsewhere, outside of our solar system. What is still much in doubt, however, is how long those civilizations have lasted. There is currently great concern that our own technological civilization may be very short-lived. Is rapid development followed by rapid decline the norm for technological, energy-intensive civilizations like ours?There were some very good insights that this book brought up, but in the end I was still left with skepticism that, because of the great distances involved and the short-sighted direction our civilization seems to be taking, our species will never learn much about the true answers to these questions."
136,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,5,"This book is about our growing knowledge of exoplanets, and what the emerging science of astrobiology can teach us about the fate of our own planet. Yup, it’s a pretty heavy subject, but the science is not difficult, and is facilely explained by Adam Frank. He uses as his central principle the famous Drake Equation, which estimates the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence. With at least 1200 confirmed exoplanets, and thousands more sure to lurk in data captured by the Kepler space telescope but not yet analyzed, we have quite a bit of data to start filling in the variables in the Equation. Further, Frank looks back at two planets we know very well (Venus and Mars) to explain why they DON’T currently host life. The famed astronomer Carl Sagan appears in several threads of this story, both as an early enthusiast in SETI and as a member of the team which created the term “nuclear winter” (evidence for which comes from the history of Mars). The point of the book is basically to help us understand climate change on Earth, but the science it uses to get there is broad and endlessly fascinating. If you are in any way interested in any planetary science, this is a must-read.Grade: A"
137,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Over the years, many works of fiction have discussed the possibility of other worlds. In the 1950s, a group of prominent scientists sat down to lunch, and Enrico Fermi asked an important question; ""Where is everyone?""Here is a little backstory; we had known for some time that other stars might also harbor planets capable of supporting life. If we only look at the Milky Way Galaxy, we are looking at a cosmic neighborhood of approximately four hundred billion stars. So finally, a scientist sat down and wrote out a simple equation. It isn't necessarily a law of nature like Einstein's Equations. That scientist was named Frank Drake, and Drake's Equation became famous.Drake's Equation is easy to understand. It has seven parts. First, you figure out the birthrate of stars. Second, you multiply the number by the fraction of stars with planets. Third, you figure out which planets are in a habitable zone. Fourth, you figure out which planets develop life. Fifth, you figure out whether or not it has intelligence. Sixth, you figure out if they have the technology required to receive and send radio signals. Finally, you have to figure out the average lifetime of a technologically advanced civilization.The book is fascinating. I enjoyed it a lot."
138,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"The subtitle, preface, and marketing materials seem to indicate that this is about what astrobiology will reveal about climate change. Except that turns out to be almost backwards; there are indeed chapters setting up planetary science and the Drake equation about the likelihood of detectable life elsewhere in the galaxy, but then abruptly turns to computational models of ecology with very limited extraterrestrial input (except maybe a slight assist from Venus and Mars) to compute how likely civilization is to destroy itself. The doesn't seem to really know how Idea A is supposed to relate to Idea B, only that it thinks both ideas are interesting.It was mostly absorbing enough, although Frank's presentations were sometimes baffling -- his example ecological model was about ""bunnies,"" and although I'm pretty sure a professor of astronomy at the University of Rochester understands statistics, he handled them so cavalierly that a lot of his inferences seemed flat-out wrong as stated. But don't go in thinking that there's going to be a clear central thesis."
139,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11628317-amanda,2,"More like a 2.5 rating.I felt a little duped after reading this. Actually I felt duped about halfway through. Though there was some great information on scientists and research I wasn't familiar with, this ended up being a very long persuasive piece about global warming/climate change. Now I completely believe humans are causing a potentially devastating change to our planet through the reckless use of fossil fuels, refusing to invest in renewable energy sources, and the clear-cutting of vast areas of the globe. I was clearly not the audience for this book. And I felt like I had been hoodwinked into reading this because I thought this would be a book about something else.Mainly aliens. I thought it'd be about aliens. And like 20 pages were. Sorta. :/ It's a well-written book and I recommend it to people who want to read about climate change. But if you came to it for aliens, you'll be disappointed. "

Light of the Stars is a popular account of the current understanding of the evolution of planets, ours and others throughout the universe. Frank addresses climate change by saying that science tells us we are changing our climate, but we should not feel guilty about it. Developing civilizations are part of the planet and do impact the development of the planet. We will not destroy the planet. It is not a question of whether or not the earth will survive, but rather whether or not humans will survive. If you are looking for details of the physics behind Frank's arguments, you will be disappointed. There is only one equation in the book and it is well explained. If you are not up to date on current scientific understanding of our planet and its possible future, Frank provides an easily read book to fill that gap."

It seems to me that while there are a lot of important questions to ask about the long-term future of humans on this planet, and maybe more generally technological civilizations on any planet, a better integration of ecological and evolutionary concepts is currently a missing ingredient. I would guess that this bias stems from the fields that astrobiology emerged from, and the generally short timescales ecologists tend to limit themselves to. This book would certainly support the idea that we need to think on big scales - as well as smaller scales - to better understand the magnitude and nature of our changing world in the context of the larger universe."

That's not to say its not good, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting, and that made it really drag for me. I had originally thought this book was solely focused on the possibilities of aliens, and inhabited planets. That is certainly part of the story, but in reality, this book is about what other planets can teach us about our own experiences on Earth, primarily climate change and how to respond to it, or the risks it might present. Whilst a valuable endeavour, coming off the back of 'The Glad Shout', and given what I thought the content was to be, I really not enthused for the topic. Nonetheless, Frank's book is a compelling argument for human created climate change, and how planetary science can teach us how we need to respond to ensure we're still here in a thousand years. So, if you've got a friend who doesn't believe in climate change, might be a worthwhile read for them."

The author calculates the number of planets the are similar to Earth and concludes that it's overwhelmingly likely there's life out there. But, of course, this is a bad argument: a large number of Earth-like planets (without any information about the probabilities of life arising within those conditions) is not enough to know how likely life is... (If you don't know how many sides a die has, you can't conclude from (even a very large) number of tosses that it's likely to land on ""1"").

Along those lines, this is a fantastic book for people who have a base understanding or are being introduced to topics such as Fermi's paradox, Carl Sagan's work, and the SETI program.

I think I mostly found the hard actual science in the beginning to the speculative and future possible science of the later portions of the book. The first portion of the book really found me thinking a lot of the Carl Sagan’s Contact, because it’s essentially dealing with the early approaches of searching for other life in the universe (Including the records Sagan was heavily involved with getting on the Voyager space probes.) Once the book started to delve into theory and odds of there being other intelligent live in the universe and the odds of contact etc, I lost interest rather quickly. It’s not that the book is poorly written or researched, it’s solid, it was just not all that interesting to me.

Each of these chapters could have been boiled down to single sentences. The rest of it is filler: ""dramatic"" retellings of astronomers making observations, biographies of scientists, etc.If you were hoping for a volume that reported the latest research on exoplanets, this is not it.

It also explores the search for other life in the universe and the possible meaning for humans. The bottom line that this book brings home is that climate change is real and people have caused it because people are the major life form on our planet. It’s no longer a matter of saving the planet but of saving ourselves. A reasoned and informative read.
153,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22093539-audra-falk,4,"After reading this book, I have a much bigger view of the universe. WOW.I also now have what is probably a more accurate perspective of our own tiny place within time and space--and a greater appreciation of the privileges and responsibilities we as humans have on this planet and at this time.For someone who struggled with physics and chemistry classes in school, I was happy to find that I was able to understand the vast majority of this book. This is a credit to the author's ability to speak to the layperson. Overall a great book for anyone who is interested in an overview of astrobiology or astrophysics-- or who is just curious about the great universe that surrounds us. "
154,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4865450-david-davy,5,"I've long thought that biggest obstacle to solving or dealing with climate change is that it occurs outside boundaries of normal, everyday perception. Light of the Stars attempts to address this by expanding the field of observation to planets other than our own, real and imagined, given the data at hand. We and all other life here are a natural result of the myriad changes that have already taken place across the entirety of the existence of the planet, and the odds that we are the first planet to have this outcome, of civilization, is virtually nil. The long term survival of our civilization depends on a better understanding of how planets work and of our place on them. "

The science did feel a bit light and overly dumbed down at times, but perhaps that is what the general public needs. But as a logical thought experiment, the message rings true - we are both not alone in the universe but there is no backup to Earth. What are we going to do about it? I feel like this should be high school required reading."

158,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12275862-sigurgeir,3,"I did want to give this book a higher rating since I did like it. It is full of good information, it's fun to read and quite frankly I really enjoyed it. The reason I can't give it a higher rating though is that I'm not quite sure who it's for. It seems to be for those who already accept the science of climate change and just want a little more information. But at the same time the author does say that the intention of the book is to change the narrative of climate change to something where we humans are not the villains of the story but rather the protagonists facing a challenge.I do like all this but I would say that in either case, but for one the information probably could be a lot more and a lot deeper. I mean, as someone who did pick up the book looking for information and I did get some of it. But I couldn't help but feel that there could have been a hell of a lot more. Quite honestly, with that in mind when picking up the book, I really would have liked it to be a hell of a lot thicker and more detailed. I got interested in it after hearing an interview with the author on the podcast Probably Science, an excellent podcast which I recommend to everyone, and it seemed that the hour and 20 minute interview pretty much covered the entire book. I was really hoping that the book itself would give me extra information but it really didn't feel like it. I suspect that the author wanted to appeal to as a wide variety of readers as possible, but I really could have done with more. I suppose I'll have to give other works reading.Along with that I felt that the author could have been more convincing as well. As I said, the book seems to be geared to those who already accept the science of climate change. That in on itself is perfectly fine. But the tone of the book comes off as if he also already expects us to simply accept what he wants to do, that is change the narrative around climate change. It feels like he's simply preaching to the choir. Now, personally I do think he is correct, another part of why I like this book, but when I am reading a work that does centre around making an argument. Whether it is for changing a narrative, making a philosophical argument or trying to make an argument for a stance, I really want the author to not only to state his facts but to make his case as if he wants to convince me. I do feel like I am being overly critical here, but I must say that if I didn't already accept the science of climate change and think that the author was correct after the very interesting and fun interview on Probably Science, I don't think I would have been convinced whatsoever. Even if I would already have accepted climate change but still be sceptical about the authors version of the narrative, I don't think that the author would have convinced me of it.Continuing that thought into thirdly, I really would have thought that the author would have wanted to convince as many as he could and reach the widest base. But since he seems to focus on those who already accept climate change and since, in my opinion, his arguments kinda feel like he already expects you to agree with him, I really don't feel like he's reaching as wide a base as he could.Now I'm not saying that he needed to do all three of these. But I would have liked to see at least something of this done better. I would have given this book full five stars if it either had been thicker and more informative, a bit more convincing, again I'm saying that as someone who already thinks the author is correct, or if he had not quite sounded as if he was simply preaching to the little choir that already. That said, I still highly enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about climate change and some of the history around it. "
159,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465139-leftjab,4,"This would actually be a 3.5. I’m really interested in astrobiology and Frank’s writing here makes me feel like I’ve grasped it. I was reading this as a follow up to Asimov’s Extraterrestrial Civilizations. Not quite sure if this really was what I was wanting – felt that some of the science involved was glossed over for Frank to illustrate why his approach to extraterrestrial life he would consider optimistic while many of the nay-sayers would be pessimistic. I gotta be honest, I don’t see what the big deal about the Drake Equation is. It just sounds like math that has no hope of being proved until there’s contact with some other advanced civilization and while Frank yes is optimistic that there must be other life of some sort in the universe because of the sheer number of stars and the possibility of planets around them – I’m not disputing that at all. It’s just that the conclusion of the equation is arbitrary. Beyond knowing that there are literally billions of planets the math would lead one to think that yes, there is a strong possibility for life on one of the planets. Any speculation about what that alien life could be like – to remove it from science fiction and place it closer to reality (to put it one way) – can only be postulated based on our extremely limited explorations of our solar system. So yeah, we have a good grasp on Mars and Venus, but beyond that, even exploring moons and planets within our solar system is so difficult and dangerous that getting into exoplanets is really vague at best.I’m not going to take away from Frank’s presentation of the information out there – I read the book quickly and actually made some notes of some of his sources to explore these concepts deeper in the future. And of course, the book possesses more sad resignation about the state of Earth and climate change. I liked Frank’s approach that a global civilization is going to affect the planet by nature of its being. I think that is a good approach to take – of course, I can’t stomach climate deniers and I don’t think they would even open a book like Light of the Stars to convince them that their “gut instincts” are incorrect.Why I bump the 3.5 to 4 though, is personal – as Frank speaks my language in the concluding chapter of the book, and summed up my shared belief about not that climate change is occurring, but how we as participating members of the global community should start to see ourselves and how that self-awareness (based in the scientific process but then could be utilized philosophically and ideologically – not to mention how there could be a religious aspect to self-analysis – I don’t see how religion and science cannot co-exist and getting past this political bullshit would be extremely helpful in trying to survive the next decade) should be utilized in terms of how people can attempt to tackle climate change – i.e. as a world instead of as individual nations:“Gaining the astrobiological perspective is the first, essential step in our maturation and our ability to face the Anthropocene. It means recognizing that we and our project of civilization are nothing more than the fruit of Earth’s ongoing evolutionary experiments. Any civilization on any planet will be nothing more than an expression of its home world’s creativity. We are no different from those we would call ‘alien.’”Well said. Nigel Kneale would agree."
160,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901146-arvind,4,"I picked up Light of the Stars after watching Frank animatedly discuss possibilities of alien life and world girdling civilizations with Joe Rogan. What caught my attention then, and part of what I think makes his book worth reading, is Frank‘s almost contrarian framing of global warming. For sure it’s happening, but the popular narrative about saving the planet and the polar bears isn’t compatible with life’s long history on Earth. Frank asserts that we, humanity, are the ones that need saving. Earth and life have co-evolved for billions of years and will for many more, with or without us.Light of the Stars takes an exogenous view of the way Earth, life (read humanity), and the climate interact. While describing how Earth’s climate and life have co-evolved over eons, Frank tells the story of how observations of Mars and Venus, for instance, have lead to greater understanding of climate processes here on Earth, and even influenced international politics. Later he takes the ultimate frequentist approach, based recent exoplanet discoveries, and poses Earth and our civilization as one of many in the galaxy and universe. He even uses the word 'experiment' to describe us and these other conjectured civilizations. Borrowing probably from Kardashev and others he assumes, modulo specific histories, anatomy, etc., all civilizations go through an Anthropocene type phase. Over the whole distribution of planets with civilizations, some master the transition and their planets, and some die off. It’s a powerful idea; and he, and coworkers, even made crude models of ""parametrized"" civilizations, seeded them with varying initial conditions, and analyzed the survival outcomes of the civilizations. The whole approach is pretty cool.Woven throughout is a story about the search and speculation about extraterrestrial life, and it’s interesting on its own. Frank really pays homage to Sagan, Tarter, Kardashev, and many other scientists that thought seriously about extraterritorial life. Before reading the book I had the same opinion of the Drake equation as Colonel Janus from the Expanse: „That’s not a equation. It’s a big fat guess.“. But the Drake equation really helped guide the search for extraterrestrial life. Along the same lines, Frank proposes his own equation, updated based on recent exoplanet discoveries.Overall, Light of the Stars is an interesting, light, nontechnical read, with a unique framing of climate change and our place in the universe."
161,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7649288-matt-ward,2,"One of the greatest things about popular science as a genre is how it can take topics that are somewhat dry and boring and bring life to it. We get to feel what's so cool about the topic that excited the scientists to work on it (The Elegant Universe, The Shape of Inner Space, The Selfish Gene, and Fermat's Last Theorem come to mind). Adam Frank is clearly fascinated by this stuff, but he doesn't spend enough time motivating it to get an uninterested person interested. The second chapter is basically a dry list of what makes up the environment on various planets and a recounting of probes that went there and a tedious history of the discoveries. It's only at the end of the chapter that it becomes clear why any of this is being discussed (namely, that climate models have been tested outside of Earth). That motivation needs to come at the beginning.It's not clear what niche this book is trying to serve. Most people with enough interest to pick this book up will already be familiar with the Drake equation and Fermi paradox. He doesn't even discuss the most interesting aspect of it (namely, the reason its a paradox).The end of the book gets better, but so many other books have covered similar ground in more detail and more interesting ways (see Jared Diamond's Collapse). So, I again wonder what niche the book is attempting to fill. Sorry to be such a downer. I heard a pretty interesting interview with him that turned me on to the book. I'd love to sit down and pick his brain over lunch. I'm not that interested in reading another of his books."
162,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43813529-celia-reaves,3,"Frank is a scientist with solid credentials and a strong reputation. In this book he tries something that’s probably impossible to pull off, so it’s not surprising I found it underwhelming. He is trying to use what we know about how stars, planets, biospheres, and civilizations evolve to draw conclusions about two separate things: whether there are or ever have been alien civilizations on other planets, and whether our civilization will survive the climate crisis we are now facing. He has good science about how stars develop. He pulls together information from geology and the study of planets in our solar system to support a strong argument about the development of planets. When he starts to draw conclusions about the evolution of large and complex biological organisms, and then about intelligence and technological civilizations, though, he loses me. I don’t see any way to extrapolate meaningfully from a sample of one. He does the math to show that in order for us to be the only technological civilization ever in our galaxy, the probability for such an event would have to be ridiculously small (one in ten billion trillion). Therefore, he concludes, we are not the first such civilization. I’m unconvinced by this argument. Just because a probability is vanishingly small doesn’t mean it actually vanishes. There is a lot of interesting information here, about stars and planets and the search for planets around distant stars. For me, though, he goes a step too far in the conclusions he draws. The evidence we need to get there is just not available yet."
163,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3512830-elmwoodblues,3,"Adam Frank himself makes clear that the subtitle of his book, 'Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth', could read '...and the Fate of Humanity.' Our earth is a pretty big place, and it didn't always look like it does now, what with the lava and the no oxygen and all. So, like Venus or Mars or (Carl Sagan voice here:) billions and billions of other worlds, when the water all floats away or the greenhouse effects take hold, whatever big round rock this happens to will be mostly okay. It is just the, you know, living stuff, that will have the bad day.It is a little frustrating to know that we all agree on how a greenhouse works out in a field, trapping solar radiation in the form of heat; Harbor Freight sells small ones for $300, near the $6 car-window shades. We all know that no use of energy is 100% efficient, so waste is produced with ANY work done; there are no free lunches in the universe. (Wind power? ""...extracting energy from wind power on a scale massive enough to power our current civilization would leave a global imprint akin to mild global warning."" Page 191. Sorry)So, why 'denial'? Because 'causes' is the big bugaboo, and we need to blame something? It's not the 'how' of using energy, it's the amount, the scale of it, the inevitability of it. It's thermodynamics, and thermodynamics are a bitch. Ask Venus."

The author does a good job of bringing together numerous different interrelated theories in terms of planetary feedback loops, systems and climate to make probabilistic claims on the likely number of planets that exist in the universe that are within the habitable zone and thus able to sustain life. The probabilities continue to look at just how many of those planets are likely to see the development of intelligent life and civilisation building life, like our own of earth. Unsurprisingly, the odds diminish at each stage, but even with the most pessimistic of predictions from the biggest doubters in the scientific community, we are still talking about a healthy number of planets that have or may host civilisation building life throughout all space and time.It’s a fascinating book well worth a read for anyone who loves science."

The focus of this book is on Fermi's Paradox, which states that with the near infinite number of opportunities in the universe for intelligent life to form, why is there no concrete evidence of any intelligent life other than ourselves? Are we really alone in the universe?It turns out that with the recent discoveries of numerous exoplanets, there can now be little doubt that life, and even intelligent life has sprung up elsewhere, outside of our solar system. What is still much in doubt, however, is how long those civilizations have lasted. There is currently great concern that our own technological civilization may be very short-lived. Is rapid development followed by rapid decline the norm for technological, energy-intensive civilizations like ours?There were some very good insights that this book brought up, but in the end I was still left with skepticism that, because of the great distances involved and the short-sighted direction our civilization seems to be taking, our species will never learn much about the true answers to these questions."
166,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,5,"This book is about our growing knowledge of exoplanets, and what the emerging science of astrobiology can teach us about the fate of our own planet. Yup, it’s a pretty heavy subject, but the science is not difficult, and is facilely explained by Adam Frank. He uses as his central principle the famous Drake Equation, which estimates the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence. With at least 1200 confirmed exoplanets, and thousands more sure to lurk in data captured by the Kepler space telescope but not yet analyzed, we have quite a bit of data to start filling in the variables in the Equation. Further, Frank looks back at two planets we know very well (Venus and Mars) to explain why they DON’T currently host life. The famed astronomer Carl Sagan appears in several threads of this story, both as an early enthusiast in SETI and as a member of the team which created the term “nuclear winter” (evidence for which comes from the history of Mars). The point of the book is basically to help us understand climate change on Earth, but the science it uses to get there is broad and endlessly fascinating. If you are in any way interested in any planetary science, this is a must-read.Grade: A"
167,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Over the years, many works of fiction have discussed the possibility of other worlds. In the 1950s, a group of prominent scientists sat down to lunch, and Enrico Fermi asked an important question; ""Where is everyone?""Here is a little backstory; we had known for some time that other stars might also harbor planets capable of supporting life. If we only look at the Milky Way Galaxy, we are looking at a cosmic neighborhood of approximately four hundred billion stars. So finally, a scientist sat down and wrote out a simple equation. It isn't necessarily a law of nature like Einstein's Equations. That scientist was named Frank Drake, and Drake's Equation became famous.Drake's Equation is easy to understand. It has seven parts. First, you figure out the birthrate of stars. Second, you multiply the number by the fraction of stars with planets. Third, you figure out which planets are in a habitable zone. Fourth, you figure out which planets develop life. Fifth, you figure out whether or not it has intelligence. Sixth, you figure out if they have the technology required to receive and send radio signals. Finally, you have to figure out the average lifetime of a technologically advanced civilization.The book is fascinating. I enjoyed it a lot."
168,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"The subtitle, preface, and marketing materials seem to indicate that this is about what astrobiology will reveal about climate change. Except that turns out to be almost backwards; there are indeed chapters setting up planetary science and the Drake equation about the likelihood of detectable life elsewhere in the galaxy, but then abruptly turns to computational models of ecology with very limited extraterrestrial input (except maybe a slight assist from Venus and Mars) to compute how likely civilization is to destroy itself. The doesn't seem to really know how Idea A is supposed to relate to Idea B, only that it thinks both ideas are interesting.It was mostly absorbing enough, although Frank's presentations were sometimes baffling -- his example ecological model was about ""bunnies,"" and although I'm pretty sure a professor of astronomy at the University of Rochester understands statistics, he handled them so cavalierly that a lot of his inferences seemed flat-out wrong as stated. But don't go in thinking that there's going to be a clear central thesis."

Though there was some great information on scientists and research I wasn't familiar with, this ended up being a very long persuasive piece about global warming/climate change. Now I completely believe humans are causing a potentially devastating change to our planet through the reckless use of fossil fuels, refusing to invest in renewable energy sources, and the clear-cutting of vast areas of the globe. I was clearly not the audience for this book. And I felt like I had been hoodwinked into reading this because I thought this would be a book about something else.Mainly aliens. I thought it'd be about aliens. And like 20 pages were. Sorta. :/ It's a well-written book and I recommend it to people who want to read about climate change. But if you came to it for aliens, you'll be disappointed. "

Light of the Stars is a popular account of the current understanding of the evolution of planets, ours and others throughout the universe. Frank addresses climate change by saying that science tells us we are changing our climate, but we should not feel guilty about it. Developing civilizations are part of the planet and do impact the development of the planet. We will not destroy the planet. It is not a question of whether or not the earth will survive, but rather whether or not humans will survive. If you are looking for details of the physics behind Frank's arguments, you will be disappointed. There is only one equation in the book and it is well explained. If you are not up to date on current scientific understanding of our planet and its possible future, Frank provides an easily read book to fill that gap."

It seems to me that while there are a lot of important questions to ask about the long-term future of humans on this planet, and maybe more generally technological civilizations on any planet, a better integration of ecological and evolutionary concepts is currently a missing ingredient. I would guess that this bias stems from the fields that astrobiology emerged from, and the generally short timescales ecologists tend to limit themselves to. This book would certainly support the idea that we need to think on big scales - as well as smaller scales - to better understand the magnitude and nature of our changing world in the context of the larger universe."

That's not to say its not good, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting, and that made it really drag for me. I had originally thought this book was solely focused on the possibilities of aliens, and inhabited planets. That is certainly part of the story, but in reality, this book is about what other planets can teach us about our own experiences on Earth, primarily climate change and how to respond to it, or the risks it might present. Whilst a valuable endeavour, coming off the back of 'The Glad Shout', and given what I thought the content was to be, I really not enthused for the topic. Nonetheless, Frank's book is a compelling argument for human created climate change, and how planetary science can teach us how we need to respond to ensure we're still here in a thousand years. So, if you've got a friend who doesn't believe in climate change, might be a worthwhile read for them."

The author calculates the number of planets the are similar to Earth and concludes that it's overwhelmingly likely there's life out there. But, of course, this is a bad argument: a large number of Earth-like planets (without any information about the probabilities of life arising within those conditions) is not enough to know how likely life is... (If you don't know how many sides a die has, you can't conclude from (even a very large) number of tosses that it's likely to land on ""1"").

The first portion of the book really found me thinking a lot of the Carl Sagan’s Contact, because it’s essentially dealing with the early approaches of searching for other life in the universe (Including the records Sagan was heavily involved with getting on the Voyager space probes.) Once the book started to delve into theory and odds of there being other intelligent live in the universe and the odds of contact etc, I lost interest rather quickly. It’s not that the book is poorly written or researched, it’s solid, it was just not all that interesting to me. I’m more for hard science here and while some of that was mixed in, such as the use of the Hubble Telescope to find other planets, it just wasn’t enough. "
181,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35537079-andy,1,"This book doesn't deliver what it promises at all. I was very disappointed. It promises to tell us ""what the latest thinking on alien civilizations reveals about our own"", but in reality it just gives four or five simple points, none of which are based on even recent research. For instance, one whole chapter is dedicated to pointing out that Mars and Venus have had various climates over their history. Another chapter tells us that Earth has too. Each of these chapters could have been boiled down to single sentences. The rest of it is filler: ""dramatic"" retellings of astronomers making observations, biographies of scientists, etc.If you were hoping for a volume that reported the latest research on exoplanets, this is not it. I honestly don't think there's anything here that someone who just casually reads about this topic whenever it makes the news wouldn't know already."
182,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,This is an excellent book using the latest information about exo-planets and what they can tell us about our own planet’s health. The book examines the history of life on earth and of space exploration of the planets in our solar system and also the history of our search for other planets around other stars and what that can tell us about our own world. It also explores the search for other life in the universe and the possible meaning for humans. The bottom line that this book brings home is that climate change is real and people have caused it because people are the major life form on our planet. It’s no longer a matter of saving the planet but of saving ourselves. A reasoned and informative read.
183,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22093539-audra-falk,4,"After reading this book, I have a much bigger view of the universe. WOW.I also now have what is probably a more accurate perspective of our own tiny place within time and space--and a greater appreciation of the privileges and responsibilities we as humans have on this planet and at this time.For someone who struggled with physics and chemistry classes in school, I was happy to find that I was able to understand the vast majority of this book. This is a credit to the author's ability to speak to the layperson. Overall a great book for anyone who is interested in an overview of astrobiology or astrophysics-- or who is just curious about the great universe that surrounds us. "
184,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4865450-david-davy,5,"I've long thought that biggest obstacle to solving or dealing with climate change is that it occurs outside boundaries of normal, everyday perception. Light of the Stars attempts to address this by expanding the field of observation to planets other than our own, real and imagined, given the data at hand. We and all other life here are a natural result of the myriad changes that have already taken place across the entirety of the existence of the planet, and the odds that we are the first planet to have this outcome, of civilization, is virtually nil. The long term survival of our civilization depends on a better understanding of how planets work and of our place on them. "

The science did feel a bit light and overly dumbed down at times, but perhaps that is what the general public needs. But as a logical thought experiment, the message rings true - we are both not alone in the universe but there is no backup to Earth. What are we going to do about it? I feel like this should be high school required reading."

188,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12275862-sigurgeir,3,"I did want to give this book a higher rating since I did like it. It is full of good information, it's fun to read and quite frankly I really enjoyed it. The reason I can't give it a higher rating though is that I'm not quite sure who it's for. It seems to be for those who already accept the science of climate change and just want a little more information. But at the same time the author does say that the intention of the book is to change the narrative of climate change to something where we humans are not the villains of the story but rather the protagonists facing a challenge.I do like all this but I would say that in either case, but for one the information probably could be a lot more and a lot deeper. I mean, as someone who did pick up the book looking for information and I did get some of it. But I couldn't help but feel that there could have been a hell of a lot more. Quite honestly, with that in mind when picking up the book, I really would have liked it to be a hell of a lot thicker and more detailed. I got interested in it after hearing an interview with the author on the podcast Probably Science, an excellent podcast which I recommend to everyone, and it seemed that the hour and 20 minute interview pretty much covered the entire book. I was really hoping that the book itself would give me extra information but it really didn't feel like it. I suspect that the author wanted to appeal to as a wide variety of readers as possible, but I really could have done with more. I suppose I'll have to give other works reading.Along with that I felt that the author could have been more convincing as well. As I said, the book seems to be geared to those who already accept the science of climate change. That in on itself is perfectly fine. But the tone of the book comes off as if he also already expects us to simply accept what he wants to do, that is change the narrative around climate change. It feels like he's simply preaching to the choir. Now, personally I do think he is correct, another part of why I like this book, but when I am reading a work that does centre around making an argument. Whether it is for changing a narrative, making a philosophical argument or trying to make an argument for a stance, I really want the author to not only to state his facts but to make his case as if he wants to convince me. I do feel like I am being overly critical here, but I must say that if I didn't already accept the science of climate change and think that the author was correct after the very interesting and fun interview on Probably Science, I don't think I would have been convinced whatsoever. Even if I would already have accepted climate change but still be sceptical about the authors version of the narrative, I don't think that the author would have convinced me of it.Continuing that thought into thirdly, I really would have thought that the author would have wanted to convince as many as he could and reach the widest base. But since he seems to focus on those who already accept climate change and since, in my opinion, his arguments kinda feel like he already expects you to agree with him, I really don't feel like he's reaching as wide a base as he could.Now I'm not saying that he needed to do all three of these. But I would have liked to see at least something of this done better. I would have given this book full five stars if it either had been thicker and more informative, a bit more convincing, again I'm saying that as someone who already thinks the author is correct, or if he had not quite sounded as if he was simply preaching to the little choir that already. That said, I still highly enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about climate change and some of the history around it. "
189,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465139-leftjab,4,"This would actually be a 3.5. I’m really interested in astrobiology and Frank’s writing here makes me feel like I’ve grasped it. I was reading this as a follow up to Asimov’s Extraterrestrial Civilizations. Not quite sure if this really was what I was wanting – felt that some of the science involved was glossed over for Frank to illustrate why his approach to extraterrestrial life he would consider optimistic while many of the nay-sayers would be pessimistic. I gotta be honest, I don’t see what the big deal about the Drake Equation is. It just sounds like math that has no hope of being proved until there’s contact with some other advanced civilization and while Frank yes is optimistic that there must be other life of some sort in the universe because of the sheer number of stars and the possibility of planets around them – I’m not disputing that at all. It’s just that the conclusion of the equation is arbitrary. Beyond knowing that there are literally billions of planets the math would lead one to think that yes, there is a strong possibility for life on one of the planets. Any speculation about what that alien life could be like – to remove it from science fiction and place it closer to reality (to put it one way) – can only be postulated based on our extremely limited explorations of our solar system. So yeah, we have a good grasp on Mars and Venus, but beyond that, even exploring moons and planets within our solar system is so difficult and dangerous that getting into exoplanets is really vague at best.I’m not going to take away from Frank’s presentation of the information out there – I read the book quickly and actually made some notes of some of his sources to explore these concepts deeper in the future. And of course, the book possesses more sad resignation about the state of Earth and climate change. I liked Frank’s approach that a global civilization is going to affect the planet by nature of its being. I think that is a good approach to take – of course, I can’t stomach climate deniers and I don’t think they would even open a book like Light of the Stars to convince them that their “gut instincts” are incorrect.Why I bump the 3.5 to 4 though, is personal – as Frank speaks my language in the concluding chapter of the book, and summed up my shared belief about not that climate change is occurring, but how we as participating members of the global community should start to see ourselves and how that self-awareness (based in the scientific process but then could be utilized philosophically and ideologically – not to mention how there could be a religious aspect to self-analysis – I don’t see how religion and science cannot co-exist and getting past this political bullshit would be extremely helpful in trying to survive the next decade) should be utilized in terms of how people can attempt to tackle climate change – i.e. as a world instead of as individual nations:“Gaining the astrobiological perspective is the first, essential step in our maturation and our ability to face the Anthropocene. It means recognizing that we and our project of civilization are nothing more than the fruit of Earth’s ongoing evolutionary experiments. Any civilization on any planet will be nothing more than an expression of its home world’s creativity. We are no different from those we would call ‘alien.’”Well said. Nigel Kneale would agree."
190,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901146-arvind,4,"I picked up Light of the Stars after watching Frank animatedly discuss possibilities of alien life and world girdling civilizations with Joe Rogan. What caught my attention then, and part of what I think makes his book worth reading, is Frank‘s almost contrarian framing of global warming. For sure it’s happening, but the popular narrative about saving the planet and the polar bears isn’t compatible with life’s long history on Earth. Frank asserts that we, humanity, are the ones that need saving. Earth and life have co-evolved for billions of years and will for many more, with or without us.Light of the Stars takes an exogenous view of the way Earth, life (read humanity), and the climate interact. While describing how Earth’s climate and life have co-evolved over eons, Frank tells the story of how observations of Mars and Venus, for instance, have lead to greater understanding of climate processes here on Earth, and even influenced international politics. Later he takes the ultimate frequentist approach, based recent exoplanet discoveries, and poses Earth and our civilization as one of many in the galaxy and universe. He even uses the word 'experiment' to describe us and these other conjectured civilizations. Borrowing probably from Kardashev and others he assumes, modulo specific histories, anatomy, etc., all civilizations go through an Anthropocene type phase. Over the whole distribution of planets with civilizations, some master the transition and their planets, and some die off. It’s a powerful idea; and he, and coworkers, even made crude models of ""parametrized"" civilizations, seeded them with varying initial conditions, and analyzed the survival outcomes of the civilizations. The whole approach is pretty cool.Woven throughout is a story about the search and speculation about extraterrestrial life, and it’s interesting on its own. Frank really pays homage to Sagan, Tarter, Kardashev, and many other scientists that thought seriously about extraterritorial life. Before reading the book I had the same opinion of the Drake equation as Colonel Janus from the Expanse: „That’s not a equation. It’s a big fat guess.“. But the Drake equation really helped guide the search for extraterrestrial life. Along the same lines, Frank proposes his own equation, updated based on recent exoplanet discoveries.Overall, Light of the Stars is an interesting, light, nontechnical read, with a unique framing of climate change and our place in the universe."
191,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7649288-matt-ward,2,"One of the greatest things about popular science as a genre is how it can take topics that are somewhat dry and boring and bring life to it. We get to feel what's so cool about the topic that excited the scientists to work on it (The Elegant Universe, The Shape of Inner Space, The Selfish Gene, and Fermat's Last Theorem come to mind). Adam Frank is clearly fascinated by this stuff, but he doesn't spend enough time motivating it to get an uninterested person interested. The second chapter is basically a dry list of what makes up the environment on various planets and a recounting of probes that went there and a tedious history of the discoveries. It's only at the end of the chapter that it becomes clear why any of this is being discussed (namely, that climate models have been tested outside of Earth). That motivation needs to come at the beginning.It's not clear what niche this book is trying to serve. Most people with enough interest to pick this book up will already be familiar with the Drake equation and Fermi paradox. He doesn't even discuss the most interesting aspect of it (namely, the reason its a paradox).The end of the book gets better, but so many other books have covered similar ground in more detail and more interesting ways (see Jared Diamond's Collapse). So, I again wonder what niche the book is attempting to fill. Sorry to be such a downer. I heard a pretty interesting interview with him that turned me on to the book. I'd love to sit down and pick his brain over lunch. I'm not that interested in reading another of his books."
192,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43813529-celia-reaves,3,"Frank is a scientist with solid credentials and a strong reputation. In this book he tries something that’s probably impossible to pull off, so it’s not surprising I found it underwhelming. He is trying to use what we know about how stars, planets, biospheres, and civilizations evolve to draw conclusions about two separate things: whether there are or ever have been alien civilizations on other planets, and whether our civilization will survive the climate crisis we are now facing. He has good science about how stars develop. He pulls together information from geology and the study of planets in our solar system to support a strong argument about the development of planets. When he starts to draw conclusions about the evolution of large and complex biological organisms, and then about intelligence and technological civilizations, though, he loses me. I don’t see any way to extrapolate meaningfully from a sample of one. He does the math to show that in order for us to be the only technological civilization ever in our galaxy, the probability for such an event would have to be ridiculously small (one in ten billion trillion). Therefore, he concludes, we are not the first such civilization. I’m unconvinced by this argument. Just because a probability is vanishingly small doesn’t mean it actually vanishes. There is a lot of interesting information here, about stars and planets and the search for planets around distant stars. For me, though, he goes a step too far in the conclusions he draws. The evidence we need to get there is just not available yet."
193,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3512830-elmwoodblues,3,"Adam Frank himself makes clear that the subtitle of his book, 'Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth', could read '...and the Fate of Humanity.' Our earth is a pretty big place, and it didn't always look like it does now, what with the lava and the no oxygen and all. So, like Venus or Mars or (Carl Sagan voice here:) billions and billions of other worlds, when the water all floats away or the greenhouse effects take hold, whatever big round rock this happens to will be mostly okay. It is just the, you know, living stuff, that will have the bad day.It is a little frustrating to know that we all agree on how a greenhouse works out in a field, trapping solar radiation in the form of heat; Harbor Freight sells small ones for $300, near the $6 car-window shades. We all know that no use of energy is 100% efficient, so waste is produced with ANY work done; there are no free lunches in the universe. (Wind power? ""...extracting energy from wind power on a scale massive enough to power our current civilization would leave a global imprint akin to mild global warning."" Page 191. Sorry)So, why 'denial'? Because 'causes' is the big bugaboo, and we need to blame something? It's not the 'how' of using energy, it's the amount, the scale of it, the inevitability of it. It's thermodynamics, and thermodynamics are a bitch. Ask Venus."

The author does a good job of bringing together numerous different interrelated theories in terms of planetary feedback loops, systems and climate to make probabilistic claims on the likely number of planets that exist in the universe that are within the habitable zone and thus able to sustain life. The probabilities continue to look at just how many of those planets are likely to see the development of intelligent life and civilisation building life, like our own of earth. Unsurprisingly, the odds diminish at each stage, but even with the most pessimistic of predictions from the biggest doubters in the scientific community, we are still talking about a healthy number of planets that have or may host civilisation building life throughout all space and time.It’s a fascinating book well worth a read for anyone who loves science."

The focus of this book is on Fermi's Paradox, which states that with the near infinite number of opportunities in the universe for intelligent life to form, why is there no concrete evidence of any intelligent life other than ourselves? Are we really alone in the universe?It turns out that with the recent discoveries of numerous exoplanets, there can now be little doubt that life, and even intelligent life has sprung up elsewhere, outside of our solar system. What is still much in doubt, however, is how long those civilizations have lasted. There is currently great concern that our own technological civilization may be very short-lived. Is rapid development followed by rapid decline the norm for technological, energy-intensive civilizations like ours?There were some very good insights that this book brought up, but in the end I was still left with skepticism that, because of the great distances involved and the short-sighted direction our civilization seems to be taking, our species will never learn much about the true answers to these questions."

Yup, it’s a pretty heavy subject, but the science is not difficult, and is facilely explained by Adam Frank. He uses as his central principle the famous Drake Equation, which estimates the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence. With at least 1200 confirmed exoplanets, and thousands more sure to lurk in data captured by the Kepler space telescope but not yet analyzed, we have quite a bit of data to start filling in the variables in the Equation. Further, Frank looks back at two planets we know very well (Venus and Mars) to explain why they DON’T currently host life. The famed astronomer Carl Sagan appears in several threads of this story, both as an early enthusiast in SETI and as a member of the team which created the term “nuclear winter” (evidence for which comes from the history of Mars). The point of the book is basically to help us understand climate change on Earth, but the science it uses to get there is broad and endlessly fascinating. If you are in any way interested in any planetary science, this is a must-read.Grade: A"
197,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Over the years, many works of fiction have discussed the possibility of other worlds. In the 1950s, a group of prominent scientists sat down to lunch, and Enrico Fermi asked an important question; ""Where is everyone?""Here is a little backstory; we had known for some time that other stars might also harbor planets capable of supporting life. If we only look at the Milky Way Galaxy, we are looking at a cosmic neighborhood of approximately four hundred billion stars. So finally, a scientist sat down and wrote out a simple equation. It isn't necessarily a law of nature like Einstein's Equations. That scientist was named Frank Drake, and Drake's Equation became famous.Drake's Equation is easy to understand. It has seven parts. First, you figure out the birthrate of stars. Second, you multiply the number by the fraction of stars with planets. Third, you figure out which planets are in a habitable zone. Fourth, you figure out which planets develop life. Fifth, you figure out whether or not it has intelligence. Sixth, you figure out if they have the technology required to receive and send radio signals. Finally, you have to figure out the average lifetime of a technologically advanced civilization.The book is fascinating. I enjoyed it a lot."

Except that turns out to be almost backwards; there are indeed chapters setting up planetary science and the Drake equation about the likelihood of detectable life elsewhere in the galaxy, but then abruptly turns to computational models of ecology with very limited extraterrestrial input (except maybe a slight assist from Venus and Mars) to compute how likely civilization is to destroy itself. The doesn't seem to really know how Idea A is supposed to relate to Idea B, only that it thinks both ideas are interesting.It was mostly absorbing enough, although Frank's presentations were sometimes baffling -- his example ecological model was about ""bunnies,"" and although I'm pretty sure a professor of astronomy at the University of Rochester understands statistics, he handled them so cavalierly that a lot of his inferences seemed flat-out wrong as stated.

Though there was some great information on scientists and research I wasn't familiar with, this ended up being a very long persuasive piece about global warming/climate change. Now I completely believe humans are causing a potentially devastating change to our planet through the reckless use of fossil fuels, refusing to invest in renewable energy sources, and the clear-cutting of vast areas of the globe. I was clearly not the audience for this book. And I felt like I had been hoodwinked into reading this because I thought this would be a book about something else.Mainly aliens. I thought it'd be about aliens. And like 20 pages were. Sorta. :/ It's a well-written book and I recommend it to people who want to read about climate change.

Light of the Stars is a popular account of the current understanding of the evolution of planets, ours and others throughout the universe. Frank addresses climate change by saying that science tells us we are changing our climate, but we should not feel guilty about it. Developing civilizations are part of the planet and do impact the development of the planet. We will not destroy the planet. It is not a question of whether or not the earth will survive, but rather whether or not humans will survive. If you are looking for details of the physics behind Frank's arguments, you will be disappointed. There is only one equation in the book and it is well explained. If you are not up to date on current scientific understanding of our planet and its possible future, Frank provides an easily read book to fill that gap."

It seems to me that while there are a lot of important questions to ask about the long-term future of humans on this planet, and maybe more generally technological civilizations on any planet, a better integration of ecological and evolutionary concepts is currently a missing ingredient. I would guess that this bias stems from the fields that astrobiology emerged from, and the generally short timescales ecologists tend to limit themselves to. This book would certainly support the idea that we need to think on big scales - as well as smaller scales - to better understand the magnitude and nature of our changing world in the context of the larger universe."

That's not to say its not good, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting, and that made it really drag for me. I had originally thought this book was solely focused on the possibilities of aliens, and inhabited planets. That is certainly part of the story, but in reality, this book is about what other planets can teach us about our own experiences on Earth, primarily climate change and how to respond to it, or the risks it might present. Whilst a valuable endeavour, coming off the back of 'The Glad Shout', and given what I thought the content was to be, I really not enthused for the topic. Nonetheless, Frank's book is a compelling argument for human created climate change, and how planetary science can teach us how we need to respond to ensure we're still here in a thousand years. So, if you've got a friend who doesn't believe in climate change, might be a worthwhile read for them."

The author calculates the number of planets the are similar to Earth and concludes that it's overwhelmingly likely there's life out there. But, of course, this is a bad argument: a large number of Earth-like planets (without any information about the probabilities of life arising within those conditions) is not enough to know how likely life is... (If you don't know how many sides a die has, you can't conclude from (even a very large) number of tosses that it's likely to land on ""1"").

The author's premise is that each of these civilizations must have found the ways, and the determination, to overcome the problem which threatens our civilization -- global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. It's a great idea for a book. I just didn't enjoy this particular one. Parts of it were really interesting, and the concept itself is a novel approach to the problem of man-made climate change, but there were too many parts in this book that were just too dry, and I had to struggle to finish it."

As a reader who has a deep interest in the topic but is being introduced to some of the principle concepts, this was very helpful. Along those lines, this is a fantastic book for people who have a base understanding or are being introduced to topics such as Fermi's paradox, Carl Sagan's work, and the SETI program. For those reader who are already well versed, this book may seem something of a review. Frank's research into the how exo-civilizations survive their experience with climate change is fascinating. "
210,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,3,"This one started off very interesting and sort of petered out over the second half of the book. I think I mostly found the hard actual science in the beginning to the speculative and future possible science of the later portions of the book. The first portion of the book really found me thinking a lot of the Carl Sagan’s Contact, because it’s essentially dealing with the early approaches of searching for other life in the universe (Including the records Sagan was heavily involved with getting on the Voyager space probes.) Once the book started to delve into theory and odds of there being other intelligent live in the universe and the odds of contact etc, I lost interest rather quickly. It’s not that the book is poorly written or researched, it’s solid, it was just not all that interesting to me. I’m more for hard science here and while some of that was mixed in, such as the use of the Hubble Telescope to find other planets, it just wasn’t enough. "
211,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35537079-andy,1,"This book doesn't deliver what it promises at all. I was very disappointed. It promises to tell us ""what the latest thinking on alien civilizations reveals about our own"", but in reality it just gives four or five simple points, none of which are based on even recent research. For instance, one whole chapter is dedicated to pointing out that Mars and Venus have had various climates over their history. Another chapter tells us that Earth has too. Each of these chapters could have been boiled down to single sentences. The rest of it is filler: ""dramatic"" retellings of astronomers making observations, biographies of scientists, etc.If you were hoping for a volume that reported the latest research on exoplanets, this is not it. I honestly don't think there's anything here that someone who just casually reads about this topic whenever it makes the news wouldn't know already."

The book examines the history of life on earth and of space exploration of the planets in our solar system and also the history of our search for other planets around other stars and what that can tell us about our own world. It also explores the search for other life in the universe and the possible meaning for humans. The bottom line that this book brings home is that climate change is real and people have caused it because people are the major life form on our planet. It’s no longer a matter of saving the planet but of saving ourselves. A reasoned and informative read.

WOW.I also now have what is probably a more accurate perspective of our own tiny place within time and space--and a greater appreciation of the privileges and responsibilities we as humans have on this planet and at this time.For someone who struggled with physics and chemistry classes in school, I was happy to find that I was able to understand the vast majority of this book. This is a credit to the author's ability to speak to the layperson. Overall a great book for anyone who is interested in an overview of astrobiology or astrophysics-- or who is just curious about the great universe that surrounds us. "

Light of the Stars attempts to address this by expanding the field of observation to planets other than our own, real and imagined, given the data at hand. We and all other life here are a natural result of the myriad changes that have already taken place across the entirety of the existence of the planet, and the odds that we are the first planet to have this outcome, of civilization, is virtually nil. The long term survival of our civilization depends on a better understanding of how planets work and of our place on them. "

218,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12275862-sigurgeir,3,"I did want to give this book a higher rating since I did like it. It is full of good information, it's fun to read and quite frankly I really enjoyed it. The reason I can't give it a higher rating though is that I'm not quite sure who it's for. It seems to be for those who already accept the science of climate change and just want a little more information. But at the same time the author does say that the intention of the book is to change the narrative of climate change to something where we humans are not the villains of the story but rather the protagonists facing a challenge.I do like all this but I would say that in either case, but for one the information probably could be a lot more and a lot deeper. I mean, as someone who did pick up the book looking for information and I did get some of it. But I couldn't help but feel that there could have been a hell of a lot more. Quite honestly, with that in mind when picking up the book, I really would have liked it to be a hell of a lot thicker and more detailed. I got interested in it after hearing an interview with the author on the podcast Probably Science, an excellent podcast which I recommend to everyone, and it seemed that the hour and 20 minute interview pretty much covered the entire book. I was really hoping that the book itself would give me extra information but it really didn't feel like it. I suspect that the author wanted to appeal to as a wide variety of readers as possible, but I really could have done with more. I suppose I'll have to give other works reading.Along with that I felt that the author could have been more convincing as well. As I said, the book seems to be geared to those who already accept the science of climate change. That in on itself is perfectly fine. But the tone of the book comes off as if he also already expects us to simply accept what he wants to do, that is change the narrative around climate change. It feels like he's simply preaching to the choir. Now, personally I do think he is correct, another part of why I like this book, but when I am reading a work that does centre around making an argument. Whether it is for changing a narrative, making a philosophical argument or trying to make an argument for a stance, I really want the author to not only to state his facts but to make his case as if he wants to convince me. I do feel like I am being overly critical here, but I must say that if I didn't already accept the science of climate change and think that the author was correct after the very interesting and fun interview on Probably Science, I don't think I would have been convinced whatsoever. Even if I would already have accepted climate change but still be sceptical about the authors version of the narrative, I don't think that the author would have convinced me of it.Continuing that thought into thirdly, I really would have thought that the author would have wanted to convince as many as he could and reach the widest base. But since he seems to focus on those who already accept climate change and since, in my opinion, his arguments kinda feel like he already expects you to agree with him, I really don't feel like he's reaching as wide a base as he could.Now I'm not saying that he needed to do all three of these. But I would have liked to see at least something of this done better. I would have given this book full five stars if it either had been thicker and more informative, a bit more convincing, again I'm saying that as someone who already thinks the author is correct, or if he had not quite sounded as if he was simply preaching to the little choir that already. That said, I still highly enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about climate change and some of the history around it. "
219,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465139-leftjab,4,"This would actually be a 3.5. I’m really interested in astrobiology and Frank’s writing here makes me feel like I’ve grasped it. I was reading this as a follow up to Asimov’s Extraterrestrial Civilizations. Not quite sure if this really was what I was wanting – felt that some of the science involved was glossed over for Frank to illustrate why his approach to extraterrestrial life he would consider optimistic while many of the nay-sayers would be pessimistic. I gotta be honest, I don’t see what the big deal about the Drake Equation is. It just sounds like math that has no hope of being proved until there’s contact with some other advanced civilization and while Frank yes is optimistic that there must be other life of some sort in the universe because of the sheer number of stars and the possibility of planets around them – I’m not disputing that at all. It’s just that the conclusion of the equation is arbitrary. Beyond knowing that there are literally billions of planets the math would lead one to think that yes, there is a strong possibility for life on one of the planets. Any speculation about what that alien life could be like – to remove it from science fiction and place it closer to reality (to put it one way) – can only be postulated based on our extremely limited explorations of our solar system. So yeah, we have a good grasp on Mars and Venus, but beyond that, even exploring moons and planets within our solar system is so difficult and dangerous that getting into exoplanets is really vague at best.I’m not going to take away from Frank’s presentation of the information out there – I read the book quickly and actually made some notes of some of his sources to explore these concepts deeper in the future. And of course, the book possesses more sad resignation about the state of Earth and climate change. I liked Frank’s approach that a global civilization is going to affect the planet by nature of its being. I think that is a good approach to take – of course, I can’t stomach climate deniers and I don’t think they would even open a book like Light of the Stars to convince them that their “gut instincts” are incorrect.Why I bump the 3.5 to 4 though, is personal – as Frank speaks my language in the concluding chapter of the book, and summed up my shared belief about not that climate change is occurring, but how we as participating members of the global community should start to see ourselves and how that self-awareness (based in the scientific process but then could be utilized philosophically and ideologically – not to mention how there could be a religious aspect to self-analysis – I don’t see how religion and science cannot co-exist and getting past this political bullshit would be extremely helpful in trying to survive the next decade) should be utilized in terms of how people can attempt to tackle climate change – i.e. as a world instead of as individual nations:“Gaining the astrobiological perspective is the first, essential step in our maturation and our ability to face the Anthropocene. It means recognizing that we and our project of civilization are nothing more than the fruit of Earth’s ongoing evolutionary experiments. Any civilization on any planet will be nothing more than an expression of its home world’s creativity. We are no different from those we would call ‘alien.’”Well said. Nigel Kneale would agree."
220,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901146-arvind,4,"I picked up Light of the Stars after watching Frank animatedly discuss possibilities of alien life and world girdling civilizations with Joe Rogan. What caught my attention then, and part of what I think makes his book worth reading, is Frank‘s almost contrarian framing of global warming. For sure it’s happening, but the popular narrative about saving the planet and the polar bears isn’t compatible with life’s long history on Earth. Frank asserts that we, humanity, are the ones that need saving. Earth and life have co-evolved for billions of years and will for many more, with or without us.Light of the Stars takes an exogenous view of the way Earth, life (read humanity), and the climate interact. While describing how Earth’s climate and life have co-evolved over eons, Frank tells the story of how observations of Mars and Venus, for instance, have lead to greater understanding of climate processes here on Earth, and even influenced international politics. Later he takes the ultimate frequentist approach, based recent exoplanet discoveries, and poses Earth and our civilization as one of many in the galaxy and universe. He even uses the word 'experiment' to describe us and these other conjectured civilizations. Borrowing probably from Kardashev and others he assumes, modulo specific histories, anatomy, etc., all civilizations go through an Anthropocene type phase. Over the whole distribution of planets with civilizations, some master the transition and their planets, and some die off. It’s a powerful idea; and he, and coworkers, even made crude models of ""parametrized"" civilizations, seeded them with varying initial conditions, and analyzed the survival outcomes of the civilizations. The whole approach is pretty cool.Woven throughout is a story about the search and speculation about extraterrestrial life, and it’s interesting on its own. Frank really pays homage to Sagan, Tarter, Kardashev, and many other scientists that thought seriously about extraterritorial life. Before reading the book I had the same opinion of the Drake equation as Colonel Janus from the Expanse: „That’s not a equation. It’s a big fat guess.“. But the Drake equation really helped guide the search for extraterrestrial life. Along the same lines, Frank proposes his own equation, updated based on recent exoplanet discoveries.Overall, Light of the Stars is an interesting, light, nontechnical read, with a unique framing of climate change and our place in the universe."
221,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7649288-matt-ward,2,"One of the greatest things about popular science as a genre is how it can take topics that are somewhat dry and boring and bring life to it. We get to feel what's so cool about the topic that excited the scientists to work on it (The Elegant Universe, The Shape of Inner Space, The Selfish Gene, and Fermat's Last Theorem come to mind). Adam Frank is clearly fascinated by this stuff, but he doesn't spend enough time motivating it to get an uninterested person interested. The second chapter is basically a dry list of what makes up the environment on various planets and a recounting of probes that went there and a tedious history of the discoveries. It's only at the end of the chapter that it becomes clear why any of this is being discussed (namely, that climate models have been tested outside of Earth). That motivation needs to come at the beginning.It's not clear what niche this book is trying to serve. Most people with enough interest to pick this book up will already be familiar with the Drake equation and Fermi paradox. He doesn't even discuss the most interesting aspect of it (namely, the reason its a paradox).The end of the book gets better, but so many other books have covered similar ground in more detail and more interesting ways (see Jared Diamond's Collapse). So, I again wonder what niche the book is attempting to fill. Sorry to be such a downer. I heard a pretty interesting interview with him that turned me on to the book. I'd love to sit down and pick his brain over lunch. I'm not that interested in reading another of his books."
222,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43813529-celia-reaves,3,"Frank is a scientist with solid credentials and a strong reputation. In this book he tries something that’s probably impossible to pull off, so it’s not surprising I found it underwhelming. He is trying to use what we know about how stars, planets, biospheres, and civilizations evolve to draw conclusions about two separate things: whether there are or ever have been alien civilizations on other planets, and whether our civilization will survive the climate crisis we are now facing. He has good science about how stars develop. He pulls together information from geology and the study of planets in our solar system to support a strong argument about the development of planets. When he starts to draw conclusions about the evolution of large and complex biological organisms, and then about intelligence and technological civilizations, though, he loses me. I don’t see any way to extrapolate meaningfully from a sample of one. He does the math to show that in order for us to be the only technological civilization ever in our galaxy, the probability for such an event would have to be ridiculously small (one in ten billion trillion). Therefore, he concludes, we are not the first such civilization. I’m unconvinced by this argument. Just because a probability is vanishingly small doesn’t mean it actually vanishes. There is a lot of interesting information here, about stars and planets and the search for planets around distant stars. For me, though, he goes a step too far in the conclusions he draws. The evidence we need to get there is just not available yet."

Our earth is a pretty big place, and it didn't always look like it does now, what with the lava and the no oxygen and all. So, like Venus or Mars or (Carl Sagan voice here:) billions and billions of other worlds, when the water all floats away or the greenhouse effects take hold, whatever big round rock this happens to will be mostly okay. It is just the, you know, living stuff, that will have the bad day.It is a little frustrating to know that we all agree on how a greenhouse works out in a field, trapping solar radiation in the form of heat; Harbor Freight sells small ones for $300, near the $6 car-window shades. We all know that no use of energy is 100% efficient, so waste is produced with ANY work done; there are no free lunches in the universe. (Wind power? ""...extracting energy from wind power on a scale massive enough to power our current civilization would leave a global imprint akin to mild global warning."" Page 191. Sorry)So, why 'denial'? Because 'causes' is the big bugaboo, and we need to blame something? It's not the 'how' of using energy, it's the amount, the scale of it, the inevitability of it. It's thermodynamics, and thermodynamics are a bitch. Ask Venus."

The author does a good job of bringing together numerous different interrelated theories in terms of planetary feedback loops, systems and climate to make probabilistic claims on the likely number of planets that exist in the universe that are within the habitable zone and thus able to sustain life. The probabilities continue to look at just how many of those planets are likely to see the development of intelligent life and civilisation building life, like our own of earth. Unsurprisingly, the odds diminish at each stage, but even with the most pessimistic of predictions from the biggest doubters in the scientific community, we are still talking about a healthy number of planets that have or may host civilisation building life throughout all space and time.It’s a fascinating book well worth a read for anyone who loves science."

The focus of this book is on Fermi's Paradox, which states that with the near infinite number of opportunities in the universe for intelligent life to form, why is there no concrete evidence of any intelligent life other than ourselves? Are we really alone in the universe?It turns out that with the recent discoveries of numerous exoplanets, there can now be little doubt that life, and even intelligent life has sprung up elsewhere, outside of our solar system. What is still much in doubt, however, is how long those civilizations have lasted. There is currently great concern that our own technological civilization may be very short-lived. Is rapid development followed by rapid decline the norm for technological, energy-intensive civilizations like ours?There were some very good insights that this book brought up, but in the end I was still left with skepticism that, because of the great distances involved and the short-sighted direction our civilization seems to be taking, our species will never learn much about the true answers to these questions."

Yup, it’s a pretty heavy subject, but the science is not difficult, and is facilely explained by Adam Frank. He uses as his central principle the famous Drake Equation, which estimates the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence. With at least 1200 confirmed exoplanets, and thousands more sure to lurk in data captured by the Kepler space telescope but not yet analyzed, we have quite a bit of data to start filling in the variables in the Equation. Further, Frank looks back at two planets we know very well (Venus and Mars) to explain why they DON’T currently host life. The famed astronomer Carl Sagan appears in several threads of this story, both as an early enthusiast in SETI and as a member of the team which created the term “nuclear winter” (evidence for which comes from the history of Mars). The point of the book is basically to help us understand climate change on Earth, but the science it uses to get there is broad and endlessly fascinating. If you are in any way interested in any planetary science, this is a must-read.Grade: A"

In the 1950s, a group of prominent scientists sat down to lunch, and Enrico Fermi asked an important question; ""Where is everyone?""Here is a little backstory; we had known for some time that other stars might also harbor planets capable of supporting life. If we only look at the Milky Way Galaxy, we are looking at a cosmic neighborhood of approximately four hundred billion stars. So finally, a scientist sat down and wrote out a simple equation. It isn't necessarily a law of nature like Einstein's Equations. That scientist was named Frank Drake, and Drake's Equation became famous.Drake's Equation is easy to understand. It has seven parts. First, you figure out the birthrate of stars. Second, you multiply the number by the fraction of stars with planets. Third, you figure out which planets are in a habitable zone. Fourth, you figure out which planets develop life. Fifth, you figure out whether or not it has intelligence. Sixth, you figure out if they have the technology required to receive and send radio signals. Finally, you have to figure out the average lifetime of a technologically advanced civilization.The book is fascinating. I enjoyed it a lot."

Except that turns out to be almost backwards; there are indeed chapters setting up planetary science and the Drake equation about the likelihood of detectable life elsewhere in the galaxy, but then abruptly turns to computational models of ecology with very limited extraterrestrial input (except maybe a slight assist from Venus and Mars) to compute how likely civilization is to destroy itself. The doesn't seem to really know how Idea A is supposed to relate to Idea B, only that it thinks both ideas are interesting.It was mostly absorbing enough, although Frank's presentations were sometimes baffling -- his example ecological model was about ""bunnies,"" and although I'm pretty sure a professor of astronomy at the University of Rochester understands statistics, he handled them so cavalierly that a lot of his inferences seemed flat-out wrong as stated.

Though there was some great information on scientists and research I wasn't familiar with, this ended up being a very long persuasive piece about global warming/climate change. Now I completely believe humans are causing a potentially devastating change to our planet through the reckless use of fossil fuels, refusing to invest in renewable energy sources, and the clear-cutting of vast areas of the globe. I was clearly not the audience for this book. And I felt like I had been hoodwinked into reading this because I thought this would be a book about something else.Mainly aliens. I thought it'd be about aliens. And like 20 pages were. Sorta. :/ It's a well-written book and I recommend it to people who want to read about climate change.

Developing civilizations are part of the planet and do impact the development of the planet. We will not destroy the planet. It is not a question of whether or not the earth will survive, but rather whether or not humans will survive. If you are looking for details of the physics behind Frank's arguments, you will be disappointed. There is only one equation in the book and it is well explained. If you are not up to date on current scientific understanding of our planet and its possible future, Frank provides an easily read book to fill that gap."

It seems to me that while there are a lot of important questions to ask about the long-term future of humans on this planet, and maybe more generally technological civilizations on any planet, a better integration of ecological and evolutionary concepts is currently a missing ingredient. I would guess that this bias stems from the fields that astrobiology emerged from, and the generally short timescales ecologists tend to limit themselves to. This book would certainly support the idea that we need to think on big scales - as well as smaller scales - to better understand the magnitude and nature of our changing world in the context of the larger universe."

That's not to say its not good, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting, and that made it really drag for me. I had originally thought this book was solely focused on the possibilities of aliens, and inhabited planets. That is certainly part of the story, but in reality, this book is about what other planets can teach us about our own experiences on Earth, primarily climate change and how to respond to it, or the risks it might present. Whilst a valuable endeavour, coming off the back of 'The Glad Shout', and given what I thought the content was to be, I really not enthused for the topic. Nonetheless, Frank's book is a compelling argument for human created climate change, and how planetary science can teach us how we need to respond to ensure we're still here in a thousand years.

But, of course, this is a bad argument: a large number of Earth-like planets (without any information about the probabilities of life arising within those conditions) is not enough to know how likely life is... (If you don't know how many sides a die has, you can't conclude from (even a very large) number of tosses that it's likely to land on ""1"").

It predicts the possibility of life on exo-planets far far away and within our solar system. How the climate of other planets predicts the future of our own planet is the main theme of this book. The introduction of the books says that, Astrobiology is the main content of the book. Still, we don't get any possible explanation of what could be biology on a distant planet with regards to their atmosphere. Quite disappointing to read the same staff in many non-fiction science book. If you read science books rarely, you may find it a good read. But for a general reader with an interest on specially these type of books, this particular book doesn't offer much new."

This dual theme is runs rampant throughout this book. Good writing supporting dubious science doesn't make for a good book - neither does mixing contempt for Republicans - of which I happen to be.Sadly, ZERO STARS to what should have been a good book ruined by Professor Frank's devotion to his totally unscientific dual cults.Not Recommended.

And stop denying the changes we've known about for a long time.Oh yeah... my one question that's never talked about when they talk about formulas for possible other civilizations... they never discuss the possibility of any of them going off world or finding another planet to use once theirs is all messed up or close to dying. If they get so advanced, shouldn't that be another possibility to help the pessimism line or whatever it was called?"

The author's premise is that each of these civilizations must have found the ways, and the determination, to overcome the problem which threatens our civilization -- global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. It's a great idea for a book. I just didn't enjoy this particular one. Parts of it were really interesting, and the concept itself is a novel approach to the problem of man-made climate change, but there were too many parts in this book that were just too dry, and I had to struggle to finish it."

As a reader who has a deep interest in the topic but is being introduced to some of the principle concepts, this was very helpful. Along those lines, this is a fantastic book for people who have a base understanding or are being introduced to topics such as Fermi's paradox, Carl Sagan's work, and the SETI program. For those reader who are already well versed, this book may seem something of a review. Frank's research into the how exo-civilizations survive their experience with climate change is fascinating. "
240,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,3,"This one started off very interesting and sort of petered out over the second half of the book. I think I mostly found the hard actual science in the beginning to the speculative and future possible science of the later portions of the book. The first portion of the book really found me thinking a lot of the Carl Sagan’s Contact, because it’s essentially dealing with the early approaches of searching for other life in the universe (Including the records Sagan was heavily involved with getting on the Voyager space probes.) Once the book started to delve into theory and odds of there being other intelligent live in the universe and the odds of contact etc, I lost interest rather quickly. It’s not that the book is poorly written or researched, it’s solid, it was just not all that interesting to me. I’m more for hard science here and while some of that was mixed in, such as the use of the Hubble Telescope to find other planets, it just wasn’t enough. "
241,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35537079-andy,1,"This book doesn't deliver what it promises at all. I was very disappointed. It promises to tell us ""what the latest thinking on alien civilizations reveals about our own"", but in reality it just gives four or five simple points, none of which are based on even recent research. For instance, one whole chapter is dedicated to pointing out that Mars and Venus have had various climates over their history. Another chapter tells us that Earth has too. Each of these chapters could have been boiled down to single sentences. The rest of it is filler: ""dramatic"" retellings of astronomers making observations, biographies of scientists, etc.If you were hoping for a volume that reported the latest research on exoplanets, this is not it. I honestly don't think there's anything here that someone who just casually reads about this topic whenever it makes the news wouldn't know already."
242,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,This is an excellent book using the latest information about exo-planets and what they can tell us about our own planet’s health. The book examines the history of life on earth and of space exploration of the planets in our solar system and also the history of our search for other planets around other stars and what that can tell us about our own world. It also explores the search for other life in the universe and the possible meaning for humans. The bottom line that this book brings home is that climate change is real and people have caused it because people are the major life form on our planet. It’s no longer a matter of saving the planet but of saving ourselves. A reasoned and informative read.
243,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22093539-audra-falk,4,"After reading this book, I have a much bigger view of the universe. WOW.I also now have what is probably a more accurate perspective of our own tiny place within time and space--and a greater appreciation of the privileges and responsibilities we as humans have on this planet and at this time.For someone who struggled with physics and chemistry classes in school, I was happy to find that I was able to understand the vast majority of this book. This is a credit to the author's ability to speak to the layperson. Overall a great book for anyone who is interested in an overview of astrobiology or astrophysics-- or who is just curious about the great universe that surrounds us. "
244,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4865450-david-davy,5,"I've long thought that biggest obstacle to solving or dealing with climate change is that it occurs outside boundaries of normal, everyday perception. Light of the Stars attempts to address this by expanding the field of observation to planets other than our own, real and imagined, given the data at hand. We and all other life here are a natural result of the myriad changes that have already taken place across the entirety of the existence of the planet, and the odds that we are the first planet to have this outcome, of civilization, is virtually nil. The long term survival of our civilization depends on a better understanding of how planets work and of our place on them. "

248,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12275862-sigurgeir,3,"I did want to give this book a higher rating since I did like it. It is full of good information, it's fun to read and quite frankly I really enjoyed it. The reason I can't give it a higher rating though is that I'm not quite sure who it's for. It seems to be for those who already accept the science of climate change and just want a little more information. But at the same time the author does say that the intention of the book is to change the narrative of climate change to something where we humans are not the villains of the story but rather the protagonists facing a challenge.I do like all this but I would say that in either case, but for one the information probably could be a lot more and a lot deeper. I mean, as someone who did pick up the book looking for information and I did get some of it. But I couldn't help but feel that there could have been a hell of a lot more. Quite honestly, with that in mind when picking up the book, I really would have liked it to be a hell of a lot thicker and more detailed. I got interested in it after hearing an interview with the author on the podcast Probably Science, an excellent podcast which I recommend to everyone, and it seemed that the hour and 20 minute interview pretty much covered the entire book. I was really hoping that the book itself would give me extra information but it really didn't feel like it. I suspect that the author wanted to appeal to as a wide variety of readers as possible, but I really could have done with more. I suppose I'll have to give other works reading.Along with that I felt that the author could have been more convincing as well. As I said, the book seems to be geared to those who already accept the science of climate change. That in on itself is perfectly fine. But the tone of the book comes off as if he also already expects us to simply accept what he wants to do, that is change the narrative around climate change. It feels like he's simply preaching to the choir. Now, personally I do think he is correct, another part of why I like this book, but when I am reading a work that does centre around making an argument. Whether it is for changing a narrative, making a philosophical argument or trying to make an argument for a stance, I really want the author to not only to state his facts but to make his case as if he wants to convince me. I do feel like I am being overly critical here, but I must say that if I didn't already accept the science of climate change and think that the author was correct after the very interesting and fun interview on Probably Science, I don't think I would have been convinced whatsoever. Even if I would already have accepted climate change but still be sceptical about the authors version of the narrative, I don't think that the author would have convinced me of it.Continuing that thought into thirdly, I really would have thought that the author would have wanted to convince as many as he could and reach the widest base. But since he seems to focus on those who already accept climate change and since, in my opinion, his arguments kinda feel like he already expects you to agree with him, I really don't feel like he's reaching as wide a base as he could.Now I'm not saying that he needed to do all three of these. But I would have liked to see at least something of this done better. I would have given this book full five stars if it either had been thicker and more informative, a bit more convincing, again I'm saying that as someone who already thinks the author is correct, or if he had not quite sounded as if he was simply preaching to the little choir that already. That said, I still highly enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about climate change and some of the history around it. "
249,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465139-leftjab,4,"This would actually be a 3.5. I’m really interested in astrobiology and Frank’s writing here makes me feel like I’ve grasped it. I was reading this as a follow up to Asimov’s Extraterrestrial Civilizations. Not quite sure if this really was what I was wanting – felt that some of the science involved was glossed over for Frank to illustrate why his approach to extraterrestrial life he would consider optimistic while many of the nay-sayers would be pessimistic. I gotta be honest, I don’t see what the big deal about the Drake Equation is. It just sounds like math that has no hope of being proved until there’s contact with some other advanced civilization and while Frank yes is optimistic that there must be other life of some sort in the universe because of the sheer number of stars and the possibility of planets around them – I’m not disputing that at all. It’s just that the conclusion of the equation is arbitrary. Beyond knowing that there are literally billions of planets the math would lead one to think that yes, there is a strong possibility for life on one of the planets. Any speculation about what that alien life could be like – to remove it from science fiction and place it closer to reality (to put it one way) – can only be postulated based on our extremely limited explorations of our solar system. So yeah, we have a good grasp on Mars and Venus, but beyond that, even exploring moons and planets within our solar system is so difficult and dangerous that getting into exoplanets is really vague at best.I’m not going to take away from Frank’s presentation of the information out there – I read the book quickly and actually made some notes of some of his sources to explore these concepts deeper in the future. And of course, the book possesses more sad resignation about the state of Earth and climate change. I liked Frank’s approach that a global civilization is going to affect the planet by nature of its being. I think that is a good approach to take – of course, I can’t stomach climate deniers and I don’t think they would even open a book like Light of the Stars to convince them that their “gut instincts” are incorrect.Why I bump the 3.5 to 4 though, is personal – as Frank speaks my language in the concluding chapter of the book, and summed up my shared belief about not that climate change is occurring, but how we as participating members of the global community should start to see ourselves and how that self-awareness (based in the scientific process but then could be utilized philosophically and ideologically – not to mention how there could be a religious aspect to self-analysis – I don’t see how religion and science cannot co-exist and getting past this political bullshit would be extremely helpful in trying to survive the next decade) should be utilized in terms of how people can attempt to tackle climate change – i.e. as a world instead of as individual nations:“Gaining the astrobiological perspective is the first, essential step in our maturation and our ability to face the Anthropocene. It means recognizing that we and our project of civilization are nothing more than the fruit of Earth’s ongoing evolutionary experiments. Any civilization on any planet will be nothing more than an expression of its home world’s creativity. We are no different from those we would call ‘alien.’”Well said. Nigel Kneale would agree."
250,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901146-arvind,4,"I picked up Light of the Stars after watching Frank animatedly discuss possibilities of alien life and world girdling civilizations with Joe Rogan. What caught my attention then, and part of what I think makes his book worth reading, is Frank‘s almost contrarian framing of global warming. For sure it’s happening, but the popular narrative about saving the planet and the polar bears isn’t compatible with life’s long history on Earth. Frank asserts that we, humanity, are the ones that need saving. Earth and life have co-evolved for billions of years and will for many more, with or without us.Light of the Stars takes an exogenous view of the way Earth, life (read humanity), and the climate interact. While describing how Earth’s climate and life have co-evolved over eons, Frank tells the story of how observations of Mars and Venus, for instance, have lead to greater understanding of climate processes here on Earth, and even influenced international politics. Later he takes the ultimate frequentist approach, based recent exoplanet discoveries, and poses Earth and our civilization as one of many in the galaxy and universe. He even uses the word 'experiment' to describe us and these other conjectured civilizations. Borrowing probably from Kardashev and others he assumes, modulo specific histories, anatomy, etc., all civilizations go through an Anthropocene type phase. Over the whole distribution of planets with civilizations, some master the transition and their planets, and some die off. It’s a powerful idea; and he, and coworkers, even made crude models of ""parametrized"" civilizations, seeded them with varying initial conditions, and analyzed the survival outcomes of the civilizations. The whole approach is pretty cool.Woven throughout is a story about the search and speculation about extraterrestrial life, and it’s interesting on its own. Frank really pays homage to Sagan, Tarter, Kardashev, and many other scientists that thought seriously about extraterritorial life. Before reading the book I had the same opinion of the Drake equation as Colonel Janus from the Expanse: „That’s not a equation. It’s a big fat guess.“. But the Drake equation really helped guide the search for extraterrestrial life. Along the same lines, Frank proposes his own equation, updated based on recent exoplanet discoveries.Overall, Light of the Stars is an interesting, light, nontechnical read, with a unique framing of climate change and our place in the universe."
251,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7649288-matt-ward,2,"One of the greatest things about popular science as a genre is how it can take topics that are somewhat dry and boring and bring life to it. We get to feel what's so cool about the topic that excited the scientists to work on it (The Elegant Universe, The Shape of Inner Space, The Selfish Gene, and Fermat's Last Theorem come to mind). Adam Frank is clearly fascinated by this stuff, but he doesn't spend enough time motivating it to get an uninterested person interested. The second chapter is basically a dry list of what makes up the environment on various planets and a recounting of probes that went there and a tedious history of the discoveries. It's only at the end of the chapter that it becomes clear why any of this is being discussed (namely, that climate models have been tested outside of Earth). That motivation needs to come at the beginning.It's not clear what niche this book is trying to serve. Most people with enough interest to pick this book up will already be familiar with the Drake equation and Fermi paradox. He doesn't even discuss the most interesting aspect of it (namely, the reason its a paradox).The end of the book gets better, but so many other books have covered similar ground in more detail and more interesting ways (see Jared Diamond's Collapse). So, I again wonder what niche the book is attempting to fill. Sorry to be such a downer. I heard a pretty interesting interview with him that turned me on to the book. I'd love to sit down and pick his brain over lunch. I'm not that interested in reading another of his books."
252,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43813529-celia-reaves,3,"Frank is a scientist with solid credentials and a strong reputation. In this book he tries something that’s probably impossible to pull off, so it’s not surprising I found it underwhelming. He is trying to use what we know about how stars, planets, biospheres, and civilizations evolve to draw conclusions about two separate things: whether there are or ever have been alien civilizations on other planets, and whether our civilization will survive the climate crisis we are now facing. He has good science about how stars develop. He pulls together information from geology and the study of planets in our solar system to support a strong argument about the development of planets. When he starts to draw conclusions about the evolution of large and complex biological organisms, and then about intelligence and technological civilizations, though, he loses me. I don’t see any way to extrapolate meaningfully from a sample of one. He does the math to show that in order for us to be the only technological civilization ever in our galaxy, the probability for such an event would have to be ridiculously small (one in ten billion trillion). Therefore, he concludes, we are not the first such civilization. I’m unconvinced by this argument. Just because a probability is vanishingly small doesn’t mean it actually vanishes. There is a lot of interesting information here, about stars and planets and the search for planets around distant stars. For me, though, he goes a step too far in the conclusions he draws. The evidence we need to get there is just not available yet."
253,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3512830-elmwoodblues,3,"Adam Frank himself makes clear that the subtitle of his book, 'Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth', could read '...and the Fate of Humanity.' Our earth is a pretty big place, and it didn't always look like it does now, what with the lava and the no oxygen and all. So, like Venus or Mars or (Carl Sagan voice here:) billions and billions of other worlds, when the water all floats away or the greenhouse effects take hold, whatever big round rock this happens to will be mostly okay. It is just the, you know, living stuff, that will have the bad day.It is a little frustrating to know that we all agree on how a greenhouse works out in a field, trapping solar radiation in the form of heat; Harbor Freight sells small ones for $300, near the $6 car-window shades. We all know that no use of energy is 100% efficient, so waste is produced with ANY work done; there are no free lunches in the universe. (Wind power? ""...extracting energy from wind power on a scale massive enough to power our current civilization would leave a global imprint akin to mild global warning."" Page 191. Sorry)So, why 'denial'? Because 'causes' is the big bugaboo, and we need to blame something? It's not the 'how' of using energy, it's the amount, the scale of it, the inevitability of it. It's thermodynamics, and thermodynamics are a bitch. Ask Venus."

The author does a good job of bringing together numerous different interrelated theories in terms of planetary feedback loops, systems and climate to make probabilistic claims on the likely number of planets that exist in the universe that are within the habitable zone and thus able to sustain life. The probabilities continue to look at just how many of those planets are likely to see the development of intelligent life and civilisation building life, like our own of earth. Unsurprisingly, the odds diminish at each stage, but even with the most pessimistic of predictions from the biggest doubters in the scientific community, we are still talking about a healthy number of planets that have or may host civilisation building life throughout all space and time.It’s a fascinating book well worth a read for anyone who loves science."

The focus of this book is on Fermi's Paradox, which states that with the near infinite number of opportunities in the universe for intelligent life to form, why is there no concrete evidence of any intelligent life other than ourselves? Are we really alone in the universe?It turns out that with the recent discoveries of numerous exoplanets, there can now be little doubt that life, and even intelligent life has sprung up elsewhere, outside of our solar system. What is still much in doubt, however, is how long those civilizations have lasted. There is currently great concern that our own technological civilization may be very short-lived. Is rapid development followed by rapid decline the norm for technological, energy-intensive civilizations like ours?There were some very good insights that this book brought up, but in the end I was still left with skepticism that, because of the great distances involved and the short-sighted direction our civilization seems to be taking, our species will never learn much about the true answers to these questions."

Yup, it’s a pretty heavy subject, but the science is not difficult, and is facilely explained by Adam Frank. He uses as his central principle the famous Drake Equation, which estimates the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence. With at least 1200 confirmed exoplanets, and thousands more sure to lurk in data captured by the Kepler space telescope but not yet analyzed, we have quite a bit of data to start filling in the variables in the Equation. Further, Frank looks back at two planets we know very well (Venus and Mars) to explain why they DON’T currently host life. The famed astronomer Carl Sagan appears in several threads of this story, both as an early enthusiast in SETI and as a member of the team which created the term “nuclear winter” (evidence for which comes from the history of Mars). The point of the book is basically to help us understand climate change on Earth, but the science it uses to get there is broad and endlessly fascinating. If you are in any way interested in any planetary science, this is a must-read.Grade: A"
257,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Over the years, many works of fiction have discussed the possibility of other worlds. In the 1950s, a group of prominent scientists sat down to lunch, and Enrico Fermi asked an important question; ""Where is everyone?""Here is a little backstory; we had known for some time that other stars might also harbor planets capable of supporting life. If we only look at the Milky Way Galaxy, we are looking at a cosmic neighborhood of approximately four hundred billion stars. So finally, a scientist sat down and wrote out a simple equation. It isn't necessarily a law of nature like Einstein's Equations. That scientist was named Frank Drake, and Drake's Equation became famous.Drake's Equation is easy to understand. It has seven parts. First, you figure out the birthrate of stars. Second, you multiply the number by the fraction of stars with planets. Third, you figure out which planets are in a habitable zone. Fourth, you figure out which planets develop life. Fifth, you figure out whether or not it has intelligence. Sixth, you figure out if they have the technology required to receive and send radio signals. Finally, you have to figure out the average lifetime of a technologically advanced civilization.The book is fascinating. I enjoyed it a lot."

Except that turns out to be almost backwards; there are indeed chapters setting up planetary science and the Drake equation about the likelihood of detectable life elsewhere in the galaxy, but then abruptly turns to computational models of ecology with very limited extraterrestrial input (except maybe a slight assist from Venus and Mars) to compute how likely civilization is to destroy itself. The doesn't seem to really know how Idea A is supposed to relate to Idea B, only that it thinks both ideas are interesting.It was mostly absorbing enough, although Frank's presentations were sometimes baffling -- his example ecological model was about ""bunnies,"" and although I'm pretty sure a professor of astronomy at the University of Rochester understands statistics, he handled them so cavalierly that a lot of his inferences seemed flat-out wrong as stated. But don't go in thinking that there's going to be a clear central thesis."

Though there was some great information on scientists and research I wasn't familiar with, this ended up being a very long persuasive piece about global warming/climate change. Now I completely believe humans are causing a potentially devastating change to our planet through the reckless use of fossil fuels, refusing to invest in renewable energy sources, and the clear-cutting of vast areas of the globe. I was clearly not the audience for this book. And I felt like I had been hoodwinked into reading this because I thought this would be a book about something else.Mainly aliens. I thought it'd be about aliens. And like 20 pages were. Sorta. :/ It's a well-written book and I recommend it to people who want to read about climate change. But if you came to it for aliens, you'll be disappointed. "

Light of the Stars is a popular account of the current understanding of the evolution of planets, ours and others throughout the universe. Frank addresses climate change by saying that science tells us we are changing our climate, but we should not feel guilty about it. Developing civilizations are part of the planet and do impact the development of the planet. We will not destroy the planet. It is not a question of whether or not the earth will survive, but rather whether or not humans will survive. If you are looking for details of the physics behind Frank's arguments, you will be disappointed. There is only one equation in the book and it is well explained. If you are not up to date on current scientific understanding of our planet and its possible future, Frank provides an easily read book to fill that gap."

It seems to me that while there are a lot of important questions to ask about the long-term future of humans on this planet, and maybe more generally technological civilizations on any planet, a better integration of ecological and evolutionary concepts is currently a missing ingredient. I would guess that this bias stems from the fields that astrobiology emerged from, and the generally short timescales ecologists tend to limit themselves to. This book would certainly support the idea that we need to think on big scales - as well as smaller scales - to better understand the magnitude and nature of our changing world in the context of the larger universe."

That's not to say its not good, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting, and that made it really drag for me. I had originally thought this book was solely focused on the possibilities of aliens, and inhabited planets. That is certainly part of the story, but in reality, this book is about what other planets can teach us about our own experiences on Earth, primarily climate change and how to respond to it, or the risks it might present. Whilst a valuable endeavour, coming off the back of 'The Glad Shout', and given what I thought the content was to be, I really not enthused for the topic. Nonetheless, Frank's book is a compelling argument for human created climate change, and how planetary science can teach us how we need to respond to ensure we're still here in a thousand years. So, if you've got a friend who doesn't believe in climate change, might be a worthwhile read for them."
263,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4039516-heather,4,"This was a really interesting overview of current research into extraterrestrial planets and the likelihood of finding alien life. The author calculates the number of planets the are similar to Earth and concludes that it's overwhelmingly likely there's life out there. But, of course, this is a bad argument: a large number of Earth-like planets (without any information about the probabilities of life arising within those conditions) is not enough to know how likely life is... (If you don't know how many sides a die has, you can't conclude from (even a very large) number of tosses that it's likely to land on ""1""). I enjoyed the author's emphasis on the geological scale of Earth's history and future. Humans are such brief players on the world's stage and may be too stupid to keep from killing ourselves. Nevertheless, there's a rich future for the earth and whatever other inhabitants may arise here."

The introduction of the books says that, Astrobiology is the main content of the book. Still, we don't get any possible explanation of what could be biology on a distant planet with regards to their atmosphere. Quite disappointing to read the same staff in many non-fiction science book. If you read science books rarely, you may find it a good read.

This dual theme is runs rampant throughout this book. Good writing supporting dubious science doesn't make for a good book - neither does mixing contempt for Republicans - of which I happen to be.Sadly, ZERO STARS to what should have been a good book ruined by Professor Frank's devotion to his totally unscientific dual cults.Not Recommended.

And stop denying the changes we've known about for a long time.Oh yeah... my one question that's never talked about when they talk about formulas for possible other civilizations... they never discuss the possibility of any of them going off world or finding another planet to use once theirs is all messed up or close to dying.

The author's premise is that each of these civilizations must have found the ways, and the determination, to overcome the problem which threatens our civilization -- global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. It's a great idea for a book. I just didn't enjoy this particular one. Parts of it were really interesting, and the concept itself is a novel approach to the problem of man-made climate change, but there were too many parts in this book that were just too dry, and I had to struggle to finish it."

As a reader who has a deep interest in the topic but is being introduced to some of the principle concepts, this was very helpful. Along those lines, this is a fantastic book for people who have a base understanding or are being introduced to topics such as Fermi's paradox, Carl Sagan's work, and the SETI program. For those reader who are already well versed, this book may seem something of a review. Frank's research into the how exo-civilizations survive their experience with climate change is fascinating. "
270,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,3,"This one started off very interesting and sort of petered out over the second half of the book. I think I mostly found the hard actual science in the beginning to the speculative and future possible science of the later portions of the book. The first portion of the book really found me thinking a lot of the Carl Sagan’s Contact, because it’s essentially dealing with the early approaches of searching for other life in the universe (Including the records Sagan was heavily involved with getting on the Voyager space probes.) Once the book started to delve into theory and odds of there being other intelligent live in the universe and the odds of contact etc, I lost interest rather quickly. It’s not that the book is poorly written or researched, it’s solid, it was just not all that interesting to me. I’m more for hard science here and while some of that was mixed in, such as the use of the Hubble Telescope to find other planets, it just wasn’t enough. "
271,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35537079-andy,1,"This book doesn't deliver what it promises at all. I was very disappointed. It promises to tell us ""what the latest thinking on alien civilizations reveals about our own"", but in reality it just gives four or five simple points, none of which are based on even recent research. For instance, one whole chapter is dedicated to pointing out that Mars and Venus have had various climates over their history. Another chapter tells us that Earth has too. Each of these chapters could have been boiled down to single sentences. The rest of it is filler: ""dramatic"" retellings of astronomers making observations, biographies of scientists, etc.If you were hoping for a volume that reported the latest research on exoplanets, this is not it. I honestly don't think there's anything here that someone who just casually reads about this topic whenever it makes the news wouldn't know already."

The book examines the history of life on earth and of space exploration of the planets in our solar system and also the history of our search for other planets around other stars and what that can tell us about our own world. It also explores the search for other life in the universe and the possible meaning for humans. The bottom line that this book brings home is that climate change is real and people have caused it because people are the major life form on our planet. It’s no longer a matter of saving the planet but of saving ourselves. A reasoned and informative read.
273,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22093539-audra-falk,4,"After reading this book, I have a much bigger view of the universe. WOW.I also now have what is probably a more accurate perspective of our own tiny place within time and space--and a greater appreciation of the privileges and responsibilities we as humans have on this planet and at this time.For someone who struggled with physics and chemistry classes in school, I was happy to find that I was able to understand the vast majority of this book. This is a credit to the author's ability to speak to the layperson. Overall a great book for anyone who is interested in an overview of astrobiology or astrophysics-- or who is just curious about the great universe that surrounds us. "
274,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4865450-david-davy,5,"I've long thought that biggest obstacle to solving or dealing with climate change is that it occurs outside boundaries of normal, everyday perception. Light of the Stars attempts to address this by expanding the field of observation to planets other than our own, real and imagined, given the data at hand. We and all other life here are a natural result of the myriad changes that have already taken place across the entirety of the existence of the planet, and the odds that we are the first planet to have this outcome, of civilization, is virtually nil. The long term survival of our civilization depends on a better understanding of how planets work and of our place on them. "

278,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12275862-sigurgeir,3,"I did want to give this book a higher rating since I did like it. It is full of good information, it's fun to read and quite frankly I really enjoyed it. The reason I can't give it a higher rating though is that I'm not quite sure who it's for. It seems to be for those who already accept the science of climate change and just want a little more information. But at the same time the author does say that the intention of the book is to change the narrative of climate change to something where we humans are not the villains of the story but rather the protagonists facing a challenge.I do like all this but I would say that in either case, but for one the information probably could be a lot more and a lot deeper. I mean, as someone who did pick up the book looking for information and I did get some of it. But I couldn't help but feel that there could have been a hell of a lot more. Quite honestly, with that in mind when picking up the book, I really would have liked it to be a hell of a lot thicker and more detailed. I got interested in it after hearing an interview with the author on the podcast Probably Science, an excellent podcast which I recommend to everyone, and it seemed that the hour and 20 minute interview pretty much covered the entire book. I was really hoping that the book itself would give me extra information but it really didn't feel like it. I suspect that the author wanted to appeal to as a wide variety of readers as possible, but I really could have done with more. I suppose I'll have to give other works reading.Along with that I felt that the author could have been more convincing as well. As I said, the book seems to be geared to those who already accept the science of climate change. That in on itself is perfectly fine. But the tone of the book comes off as if he also already expects us to simply accept what he wants to do, that is change the narrative around climate change. It feels like he's simply preaching to the choir. Now, personally I do think he is correct, another part of why I like this book, but when I am reading a work that does centre around making an argument. Whether it is for changing a narrative, making a philosophical argument or trying to make an argument for a stance, I really want the author to not only to state his facts but to make his case as if he wants to convince me. I do feel like I am being overly critical here, but I must say that if I didn't already accept the science of climate change and think that the author was correct after the very interesting and fun interview on Probably Science, I don't think I would have been convinced whatsoever. Even if I would already have accepted climate change but still be sceptical about the authors version of the narrative, I don't think that the author would have convinced me of it.Continuing that thought into thirdly, I really would have thought that the author would have wanted to convince as many as he could and reach the widest base. But since he seems to focus on those who already accept climate change and since, in my opinion, his arguments kinda feel like he already expects you to agree with him, I really don't feel like he's reaching as wide a base as he could.Now I'm not saying that he needed to do all three of these. But I would have liked to see at least something of this done better. I would have given this book full five stars if it either had been thicker and more informative, a bit more convincing, again I'm saying that as someone who already thinks the author is correct, or if he had not quite sounded as if he was simply preaching to the little choir that already. That said, I still highly enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about climate change and some of the history around it. "
279,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465139-leftjab,4,"This would actually be a 3.5. I’m really interested in astrobiology and Frank’s writing here makes me feel like I’ve grasped it. I was reading this as a follow up to Asimov’s Extraterrestrial Civilizations. Not quite sure if this really was what I was wanting – felt that some of the science involved was glossed over for Frank to illustrate why his approach to extraterrestrial life he would consider optimistic while many of the nay-sayers would be pessimistic. I gotta be honest, I don’t see what the big deal about the Drake Equation is. It just sounds like math that has no hope of being proved until there’s contact with some other advanced civilization and while Frank yes is optimistic that there must be other life of some sort in the universe because of the sheer number of stars and the possibility of planets around them – I’m not disputing that at all. It’s just that the conclusion of the equation is arbitrary. Beyond knowing that there are literally billions of planets the math would lead one to think that yes, there is a strong possibility for life on one of the planets. Any speculation about what that alien life could be like – to remove it from science fiction and place it closer to reality (to put it one way) – can only be postulated based on our extremely limited explorations of our solar system. So yeah, we have a good grasp on Mars and Venus, but beyond that, even exploring moons and planets within our solar system is so difficult and dangerous that getting into exoplanets is really vague at best.I’m not going to take away from Frank’s presentation of the information out there – I read the book quickly and actually made some notes of some of his sources to explore these concepts deeper in the future. And of course, the book possesses more sad resignation about the state of Earth and climate change. I liked Frank’s approach that a global civilization is going to affect the planet by nature of its being. I think that is a good approach to take – of course, I can’t stomach climate deniers and I don’t think they would even open a book like Light of the Stars to convince them that their “gut instincts” are incorrect.Why I bump the 3.5 to 4 though, is personal – as Frank speaks my language in the concluding chapter of the book, and summed up my shared belief about not that climate change is occurring, but how we as participating members of the global community should start to see ourselves and how that self-awareness (based in the scientific process but then could be utilized philosophically and ideologically – not to mention how there could be a religious aspect to self-analysis – I don’t see how religion and science cannot co-exist and getting past this political bullshit would be extremely helpful in trying to survive the next decade) should be utilized in terms of how people can attempt to tackle climate change – i.e. as a world instead of as individual nations:“Gaining the astrobiological perspective is the first, essential step in our maturation and our ability to face the Anthropocene. It means recognizing that we and our project of civilization are nothing more than the fruit of Earth’s ongoing evolutionary experiments. Any civilization on any planet will be nothing more than an expression of its home world’s creativity. We are no different from those we would call ‘alien.’”Well said. Nigel Kneale would agree."
280,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901146-arvind,4,"I picked up Light of the Stars after watching Frank animatedly discuss possibilities of alien life and world girdling civilizations with Joe Rogan. What caught my attention then, and part of what I think makes his book worth reading, is Frank‘s almost contrarian framing of global warming. For sure it’s happening, but the popular narrative about saving the planet and the polar bears isn’t compatible with life’s long history on Earth. Frank asserts that we, humanity, are the ones that need saving. Earth and life have co-evolved for billions of years and will for many more, with or without us.Light of the Stars takes an exogenous view of the way Earth, life (read humanity), and the climate interact. While describing how Earth’s climate and life have co-evolved over eons, Frank tells the story of how observations of Mars and Venus, for instance, have lead to greater understanding of climate processes here on Earth, and even influenced international politics. Later he takes the ultimate frequentist approach, based recent exoplanet discoveries, and poses Earth and our civilization as one of many in the galaxy and universe. He even uses the word 'experiment' to describe us and these other conjectured civilizations. Borrowing probably from Kardashev and others he assumes, modulo specific histories, anatomy, etc., all civilizations go through an Anthropocene type phase. Over the whole distribution of planets with civilizations, some master the transition and their planets, and some die off. It’s a powerful idea; and he, and coworkers, even made crude models of ""parametrized"" civilizations, seeded them with varying initial conditions, and analyzed the survival outcomes of the civilizations. The whole approach is pretty cool.Woven throughout is a story about the search and speculation about extraterrestrial life, and it’s interesting on its own. Frank really pays homage to Sagan, Tarter, Kardashev, and many other scientists that thought seriously about extraterritorial life. Before reading the book I had the same opinion of the Drake equation as Colonel Janus from the Expanse: „That’s not a equation. It’s a big fat guess.“. But the Drake equation really helped guide the search for extraterrestrial life. Along the same lines, Frank proposes his own equation, updated based on recent exoplanet discoveries.Overall, Light of the Stars is an interesting, light, nontechnical read, with a unique framing of climate change and our place in the universe."
281,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7649288-matt-ward,2,"One of the greatest things about popular science as a genre is how it can take topics that are somewhat dry and boring and bring life to it. We get to feel what's so cool about the topic that excited the scientists to work on it (The Elegant Universe, The Shape of Inner Space, The Selfish Gene, and Fermat's Last Theorem come to mind). Adam Frank is clearly fascinated by this stuff, but he doesn't spend enough time motivating it to get an uninterested person interested. The second chapter is basically a dry list of what makes up the environment on various planets and a recounting of probes that went there and a tedious history of the discoveries. It's only at the end of the chapter that it becomes clear why any of this is being discussed (namely, that climate models have been tested outside of Earth). That motivation needs to come at the beginning.It's not clear what niche this book is trying to serve. Most people with enough interest to pick this book up will already be familiar with the Drake equation and Fermi paradox. He doesn't even discuss the most interesting aspect of it (namely, the reason its a paradox).The end of the book gets better, but so many other books have covered similar ground in more detail and more interesting ways (see Jared Diamond's Collapse). So, I again wonder what niche the book is attempting to fill. Sorry to be such a downer. I heard a pretty interesting interview with him that turned me on to the book. I'd love to sit down and pick his brain over lunch. I'm not that interested in reading another of his books."
282,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43813529-celia-reaves,3,"Frank is a scientist with solid credentials and a strong reputation. In this book he tries something that’s probably impossible to pull off, so it’s not surprising I found it underwhelming. He is trying to use what we know about how stars, planets, biospheres, and civilizations evolve to draw conclusions about two separate things: whether there are or ever have been alien civilizations on other planets, and whether our civilization will survive the climate crisis we are now facing. He has good science about how stars develop. He pulls together information from geology and the study of planets in our solar system to support a strong argument about the development of planets. When he starts to draw conclusions about the evolution of large and complex biological organisms, and then about intelligence and technological civilizations, though, he loses me. I don’t see any way to extrapolate meaningfully from a sample of one. He does the math to show that in order for us to be the only technological civilization ever in our galaxy, the probability for such an event would have to be ridiculously small (one in ten billion trillion). Therefore, he concludes, we are not the first such civilization. I’m unconvinced by this argument. Just because a probability is vanishingly small doesn’t mean it actually vanishes. There is a lot of interesting information here, about stars and planets and the search for planets around distant stars. For me, though, he goes a step too far in the conclusions he draws. The evidence we need to get there is just not available yet."
283,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3512830-elmwoodblues,3,"Adam Frank himself makes clear that the subtitle of his book, 'Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth', could read '...and the Fate of Humanity.' Our earth is a pretty big place, and it didn't always look like it does now, what with the lava and the no oxygen and all. So, like Venus or Mars or (Carl Sagan voice here:) billions and billions of other worlds, when the water all floats away or the greenhouse effects take hold, whatever big round rock this happens to will be mostly okay. It is just the, you know, living stuff, that will have the bad day.It is a little frustrating to know that we all agree on how a greenhouse works out in a field, trapping solar radiation in the form of heat; Harbor Freight sells small ones for $300, near the $6 car-window shades. We all know that no use of energy is 100% efficient, so waste is produced with ANY work done; there are no free lunches in the universe. (Wind power? ""...extracting energy from wind power on a scale massive enough to power our current civilization would leave a global imprint akin to mild global warning."" Page 191. Sorry)So, why 'denial'? Because 'causes' is the big bugaboo, and we need to blame something? It's not the 'how' of using energy, it's the amount, the scale of it, the inevitability of it. It's thermodynamics, and thermodynamics are a bitch. Ask Venus."

The author does a good job of bringing together numerous different interrelated theories in terms of planetary feedback loops, systems and climate to make probabilistic claims on the likely number of planets that exist in the universe that are within the habitable zone and thus able to sustain life. The probabilities continue to look at just how many of those planets are likely to see the development of intelligent life and civilisation building life, like our own of earth. Unsurprisingly, the odds diminish at each stage, but even with the most pessimistic of predictions from the biggest doubters in the scientific community, we are still talking about a healthy number of planets that have or may host civilisation building life throughout all space and time.It’s a fascinating book well worth a read for anyone who loves science."

The focus of this book is on Fermi's Paradox, which states that with the near infinite number of opportunities in the universe for intelligent life to form, why is there no concrete evidence of any intelligent life other than ourselves? Are we really alone in the universe?It turns out that with the recent discoveries of numerous exoplanets, there can now be little doubt that life, and even intelligent life has sprung up elsewhere, outside of our solar system. What is still much in doubt, however, is how long those civilizations have lasted. There is currently great concern that our own technological civilization may be very short-lived. Is rapid development followed by rapid decline the norm for technological, energy-intensive civilizations like ours?There were some very good insights that this book brought up, but in the end I was still left with skepticism that, because of the great distances involved and the short-sighted direction our civilization seems to be taking, our species will never learn much about the true answers to these questions."

Yup, it’s a pretty heavy subject, but the science is not difficult, and is facilely explained by Adam Frank. He uses as his central principle the famous Drake Equation, which estimates the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence. With at least 1200 confirmed exoplanets, and thousands more sure to lurk in data captured by the Kepler space telescope but not yet analyzed, we have quite a bit of data to start filling in the variables in the Equation. Further, Frank looks back at two planets we know very well (Venus and Mars) to explain why they DON’T currently host life. The famed astronomer Carl Sagan appears in several threads of this story, both as an early enthusiast in SETI and as a member of the team which created the term “nuclear winter” (evidence for which comes from the history of Mars). The point of the book is basically to help us understand climate change on Earth, but the science it uses to get there is broad and endlessly fascinating. If you are in any way interested in any planetary science, this is a must-read.Grade: A"
287,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Over the years, many works of fiction have discussed the possibility of other worlds. In the 1950s, a group of prominent scientists sat down to lunch, and Enrico Fermi asked an important question; ""Where is everyone?""Here is a little backstory; we had known for some time that other stars might also harbor planets capable of supporting life. If we only look at the Milky Way Galaxy, we are looking at a cosmic neighborhood of approximately four hundred billion stars. So finally, a scientist sat down and wrote out a simple equation. It isn't necessarily a law of nature like Einstein's Equations. That scientist was named Frank Drake, and Drake's Equation became famous.Drake's Equation is easy to understand. It has seven parts. First, you figure out the birthrate of stars. Second, you multiply the number by the fraction of stars with planets. Third, you figure out which planets are in a habitable zone. Fourth, you figure out which planets develop life. Fifth, you figure out whether or not it has intelligence. Sixth, you figure out if they have the technology required to receive and send radio signals. Finally, you have to figure out the average lifetime of a technologically advanced civilization.The book is fascinating. I enjoyed it a lot."

Except that turns out to be almost backwards; there are indeed chapters setting up planetary science and the Drake equation about the likelihood of detectable life elsewhere in the galaxy, but then abruptly turns to computational models of ecology with very limited extraterrestrial input (except maybe a slight assist from Venus and Mars) to compute how likely civilization is to destroy itself. The doesn't seem to really know how Idea A is supposed to relate to Idea B, only that it thinks both ideas are interesting.It was mostly absorbing enough, although Frank's presentations were sometimes baffling -- his example ecological model was about ""bunnies,"" and although I'm pretty sure a professor of astronomy at the University of Rochester understands statistics, he handled them so cavalierly that a lot of his inferences seemed flat-out wrong as stated.

Though there was some great information on scientists and research I wasn't familiar with, this ended up being a very long persuasive piece about global warming/climate change. Now I completely believe humans are causing a potentially devastating change to our planet through the reckless use of fossil fuels, refusing to invest in renewable energy sources, and the clear-cutting of vast areas of the globe. I was clearly not the audience for this book. And I felt like I had been hoodwinked into reading this because I thought this would be a book about something else.Mainly aliens. I thought it'd be about aliens. And like 20 pages were. Sorta. :/ It's a well-written book and I recommend it to people who want to read about climate change. But if you came to it for aliens, you'll be disappointed. "
290,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/305384-dan,3,"Frank is an astrophysicist who aspires to be the next Carl Sagan. Light of the Stars is a popular account of the current understanding of the evolution of planets, ours and others throughout the universe. Frank addresses climate change by saying that science tells us we are changing our climate, but we should not feel guilty about it. Developing civilizations are part of the planet and do impact the development of the planet. We will not destroy the planet. It is not a question of whether or not the earth will survive, but rather whether or not humans will survive. If you are looking for details of the physics behind Frank's arguments, you will be disappointed. There is only one equation in the book and it is well explained. If you are not up to date on current scientific understanding of our planet and its possible future, Frank provides an easily read book to fill that gap."
291,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3248359-justin,4,"A well-thought and organized but *brief* description of the sciences leading to our current understanding of Earth’s place in the larger universe, with the central question being: will our civilization survive long enough to carry the story forward? It seems to me that while there are a lot of important questions to ask about the long-term future of humans on this planet, and maybe more generally technological civilizations on any planet, a better integration of ecological and evolutionary concepts is currently a missing ingredient. I would guess that this bias stems from the fields that astrobiology emerged from, and the generally short timescales ecologists tend to limit themselves to. This book would certainly support the idea that we need to think on big scales - as well as smaller scales - to better understand the magnitude and nature of our changing world in the context of the larger universe."
292,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4987429-tara-van-beurden,3,"Another book I had really expected to love, but didn't. That's not to say its not good, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting, and that made it really drag for me. I had originally thought this book was solely focused on the possibilities of aliens, and inhabited planets. That is certainly part of the story, but in reality, this book is about what other planets can teach us about our own experiences on Earth, primarily climate change and how to respond to it, or the risks it might present. Whilst a valuable endeavour, coming off the back of 'The Glad Shout', and given what I thought the content was to be, I really not enthused for the topic. Nonetheless, Frank's book is a compelling argument for human created climate change, and how planetary science can teach us how we need to respond to ensure we're still here in a thousand years. So, if you've got a friend who doesn't believe in climate change, might be a worthwhile read for them."
293,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4039516-heather,4,"This was a really interesting overview of current research into extraterrestrial planets and the likelihood of finding alien life. The author calculates the number of planets the are similar to Earth and concludes that it's overwhelmingly likely there's life out there. But, of course, this is a bad argument: a large number of Earth-like planets (without any information about the probabilities of life arising within those conditions) is not enough to know how likely life is... (If you don't know how many sides a die has, you can't conclude from (even a very large) number of tosses that it's likely to land on ""1""). I enjoyed the author's emphasis on the geological scale of Earth's history and future. Humans are such brief players on the world's stage and may be too stupid to keep from killing ourselves. Nevertheless, there's a rich future for the earth and whatever other inhabitants may arise here."
294,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25068781-utpal-mondal,3," Light o the Stars tells the journey of a planet. How it's inhabitants can combine with its planet as a whole and transform self for the progress of its civilization. It predicts the possibility of life on exo-planets far far away and within our solar system. How the climate of other planets predicts the future of our own planet is the main theme of this book. The introduction of the books says that, Astrobiology is the main content of the book. Still, we don't get any possible explanation of what could be biology on a distant planet with regards to their atmosphere. Quite disappointing to read the same staff in many non-fiction science book. If you read science books rarely, you may find it a good read. But for a general reader with an interest on specially these type of books, this particular book doesn't offer much new."
295,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8487266-joseph,1,"has stopped reading ""Light Of The Stars"" by Adam Frank, released by Norton Books.In addition to being a Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Rochester, Adam Frank is also has, as indicated by the 33 pages I read into this political propaganda piece masquerading as a work of non-fiction, dual membership into the Cult of the Great Global Climate Change Hoax and is a devout Setist who firmly believes that there are advanced alien civilizations that we can learn from, if only to save human civilization. This dual theme is runs rampant throughout this book. Good writing supporting dubious science doesn't make for a good book - neither does mixing contempt for Republicans - of which I happen to be.Sadly, ZERO STARS to what should have been a good book ruined by Professor Frank's devotion to his totally unscientific dual cults.Not Recommended. "
296,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1305908-nina,3,"Some interesting stuff, some not-so-surprising or new things. But a good way to look at how we can use other planets to think about how to save our own. It ends on a... sort of? hopeful note. But basically like... we need to figure some stuff out NOW. And stop denying the changes we've known about for a long time.Oh yeah... my one question that's never talked about when they talk about formulas for possible other civilizations... they never discuss the possibility of any of them going off world or finding another planet to use once theirs is all messed up or close to dying. If they get so advanced, shouldn't that be another possibility to help the pessimism line or whatever it was called?"

298,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95800817-cary-fitzgerald,3,"The sheer size of the universe, the number of stars, and the fact that we're discovering new planets practically every day makes it a mathematical near-certainty that we are not alone -- that there are other, perhaps more-advanced civilizations ""out there."" The author's premise is that each of these civilizations must have found the ways, and the determination, to overcome the problem which threatens our civilization -- global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. It's a great idea for a book. I just didn't enjoy this particular one. Parts of it were really interesting, and the concept itself is a novel approach to the problem of man-made climate change, but there were too many parts in this book that were just too dry, and I had to struggle to finish it."
299,0393609014,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46501961-timders77,5,"Adam Frank has a knack for taking complex scientific concepts and explaining them in a much more accessible fashion. As a reader who has a deep interest in the topic but is being introduced to some of the principle concepts, this was very helpful. Along those lines, this is a fantastic book for people who have a base understanding or are being introduced to topics such as Fermi's paradox, Carl Sagan's work, and the SETI program. For those reader who are already well versed, this book may seem something of a review. Frank's research into the how exo-civilizations survive their experience with climate change is fascinating. "
