0,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"In my bookshop are lots of books like, 'First 100 Words' and ""ABC with pictures"", you know those sort of books. We talk to our babies in 'motherese' and we point to things and name them, but we do not teach our babies grammar. We say things like 'look at those puppies there, they are much smaller than these ones here'. We don't explain when to use words like 'those' or 'these' or 'there' and 'here' and where we put them in a sentence. We don't need to, Pinker says, Chomsky said, that grammar is built-in. That no matter what language a child learns, they will use the words grammatically without any instruction. And if a child learns wildly different languages as say Welsh, Spanish and English (there are many people who grow up speaking these particular three in Patagonia) they will use the correct grammar as well as words without any difficulty at all.__________Notes on reading: What I've learned so far: that it takes only one generation to turn a pidgin into a creole (language). Immigrant workers in Hawaii, Japanese, Filipinos, Chinese, Koreans even Portuguese and Europeans spoke to each other in pidgin. Pidgin is a collection of words without any grammar. It's a bit like what most of us who are not linguistically-gifted speak when we travel. We mix the few words we know of the local language with English and (if British) shouted loudly and repetitively until the 'native' gets it. The children of the immigrant workers were looked after together when their parents were in the fields and they, just like that, because of the instinct for language, for grammar, turned the pidgin into a creole, a language that could express anything and everything. Children never speak pidgin, their brains impose structure on words and they learn from each other. Sadly, the window for language acquisition closes as puberty approaches. After that it is only talented individuals who can acquire a foreign language with perfect grammar and accent. Jamaican, which Jamaicans continually put down as the patois of the poor people', not proper 'standard English' is in fact a proper language with its own grammar, although a majority of the words are derived from English and Akan, Pinker says he's not 100% behind Chomsky's theories. He's pretty close though. I got bored with the chapters on Chomsky's language trees, I'm more interested in how we produce language than the structure of it. Great book, a difficult and academic read (at least to me) and boring in bits too but none of that takes away from opening up a new skein of thought for me, and I enjoy that more than anything else from a book."

2,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1198255-madeleine,4,"I have this incredible mental block about reviewing nonfiction. My formal linguistics experience is limited to exactly one History of the English Language class as a college junior (and it remains one of the most fascinating, satisfying and illuminating classroom experiences I've ever had, university-level or otherwise), which was about when I realized that the study of language was up there with the school paper and my creative-writing courses in terms of the all-over fulfillment I found in it. It helped that I had an enthusiastic professor whose wealth of knowledge and general zeal turned my disappointment in the English department's lack of additional linguistic offerings into a fervent hunt for extracurricular reading material regarding the topic, though I can't help but feel that my self-guided tour through the field isn't yielding the same benefits I'd've received from exploring the same terrain with an expert leading the way. Hence my concern that I'll sound like I'm trying to pretend that I know what I'm talking about on some deeper level when my background in the roots of language is far more recreational than academic. All's I can say for sure is that The Language Instinct was great fun, beautifully written and an absolute whirlwind of information that covers a dizzying array of unexpected but thought-provokingly relevant subjects.Oh, and that Steven Pinker has the most admirably disheveled hair since Georges Perec. Their locks are not to be trifled with, nor, clearly, are their minds. The last language-centric book I read argued in favor of a point that had been laughed into noncredibility for years thanks to the implied racism it still carried from the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis days, which is that the world actually looks different based on one's view of the world based on his or her culture and language (Through the Language Glass, written by Guy Deutscher and published in 2010 -- and which I must admit to having read long enough ago that I have shamefully forgotten many of its finer details but do recall as having made a rather convincing argument, as it delved into stuff such as how a language can reflect a culture's attitude toward its women) -- an hypothesis that Pinker decried within the first 50 pages of this 1994 bestseller as ""wrong, all wrong,"" as it is his view that ""discussions that assume that language determines thought carry on only by a collective suspension of disbelief."" My copy of The Language Instinct includes Pinker's chapter-by-chapter asides about updates in the many areas he explored in a book he published more than two decades ago, including the neo-Whorfism that has sprung up in recent years, a revival that allowed works such as Through the Language Glass to be taken more seriously because the misguided blinders and red herrings of the linguistic avenue of contemplation have finally fallen away and its points can be made in such a way to sidestep the unfortunate pitfalls of the past.Seeing the inverse of an argument made just as successfully as my initial exposure to it was what sucked me in for good with this book. The overlapping of an argument's two sides and seeing familiar names, familiar backgrounds, familiar failings and completely different conclusions were all strangely rewarding payoffs for my own curious, solitary explorations. And that spark of recognition just kept cropping up in myriad forms as I read on and on (and on and on, as it took me, like, two months to finish this -- absolutely no fault of Pinker's, but rather that of my compulsion to juggle two and three books at once and work's nasty habit of reducing my reading time in two-week cycles). While the biology and neurobiology and child development and abnormal psych were all a bit of alien territory for me, Pinker presented them all in such accessible ways that my tactile-learner self was picking up everything he was putting down. Which made the friendlier faces I'd seen before all the more inviting: The progression of Old English to Middle English to Modern English was like having tea (or mead) with an old friend, reading about the Great Vowel Shift was like reminiscing with an old lover and wondering if maybe the stars are finally aligned in our favor, the uncanny commonalities between seemingly unrelated tongues was a kiddie ball pit wrapped in a trampoline for my brain, and the pages and chapters of grammatical theory? Be still, my pedantic heart! I didn't even mind, as a happily neurotic proofreader, when Pinker started asserting that maybe the Grammar Mavens have their priorities all wrong, that even nontraditional dialects have their merits, that ""whom"" ought to go the way of ""ye"" and its other equally antiquated brethren, that it's okay to hang on to the rules of usage for clarity's sake rather than browbeating those poor folks who don't work themselves into paroxysms of glee at the very notion of sentence diagrams over their truly nitpicky transgressions. I had no idea the lengths and detail necessary in asserting that something so mind-bogglingly complex but is so universally taken for granted -- that is, human speech -- is a deep-seated biological impulse, hard-wired into our brains to the point that we are all, in fact, baby geniuses when it comes to sussing out most of the nuances of our diabolically tricky native languages by the age of three. I had no well-formed opinion on the matter of language as a learned habit versus a communicative imperative instilled in us via evolution before coming into this but did Pinker ever reel me in, hold my attention and make me want to delve deeper into his research, theories and positions regarding the language instinct. Bearing witness to the impressive lengths he goes to to cover all his ground from every angle is reward enough for hearing him out for nearly 500 pages, because Pinker's dedication to the language instinct is evident enough in the miles of homework he did to make his point with armfuls of wide-ranging detail and chapter upon chapter of some truly compelling writing."
3,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1445709-tyas,5,"A friend, a diplomat’s daughter, when asked how she had managed to master Dutch when she went to a school in Suriname, shrugged.“I don’t know. I remember being so confused during the first day, not understanding a single word. But not so long after that, I was able to speak in Dutch. I just spoke, I don’t know how.”That had happened years ago, when she was still very young. We have always wondered how come children are able to learn language easily, while many, if not most adults, find the task of learning a new language bewildering, bordering with the impossible. Plus, children are not just great imitators. If they were, we would only be repeating things our parents had told us when we were small. But we don’t. We don’t just mimic our parents’ words. Something in our neural circuitry does more than just copying; it analyses grammar, it finds for pattern, it composes new combination of words... frighteningly complex processes that, so far, cannot even be matched by the most advanced of AI. C3PO is still a long way to go.The ability of learning language is one of the many subjects covered by the book The Language Instinct, written by Steven Pinker, a psycholinguist in Harvard. (No, he’s not some crazy linguist who enjoys slaying people.)Language is probably the hallmark of human race. We boast our ability to communicate in words, a feature of our culture that no other living forms have. But Pinker shows us that far from being a cultural invention, language is actually an instinct. And because it is, then despite the doubts of the likes of Chomsky, it must be built gradually in the lineages one of which led to us thanks to natural selection. Aiming towards the goal of convincing us about that main point of language being an instinct, Pinker wove an abundance of evidence into this clear, mostly easy-to-swallow book. I said most, because to be frank at times I was lost among a wealth of linguistic terms that I had to crawl through, trying to just grab the general point of some parts.Nevertheless, I like Pinker’s book for dissecting language thoroughly. My favourite part is of course about the language mavens – people who think they have the task to safeguard the purity of language and grammar. Pinker showed us that many instances of ‘ungrammatical’ words or sentences according to those mavens, are actually grammatical according to how our brain works. Very enlightening, especially for someone like me who has for quite some time lost her faith in the tyranny of KBBI and EYD of the Indonesian language. (Our own language mavens, for instance, would waste their sweat telling us that the correct spelling for ‘lembab’ is ‘lembap’, though you understand that both mean the same anyway, and that you may not speak of ‘jam delapan’, but ‘pukul delapan’ instead.)But hey, if this sounds like telling us to ditch our dictionaries and standard spellings and pronunciation altogether, what am I doing, writing something in what, I hope, is a neat piece of review, instead 0f sumth1n l1k3 d33s? (You might even notice that I even care to hit the spacebar twice after a period, but only once after a comma.)Well, when I talk with my sister and brother, or with my bestfriends, sometimes we use words and phrases only we understand. (I wager none of you know what an ‘exedol’ is.) Sometimes we don’t even have to finish our sentences. Our experience together has created specific words and phrases and shaped the language that we use when we communicate with each other. But, when I write something, keeping a general reader in mind, I must be careful to use words and phrases most, if not all, readers would understand, presenting my thought clearly, preventing misunderstanding or confusion (except if that is exactly my intention, but Joyce I am not). Hence my writing style – but trust me, in verbal communication, I might sound very, very different.Language is far more interesting than filling up blanks on a question sheet with the right form of verbs, and Steven Pinker has a way of revealing to us how amazing our language and our brain are."
4,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,4,"I had The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language out of the library for the entire summer. I finally finished it by actively reading it on the train for a couple of weeks. It's interesting, don't get me wrong, it's just LONG and has enough dull/confusing stretches that I couldn't bring myself to read it in my free time - it was pretty much a train-only book.The book's underlying claim is that all human beings are born with something Pinker calls a Universal Grammar, which causes us to acquire language instinctively. Whether we are born into an English or Kinyarwandan or sign-language community affects only the details of our language acquisition - we are wired to understand the way language works.He makes many good points, and I learned a lot from reading this book, but something underlying the text was somewhat disturbing to me (and it's not just the way he seems to revere Noam Chomsky as a god, quoting him earnestly and often, and almost overemphasizing the one point where he disagrees with Chomsky as if to say, ""Look, all you people who think I'm just digesting Chomsky for the masses - I DO have my own thoughts! So there!""). It's that Pinker is 100% an objectivist, believing that our language and culture don't really affect the underlying processes in our minds and that human beings are ultimately the same, whereas I can't see the world without some degree of relativity slipping in, thinking that we are all very very similar and are justified in acting as if we are all the same, but that there are subtle differences that we may not entirely be able to overcome. I think lanugage, at least to a small degree, does affect the way we think and process the world, even if the differences are mostly ones we can see past or work around when talking with others from a different language background.(I laughed every time I turned the book over and saw the quote on the back from William F. Buckley, Jr.: ""Steven Pinker is, I think, engagingly wrong in some of his conclusions, but the operative word here is engagingly. He reminds us of the pleasures of reading about language, provided people like him are at the wheel."")A few details I really enjoyed about this book: Case studies and quotes from people with various neurological disorders affecting their language abilities. The detail to which Pinker addressed sign languages, showing how language acquisition follows the same steps whether it is spoken or gestured (deaf babies ""babble"" with their hands at the same age that hearing babies babble with their mouths). The linguistics primers, which had me making phoneme sounds and sticking my finger in my mouth to see how my tongue and lips were arranged (while on the train!). Reasons why the ""language mavens"" (people who bemoan the decline of English) are often wrong. This is definitely a worthwhile read if you're interested in linguistics but haven't studied much on the topic yet. There's a lot of value in this book, even though some passages do get overwhelmingly dry or pedantic (pages of sentence diagramming scattered throughout the book, for example). I wouldn't recommend it to a casual reader, since I kind of had to will myself to finish reading the book, but I do think I learned a lot for sticking it out. "
5,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"Steven Pinker and I should be natural enemies. He's a representative of what I consider to be the smarmy, science-precludes-all-else school of hung-up modernist reductionists, while I fly the flag of what he considers to be the wishy-washy, Nietzsche-damaged academic Left. And yet it's difficult for me not to have some respect for his project.When he's not making potshots at relativism(s), he is generally quite lucid and charming, and throughout writes with a clear, approachable logic. By cogitating on the structure of Creole languages and the speech patterns of aphasics, he makes a very, very strong case for a universal grammar. While there are suggestions that certain features of universal aren't present in some languages, it seems to be a reasonable hypothesis. I will say, as an arch-empiricist and an arch-skeptic, that there's a very strong chance that grammatical structures quite likely have a social rather than a strictly evolutionary basis, but the idea is certainly thought-provoking. And, importantly for us moody relativists, he has convinced me (in a way that Peter Singer totally didn't) of the democratic potential of the notion of innate human nature. I do feel that he utilizes a certain circular logic. In Pinker's view, morphemes fit into the framework of syntax, and therefore language is innate. What is a morpheme? Something that fits into the framework of syntax. Also, he largely relies on generalizations rather than universals.Oh, and he claims signifiers are arbitrary, even in the case of onomatopoeia. And yet he tries to claim that certain signifiers are non-arbitrary because we evolved in certain ways. This is just a glaring example that implies, to me, that Pinker used his data to fit his conclusion. Bad science booohissss.But while these problems call into question his work and method, it's still a work I have the utmost respect for, and that everyone interested in language, whether liquored-up French deconstructionist or icy positivist, needs to read."
6,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Previously, I had read Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought"", which is also an excellent book. I enjoyed that book, so I next read this one--and I'm glad I did. ""The Language Instinct"" is an absolutely fascinating book! The author presents some very convincing arguments, that the acquisition of language is an instinct that has evolved over many generations, through natural selection. Steven Pinker is right on the money, when it comes to his analysis of evolution. Every chapter is compelling, and each chapter investigates language from a different perspective. In both this book, and in ""The Stuff of Thought"", Pinker investigates why so many seemingly irregular word usages are not irregular at all. Often we instinctively use words and phrases that seem illogical, just because ""it sounds right."" Pinker shows the logic underlying the usage--and each time, I just have to say, ""oh-my-gosh--of course!""  "
7,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1107219-jimmy,5,"In The Descent of Man, Charles Darwin wrote, “Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children; while no child has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew, or write.” The experimental psychologist, Steven Pinker, took this quote as the inspiration for his book on – what he considers – the idea that there exists an innate language instinct to be found across all cultures. Elaborating on the canonical linguistic ideas of Noam Chomsky, particularly in regard to Chomsky’s Universal Grammar, Pinker presents the lay reader with numerous examples of how language acquisition, grammatical comprehension, and the tendency to speak, are all aspects of an innate linguistic tendency that human beings share, regardless of cultural background or specific language.Though Pinker generally agrees with Chomsky’s work on Universal Grammar, The Language Instinct focuses primarily on the idea that thoughts create language, a mental process that Pinker refers to as “mentalese”. This theoretical linguistic perspective is diametric to that of the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis, which suggests that language determines thought, and that the particular culture one belongs to is unique, in turn greatly affecting the way that a person communicates, utilizes language, and ultimately, perceives the world around them. In Chapter one, entitled “An Instinct to Acquire an Art”, Pinker covers the two opposing linguistic schools, and talks about Chomsky and his research on Universal grammar. Pinker begins his polemic on Whorfian claims about language coloring in human perspective by discussing Chomsky’s skepticism, concerning not merely the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis, but the “Standard Social Science Model” (SSCM) in general. Pinker, siding with Chomsky, feels that, not only is the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis wrong, but the basic intellectual stance that “the human psyche is molded by the surrounding culture”, is a dramatic misconception inspired by the SSCM. However, as we see later in the book, Pinker will part ways with Chomsky, ideologically. Though they both feel that grammar is a discrete combinatorial system; and is also a soundly structured tool with words and rules that human beings have an innate tendency to acquire, Chomsky is apprehensive about whether or not this language instinct, or gene, is part of the process of evolutionary adaptation. Pinker feels that the language instinct is similar to the human eye in that it has the appearance of design. In other words, the eye, for human beings, is a tool engineered with a very specific purpose. It has the appearance of design, and elements of an engineered tool, just like a camera, or an engine. The significant point that Pinker does take from Chomsky’s work is his claim that “the same symbol-manipulating machinery, without exception, underlies the world’s languages.” A chapter by chapter synopsis of a book of such layered complexity would become tedious after chapter 5. Everything from Broca’s Aphasia (which can cause language impairment), to x-bar theory (a theoretical version of phrase structure proposed by Chomsky that compares common grammatical rules and structures across different languages), artificial intelligence, prescriptive vs. descriptive grammar, and language organs and grammar genes, is covered in this erudite defense of Universal Grammar. These examples are useful to Pinker because they assist him in elucidating his rational stance on a language of thought. Logic-heavy gems such as, “And if there can be two thoughts corresponding to one word, thoughts can’t be words”, are peppered throughout the book. When he talks about x-bar theory, he explains how, “A part of speech, then, is not a kind of meaning: it is a kind of token that obeys certain formal rules, like a chess piece or a poker chip.” Pinker’s strongest arguments for a Universal Grammar or a language of thought, primarily concern phrase structure within sentences. Chomsky laid much of the ground on syntactic structures in his linguistic work in the 1960’s. But Pinker sees grammar as a technical aspect of language that “offers a clear refutation of the empiricist doctrine that there is nothing in the mind that was not first in the senses.” So, again, the book is covering a lot of linguistic ground concerning academic debates about what language essentially is, but for Pinker, an unabashed devotee of Darwin, The Language Instinct is also about how language is an innate tendency that undergoes evolutionary adaptive processes. He disagrees with the Whorfians and cultural relativists in the sense that he sees grammatical comprehension and language acquisition as innate tendencies. It’s not that he disagrees with the claim that culture can occasionally influence how people speak, or the way a language sounds. Pinker simply believes that there is a common capacity for speech and language utilization across all cultures, and it’s not that different. Again, he refers to the apparent design of language toward the end of chapter 10, entitled “Language Organs and Grammar Genes”, when he reflects, “I would expect the basic design of language, from x-bar syntax to phonological rules and vocabulary structure to be uniform across the species; how else could children learn to talk and adults understand one another.”  In the academic arena of linguistics, this debate between people arguing that language is an innate instinct and those that feel that language influences thought is slightly less prominent than it was in the past. In example, one of the strongest claims supporting the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis is that the speakers of the Piraha tribe of South America were incapable of using recursion (inserting embedded clauses within sentences ad infinitum) in their language. In 2004, Peter Gordon conducted an experiment consisting of various counting exercises in order to determine whether or not the Piraha were capable of counting exact cardinalities. He concluded that the Piraha had numbers for one, few, and many, but were incapable of remembering large exact numbers. Gordon’s experimental design was relatively crude, and he merely concluded that the Piraha couldn’t count that well under the conditions of the experiment. Since then, the linguist Andrew Nevins, along with his colleagues concluded that Piraha does allow for some recursive embedding using verb suffixes and conversions of nouns to verbs. It is also possible to conjoin propositions within a sentence, such as “We ate a lot of the fish, but there was some fish that we did not eat."" The debunking of linguistic myths such as the apparent absence of recursion in the Piraha language, are concrete proof that Pinker is on to something profound when he suggests an underlying linguistic design in human nature. One might argue that, throughout The Language Instinct, Pinker attempts to insert too many anecdotes from technical linguistics as well as from popular culture. The Language Instinct was one of Pinker’s first popular science books. This onslaught of information is understandable as he is a trained experimental psychologist trying to make technical linguistic explanations understandable to a lay audience. He does so with flying colors. There is also his Darwinist bent, along with the genetic approach to language research, which many traditional linguists (especially academic Whorfians, clearly) might find a little too reductionist. What stands out in this wonderfully informative book is Pinker’s basic, non-threatening theoretical stance that language is part of an adaptive process in nature. There may be notable superficial distinctions across different languages, but the basic structure of language and its apparent design is something that is utilized across all cultures, regardless of location, history, or linguistic origin. For Pinker, culture is not to be devalued or overlooked, but when lost in the cacophonous babel of world languages he opines, “I imagine seeing through the rhythms to the structures underneath, and sense that we all have the same minds.” "
8,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"A highly interesting book about how language came about in the human mind. It gets quite technical at times, but that's an added bonus for anyone who is truly interested in the subject."
9,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,2,"Interesting for its discussion of language and language acquisition. But: too many people take Pinker's word as gospel, when in fact his theories are quite controversial. This book also bears a lot of responsibility for the rise of pop EvPsych. Evolutionary psychology is a field that has a few worthwhile observations mixed with an awful lot of BS used to justify all sorts of learned behavior. So, read this book with a very large grain of salt."
10,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,1,"Pinker is as much of a twit as his hair suggests: The Language Instinct is a miserable pile of unsupported and unsupportable conclusions, straw man attacks, hypocrisy leap-frogging into doublethink, shoddy reasoning, knee-jerk contrarianism, indeliberate obtusity, and gut-feeling argumentation. Pinker tries to synthesize the ideas of people smarter than he is (Chomsky, mostly), and many of these are perfectly fine the way they were originally formulated; they no longer are after Pinker is through defending them, because he understands neither the ideas nor any arguments in their favour.As an example, do you remember the argument Dawkins once made, possibly in The Blind Watchmaker, about how very small changes can accumulate and turn into very significant results in a relatively small amount of time? He used a hypothetical population of mice that grew in average size by one percent every generation, and showed that within a few thousand generations — a mere couple of millennia! — those mice would be the size of elephants. Pinker tries to use this same story to show that small *selection pressures* can have significant results quickly:> ``Imagine a mouse that was subject to a miniscule selection pressure for increased size—say, one percent reproductive advantage for offspring that were one percent bigger. Some arithmetic shows that the mouse's descendants would evolve to the size of an elephant in a few thousand generations, an evolutionary eyeblink.''Which is obviously fractally incoherent, as he would have realised if he'd understood Dawkins's argument instead of just trying to repeat it to try to get a good review by him for the back cover (which he got), or even just tried to do said arithmetic. The sad part is that what he set out to argue is actually true; his bungled argument just undermined it.This is par for the course (there are more egregious examples, but this one stuck because it's Dawkins), and Pinker repeatedly fucks over his main thesis — that language is instinctive, which was as uncontroversial in 1994, when the book was written, as it is now — in the same way. Worse than that, though, he then tries to pretend that arguments in favour of this thesis mean that language is *nothing but* instinctive and, incidentally, uniquely human, and that ``therefore'' everything from linguistic prescriptivism to animal language to Sapir-Whorf to being interested in etymology is completely and utterly wrong-headed and obviously moronic, which he tries to back up by attacking caricatures of these things or, not infrequently, the character of the people involved.Anyway, other people have apparently done thorough jobs of taking apart The Language Instict, so I won't waste any more time on it. Not everything he says is wrong (stopped clocks and all that), and it's a lot like Penrose's The Emperor's New Mind in that some of the digressions are interesting enough, but the signal-to-noise ratio is so pathetically low that the book as a whole isn't worth your time. Read Chomsky instead; Pinker would claim he's saying the same things he is anyway, which demonstrates just how confused he is.Maybe it's just because TLI is his first book. Elsewhere in my to-read stack is his most recent one, The Stuff of Thought; we'll see how it compares. I'm not holding my breath. Ultimately, the problem isn't that he was new to writing, because he wasn't; it's that he's a psychologist, and not a real scientist."
11,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,4,"A good portion of this book can be summed up in the relatively simple graph that was making the rounds on Twitter a while back: https://twitter.com/robdrummond/statu.... However, Pinker is a good enough writer that reading about the issue in book-length format rarely feels boring, as he throws about a plethora of interesting examples and anecdotes to illustrate the point. What’s more, the book skips around quite a bit, covering just about every aspect of general linguistics I could think of that actually interests me – how language works, how it was created, how the brain produces it, how various internal and external processes shape it, etc.I do have objections, of course, one of them being that for a book that very loudly proclaims to be about language in general, it retains a strong English-leaning slant – there is quite some talk, for instance, about how English spelling is an optimal system of representing speech vocalizations on paper, which comes off as a really weird claim to someone reared in a writing system with a phonetic alphabet/script (Serbian Cyrillic, and to an extent, Serbo-Croatian Latin).The segment on Chomsky and the structure of deep grammar/mentalese also suffers quite a bit in audiobook format. The narrator really makes an effort, but some of the structures described, while probably quite clear at a mere glance at a hand-drawn diagram, become an impenetrable forest of P(NP)VPs when read out loud.On the other hand, the majority of the objections I saw here, glancing through the comments, boil down to either “boo-hoo, I disagree with his views, therefore this is a bad book” or “Pinker’s presentation is simplistic cherry-picking of straw-man arguments”. Well, one may disagree with what he’s saying, but Pinker does mention very specific sources and research his arguments lean on, and my humble academic experience with some of the opposition to his views leaves me inclined towards aligning with the theories presented herein. As for simplistic? Probably, but this is not a university textbook, so I don’t see the problem. He does what he meant to do, present an overall state of play in linguistics at the time of writing for a more-or-less lay audience. My edition also has a neat addendum at the end, where he looks back after more than a decade has passed, and discusses some of the changes and reactions to the contents of the book."
12,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"When it comes to something I don't know much about, I'm pretty easily swayed by other people's arguments. Like, I finished this book feeling it was pretty intelligent and interesting, and then I read some criticisms and reviews and heck, I don't know what to think. Still, I did find it interesting, and while the book looks deceptively slim for how long it took me to get through it, Pinker expresses his arguments clearly, with examples and sourcing, etc. His basic argument is that we're hardwired for language. That, as with our sight, hearing, etc, we have a 'language sense'; if properly stimulated during the critical period, our brains quickly figure out how to parse language (at least, the language spoken around us when we are at that age, even if that language is sign language). We don't need to hear every word or possible sentence structure (couldn't possibly) to pick up on the rules of grammar and apply them, when speaking and when listening. This only refers to the critical period; a child will learn grammar instinctively on being exposed to a language, but an adult must learn it by rote, in the same way as you have to learn to process visual input during the critical period for that, or you'll never have the same visual acuity as someone who did.Thus far, I think I'm going along with him. I do have questions of a sort of chicken and the egg nature: which came first, the brain's Universal Grammar module, or language that necessitated it? I'm inclined to think that the structures that we now use to understand language were used for something else earlier in our evolution, and became co-opted into our communications array (so to speak) over time. Our brains formed language, and then the language formed our brains...All in all, I don't know whether Pinker's right, but I found his work convincing. Having read a couple of other books on language, including Guy Deutscher's 
Through the Language Glass
, and applying what I know from those too, I find it hard to disagree with Pinker even where I want to, for example about relativism."
13,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2432122-joseph,1,"Given the current divide in linguistics between the Functional/Cognitive theoretical approach to language and the formalist, generative approach which Pinker supports and has largely popularized with this book, The Language Instinct is an intellectually irresponsible endeavor. He frames linguistic nativism as a non-negotiable fact when actually, there is a fierce debate within linguistics which is moving away from ideas of those like Steven Pinker and Noam Chomsky. The opposing school of thought argues that although the cognitive underpinnings of language are innate (having developed in evolutionary time), language itself is more like a new machine made out of old parts, which develops in social interaction and cannot be localized in any set of genes or related to any ""instinct."" Fraught with error, Pinker's pseudo-science is based on an approach that seeks not to fully understand the nature of real language as it exists, as it evolves over time, and as it is acquired by young children - but to rehash a pre-supposed view of language that was developed by ""linguists"" philosophizing as they sat in their armchairs in the 50s and 60s, fundamentally concerned with abstracting language into mathematical elegance rather than recognizing it for the complex system that it is. I highly recommend anyone who found themselves nodding at every turn as they read this book to read Tomasello's response ""Language is not an Instinct"" (to be found in full just by doing a google search). And I quote, ""At heart, Chomskyan nativism is a philosophical endeavor to discern by means of logic what is uniquely and innately human. Cognitive and Functional approaches are scientific endeavors aimed at understanding how people learn and use natural languages."" Couldn't have said it better myself.One star for effort, Pinky-Poo."

15,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1828815-anthony-buckley,5,"I had always supposed that linguists could not write clearly. Rather like psychiatrists who were mad, sociologists who couldn’t get on with people, and social anthropologists who were permanent outsiders, linguists, I supposed, devoted their adulthood overcoming their childhood difficulties with language. Here, however, I discover my prejudices overturned. Considering the inherent complexity of his topic, Steven Pinker’s book on language is witty, lucid and intelligible. Pinker’s theme is that people are born with an inherent capacity – an instinct – that enables them to construct language. In much the same way as they are programmed to learn, at appropriate ages, to walk, to tell jokes and to have sex, so people have an innate ability to learn to speak correctly. Around this central idea – derived from Chomsky’s studies of syntax – Pinker hangs a summary of some of the most important recent ideas in linguistics. The book therefore doubles as a textbook for a first year linguistics student and a good general introduction for a mildly interested beginner (for somebody like me). It is also a polemical book, for Pinker is not afraid to ride hobby horses and proclaim his own vision of the one true linguistics. He delves into the mysteries of Chomskyan deep structure, explaining that the grammar of particular languages are constructed from the inbuilt language-structure that is common to every person and every language. He defies the linguistic relativism associated with the names of Sapir and Whorf. He explains how people and animals think without having a language. He tells the story of deaf children in Nicaragua who were thrown together with older children who knew bits and pieces of sign language from a variety of sources, but who, from these bits and pieces, were able to construct a sign language as coherent as any other. He casts doubt on the supposed ability of monkeys and whales to speak human languages. He explores the biology that explains – or might explain – the instinct for speaking. He opposes those who fight endless wars against the split infinitive, the greengrocer's apostrophe and the final participle, claiming that their own version of English is the only correct one. And he does much more. The book is, in short, informative and intelligent. It is also a lot of fun. I see that a more recent book by Pinker has been nominated for the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction. Having just read this one, I am not at all surprised. "
16,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5130906-mikael-lind,4,"First of all, I am not a big fan of Steven Pinker. I found How the mind works erroneous on many accounts. That said, The Language Instinct is despite its uncompromising MIT cognitivist stance a fun and interesting read. To me, even the title reveals a general error; i.e. How the Mind Creates Language. The mind does not create language; human beings create language in an inter-subjective way. (Compare: brains do not think (except as metaphorical speech, not suitable for scientific writing) people think.) So be on your guard and do not accept mr. Pinker's arguments without reflecting upon them. This book is full of interesting facts and stories, but I would recommend anyone to pick up a copy of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations after having read Pinker in order to get a glance of the complicated reality outside the cognitivist nimbus cloud."

20,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8235372-may,5,"I just finished reading the most challenging non-fiction leisure book I have ever read: Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct. It was a close call, but I'm relieved that I powered through.Before I dive into my review, I'd like to clarify that I found it challenging not because my knowledge of linguistics prior to reading this book was terribly basic, but rather because there is so much information packed into The Language Instinct. That is, however, its greatest merit - and the reason why my mind was being blown after every chapter.In The Language Instinct, Pinker argues that humans' ability to acquire language is not dependant on education or imitation. Rather, it's instinctual. It's ""wired into our brains by evolution.""According to Pinker, ""evolution did not make a ladder. It made a bush."" That is to say, Pinker disagrees with Darwin's theory that we evolved from Monkeys.That's why computers will never be able to learn language the way a child could, and also why apes will never be able to speak English or Learn American Sign Language. Indeed, Pinker's research shows that those who claimed that laboratory apes' gestures resembled sign language were actually overanalyzing what they observed.Of course, there are many Darwinists out there who would shake their heads at such a thought (Pinker, however, is pretty convincing). All it would take, however, is the discovery of an evolved trait for an aesthetic, and not pragmatic, purpose, to defy the theory of natural selection.Anyway - because Pinker is trying to prove that language is an instinct, he begins at the roots of language acquisition. There is a lot of research on children. Such research is especially interesting when Pinker discusses 'creoles,' mother tongues that are developed as a result of several languages meshed together. The possibility of such 'meshing' suggests that an universal grammar underlies all language.The existence of a ""universal grammar,"" however, would not wholly verify that language is an instinct. After all, we have words for 'water' not because our DNA dictates it but because we need to refer to water. Neither is there a 'grammar gene - an American-born Chinese can just as easily learn English as his or her American peers. So, it seems that ""complexity in the mind is not caused by learning; learning is caused by complexity in the mind.""The Language Instinct is also in many ways a defense of language. Pinker argues that there is no reason to look down upon primitive dialects because primitive cultures have complex language systems and, after all, a language is also a dialect - just one with ""an army and a navy.""In his chapter on language mavens, a.k.a grammar nazis, Pinker also explains why certain grammatical errors are perhaps even preferable. For example, language mavens will argue that ""Who did you see"" should be ""Whom did you see"" or at least ""Which person did you see"" according to the rules of grammar. Yet can you imagine, Pinker asks, saying something like ""Whom did you sound like?"" Moreover, the final option (""which person"") restricts the 'who' from being an animal or multiple people.The Language Instinct is an enlightening read that leaves reader with a deeper understanding, and growing curiosity, of language. Pinker writes in a clear and sometimes almost conversational way that renders a PhD-worthy subject into one that general audiences can grasp. Of course, certain sections are utterly perplexing and almost impossible to retain. Above all, however, Pinker convincingly presents the thesis that language - contrary to what many believe - is instinctual.As he says, ""this is news."" If language is innate, much more could be; such a revelation would revolutionize the way we consider education, study the human brain and even assess the validity of Darwin's theory of evolution!!Factoids:- We are told that a noun is the most important part of a sentence because it is the doer; however, a noun cannot operate without verb. So, the verb is the boss of a sentence- Mentalese: the hypothetical ""language of thought, or representation of concepts and propositions in the brain in which ideas, including the meanings of words and sentences, are couched.- Listeme: an element of language that must be memorized because its sound or meaning does not conform to some general rule. All word roots, irregular forms and idioms are listemes. - When your tongue is high and at front of your mouth, you'll produce high-frequency sounds (e.g. e in teeny); when your tongue is low and at the back of your mouth, you'll produce low-frequency sounds (e.g. a in large). Now, this is especially fascinating when we consider words such as frobbing, twiddling and tweaking. To frob is to move a dial or switch by drastically adjusting its range; to twiddle is to adjust the switch by a smaller margin; to tweak is to adjust the switch by only a litte. Interestingly, it's always the word with the high front vowel that goes first in expressions such as ping-pong and chit-chat. Hip-hop, flip-flop, the list goes on... - English is an isolating language, meaning that you must say ""to go"" to indicate the act of going somewhere - two units are used to express one definition. The french aller, however, does the deed in one word. "
21,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11962530-krish,5,"Main takeaways:- Language is an innate skill possessed by humans and not acquired artificially through teaching like writing, programming, etc.- Although innate, the skill can be automatically learnt only during the critical period of up to 6 years of age. Beyond this age, it has to be artificially acquired like a second language.- Just one generation of children brought up by adults who speak a ""pidgin"" (a language lacking grammar and consisting of mere words from a number of different languages) is enough to create a ""creole"" (a grammatically rich language which borrows the pidgin vocabulary)- All languages share a Universal Grammar (which is the part of language learning that's probably innate in humans). Each language follows the super-rules of this grammar but has its own values for the variable parameters depending on various cultural and environmental factors. - Rules of grammar are only useful as long as they help resolve ambiguity and enable effective communication among humans. Rules like ""don't end a sentence with a preposition"" and ""use whom instead of who"" are bookishly enforced and serve no practical purpose.- ""English spelling could be better than it is. But it is already much better than people think it is. That is because writing systems do not aim to represent the actual sounds of talking, which we do not hear, but the abstract units of language underlying them, which we do hear."""
22,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,3,"I so so so wanted to like this book. I took one linguistics class and did a number of rhetoric classes so I thought that I would find this book accessible. I did not. I recognize the Chomsky language trees. I did see why the trees were so important to discuss top and bottom sentences and to prove how all humans are hardwired for language so that babies simply learn if their family speaks top or bottom sentences and SVO or some other construction. Yet all human languaget is obviously human. I get that. I wonder why Pinker wrote such a detailed argument, so detailed that my attention derailed, and I cannot read one more page of this book.So why 3 stars when I seem to hate this book? I do not hate the book. I am frustrated by the details. I plan to retern to this book at a later date and to read one chapter at a time and then put the book away for a month and then repeat the process until I complete the book.

25,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/472694-e,3,"Pinker is entertaining as he explains the basic tenets of language development for laypeople or beginning students of linguistics. He argues that humans do indeed have an instinct for language - for grammar, to be specific - unparalleled in other species, as one-of-a-kind as the elephant's trunk. This instinct driven by nature prevails over environmental or nuturing factors, though one can't take that argument too literally. Obviously, whether a baby speaks English or Zulu is determined by the family and community, but many so-called ""mistakes"" children make in grammar are proof of the brain's perseverance in calculating sentences correctly. My main disagreement with Pinker's argument relates to the beloved pasttime of descriptive linguists to bash ""the language mavens"" - i.e., teachers and writers who criticize certain styles of speech and writing. He is right that language is man-made; it is always changing and always will change. Every big change creates a dialect and no dialect is ""wrong"" or ""right."" Linguists can certainly contribute to socio-political progress in proving that Southern dialect, Ebonics, and the Queen's English are all grammatically consistent and equally rife with potential for creative expression. However, to argue that all languages change and therefore no one should care one way or another what is spoken where or when is dangerously libertine, for it ignores the significance of social subtlety and the value of skilled oratory and writing. If one uses a youth dialect variant at a job interview or a conference with the word ""like"" inserted before every adjective, verb, and noun, ""it will kill the pathos,"" as a professor of mine once said. Likewise, if one uses the Queen's English at a rave, you will be kindly asked to remove the pole from thine ass, and rightly so. Both linguists and writers should recognize that no language is ultimately superior to the other, but that social constructs do dictate what sort of language will be received well in what sort of context and to dismiss these rules is indeed to demonstrate social and aesthetic ignorance and/or arrogance. (See EATS SHOOTS AND LEAVES by Lynne Truss for more on that.)Some professors have dismissed Pinker's book as pop science, whereas others are of course excited about his giving the subject popular appeal. I've taken courses on linguistics, but I'm not a linguist, so I found it to be neither patronizing nor elite."

His premise is that much of what we consider to be learned in our early years as children,through practice with language, is actually pre hardwired in our brains as in an almost universal understanding of syntax that can get laid out in a number of different languages in a number of different ways. That the ways humans have developed to think of the world is inherent in our understanding of this language. I don't know if he made enough ""hard"" or solid arguments for me to buy into this completely. I don't know if he answered fully my objections to his argument. One being that could humans not have been able to pick up on patterns locally in their environment instead of this having to be factored in? The only really good counterargument to this would have been his description of deaf children and their own ""invented"" signs when not taught this initially. I would have like to have heard more of this but was still very impressed overall with the author and what he was trying to accomplish with this work and would definitely pick up another book of his.

31,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,1,"This review could be long or short. I wasn't sure if I wanted to waste the time, but it's a long book and there are some seriously interesting and seriously stupid things in it. It centers on the issue of language as learned or as instinct, which can be so fine an issue that most people really won’t care. For the short: it's very nice to see so much research on language presented and Pinker does a good job of explaining the often oversimplified theory that there is a genetic basis for understanding language (parts are probably split between your genetic code, but there is no one gene that controls all of it). But there is also some will-meltingly stupid material, like arguments that we can't have standards in our language because we can't judge whale songs and programming a useful speaking device wouldn't include commands like ""don't split infinitives"" because a screwdriver doesn't split infinitives. As he tries to illuminate how the brain creates language, the book is pretty interesting. As he tries to enforce his values, like that we shouldn't have any aesthetic consideration, he's worthless.Okay. That's the short one. Here’s a longer one.Pinker's central argument does nothing for me. That argument is that we have an instinct for creating language. You can construct sentences without thinking about the structure, and even when you babble you have a sense of when to pause for verbal grammar. Think of kids picking up swearing just by hearing it – they aren’t instructed in how to use it, but figure it out logically and intuitively. Since I already believe in this instinct and it seems pretty obvious that we do have it, an argument that it exists isn't impressive, though it was nice of him to collect so many anecdotes and studies that illustrate it to be the case. The best parts of the book are studies that show how versatile people are with language, like children picking up Pidgin or nonsense and converting them, within one generation, into grammatically sound modes of communication.The whole matter is kind of a bunk argument. Either our brains have an instinct for picking up and creating language, or we created languages that our brains are capable of picking up and using. If you think about it on those terms for so much as a minute, you'll get how silly the debate is. At best, both are partially true: we generate and imitate modes of expression that our brains can use readily. From the creation standpoint, why wouldn't we make something that's pretty close to what our brains can handle with unconscious ease? And from the instinct standpoint, why wouldn't we have instincts of some strength or other for the things that are created from inside our heads?Do we think about language or use it unconsciously? It’s obvious that we do both, though we wing it more than we plot it. It’s not an either/or problem, and that Pinker misses this almost entirely is sad. Parents help teach their children and foster language, from obvious examples like imparting the names for things and spelling of words, to what’s been found in recent scientific studies (not in this book) examining mastery of language in children who come from households with differing amounts of speech. Every day you probably struggle for words and consciously choose what to say at least some of the time – you know there is a conscious component to speech. There is unconscious and conscious education that he simply disregards because he's arguing for this instinct. Pinker choosing a side here feels like he's doing it for attention, and it's not as though this is the only time (in this book or academia in general) where it feels like his decision was unnecessary to the pursuit of truth.His side-arguments can get annoying. Sometimes he seems downright condescending on the intelligence of children and the deaf, and often he seems to skim rather than analyze evidence when it suits his arguments. For instance in the case of a Simon, a deaf boy whose deaf parents had improper signing that he did not pick up, Pinker makes serious assumptions about what he must have done with no evidence or even interviews with the boy in question to verify the conclusions. It’s not even anecdotal at that point; it’s conjecture, which does not belong next to the real research on Simon’s case. Conjecture is essential in analysis, but not like this, and not in making the ironclad decisions about the way minds work as Pinker does.By far his silliest argument is in favor of descriptivism over prescriptivism. Descriptivism is the school that describes how people speak; prescriptivism deals with how people ought to. Here, like in the bunk argument over using a language consciously or unconsciously, most intelligent people understand that language functions best when we mediate between the descriptive and prescriptive influences, changing the rules to better suit some things, but sticking to them for others. Being a scientist who observes, Pinker is interested in descriptivism as it shows the most about how we are inclined to speak and act in language. But being foolishly inclined to polar positions, he argues that we ought to only follows descriptivism and does it in downright stupid ways, like saying that we don't need a speaking machine is programmed to ""not split infinitives"" because screwdrivers already don't split infinitives. That’s moronic and if his opposition made a similar rhetorical move he would never allow it. His conclusions are that whatever we “get” by the language instinct should make up all the prescriptive rules, and that whatever we don’t make should constitute the rest. You know, in the way that we eat whatever tastes good, think whatever we like regardless of objective evidence and live in total anarchy without any government. Okay, those three examples are stupidity on my own part, but that’s what this pure-descriptive argument deserves. It comes from his oversimplified approach to language cognition, at first pretending that people don’t think or act in their education of language, and now proceeding that we shouldn’t think about how we’re going to use it or apply intentional value. That he quotes a Shakespearian character in defense his of anti-prescriptive campaign when that author taught writing seals the deal.Now before Pinker's fans get angry over the rating alone, if you hold your mouse button over the stars you see that each correlates to a statement. One star means ""I didn't like it,"" and for the fascinating research in the book, Pinker became too annoying and questionable at too many points for me to like his book. So it gets one star because, you see, they have prescribed meaning and are not just whatever you want them to be."

34,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,4,"In this very entertaining book, Steven Pinker has given a kind of overview and popularization of contemporary linguistics, as developed by Noam Chomsky. He argues that there is a language instinct, developed through evolution, which shapes how any human being acquires language. This is in opposition to the idea that we are blank slates, perhaps very intelligent blank slates, who learn everything from our environment and our culture. The Chomskyan idea is that all human languages have certain basic structures, such as noun phases and verb phrases, which small children seem to understand even as they acquire their native language. These structures are innate, according to Chomsky and Pinker, and are part of an instinct or natural capability for language which results from evolution.Pinker engages in a wide-ranging discussion of language which covers everything from phonetics, the inventory of raw sounds that are available to the human larynx, to language mavens, the self-described experts on language who want to be the arbiters of good grammar. I found the whole discussion fascinating, and I am trying to internalize the basics of Chomsky’s approach, so that I can go on to read some more technical linguistics.A couple of issues engaged me. One was the debate between a prescriptive approach to language and a descriptive approach, between those who argue that there is a grammatically correct way to speak (the way we ought to speak), and those who say that linguistics only describes how people actually use language. Pinker inveighs against the prescriptivists, saying that even small children have an instinct to use appropriate grammatical structures. He makes fun of the shibboleths of grammarians, such as not splitting infinitives, offering in each case an argument as to why the supposedly ungrammatical phrase exhibits an inherent grammatical sense.I’m not sure the boundary between prescriptive and descriptive approaches is so clear. If I am learning Spanish, say, then I want to know the rules for when to use the subjunctive. Those rules are normative, prescriptive, for me, even if there is some logic to whatever mistakes I make. Pinker could say that the rules are normative only in a hypothetical sense, that they are contingent on my wanting to speak like a native. But of course I do want to speak any acquired language, or my own language, as well and as effectively as possible. So, for practical purposes, grammar can be prescriptive as well as descriptive.Another bone of contention actually occurs between Pinker and Chomsky. Pinker argues that our language instinct is based on evolution. Chomsky has said that scientific factors other than evolution may have determined how we acquire language. To explain Chomsky, Pinker offers the example of a fish jumping out of the water and diving back in. Evolution may have developed the capacity to jump out of the water, but gravity determines that the fish will return to water. A linguistic example might be that acoustics, more than evolution, may have determined the inventory of sounds available to use in language. Pinker seems puzzled by Chomsky’s point, and specifically disagrees with it.My take is that there may be logical constraints on how language is acquired. Logic is a kind of science, like mathematics, but different from the empirical sciences. The grammatical structure of languages may have something in common with the logical structure of arguments. Perhaps there is no logical alternative to sentences containing a noun phrase and a verb phrase. If that is the case, then to that extent the constraint on language is logical and not evolutionary, although of course the two work hand in hand. I will have to read more to discover if my interpretation of Chomsky is plausible."
35,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1637858-dave-maddock,4,"Wow, a fair number of angry 1-star reviews of this book here on Goodreads. I suspect these are anti-Chomskyites or bitter social scientists who didn't like Pinker's criticism of relativism in the final chapter. Or possibly, johnny-come-latelys who are carrying over their critique from his later book, The Blank Slate. As a pop-sci overview of modern linguistics (ie. the whole point of the book), this is excellent.Some random thoughts on criticism: Within the field Pinker certainly has staked out his own position as a defender of many of Chomsky's ideas (Chomsky the brilliant linguist, not Chomsky the idiot leftist tool), but the only reason to whine about that and give 1-star is if you aspire to be the ideologue you claim Pinker is. After all, these ideas are fundamental to the field and this is a very well-written book. As it happens, I agree with Pinker's views but to prove I don't review along party lines like one of these jackass whiners, check out my review of The Mismeasure of Man where I take heat for defending Gould despite not swallowing his relativism wholesale. (Incidentally, Pinker criticizes Gould several times herein.) I think Pinker does an admirable job trying to transcend false dichotomies like nature vs. nurture, which is why it annoys me so to see such ignorant reviews criticizing him for doing the opposite."
36,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3719712-kevin,3,"Yes, this book has grammar trees breaking sentences down like you did in school. No, it doesn't hurt that much.Pinker shattered for me the conventional wisdom (for which he partially blames the Newspeak essay at the end of 1984) that language determines thought—""Mentalese"" is real. His tour of Chomsky's universal grammar and how the world's languages all share a similar underlying structure kept me rapt with the particular deconstructionist fever I sometimes get when programming. My assumptions about how much languages around the world differ also got exploded.The last third drags a bit when we go on a tour through both English's aphoneticism(?) and it's all its local dialects' various disregard for ""the rules,"" all to prove a point he hammers home over and over—that people use grammar with a higher degree of precision than most people give them credit for. He also leans a bit on the fact that engineers hadn't even imagined how computers might succeed in a real way at things like image recognition and generalized problem solving as evidence that the brain must have some very specific machinery to do so—a more difficult link to accept in the age of Google's burgeoning omniscience.There's also a clear lack of biological evidence for the kinds of structures we inherit genetically that he's positing play specific roles in parsing and constructing grammatical sentences, but that's not the fault of the science author talking about the bleeding edge of research—now I'm curious what more we've learned in the 20 years since!"
37,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215202-mark,3,"A book that tells you all that you might want to know about how humans are able to communicate with language. Pinker praises the work of Chomsky and tries to show that the fundamentals of language are built into the human mind, an instinct that is refined by our natural surroundings. He gives many examples of a fundamental grammar that all humans speaking whatever language have, which they use to organize sentences in their own language even if the sentence structures of two different languages are very unlike on another. He uses Darwin’s theory to show how language has evolved. Part of the book explains how sounds are made, while another explains as much as we know about how the brain forms sentences. One of his most interesting chapters shows that experts in a language that lay down the rules of grammar are no more experts than 5 year olds who converse with each other because language itself is ever changing. Many “rules” are no more relevant than if we kept the rules of old English. In fact he shows how these “experts” make rules that are counterintuitive to the language instinct. Overall the book is a bit technical at points particularly with his endless diagrams of sentence structure in the first half of the book, but Pinker does a very good job of explaining the intricacies of language to the masses."
38,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"(Based on the highly abridged audiobook.) Pinker's lively popularization of Chomskyan linguistics and cutting edge cognitive science elucidates the best available evidence for a ""universal grammar"" of the mind. (It is useful to remember, however, that this book was written in the 1990s.)Pinker's attempts at psycholinguistic theory are often quite amateurish and crude, since he clearly doesn't have in-depth knowledge of the field. His computational model of the mind, as well as his belief in the ""language of thinking"" (what he calls ""mentalese""), are somewhat mechanistic and lacking in data. But the overall project is a vital one, and the ease with which Pinker employs quotations from popular culture and Shakespeare to spice up his survey of the sciences is very ""edutaining."" The importance of making science fun is overlooked by many thinkers, who think that dry facts should do the talking. But how can we hope to convince people if we cannot even keep them awake? When a brilliant mind manages to synthesize decades of research, and make the reader enjoy the process of learning, the result is nothing short of mesmerizing."
39,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,4,"Very interesting, as with previous Steven Pinker books I have enjoyed, the author displays his admirable ability to gather together a lot of research/information in a wide range of areas into a coherent explanation - here supporting an innate human instinct to acquire and use language. Full of illustrative examples, apparently fair and balanced, well-constructed arguments here provide a convincing case without feeling biased or unjustly critical of counter arguments.My only criticism would be that I would have been convinced by a book half the length of this. It wasn’t necessarily over-long or difficult to get through, it just felt in places that certain aspects (the algebra and logic of linguistics especially) were examined in more depth than was necessary. Perhaps I needed less explanation and fewer examples than some readers, perhaps the author just wanted to speak at length about aspects he found particularly interesting, it detracted slightly from my enjoyment. Nevertheless I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this to anyone interested in the field. "

With each book we read, each conversation we have similar events take place. It is a process that most of us take for granted but try, for a moment, to imagine a world in which language didn't exist. What would we have lost?Steven Pinker is a genius, alongside Noam Chomsky and Stephen Hawking. His literary style is dense and required much concentration to penetrate but once I had resolved this conflict I was entranced and captivated by the world he showed me. Did a scientific explanation of language acquisition remove the wonder? No, it made it more intense and even more precious."

Not exactly light reading, though Pinker's dry humor makes it fun. His basic premise is that language is an evolutionary adaptation of humans to communicate information, just like wings are an adaptation of birds to fly, or gills for a fish to breathe underwater. For that I think he makes the case well. He's also very much anti-cultural relativism (one of my favorite quotes is: ""I hate relativism. I hate relativism more than anything else except perhaps fiberglass power boats."") I suspect he's exaggerating the point to make a point, but that makes it a much richer topic for debate, yes? If you love words, from how they feel in your mouth to the deep structures of grammar, you'll enjoy this book."

But I enjoyed the tone of the book, the methodical way the author explained his ideas, supporting them with examples and citations. He's also made Chomsky far more palatable than when we learned about his theory in class. "

I remember enjoying it a lot and finding the material utterly fascinating. When I was in college I wrote a major paper for a graduate seminar that was a review of the research into communication and language development in primates up to that time. When I read this book I truly enjoyed catching up with 20-some years of research and thinking on the topic of language acquisition. "

"
45,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33437121-tony,2,"Bit late to the discussion. The only question left to ask is one I’m not really qualified to answer: how well has the book aged over a decade and a half of psycho- and comparative linguistics? I’m not a linguist, but I know enough basic biology to sort the wheat from the chaff in a popular science book. Omit the chapters titled Grammar Organs and Language Genes, The Big Bang, and Mind Design. The general reader has probably forgotten more high school biology than these chapters rightfully explain. Besides, talk of a “language or a grammar gene” written before the important work in comparative molecular evolution of FOXP2 (read: Evo-Devo, Deep Homology and FoxP2: implications for the evolution of speech and language) and genomics in general is simply uninformative. Aside from that Pinker fails in his endeavor to wed evolutionary biology to a theory of a Universal Grammar. Instead, he summarizes a few basic concepts throughout these chapters—comically disparaging Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin as mere paleontologist and a geneticist in the process—and assumes the reader will make the logical leap to a grammar gene. Another tired chapter on the state-of-the-science of voice recognition machines can be summed when Pinker asks ""So why is it that a nation that can put a man on the moon cannot build a computer that can take dictation?"" As Tecumseh Fitch has it ""... discussion of the evolution of language often involve more speculation than data."" Symptoms of an unhealthy science. The Language Instinct draws two conclusions: language is unique to our lineage and there exists something called a universal grammar. It must be somewhat unusual that though Pinker’s ideas in this book are “deeply influenced” by Chomsky, Pinker is far better known to undergraduates, graduates and the general public (Richard Dawkins and WD Hamiilton are another example, I guess). The notion being Chomsky’s academic writing is unapproachable. That’s not to say readers won't encounter hurdles to understanding in this book. Pinker’s attempts at levity via popular culture quotes are as distracting as they are entertaining. His examples of grammar and syntax, which bulk up what should have been a slimmer text, are often so excessive and repetitive I’d lose the thread. One of these threads is that seemingly arbitrary regularities that occur in the English language (“John and I” over “Me and John”) are actually innate mechanisms instead of a transient cultural trend. Alternatively, he makes a convincing argument against a Pleistocene Ur-language. The good news, however, is that the author of a book on linguistics writes clearly and succinctly. The bad news is that Pinker does arrogant too well. The natural inclination to posturing in a non-fiction book is that it invites a death by a thousand cuts approach to a critique. For such a thick book (now with four throwaway chapters!), we are rewarded with intuitive arguments driven more by anecdote than data. This predicates explanatory imprecision and conceptual wrong-headedness. A chapter in the midst of all this, The Language Mavens, lively and satisfying, seems to foretaste Pinker’s 2014 book “Sense of Style: The Thinking Person’s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century.” As unreceptive as I am to Pinker’s posturing and condescension—all virtues for an anti-prescriptivist manifesto!—I now must read that book. "
46,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10769886-michael-noes,4,"I came for the science, but stayed for the linguistics jokes.In this book Steven Pinker challenged two related assumptions that I’d previously made about language: firstly, that the mechanics of one’s particular language must have a significant effect on their perception and understanding of the world around them (after all, we think and perceive largely in the context of our language, right?), and secondly, that without exposure to language we would “think” and “perceive” in some way that is quite different than what we could now imagine. Building on the work of Chomsky, Pinker argues against these notions, attempting to demonstrate that the languages we speak are more similar to each other, and innately reflective of our inner mental workings, than we might have realized. In other words, our brains determine our language (and not the other way around) because we are wired to develop in our thought and communication patterns in a certain way.Pinker explores the overlap shared by fields fascinating on their own (linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, human development), at times supporting his points with a microscope (down to the interactions between synapses) and at times using broad observations about the history of language’s usefulness for us as a species. A charming and informative book for anyone who does not find it a bore to think about thinking, read about reading, or talk about talking."
47,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,3,"This book is very similar to many others in the genre, such as John McWhorter’s The Tower of Babel, Guy Deutcher’s The Unfolding of Language, and Bill Bryson’s The Mother Tongue, all of which I’ve rated very high. But Pinker gets more credit for being one of the earliest in the genre, and he goes into more depth about the neuroscience behind language. In fact, this book covers an exhaustive range of topics, from Chomskyan linguistics, language processing, artificial intelligence, neurobiology, psychology, evolution, philosophy, politics, and prescriptive grammar. His expertise in all these topics is impressive, and he makes a very persuasive overall argument – that the human mind has built-in modules for specific language-related functions, rather than being born with general purpose hardware that is programmed by its environment. However, this book just didn’t hook me the same way John McWhorter did. He covers so many topics so quickly that it’s hard to get into it. He does give entertaining examples, and style is swift and humorous, but he fell just short of satisfying me. I guess it’s like having a cup of coffee with one cube of sugar, after getting used to coffee with two cubes. It feels like a tease. Some of the topics he covers deserve a whole book, and in fact, he does have books about those topics – How the Mind Works, The Blank Slate, The Stuff of Thought, Words and Rules, and others. I will definitely be reading them."
48,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/342436-chris-friend,4,"This one was recommended to me by Ben, and he was spot-on in thinking that I would find it both interesting and enlightening. I cracked open the book thinking that it was going to be just another discussion of linguistics, but it ended up dealing a heckuvalot more with neurology and human behavior, drawing particular attention to the interesting tendencies that we humans have built-in for the construction, use, and comprehension of spoken language.The author seems quite fair in his broad-based approach to dealing with a wide variety of subject areas and approaches -- it was impressive how often sign language was used as a reference. (Side note: I found it particularly surprising to hear a linguist give so much credit to the design, style, and mentality of ASL. Taking a couple courses in the language in college, I was vaguely aware of the specificity of its grammar, but I had no idea it literally impacted the human brain the same way audible speech does.)In contrast to the Ramachandran book I recently read (and despised), this text found a great balance between examples, scientific terminology, and illustrations/explanations/examples in layman's terms. It was both approachable and informative, something I'm not accustomed to finding in a nonfiction book.Definitely worth looking into. Chad's getting it next -- this is right up his alley."
49,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5892502-katya-epstein,4,"Probably the best book I have read on the topic. For starters, Pinker's writing is a pleasure to read: It's clear, clever, and affable. He writes the way he talks; he doesn't seem to feel the need to use fancy words just because he's writing a book (e.g. from the glossary entry for stem: ""The main portion of a word, the one that prefixes and suffixes are stuck onto."" He avoids that (inexplicable) academic affectation of pretending that the author and the reader don't exist (i.e., avoiding the first and second person).And he covers more than just language itself: This book is also a not-bad introduction to evolution, genetics, the brain, and cognitive psychology. Lots of interesting stuff here.That said, I was not completely convinced by all of his explanations (I still don't understand ""trace"") and arguments (I'm not convinced that the ability to read and write is not hard-wired to some extent in some people). And it was published in 1994: A lot has been learned since then about how the brain works, so some of his info might be out of date. Also the index leaves a lot to be desired."
50,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker breaks through the superficiality of language to touch on something deep inside all of us.He gives a language lesson that isn't boring at all.I have been reminded in my daily life of many observations made in the book.The thesis of the book is simple and well defended throughout:Human language is an instinct.Vague aspects of human language, like communication and symbolism are common in the animal kingdom.But each different human language is a quirky, fanciful creation.And the drive to generate these languages is instinctual.To my glee, Pinker demonstrates stupidity of ""linguistic determinism"".He also defends the sensibility of English spelling, and legitimacy of Ebonics grammar.He does a bit of underhanded trash-talking to so-called ""language mavens"".It's nice to clear up linguistic mistakes, but he might have gone a little too far by naming names and levying insults.But if I were him, I'd probably be frustrated, too.Most importantly for me, I found myself trusting Pinker for his constant practice of backing up his claims with solid evidence, usually in the form of multiple language examples or simple try-it-yourself language experiments."

(It's a sort of semi-parody of the first sentence of the book).Let me tell you this. When a bunch of reviews say that a book is funny, it turns out I never laugh. I did not laugh reading Don Quixote, Catch-22, or even Mark Twain's stuff. So, you can say I am a humorless jerk. And, it just so happens that the first book I actually laugh out loud at is a book about linguistics, of all things.And, just because a book is a popular science book does not mean you're going to find some 14-year old reading this book. Yet, somehow, I'm 14, I somewhat like science, and I read (and really loved) this book. I must admit that language is  definitely  something we're all fascinated by, yet we can never get satisfactory answers for our questions about language. After all, this is science we're talking about, and science can never really end because the things nature has dreamed up of are so complex, yet so purposeful."

First of all, it is way too long and technical to qualify for the usual pop science non fiction. Steven Pinker would definitely benefit from the good editor (unless this was deliberately done to provide hefty volume for more money). There are very few groundbreaking theories or ideas here, just the repetition on and on of the same ones. The author likes to introduce certain idea, then provide evidence based on different (almost all anecdotal) examples: babies, deaf people, people with injuries and other diseases of the brain. And this pattern is repeated throughout the book. Also, that is most frustrating, numerous grammatical rules and structures are explained ad nauseam to illustrate whatever theory he is trying to push. You feel that author tries to literally hammer his ideas into it with all the available force of boring grammar rules. I forgot to mention that this is an excellent sleeping aid!

I was looking mainly for the information about how the language evolved and how it is still evolving - and there's plenty of that in the book, too. I really enjoyed it. It is well written and entertaining, but it is also quite often unnecessarily long, at least for a pop-science book. I get the point after a few examples, and I was getting tired with reading through dozens of long passages, all presenting the very same mechanisms and all proving the very same points.

Highly recommended.3 Jan 2015 update: After speaking with a person who has done a lot of work in computational linguistics (thanks Bob) and examining some of the central claims in this books more carefully, I must admit that I am no longer persuaded by Pinker's arguments.

I get that some nuance must be subtracted when technical information is summarized so that outsiders can understand it. But he so frequently speaks in black-and-white terms that I find it difficult to trust his analyses. Sometimes he almost sounds like he's giving a pitch, like he's trying to sell science because he's worried it will disappear otherwise. The book certainly has panache, but in the end I think it would have been more convincing if Pinker were not so allergic to words like ""perhaps,"" ""almost,"" ""sometimes,"" and ""on the other hand.""

It was a bit dated in places, but I think all that really suffered was the pop culture references and examples. The theory and research examples held up.I enjoyed how the author gave examples and explained theories that were broader than language to put his language thesis in context. I did not particularly enjoy how the author gave 15 examples for each type of phrasing he was referencing. I get it after one or two. I was listening to an audiobook version, so instead of skimming the text after he started in on the repetitions, I listened, feeling silly when my family walked in to a recording of a guy just saying random sentences.Though the book was first published in ~94, the version I listened to had an update that acknowledged the passage of time and updated affected chapters."

All human beings possess an instinct to acquire, use and comprehend language. We do so by employing our innate combinatorial cognitive system - the same system that lets us navigate through the world.Pinker takes the reader on a reading mission through grammar, morphology, phonetics, language pathologies, language & thought, anthropology, biology & evolution, and much much more. At times, it may stray a bit too far from the main point - our language instinct - but these paths lead to interesting topics that I would not have considered, had I not read this book.I rate it 5 out of 5 stars thanks to its vocabulary, insightful explanations and ways of conveying information about language and cognition, and its scope - covering a wide range of interesting topics."

What strikes me as interesting so far is that this would be a really great book for someone who's just getting into linguistics, and yet it's also great if you're already familiar with all its principles. An added bonus is that I'm starting to suspect a lot of the material for the linguistics course I'm taking this semester seems to have been lifted directly from this book...It's a fun read. Steven Pinker kind of seems like the Willy Wonka of linguistics. They should put that on his next book cover."

Maybe it wasn't the best idea to read a book about heavy-duty linguistics while also taking two classes about heavy-duty linguistics. Some parts of this book were a little thick to get through (and my BA is in Linguistics). I remember it being more accessible the first time I read it and I wonder if I somehow got my hands on an expanded edition (I read it on my Kindle this time so it would be hard to tell if it's thicker than the edition I read before).Still a great book, though. Spend a whole class on each chapter and it just about adds up to my undergraduate degree."

For a book on language, Steven Pinker has a lot of general information to offer, whether psychological, neurological, biological, or otherwise. Prior to reading I was warned that the chapters on descriptive grammar rules were torture, but I actually really enjoyed them... despite being a little harder to digest than the rest of this well-written book, Pinker's down-to-earth approach gives readers the basics and then branches out on them in a manageable and surprisingly interesting way. A must for anyone even mildly interesting in learning why humans learn language."

Although for the life of me, I can't remember what they were now. Maybe that Eskimos don't really have 1,000 words for snow?

Many of the concepts in this book were familiar to me as a student of Linguistics but it is a great start for anyone interested in learning more about language and the mind itself. Many critical questions are answered and confusing topics are explained in detail. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I will surely be picking it up from time to time as a growing linguist. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in language and the mind."

Pinker's deep understanding of language acquisition is related so clearly that even people who don't consider themselves grammar people would doubtless be able to grasp his points. Of course, the more deeply you love and/or study language, the more you'd appreciate this.

86,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32043273-ellery,1,"This book was absolutely insufferable but before I get into it let me first be up front that I only read closely chapters 1-6, read quite quickly chapters 7-8, and then skimmed through chapters 9-13. After you read this review, you'll understand why I had no choice but to skim through the second half.As a language lover, a teacher of English and Chinese, and a speaker of English, Chinese, and German, it's been on my reading list for a long time. I finally got around to reading it and after reading just a few chapters I was astounded that this is a best seller. Pinker continually makes enormous claims that aren't adequately backed up. Continually, he bounces around from one assertion to the next without any coherency. His overall writing style comes off as pseudo-academic, to be frank. Pinker constantly mentions Chomsky in virtually every single chapter. Ironically, Chomsky doesn't think much of Pinker. If you listen to his interviews on Youtube, Chomsky has some somewhat strongly worded things to say. He describes him as ""intelligent,"" ""a friend,"" ""who has done serious work in psycholinguistics and cognitive science,"" but beyond that, Chomsky just contrasts what can be made of the gobbledygook Pinker produces with others who have done ""serious work."" That's a real damning review from Chomsky. However, the main reason I couldn't seriously closely read the second half of the book was because of inaccuracies; I feared I would be learning incorrect information. He mentions the Chinese language several times in the first half dozen chapters, and a majority of the time is just flat out wrong. He writes, ""English speakers correctly guess that in Chinese ch'ing means light and ch'ung means heavy."" Not using pinyin aside, that's just flat out not true. Depending on not only the tone but also the character, the meaning of the utterance can change completely. It gets worse. A couple chapters later, he writes, ""In some ways, a morphemic writing system has served the Chinese well, despite the inherent disadvantage that readers are at a loss when they face a new or rare word."" Readers are hardly ""at a loss"" because characters are made up of different radicals that can tip one off to the meaning. But Pinker doesn't know that because he hasn't actually learned any Chinese. (In fact, he hasn't learned any foreign languages.) He goes on, ""and many documents that are thousands of years old are readable by modern speakers."" This is absolutely shocking because it is in no way true. Texts from thousands of years ago are nothing like modern Chinese. Classical Chinese is not understandable to modern speakers of Chinese. They have to learn it just like how native speakers of English would have to learn Old English if they wanted to understand it. It is for all intents and purposes a completely different language even if there are a few remnants of Classic Chinese in modern Chinese. It is amazing to have such an enormous oversight in a best seller and from someone so famous. This is the main reason I had to stop reading the book closely and just skim the rest. I can't really take seriously anything else he says in the book given these massive oversights about Chinese. Naturally, my fear is if he's so flat our wrong about almost everything he says about Chinese, how am I to believe other claims he's making about things I'm not educated about?To return to what I was saying about style, I should mention there's also no important context to the mentions of Chinese in those chapters. He bounces around randomly writing about different examples and never ties in the important pieces to really say anything interesting. I keep asking myself ""But why should I care about this?"" Sometimes chapters would end and it just seemed like he got bored and stopped writing there randomly. I assure you this is not because of my own lack of intelligence, although I am sure Pinker fans would be quick to make that claim. Rather I think it's because Pinker is a stylist. He's a master at seeming brilliant, when in reality, it's mostly hogwash presented as valuable insight.I will admit that there is a possibility that I am also simply not interested in the math and science of language. I am much more interested in how it is acquired, how we can learn it better and more quickly as adults, problems in the FL classroom, TPRS and Krashen's comprehensible input theory, and other topics. Musings about random linguistic related topics that really just make your eyes roll isn't something I'm interested in reading. So I do take responsibility for what I like and the style of writing and presentation I personally care for. That is indeed subjective. I could see how this style of writing would appeal to others. That said, the inaccuracies are too numerous and so you can't really recommend this book to anyone.I have to warn people considering reading this book. It is essentially pop science littered with false information. But don't take my word for it. Just trust Chomsky. He did, after all, imply that Pinker's books are not ""serious work."""
87,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"I think this took me long enough.In my defense, I'm kind of stupid.So he's convinced me that humans have a language instinct. And it's not arrogant, it's just objective observation in the same way that one might observe that bees have an instinct for understanding waggle dances.I also like all the take downs of prescriptive grammarians who think knowing about splitting infinitives and ending sentences in prepositions makes them better than everyone else, because I'm petty and insecure, so I can't wait until my brother corrects me for saying ""everyone got their dinner,"" and when he says ""his or her dinner,"" asking him to correct, ""I served everyone dinner before you even seated them.""My one teensy-weensy niggle, and it's more in the spirit of science - when someone lifts their hypothesis up, anyone and everyone is duty-bound to take shots at it - is that while I agree he showed humans have a language instinct, I feel like he also claimed no other animals do. And his discussion of that is that we look at chimpanzees and bonobos, expecting to find similarities in everything, even though our most recent common ancestor is maybe ~7mya. He compares it to elephants with their incredibly talented noses looking tirelessly for similar rudimentary talents in tapirs or whatever extant animal elephants are most closely related to.What's the problem? Nobody said that because the most closely related living animal doesn't have it, you're unique. Alex, that damned bird, understood a thing or two, and his most recent common ancestor with us lived in the Triassic or late Permian. I'll grant it's nothing like our complexity, but noun plus verb = grammar. And adjectives tied to nouns are noun phrases. What that animal was doing revealed something going on in his mind that could map sound labels to meaning in groups. That's language. Or proto-language. Or something. I mean, he was constructing original combinations to get what was inside his brain into somebody else's!So debunking Koko (I yield to Pinker, because I honestly don't know enough about Koko's signing to know if the many skeptics or the many believers were right) doesn't disprove non-human language. Granted, it's easy to take the non-falsifiable position that ""nobody has shown non-human language doesn't exist,"" so I will take the slightly more falsifiable position that at least some birds can apply abstract labels to meaning in noun and verb combinations. That crosses the threshold for language, IMO.And I think it makes sense, evolutionarily, since bird calls apparently accomplish a lot in a bird's life. Species identification, individual identification, tribal identification, alarms, etc.Omigod. Dinosaurs can talk."
88,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34358091-fred-gr-n,5,"Having a master's degree in linguistics, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what linguistics is about, while keeping in mind that this is of course not exactly a linguistics textbook since the author is taking a stance. Unlike a linguistics textbook, though, it is incredibly pleasant to read. I really enjoyed the way in which Pinker takes you on a ride through all the most important and the most interesting questions of the field. I think it's an excellent book to promote linguistics and it makes you realise - or reminds you of - how incredible language is even though we tend to take it for granted. I'm also grateful for this book's contribution to dispelling widespread myths about language like strong Whorfianism, absurd prescriptive rules or the incoherent views of ""language mavens"". Thank you Steven Pinker for stepping in! If you really wanted to study linguistics on your own, though, you'd have to go for a proper introductory textbook. Also, if you're looking for a scholarly book about innatist theories of language, this book is not for you. It is more of a fun (but serious) introduction to linguistics through an innatist lens.One of the most common criticisms I've heard of is that Pinker is presenting his views as ""fact"" when they are in fact quite controversial. I don't agree... Most of what appears in this book is what you'd learn in a linguistics 101 class and it is not Pinker's responsibility to make sure his readers are competent enough to notice that he is sometimes taking a stance and sometimes just explaining the state of the art. In the former case he's using arguments and in the latter just stating facts and I think the difference is clear. This book is called ""the language instinct"" so, yes, it argues that language... is an instinct. There are countless references for each chapter at the end of the book. If you want to further investigate the question, just go for it. You may criticise Pinker's theory (many linguists have) but claiming he is ""presenting controversial views as facts"" is, in my opinion, an unwarranted accusation."
89,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70100482-zo,4,"Informative and entertaining. Can get a little repetitive or tedious at times, especially on minutia of linguistic/anatomical information, but also has some sections that are great for stimulating thought about the nature of the human mind & language. The book didn't probe the philosophical complexities of the relationship between cognition/language and the origins of language as deeply as I'd hoped, but I'm unsure if that's the books defect or due to a correct assessment of what has real epistemic grounding. I am very curious to hear about criticisms of the book and how the science has changed/updated since its publishing. Instead of the more philosophical approach the book abounds in fun/quirky details about various aspects of language usage. I particularly enjoyed the section commenting on typical ""grammar Nazi"" tirades. My favorite sections were probably speculating on the origins of language and some of the information on the developmental psychology of language learning. Would like to learn more about how the ""modularity"" of language contributes to its relation to cognition, and how it could fit in with an account of consciousness like Carruther's (this is where I think more ""deep"" questions arise).
