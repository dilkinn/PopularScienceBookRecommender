0,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy,5,I’m not what you would consider a science-literate person. But I thought this book was well-written and thoughtful. There should probably be some warning for readers though that the subject of coercive sex is brought up in the animal kingdom. 
1,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1497559-jayaprakash-satyamurthy,4,"This is a thoughtful, informative book that doesn't really achieve what it sets out to do. It seeks to show how we became uniquely human. But the first 2/3 actually shows how many of our attributes including tool use, fire use and different kinds of sexual behaviour are seen elsewhere in nature. In the last 3rd, Rutherford traces how we got here by looking at genetics, palaeontology and more parallels from animal behaviour. Ultimately, he suggests, our sociability and urge to communicate allowed us to create the rich culture that sets us apart, but it's not an especially compelling argument, as presented. I found myself thinking back to Frans De Waals' wonderful Are We Smart Enough To Know How Smart Animals Are, and Rutherford himself acknowledges that our differences from other animals is of degree, not kind. Ultimately, a fascinating survey of evolution with some very recent research included - like the 2018 discovery of art produced by neanderthals - but not a persuasive case for human exceptionalis's causes (much of which might be down to chance - we're hardly the first species to dominate the planet)."
2,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"To say we have dominated the globe would be an understatement. We have conquered the highest mountains, reached deep into the oceans, become one of the few mammals that can fly and even been in the unique position of having had a select number of people leave the planet when they ventured into space. We tend to think of ourselves as exceptional, but are we? When you look at it from a bigger perspective, we are a single twig on a four-billion-year-old family tree that has countless species and lots of dead ends. All of these from a single origin with a code that is the very heart of our existence; DNA.Rutherford considers all the things that make us distinctive such as speech and communication, tool creation, art, fire, social skills and how sex has gone beyond just being for procreation. But if you look hard enough at the other species that we share this world with you can find traces of these habits where they exist. There are examples of tool usage in other primates, birds and even dolphins. He explains how raptor in Australia have learnt to move fire from one part of the landscape to another and where weapons have been used by all sorts of animals. He discusses how the various types of sex that it was only thought that the human race participated in also exist in other creatures and it makes for grim reading at times.Our genes are a map and a history of our past. Looking into its mysteries can show all sort of things, like where genes that affect language are and what they do, just how much of us is Neanderthal and how many bits of our DNA we have acquired from elsewhere. We have come to dominate the rest of the world though, even though our roots are common. Even though he is rooting through the history of our cells, this books is just what a pop science should be; accessible, understandable and intriguing enough to make you want to go and discover more about certain aspects of the text. Another book that is well worth reading from Adam Rutherford."

4,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,This was a very interesting read. There is a lot of science in this book but it is explained in a easy format for a general audience. What the books asks is What Makes Humans different than Animals?If it is not culture then what?. The book goes on to explain than what we consider traits of human culture has also been found in different species in different times. Many animals have all the physical equipment to communicate but they dont ...then what makes humans communicate?. The conclusion of this book is that the main difference between humans and animals is not the lack of culture but the ability to instill that culture to our offspring.
5,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12086858-yousif-al-zeera,4,"I have no concrete scientific background other than casual readings into science. This book didn't disappoint my 'scientific ignorance'. An enjoyable pop science book right from the beginning. Lots of interesting examples from the animal kingdom on various topics. Definitely convinced me to have a look at his other books (and his shows!) I had yet to check out his show at the BBC but from his writings (and his narration being the narrator of the book as well), I can feel how great would be his shows."
6,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,2,"Rutherford writes well. However, the Book of Humans was often lacking in deeper explanations and sometimes frustrating when the author tries to avoid anything taboo. For instance, when discussing the causes of our motives and whether they may be for survival or reproduction he didn't explain the invaluable distinction between ultimate and proximate causes. Although it's very readable, I wouldn't recommend it unless you only wanted to dip your toes into evolution and animal behaviour. "
7,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72945589-illiterate,1,Ultimately Rutherford tells us we are special. The usual anthropocentric hubris.
8,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Human beings share a common ancestor with all of the other living species that can be found on the Earth. We therefore have much in common with other creatures. Yet, there’s also something that sets us apart. Perhaps the most obvious is that humans are far and away the most narcissistic of nature’s creations, thus we want to read books about the traits we have in common with other animals and things that make us unique. Humanimal: How Homo sapiens Became Nature’s Most Paradoxical Creature—A New Evolutionary History by British geneticist, author, and broadcaster Adam Rutherford is one such book and it covers pretty much what you’d expect: tool use, brain size, fire, agriculture, language, and violence. What he finds is also pretty much what you’d expect: other animals use tools but humans use them more, other animals communicate but humans communicate more, other animals are violent but humans are more so, etc. I would say that the only thing about the book that was perhaps unexpected, was the depth, breadth and abiding fascination Rutherford exhibits regarding animal sexual behavior (a topic which constitutes about a quarter of the entire book). We’re not talking about just the birds and the bees here … there are the bears, giraffes, elephants, apes, fish, lizards, hyenas and spiders. Now, I’m not saying the topic is unimportant. Life wouldn’t exist if species didn’t procreate. I am, however, questioning the extent of the treatment in a book dedicated to the similarities and differences of Homo sapiens from other species. I’m guessing the publisher told Rutherford that ‘sex sells’ and, nerd that he is, Rutherford figured that advice applied equally to bonking bed bugs. Anyway, in case you were wondering what the upshot is … animals masturbate but humans masturbate more.As for the “New Evolutionary History” advertised in the book’s subtitle, this consists of information regarding more recently discovered hominins such as H. naledi and Denisovans and their taxonomic relationship to modern humans (perhaps surprisingly, Rutherford neglects the specificities of the sex lives of these species, but I suspect this is only due to the fact that the fossil record is incomplete). Otherwise, I really have little to say about the book. It was fine, but didn’t really stand out in any way. Though it did strike me that Rutherford has an unhealthy fixation with the sex lives of species other than his own and shouldn’t rule out psychiatric counseling."
9,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/584274-kim,3,"What an intriguing look at the fine lines that separate humans from animals, and yet really, there is not a lot of distinction genetically. The descriptions of DNA and genetic codes were easy enough to follow, and yet at the end I found myself not really close to understanding the brilliance of science and nature. I believe the point of the book was to inform readers that despite the marvelous advances in scientific research, DNA coding, continual theory, speculation, and scientific experimentation, we are still a long way from discovering the ""missing link"" that made us evolve as we did, and continue to do so. It is as if the more we know, the less we know despite our best efforts to figure out the complete truth of why we are here and how we are as we are. I found the sections on sexual habits and evolution a little disturbing, and yet I know that was not the intention. They were matter-of-fact observations told in clear words, and they were not offensive, and yet it brings home the point that, really, acceptable behavior boils down to our thinking and mental process. It ties into specific current society as to what is considered acceptable and what is not, and it is also varied from country to country. I loved reading about the mystery of the evolution of language, and although I have studied a little of the history of cave paintings and Venus sculptures, this was a fresh look and more in-depth with knowledge that dates back to far beyond what I have learned in the past. I particularly like the fact that at the end the author states that he did his own research based on the work of other scientists and their works. It's really a compilation of pared down research done by others,. He does give credit where credit is due. This is a fascinating look at evolution. It is not a book that most people, in general, will pick up and read; it is not a light, easy, get-lost-in-the-story kind of book, and I am uncertain as to a true audience that will appreciate it. I did appreciate in the end, although I also found some of the science throughout a bit over my head. I am glad for a chance to read and review it. It is not a genre or a book I would generally pick up and read from cover-to-cover, but I did in this instance and I am glad that I did."
10,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5826011-dominique,4,"I love how this book as much seeks to bring arrogance about human exceptionalism down a peg or two, as it seeks to reinforce how wildly amazing homo sapiens scientifically, genuinely are from every other creature in existence on the planet. Of course, this answers no questions, but rather adorns and illuminates long-held speculations over what exactly, if anything, makes humans more special than any other mammal. The tone and style of Adam Rutherford's books are also just so readable; being a presenter, I don't know if there's something maybe in the fact that it's his everyday job to translate the high academia of genetics to laypeople, but he's so, so good at it. This is a short book, but once I started reading I couldn't put it down (even though I found that I actually knew quite a lot of the stuff anyway! I have pretty much listened to every single Radio show he's made and, er, I think a slight weird crush tbh??) "
11,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4482895-shabbeer-hassan,4,"A very well-written book on an oft-pondered upon issue - What makes us human? Is it our culture, ability to transmit and write stories or ability to develop tools? Rutherford makes a passionate case for us humans not being so different from the animals at all. We traditionally have been guilty of thinking us to be the pinnacle of an evolutionary ladder (nothing like that exists btw) and of late, anthropomorphising animals to such an extent that we start projecting human conditions/behaviour in them. Rutherford warns us about both, all the while reminding us that, we are in our own way unique, just like how thermophilic bacteria can survive in extreme environmental conditions or how meerkats live in social groups protecting each other. In the same manner, we are just humanimals, extraordinary, unique and fascinatingly quite similar in the same way as every other species is.My Rating - 4/5"
12,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71555618-canuck-mom-of-three,1,"It was probably a mistake to read this book right after finishing Yuval Noah Harari's exceptional Sapiens. The contrast between these two books could not be more stark. They both deal with similar subject matter, but where Harari is incredibly logical and coherent in the exposition of his ideas, Rutherford's book seems like a disorganized mish-mash of recycled bits from his various other writings. Reading this book feels like sitting next to a drunk intellectual in a bar. While his individual anecdotes may be interesting in and of themselves, there seems to be no clear overarching argument that is being woven into his narrative. After a few chapters, I am wondering why I should keep reading this book. "

14,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5208303-maxine,5,"The effort to distinguish humans from the rest of the animals has filled volumes since before Darwin took his fated voyage on the HMS Beagle: tools, war, sex habits, language. In his latest book, The Book of Humans: The Story of How We Became Us, geneticist Adam Rutherford looks at each of these things and how our behaviour is different to and often surprisingly similar to other animals. The use of tools eg. was once seen as the main distinguishing factor that made us unique but scientists have documented many cases of animals using tools, monkeys using twigs to get at hidden insects and, as recently as 2017, some birds of prey were seen picking up sticks from brush fires and dropping them in dry grass to drive small animals into the open for easy pickings. As to sex habits, it has been argued in the past that humans were the only animals that had sex for reasons other than procreation but that is no longer the case. As Rutherford points out, there are few sexual habits of humans that haven't been observed in other species - here, I will freely admit I now know more than I ever thought I needed or wanted to know about the sex habits of dolphins and otters - turns out they can be really big jerks in the sack.In the end, Rutherford shows we really aren't that much different from other animals except in our ability, not only to learn but to teach and not just our closest kin but strangers. He also shows how we haven't really evolved genetically from our ancient Homo Sapiens ancestors or even likely Neanderthal or Denisovans - they had a capacity for language, for art, for symbolism just as we do now. He posits that it was increased population rather than genetics that is responsible for the rise of civilization, that as populations increase, so does our knowledge and skill-sharing.Adam Rutherford has become one of my favourite science writers - he not only makes the science accessible to the scientifically illiterate like myself but, thanks to his use of humour, he makes it fun to read. The Book of Humans is no exception. It is well-written, well-documented, clearly explained and interesting. I would even call it entertaining, a word I'm sure most would agree is rarely used to describe a book of science. Thanks to Netgalley and The Experiment for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review"
15,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42058408-annette-jordan,4,"Evolutionary history and evolutionary biology are fascinating subjects, and in his latest book, Humanimal, author Adam Rutherford takes a look at what sets humans apart from the rest of the animal kingdom, and asks if we are truly as unique as we have been led to believe. Broadly speaking he looks at a variety of behaviours that are often regarded as uniquely human , ranging from speech and communication , to art and the use of tools and even sex for pleasure rather than procreation and finds examples from around the globe that show similar behaviours in animal species that will surprise you. It is fascinating to read about species of birds in Australia who have learned to use fire as a tool to flush out prey, or dolphins who use sea sponges on their snouts as protection when hunting. Rutherford clearly and simply breaks down how the genetic similarities and differences between humans and other animals may be less than many would expect, but they are enough to make us vastly different. Although the subject of the book is vast and complex, Rutherford does a wonderful job in breaking it down, and making it not just accessible but also fascinating to the lay reader with no background in the topic. “We transmit information,” writes the author, “not just via DNA down the generations, but in every direction, to people with whom we have no immediate biological ties. We log our knowledge and experience, and share them. It is in the teaching of others, the shaping of culture, and the telling of stories, that we created ourselves.”I read and reviewed an ARC courtesy of NetGalley and the publisher, all opinions are my own."
16,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8272524-david,2,"My mother in law keeps giving me BBC sponsored pop-science books to read and thinking that they'll blow my mind. Mr Rutherford (through his frequent subjective footnotes) appears to be that kind of liberal that is always trying to be more progressive than his neighbour. He rails against the usage of the word 'man' to represent 'mankind' to represent 'humans' to represent homo-sapiens and determines everything culturally appropriate to be 'natural' and observable in the natural world and everything society shuns to be complex unclassifiable animal behaviour (also known as gang-rape, infanticide, cannibalism).Yes, man is an animal, but he is also so much more. We have complex logic and reasoning, are capable of making irrational choices, defying instinct, spirituality and feeling shame. Part of being human means resisting damaging base (read as 'natural') instincts.The genetic theory stuff in the last 50 pages was interesting and the natural world is fascinating but not like this. Not steeped in agenda and cultural interpretation."

Generally, the author emphasizes that almost none of them are exclusive to humans, but are present in other animals. His point is that we differ in degree and not in kind.After that, the book was sex. This was incredibly long, and almost a third of the book. Not that reproduction isn't important for what makes us human, but this was way too long. And worse than long, often not that relevant. Pretty sure this section was more to grab attention than anything else. This ruined the book for me. I gave up after this point. I tried to come back to it later, but I just couldn't stand it at that point. I was also annoyed at the author's ignorance of evolutionary psychology. He bashed it a few times in a book, with incredibly basic and fallacious arguments that would be explained in the first 20 pages of any textbook. If you're going to attack a whole field, at least read a bit of it.It does have good things, and some aspects were interesting. But honestly, it presents the worse of the pop-science genre. Pick literally any other book on the topic and you will be much better off. "

30,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79965959-ana,4,"Even though this book touches on a myriad of complex and important subjects, it is actually a light read. It does have quite a lot of scientific jargon, but I believe it is actually easy to read as there are plenty of explanations as footnotes.One great thing about this book, and the way the author wrote it, is that it plainly states that scientific theories and hypothesis are not laws, they are just that, theories and hypothesis. Sure most of them have been proven by physical observations and evidence, but others are still just the most plausible and likely explanation for an event. It might be said that this invalidates science as a whole, but honestly it just shows what science really is, the study of our non-observable and observable world through trial and error, where there is room for new discoveries and for the creation of new perspectives upon the obtainment of new evidence. Moreover, it is absolutely great that there is a reference list to all the studies mentioned on this book at its end.My four stars definitely come from the fact that the book makes you take scientific hypothesis at face value. Not that the author doesn't have credibility, or that the authors and studies mentioned don't have credibility, but the truth is that reality is much complex. But then again, I did take every written word on genetics from this book at face value because I'm not exactly comfortable with this area to know most of its scientific debates. This question came upon the latter chapters when more archaeological evidence (especially concerning cultural aspects of the Palaeolithic) was mentioned. Because I have studied these studies and have discussed them several times already, I know that the majority of those discoveries, especially related to their depositional contexts and dating, cannot and should not be taken at face value. But also, archaeology does rely a lot on extrapolation and hypothesis from a fragment of what actually existed, so it is difficult for hypothesis to move beyond that."
31,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,4,"The basic idea is that humans are animals, but we have some sense that we’re “better”. The author delves into how we might claim distinctness. There are lots of interesting things here. The main issue is that it doesn’t quite hang together. And it seemed padded. There are (sort of) three chapters. The first is on tools, and it’s what you might expect. Lots of examples of how animals use tools, as well as a good definition of what a tool is. (Which is nice.) And some discussion about how and whether human use of tools are fundamentally different. The second chapter is on sex, which is not really something I had thought about before. He presents the fact that a very, very small percentage (maybe 1 in 1000?) of sexual encounters among humans actually result in babies. So in some sense, humans have separated sex from its evolutionary purpose. And that small percentage is even before you start counting things like anal sex, oral sex, masturbation. But then he gives lots of examples of how those things exist elsewhere in the animal kingdom. Plus necrophilia! Just the 5–10 pages he devotes to all the different meanings “sex” has for different animals is worth the price of admission! (One of my favorites: male bedbugs don’t bother to find a vagina---they just puncture a female and assume the sperm will find its way. And it does.) Then the third chapter is… well, a bunch of mini-chapters on art, language, genes, memory, and whatever. It was sort of startling the change in style. A surprising number of these mini-chapters end on the right-hand page, so that a whole page can be blank before the next one. As it is, the book is only 209 pages. I liked the first two chapters enough to give a positive review. But it would have been nice if he had better organized. And either found more to report, or just left it as a shorter book."

33,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38835862-sylvia-snowe,4,"A way of looking at evolution from the perspective of a geneticist. Something of a mishmash, but still, interesting and informative. I've read quite few books from neuroscientists such as Eagleman and Sacks, among others, and I find Rutherford's perspective on human behavior refreshing but rather skewed. When Rutherford compares animal sexual behavior to that of humans, he does it by looking at evolution and genes. Sacks, Eagleman, and others would discuss how hormones, tumors, injuries, birth defects, strokes, drugs, etc. might affect a wide range of behaviors, including sexual. Non-consensual sex is labeled as rape by culture, it's a matter of words and actions. Rutherford says that animals don't rape, but people do, and that's wrong. Well, male animals force female animals into sex, because...that's what they do. Humans do the same--in large part, because we are animals, and the animal part of the brain takes over sometimes. Often, maybe. But Rutherford, while discussing all the ways male animals coerce females, stops short of what human males do to females. Understandable, it's not a pleasant subject. And what does it have to do with genetics? Well, male humans still have testosterone that can overwhelm their sense of cultural manners, whether on a date, in bed with the wife, during war, or at a frat party, and if we acknowledge how our brains and hormones work, we could better understand ourselves. Men are no more than advanced primates sometimes, as are women. All we have to do is take our clothes off, and there we are."
34,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42152845-per-kraulis,3,"A nice read about several topics in the evolutionary history of humans. Since I have read several other books in this area recently, not much was new for me, but I think this is a good book for those who want an introduction. The writing is mostly fluid and easily read.Towards the end of the book he poses the question why humans reached ""modernity"" (by which he means, I think, a material and artistic culture that produced artifacts) much later than Homo sapiens became clearly the same species as we are today. That is, why the lag time? His interesting suggestion is that it has to do with population size. Cultural transmission benefits hugely from a larger population size. Conversely, a too small population makes it very hard to maintain a certain cultural level. The standard example here is the Tasmanian indigenous culture, which after having been cut off from Australia, clearly regressed.However, this suggestion somewhat begs the question. Why did the population increase? Could cultural advances have caused this, or was it just (?) due to external causes, such as climate change?Minor quibble: Rutherford discusses rape as a phenomenon, and argues that although very similar behavior (i.e. violently enforced sex) can be seen in some other species, such as dolphins, those instances should not be called ""rape"" since that is a legal term. I am not so sure. Rutherford does not want to anthropomorphize, but here I think he goes too far in the other direction."
35,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91278638-martin-henson,3,"Bleh! As expected, this is very nicely written - Rutherford is a good journalist who can write about this subject with proper understanding - but there is really not much sustained content. Sure there are a number of nice tidbits - but it doesn't go very deep to the extent that what he sometimes says can be misleading - for example about group selection (p. 225). Sure, ""old"" group selection is in the dustbin of history, but ""new"" group selection (which is still hotly debated) in the sense of David Sloane Wilson (see, Does Altruism Exist?: Culture, Genes, and the Welfare of Others) is not inconsistent with the gene-centric paradigm. Reading the book made me even more guilty about having panned David Reich's book so much (Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past), though it is true that is poorly written - but, at least, it takes the reader very seriously in terms of content and packs a real punch. Perhaps had Reich and Rutherford collaborated on that book ..."

The author tries to find answer to one of the most complex question we as humans try to understand. The question is we are so similar to our cousins and other animals yet we are so special. I mean as Darwin said with all the exalted powers,man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin. We are capable of beautiful dreams and horrible nightmares. This book drives away this very important point that our culture is very much part of our biological evolution and we should not try to separate them. One of the aspect where we stand alone from other species significantly is in the cultural accumulation and transmission. I mean many animals learn but only humans can teach. We should revel in the complexity of our species and celebrate the fact that we alone are capable of understanding it. The author admits that the complexity of this puzzle that how we reached where we are will continue to increase and i guess that's what makes it more challenging."
37,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87278698-amit-verma,4,"This book does difficult work of making complex topics simpler and interesting at the same time, so that non technical reader may enjoy and learn a lot of things about our past and how it unfolded. Book is engaging description of how humans used tools, language, teachings,fire and art to conquer the earth and how we became better than our cousin apes and all the mammals, who share many similar genetic features.After a slow first chapter, book becomes rainbow of fabulous facts about us and animal kingdom. Chapters on sex life of man and animal kingdom is very good with details you will be surprised to know. Book dissects brains of man and other species in parallel. Illustrations that pop out at various points are pleasurable bonus. Thing which one may dislike is complex discussion of genes and genetics and too much Darwin. Also, description of cannabalism, rape and abnormal sexual behaviour in animals may be distracting force for some readers.Overall, a feast for science and non fiction lovers with a lot of new information but little complex nodes in between. It us little complex than sapiens, but absolute feast of knowledge for any non fiction bookfan."
38,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67537648-erik,3,"I loved Rutherford's A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived, but this didn't do as much for me.Rutherford here mainly looks at humans by comparing with other animals - some use tools, some have some kind of language, most have sex. This approach is not novel. In particular, Matt Ridley has done the same kind of thing several times, notably in The Red Queen and in Nature via Nurture. Both of those books are in my opinion better, though Rutherford writes from a more advanced point in time.In particular, in his treatment of sex, Rutherford says nothing new and dumbs down important parts. He also is so concerned with human morality that he refuses to call forced sex among animals rape - apparently rape is unnatural and unspeakable while animals forcing each other to have sex is perfectly fine. Whenever biology says something troubling about human nature, Rutherford pivots and says humans are exceptional and biology doesn't really apply.If you haven't read much about evolution, this has plenty of good information, but Rutherford doesn't delve in to scientific controversies and he evades difficult questions. Read ABHOEWEL instead, and then pick up Nature via Nurture."
39,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67436528-malcolm-beck,5,"Fantastic read if you are fascinated by the story of how we got to where we are and became the complex humans we are today. To paraphrase the author's hero, this book is one of 'degree and not kind' with Harari's Sapiens, Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and to a much lesser extent, Brian Cox's The Human Universe (lesser extent because of the subject matter, not the quality of the writing). If popular science is your thing, if you wish you'd paid more attention in school, if you'd rather learn something in the evenings than watch rubbish TV, then The Book of Humans is well worth your time. Easier to digest that others in the genre but no less riveting as a result. Like The Human Universe, you should be left with a profound sense of gratitude and wonder that you are here at all, able to read and well equipped enough between the ears to at least grasp the magnitude of who we are and how it happened. And you don't need any real science background, as Rutherford writes beautifully, with wit and clarity enough that even the most lay of laymen will understand the ideas. And not only that, he helps with holiday ideas. I'm off to Shark Bay to look for spongeing dolphins..."
40,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12977113-denise-hutchins,4,"I didn't enjoy this book as much as I hoped I would, but overall it was well-informed and well-written, so definitely worth a read if you're interested. My biggest problems came from 1) the depressing nature of some of the scientific findings included, and 2) the author's insistence that we not call acts of murder or rape by those terms when they're carried out by non-human animals. The author's argument in the latter case was that those are legal terms and therefore don't apply to anyone but humans, but I very much disagree. I won't go into the horrific details from the book but, after reading it, I believe murder and rape are words to describe acts of violence, not lingo reserved for the courtroom. As for the former issue, the depressing science proved what I already know and what is very nicely put in this line I heard somewhere once, ""The universe isn't working against you, it is indifferent to your needs."" We tend to idealize nature as some pure thing separate from human existence; this book is a good reminder that we're a part of nature and it can be just as benevolent or malevolent as we can."
41,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12213552-nancy,5,"I wasn't certain that a book of this length could adequately organize and condense the natural history of our species into a meaningful narrative. Truthfully, having read far longer, more detailed accounts of human development, I was skeptical. However, Adam Rutherford presented this survey clearly and provided a broad context for closer examination of various human evolutionary topics. It takes skill to remain focused on a complex subject and render it down to the most relevant points so that it makes sense to laymen.The material presented is dense; it might not be as clear to me without previous background knowledge on the topic. Much was familiar, but I found it valuable to view the simplified parts as they make up the complex development of our species. Using a familiar analogy or cliche, this book viewed the ""forest"" from a distance rather than focusing on each individual ""tree or leaf."" There is value in doing that. I am impressed with Rutherford's ability to distill this complex subject into an understandable, very accessible book. For me, a second reading would be worthwhile..."
42,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44400927-amanda-books-life-and-everything-nice,4,"Thank you to NetGalley, the Experiment, and Adam Rutherford for an ARC ebook copy to review. As always, an honest review from me.Like: - Opportunity to learn even more about evolution - Shows the specific genetics and behaviors that contribute to evolutionary change- Many visuals to help with understanding of the textLove:- Everyone can learn something from this book- Complex information that’s written in an easy to understand way. You don’t need a college degree in science to understand the information Dislike:- Not so much a dislike, but more of a warning- there’s chapters on sexual activity ( because how else are new animals and humans created) It goes in depth into various sexual activities, mating practices, and genital touching. So heads up, if you end up listening as an audiobook without headphones. Wish that: —Overall, a well written, comprehensive book about the step by step process of evolution. Written in an interesting easily accessible manner. I definitely recommend if you’re interested in the topic!"
43,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38687881-kayw4,3,"I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.Rutherford's book does pretty much what you want a pop science book to do: it provides an accessible, often simplifying to the point of near-deception, walk-through of complicated scientific processes, the main one here being how homo sapiens became the dominant species on the planet. Of course, this isn't actually a ""scientific"" process at all, but too often we've left it to natural sciences to provide all the explanations, which tends to leave us with very little explanation at all. What I particularly like about Rutherford's approach is that he shows just how our dissimilarity to other species is a question of degrees, and whatever we like to pretend is uniquely human might not be so unique after all. Less successful - as almost always is the case - is his attempt at explaining the ""human"" drives to create art, invent, complete large-scale projects etc. But overall, apart from the awful title, this book is a fun and easy-going journey through the history of homo sapiens."
44,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18842144-kiran-brahma,5,"I found this book highly entertaining while not losing any edge in the insightful and mind expansion area. Though I haven’t had a chance to read Charles Darwin work on evolution but this book provides a primer to the concepts that was presented in his seminal work. The author writes in a a witty language that engages you throughout the book. The info presented in the book can serve for wonderful discussions with friends and also present everyone that lot of things that we think are specific to human aren’t so. Once again, you realise the amount of luck involved in creation of our species and why one should be happy for the meteor strike that wiped out the dinosaurs. It’s a short read that once can finish it under 5/6 hours and one book I would love to read again. This book mostly will be my final read for 2018. I would say, it has been a great year of reading and hope to find similar entertaining books for 2019"
45,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37696426-cristina,3,"I expected a little bit more of this book when I borrowed it from the library.It is interesting and curious but after finished it, I have the feeling that it didn't tell much about human evolution (as the title suggests).What you find instead is a story of how different or similar we are from other animals (during a very long first part of the book), for example, looking at the use of technology, how we relate to others or how sex is experienced in different species.The second part is a little bit more complex. It is about genes and goes deeper in human understanding, although after all, not matching the expectation of evolution and how we really became what we are.All in all, this is a curious book but different from what I expected and felt like reading. I found it complex sometimes and in some parts boring. But if you are interested in sciences and evolution, maybe you will enjoy it more than I did!"
46,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10562281-roger-smitter,5,"Rutherford tells is a balance between Hamlet and Darwin. His story about how the earth began to take the form we know now. That was hundreds of millions ago. We humans show up late, only 200k years ago. We would see them as like us if they had a haircut. The book sustains the theme of “big” and “long” through the book. Humans are in the animal category, but he makes it clear that the story gets most interesting when humans appear. Evolution is the thing that got us to where we are now. Their and our DNA is about the sameA few individuals get attention in the book. Socrates had ire because he had to deal with technology. In his time, writing was a techie thing. There’s a chapter on chapter Tooled Animals This is only the beginning of a relatively short book that will engage both scientists, historians, and the rest of us. "
47,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93251589-nienke,3,"The book of Humans was an enjoyable read in my opinion. It is suitable for every reader with an interest in (evolutionary) biology. You do not need to be an expert on the topic to understand it. This book wants to tell us how we became who we are. Why are humans so unique. Sadly it does not achieve its goal. Adam Rutherford points out that many of our ""unique"" attributes, those that supposedly make us human, can be found in other animals as well. This includes behavior, but also tool use and use of fire. Most of the book is devoted to this topic. In the last part of the book, Rutherford elaborates on the fact that the establishment of mankind's rich culture might have to do something with sociability and communication. This is not certain though. The answer is yet to be found. "
48,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16524307-tony-fitzpatrick,4,"A fascinating popular science study which attempts to explain what makes us human. The primary approach used by BBC radio science celebrity Adam Rutherford is to draw comparisons with various other animals - for example in the chapter on perception he notes how few other creatures can appear to recognise themselves in the mirror, and in describing tools contrasts rudimentary tool use by apes with the heights of technology employed by people. The book covers a range of topics, including an inevitably huge section on sex. Rutherford explores the genetic history of Homo Sapiens in a very clear and understandable way. I learnt much. He has an enjoyable “storytelling” style of writing, clearly hugely influenced by his work presenting science on the radio. "
49,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12000072-steve,5,"Another great book by Rutherford that will not disappointI loved this book. I wasn’t surprised, however, since I had read two other books by Adam Rutherford - “A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived” and “Creation” and had loved those as well. In this book, Rutherford makes the case that humans are animals and that many of the ways we behave is also seen in the animal world. Rutherford writes with a conversational tone and he makes the science completely accessible. Humanimals is well written and with the same sense of humor that Rutherford displayed in his other books. And again, the footnotes are worth reading. Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book via Netgalley for review purposes."
50,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41498203-paleoanthro,4,"A very interesting book in which Rutherford highlights how no behaviors separates us from other animals, but yet, we retain our uniqueness as a species, due to our reliance on culture. We see cultural traits in other species, including our closest living relatives, so it is more than just a reliance on culture for survival, but rather that culture is a part of our biology and it is only by not separating the two can we fully understand who we are and how we came to be the species we are today. Culture has become part of our evolution and it is the traits in our genome that allows for culture that are being selected for, and Rutherford provides a thesis as to why this is and how modern humans became the species we see today."
51,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36958868-denise-skilton,5,"Adam Rutherford takes us on an evolutionary journey from the beginning of the earliest life on earth. He takes us back to Homo erectus and earlier. . It is the story of our journey through time. The Neanderthal period and how we are not separate from them, but carry there DNA today. How we have a lot in common with animals and some way very much like them being both sentient beings. With emotions and tool making and using. How we live in Social communities. But also how we differ. I loved this book. A must read to understand where we came from and our future. Well written and well researched. One of the best books I have read this year. "
52,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17068038-suzanne,4,"Very good laymen's book explaining what sets us off from the apes and other animals. A few annoying stylistic choices put me off from time to time. For example, the author repeatedly writes things like ""which we will see in chapter three"" or ""which will be discussed in an upcoming section"". These little teasers in fact had the effect of halting my thinking about the CURRENT section. Overall, Adam Rutherford uses scientific terminology just enough to teach (with footnotes to explain more technical concepts) without being overly scholarly or talking down to his audience. A solid 4 1/2 stars."

Really interesting stuff, and it’s presented here briefly to give the lay person or pop science lover a look at human evolution and animal behavior and how humans fit into the spectrum of animal behavior. I really liked it because in general I enjoy books and articles that look at behavior in the natural world and how it compares to humans - and what makes us unique or not so unique. So I found this to be a really fascinating book. Now I have to get around to reading his other well known one about the history of humans!"
54,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9024679-simon,5,"A highly readable and very accessible book, which sets out the evolution and development of humans. This is told with a straightforwardness plus a leavening of humour and yet is obviously a highly knowledgeable account from Dr. Rutherford who is entirely engaged with this story which encompasses us all. Oh for such a Science teacher!!!!Adam Rutherford and Hannah Fry have an excellent programme and podcast of BBC Radio Four called, The Curious Cases of Rutherford & Fry which is available on BBC Sounds and other podcast platforms. It is worth a listen and isn't remotely stuffy...not remotely... honestly!I must now look up his other books and try those. This one was fascinating!!"
55,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,3,"On the whole, this book provides an easy to read, overly simplified introduction to human evolution and what makes humans different (or not) from other animals. Each section covers a different aspect of ""humaness"", such as tool use, sex, speech development and cultural dissemination. I found the book a bit bland and lacking in substance as it did not provide any information that I hadn't come across in other books, journal, magazine or internet articles. ****NOTE: I received a copy of this book from NetGalley.

57,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"Another good book from Rutherford, chuck full of interesting stories about what it means to be human, and how little most of these traits mean to the rest of the animal kingdom. From birds the use fire to catch a meal, rats who demonstrate regret of choices made, to unusual mating practices of sea otters and giraffes.Overall, I thought this short book was a good compliment and extension to his previous one, A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived. Would definitely recommend both books as must reads, if only to have a better understanding of the world around us and its inhabitants."
58,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9947706-letitia-moffitt,4,"This was fascinating. Rutherford covers a lot of ground in very few pages, so of course overall the book is going to seem a tad superficial, but that's OK -- it's a good introduction to some interesting areas of science. The writing is accessible to the layperson and quite funny at times too. Rutherford's own sense of morality comes through in a way that is thoughtful and not bombastic (and it helps that I agree with pretty much every judgment he makes). A recommended read -- makes me want to delve more into this subject."
59,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41396644-chris-quartly,3,"I enjoyed this book, Adam Rutherford is an excellent writer (his previous book, A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived was fantastic), managing to make complex ideas easily digestible, with a large dollop of humour.The main drag of the book is the amount of caveats on almost every page. This is obviously necessary and commendable (people should try it more often) but it does mean the book gets a little repetitive in tone. Still, there are plenty of interesting outlying tidbits and ideas that were new to me, I'll be looking forward to his next book."
60,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3512830-elmwoodblues,4,"As another reviewer stated, this book can read like 'sitting next to a drunk intellectual in a bar'; and, since she gave it one star, I take it she means this as a bad thing. If you might enjoy such a drinking buddy, stay seated: Rutherford is funny and sacrilegious while also fairly complete in the basics of his interesting (and yes, sometimes uncertain and beginner-level) arguments. Cheers!"
61,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3570962-gerald-heath,3,"This was a nice presentation of recent evolutionary theory, as regards Homo Sapiens, although I found it to be mostly review. Perhaps most interesting, although the author wasn’t preaching, were the examples of how ubiquitous is homosexual behavior within the animal world. Giraffes? Who knew! The science seems to come down on the side of sexual diversity, although the evolutionary purposes aren’t clear. However, the author makes the point that among primates, sex is also important as a vehicle for bonding, promoting “the general welfare” of a group.Decent book. Probably 3.5."
62,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92350263-gemma,2,Well this was an interesting find. If not a little odd. I picked it up while wandering through a book shop on my lunch break. I’m fond of non fiction- not only because I find it breaks up my reading (especially if I’m in a rut) but I love learning more about our world. I started this book with the greatest of intentions but found it went off in all sorts of tangents and that primarily it wasn’t necessarily what I was after. Very informative and if you’re interested in finding out more about the animals around us and how we are different this ones for you 
63,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50370771-cathie-stumpenhaus,4,"This book, published in 2018, brings together a tremendous amount of information and speculation on how we became Homo sapiens. It covers a lot of ground in great detail. I especially liked the blend of historical scientific investigations and speculation with the unfolding information coming from investigation of DNA and individual genes. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars rather than five is that the length and depth of each chapter was such that chapters on subjects less interesting to me became a long slog. However, I read every word because I did not want to miss a thing!"
64,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26247475-bec,3,"If you are new to popular science reading, then this book would be very interesting. I would have really enjoyed this between 16-30, it is full of interesting animal/human comparisons & ancedotes that I have all heard before by now. Even the stuff about the Caledonian crows the author take pains to note is new this year, I think it was in National geographic. It is well written, it just covers fairly well trodden territory for a voracious popular science reader like me."

85,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82761489-realms-robots,5,"Humanimal is an examination of what it means to be human from a genetic and biological standpoint, and how our definers mirror those of what we consider ‘animals.’ Rutherford presents a well-researched guide to humanity – from our bodies to our behaviors to our cultures. Human history is a long, drawn out story and Humanimal makes it fascinating.You’ll learn a lot about the ways different animals match human behaviors and genetic makeup. How do animal brains compare to human brains? How does sexuality manifest in animals as compared to humans? Does the usage of tools actually work as an indicator of human intellect, given the fact that so many animals have created crude tools of their own? The similarities are surprising at times, showing how much we truly are a part of the world. It’s easy to imagine humanity as vastly different from the other living things around us but, behavior-wise, we’re quite similar. Most interesting is the sub-section regarding human speech. This is a book that gives us the root information and continues with further details until you feel pretty knowledgable about most parts of the human condition. The author examines the parts of our DNA that make it possible for us to speak before diving into how language has evolved over time and, further, how the meaning of words have evolved. It’s a fascinating progression that says a lot about our history and its sheer length of time.Above all, expect Humanimal to teach you a bevy of things you didn’t know about the world and its inhabitants. You’d be surprised at how entertaining genetics can be when illustrated by a talented author. This is an easy-to-read guide that entertains, surprises, and enlightens.NOTE: I was provided a free copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
86,1615195319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59252999-roo-phillips,3,"A book specifically on evolution of the human species. The history generally starts with the common great ape ancestors and moves forward from there. There was one section on sex and reproduction in the animal kingdom that was particularly fascinating, which is the reason for the 3rd star. If you want to know what goes on sexually in the wild, you'll get a good taste of it in this book. There's actually nothing ""tasty"" about it. Everything you can imagine happens, and probably a number of things you can't imagine, happens. Much of it is common, and only a fraction of all (known/observed) sexual activity among animals is actually physically suitable for procreation. This section extends into reproduction as well, which is equally bizarre and interesting. From temperature alone controlling the sex of unhatched egg, to adult males morphing into adult females, to asexual procreation (self-fertilization), and much more.One other point that Rutherford touches on regularly, which I like, is that we need to be more careful about anthropomorphizing animal activity. We can't directly ask an animal what it is feeling or thinking, and so it's easy for us to think that an animal feels and thinks like we would. Examples of rape, incest, and necrophilia documented among animals are just a few that elicit strong human responses that we simply do not understand but often project on other species.However, Humanimal (dumb title) is generally an unremarkable evolutionary account. It's good, but not very new or inventive. Just another way of telling a story that has been told for over a hundred years."

It is a story of difference - why we are from the same source as all the other creatures (and non-creatures) on this planet yet humans enjoy (if that is the right word) so many evolutionary-derived abilities that have led to so many cultural transformations that we are incredibly different. This is an entertaining book and one written to provide information - something only a human can undertake as giver and receiver. That this is also something we do with tools, with information, with art forms, with sex is explained in a way that excites and explains the reader. Charles Darwin is Adam Rutherford's hero. This oozes from his language, his style and his use of the great man's own words and phrases. Darwin is also the person I would have liked to have met and talked with as he epitomises not just the excitement of discovery but the best of wider human traits that man and woman should live by. I suspect that Adam Rutherford has many of these qualities - they underlie this book, a book I would heartily recommend to anyone remotely interested in ourselves. At times of worldwide heartache, be it politics, war, famine or whatever ills we bestow on ourselves, this book helps to understand what incredible creatures we have become - individually and societally - and that we do good things with the evolutionary and cultural traits we possess most of the time, which we often forget!"

Oftentimes, there are intertwined experiences that make sense of why we do the things we do now. And through these markings, we have an inkling of how humanity has grown, through failures and successes of experimenting and interacting with other species and the ecosystem that we are a part of. Rutherford tells us that while it may seem that each writer who tries to outline our histories are well-verse it these subjects, chances are, with all the experiences in the world, we are only scratching the surface. And given the precarious state of things, the equilibrium between organisms shall always influence how we shall survive. "
