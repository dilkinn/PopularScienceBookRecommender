Get a better book if you are serious about the subject, there are some very good ones out there. Not worth a full review I guess."
1,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54436-benjamin,4,"Game theory investigates the motives and dilemmas of social interactions relative to selfishness and cooperation. As we understand game theory we can increase our chances of finding satisfying resolutions by adopting new strategies or even by just having a clearer view of social dilemmas and their underlying causes. In his book on the subject, Rock Paper Scissors, Len Fisher gives the following ten tips:1.	Keep the same strategy if you’re winning, shift strategies if you lose.2.	Bring a third player in. They can be a known negotiator or a known cheater – either way it helps.3.	Set up reciprocity. Knowing that you’ll deal with people after a conflict can increase the incentive to cooperate.4.	Limit future options or provide incentives. This shows that you are committed to the best possible outcomes.5.	Offer trust. It’s simple, but it can be effective.6.	Create a situation from which neither party can escape from without loss.7.	Use side-payments to maintain cooperation.8.	Know the seven deadly dilemmas and avoid the worst outcomes:a.	The Prisoner’s Dilemma – all must cooperate or all fail.b.	 The Tragedy of the Commons (a series of Prisoner's Dilemmas) –self-interest prevents cooperation despite impending long-term failure. c.	The Free Rider problem - people taking advantage of a community resource without contributing to it.d.	Chicken/Brinkmanship - each side tries to push the other as close to the edge as they can, with each hoping that the other will back down first. e.	The Volunteer’s Dilemma - someone must make a sacrifice on behalf of the group, but if no one does, then everyone loses out. f.	The Battle of the Sexes - two people have different preferences, but each would rather share the other's company than pursue their own preference alone.g.	Stag Hunt - cooperation between members of a group gives them a good chance of success in a risky, high-return venture, but an individual can win a guaranteed but lower reward by breaking the cooperation and going it alone.9.	Work to create transparent processes that are inherently fair.10.	Favor smaller groups, it’s easier to foster trust and cooperation"

In a way, it succeeded, in that it's peppered with personal anecdotes, some of which are quite enjoyable.But as far as getting me to understand and be enthusiastic about game theory, it failed. I already understand about brinkmanship and the prisoner's dilemma, and how rock-paper-scissors work, so Fisher's descriptions added little. In fact, in some ways, they made it worse. He has several charts which explain the outcomes of various decisions made in the prisoner's dilemma, and, try as I might, I could not make any sense of the charts. Maybe it was a typo? I don't know. I also would have liked to understand the concept of quantum game theory, and about how he came to the numbers of the formula used in the Nash barganing theory. I read the passage over several times, and didn't understand it, which is quite disappointing, as I am neither completely ignorant of game theory nor am I unintelligent. It's just that he assumed we knew what was going on, and skipped past with only the briefest of descriptions.Another problem I had with this book was the structure. It had numerous footnotes and text blocks that sometimes went on for several pages, forcing me to flip back and forth, and lose my train of thought about what I'd been reading. In short, while the anecdotes were entertaining, they couldn't overcome the fact that Fisher's explanations weren't clear and lucid enough for me. "
3,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1906185-kaara,2,"This book is a sort of layman's explanation of game theory and how game theory, which is generally associated with competition, can be employed to promote cooperation among individuals, communities, and nations. Sounds promising--I like learning, I like cooperation, let's learn about new ways toward cooperation!Unfortunately, the author simultaneously gave explanations too large-scale and gave examples too small-scale. What I mean is, the premise, reasoning, and graphic illustrations of most of the game theory dilemmas were generally not broken down enough or clear enough for me to really understand them to my satisfaction, while the examples he gave were so simplified and in some cases silly that rather than clarify things, they just frustrated me. For example, you can't gauge people's trust by putting a coat down in front of women confronting puddles and seeing if they'll accept your offer to use the coat as a Queen Elizabeth did! They are responding to you suspiciously because that's an anachronistic and just plain weird thing to do in a 21st century urban center among strangers, not because they are mistrustful! Hellloooo, basic sense of social norms.Many of Fisher's evidence or examples, were based on social experiments he performed on acquaintances, strangers, or guests of parties he was invited to. As a researcher, he should know that personal anecdotes do not evidence make--and one hopes he might soon be informed that invitations to parties might dwindle if he keeps acting on his penchant for asking annoying questions or favors of the guests. In fact, I have to say in many cases I simply didn't believe his examples actually occurred--they were so simplistic that I assumed he made them up to make a point. This is especially frustrating because I can 100% see how game theory dilemmas DO provide the framework for almost every interaction people have. There was no need to turn to personal anecdotes of no research significance and dubious verity. In my mind, Fisher lazed out. I want to see studies. I want to see examples taken from the news, from history, from something beyond his small life. And I want properly referenced footnotes.The other thing that bothered me, and this might not be the author's fault but simply be the way of game theory, was the complete lack of interest in or acknowledgment of individual psyches. There was a slight nod to the effect a person's cultural milieu has on his behavior, but nothing about a person's personality. Not everyone is going to act the same in a Prisoner's Dilemma or a Stag Hunt, because people's natural inclinations toward honesty, toward their community participation, toward sociability, toward all sorts of things, differ, from person to person. Game theory, or at least Fisher's depiction of game theory, doesn't seem to take this in to account at all. All that said, I did learn something from the book. You do start understanding the world in a somewhat different way when you understand these dilemmas. There have been several times the past week or so, particularly in regards to this absolutely heinous set of condo association issues, when I've said to myself, ""Stag Hunt! This is just like the Stag Hunt!"" I've also been thinking a bit more about the solutions he offers, though for the most part they are really silly (he suggests a friend of his who is a police officer brings a dog with him to question suspects as a ""neutral third party,"" and this shows the value of neutral third party. Um! A police dog is NOT a neutral third party! I'd call this tactic something significantly simpler and less cooperation-oriented, such as ""displaying power"" or ""intimidating""!). In all, I guess I'm glad I have a basic knowledge of game theory, but was expecting a book with more solid explanations, research, and examples."
4,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40590836-ami-iida,1,In this book the contents are not accompanied with respect title .It is inadequate mathematical commentary.I recommend you to read other game theory's books.
5,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128744-dmitri,1,"Update: Instead of this book, you should read  The Compleat Strategyst by J.D. Williams. It's nearly 60 years old and everything  Rock, Paper, Scissors  wishes it could be. Don't be put off by it being published by Rand- it's actually very easy to understand and surprisingly, very funny. Also  The Compleat Strategyst is available for free in PDF form from Rand's website.Original review: Holy crap! While I was interested in the first 100 pages or so, when the author actually wrote about game theory (albeit in a simplistic pedestrian manner), the last hundred have been excruciating. Honestly, I'm about 40 pages from the end, and I try not to leave books unfinished, but I just don't think I can go on. The first 60 pages of the second half have been about trust and how to elicit such. But the author has taken advantage of my trust in him to write a book about game theory. The result is that this book has made me angry!My purpose in reading this book was to brush up on the basics before reading something a little heavier- but I could have just watched Beautiful Mind if I was in need of a time waster. Maybe, if one has not had any introduction to game theory, and they just want to know what it is, then perhaps this book could help. But reading the wikipedia article on it would be ten times more informative."
6,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,4,"Non-Mathematical Introduction to Game Theory and the Generating Co-operative BehaviourWhat makes this book so enjoyable is that it is densely loaded with interesting anecdotes and examples. This is popular math/science writing at its best and the material is easy enough to understand without any technical background. At times the lack of filling in that detail is annoying. For example he (author name) writes about a three way duel called a ""truel"", where the A who shoots first has a 1/3 chance of hitting his target, the B has a 2/3 chance and the C will hit his target 100% of the time. If he shoots B and succeeds he's a dead man, because A always hits his target. If he shoots A and misses then B and C may take him out, but if he hits A there is a 2/3 chance that B will hit A and so forth. So what is A's best strategy? The author gives a surprising solution however he leaves without the mathematical discourse or even graphical display to convince you of the conclusion. (Hint - get a large sheet of paper and draw a tree showing all possible outcomes. Remember that C is a perfect shot, so at most the truel will go two rounds. Look at all possible outcomes first before taking into account that each truelist will choose her best chance for survival. )The core idea of Game Theory is a payoff matrix showing the possible cost/benefits of making a choice. Fisher starts with a two player interaction in a single encounter where neither player is aware of the other's choice in advance - which was the basis of John Nash's initial discovery - most readers will recall the Acadamy Awarded movie ""A Beautiful Mind"". However when you introduce some variation in the scenario the behaviour changes. If you add more than two players (ie: the Truel, systems of alliances between nations) third parties act as a spoiler that influences the actions of the others. Fisher also looks at the work of Robert Axelrod's The Evolution of Cooperation ( I consider it one of the key ""must-read"" books in social work or political science, bar none) where there are more than one interaction so that both history and reputation of the players are taken into account. Lastly there is a final progression where each player has varying degrees of certainty as to the other player's choices - Fisher theorizes that this may be made possible by quantum computing (not cheating - but that would have made an interesting topic too.) and the principle of ""entanglement"".Recommended for teachers and students and a general audience because. It's entertaining and informative as to the relevance of mathematical models to everyday life. Personally I would have like more details but for that I'd recommend Anatol Rapoport's classic Two-Person Game Theory which I think I'll repurchase having lost my copy to my eldest brother. The layout of some of the boxed side discussions in the book were a bit distracting as they occasionally ran on for a few pages and they should be have been set in smaller type or relegated to the page notes at the back. In general those supplemental notes were quite good but I found the lack of two specific follow ups frustrating: He also refers to a video showing the results of Axelrod's work - it would be nice to know where one could find it; on pp 121 he talks about a new model used by the United States government to auction off radio frequencies netting over 100 billion in EXTRA revenue - but he only talks about the results and leaves out an explanation of how that model worked or a comparison to less effective techniques used in Europe, Asia and elsewhere. "
7,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658159-bestand,2,"Like other reviewers, I found this book light on details. I was also misled to believe that it was primarily a book on game theory. Having now read it and been disappointed in its game theory content, I can appreciate its value as a junction between game theory and political science.The author has clearly tried to document his attempt to learn about game theory as a tool to more effective human interaction. He hints at possible personal reasons for this. I project onto him a need to form better governments or organize collective action to solve problems of benefit to all humanity--poverty, climate change, pollution, biodiversity, obesity, etc. If the book fails to resolve these lofty aims, it is due to the immensity of the problem. I assume the author came to no definite conclusions, and this book is the result. I appreciate his personal account of his learning, but (I hope) he learned more than he covers in the book. I am left at the end with a hope to use game theory to grease the social cogs but without the mathematical machinery to do so. I had hoped that this might be the kind of book that a math class could read, and I think it's probably at a high school level. My fear that it contains too little math is mitigated somewhat by the well-documented endnotes. High school students could probably find something interesting to read and explain out of all the examples. I would, however, appreciate a pedagogical guide or bibliography to game theory."
8,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81564-sarah,4,"A non-mathematical discussion of how game theory applies to daily dilemmas and negotiations, this was a surprisingly easy read. Fisher's explanations are consistently clear (no facility with higher math required) and his writing light-hearted and entertaining. From the many examples provided from Fisher's personal life, it seems one invites him to a dinner party at the risk of turning the evening into an experiment in game theory. (Personally, I think that'd be a great way to enliven an evening, but then I spent my last dinner party discussing the implications of the forensic DNA typing I'd performed on one of my guests and her five siblings. My idea of entertainment may be suspect.)I particularly enjoyed the discussion of computer models as a method for examining which strategies work best for determining the optimal outcome between two (or more) self-interested parties.I would perhaps have liked a more detailed look at the applications of game theory on a political and global scale. The percentage of the book devoted to introducing the subject and personal exemplars seemed to overwhelm the last couple chapters, which is where Fisher ultimately got around to providing concrete suggestions for daily applications.But this is a minor nitpick. I'm hoping to track down Fisher's other books as well."
9,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7351616-andrew-kaiser,0,"No stars don't mean a bad book; it just means a bad system for rating one.Fisher's approach to game theory was scientific, but without its esotericism. The subject is no longer overwhelming, and I now see game theory in my life everyday. For example, I want people to hear my music, but not if they don't like it. Strange, this game theory."
10,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/689929-nathan-rose,5,"Awesome book! It took me three check-outs and $2.40 in late fees, but I finally finished it. Well worth the time/money."
11,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91633135-olesia,4,"“A wry fascinating tour of one of the most momentous sciences of our time” – says William Poundstone about Len Fisher’s bool “Rock, Paper, Scissors: Game theory in everyday life”. I would definetly recommend this book if you are like me – a university student who just started learning aboyt the Game theory. This book descrides what is the nash trap, how to deal with N-person stimulations, what to ise out of perfect and imperfect information. It also teaches abot decision: simultaneous and sequantials, and a great deal about rationality as well. Through various examples the author describes where do mentioned situations occur, how to deal with them and basically how to win the “Rock, Paper, Scissors Game” with rival companies and life in general. Fun and witty situations described in the book will live in your head forever after you read this book. Even though I strongly suggest this book to my peers, on the other hand (I mean, we are economists after all, the are no one-seded opinions in our lives) if you are already familiar with the topic – the book will be way too easy andprimitive for you. If you wanna deepen your knowledge on Game Theory, avoid this book 😊 The author himself suggests that his book in stretched into a book, when instea it could have been a few-page paper. But there should be a book for everyone – shouldn’t it? Withot further ado – if never heard of Prisoners dilemma, or you wanna calculate the proper distribution of gifts at a kid’s party, or get to know more about Indian crazy streets – dive into this book and enjoy your new and improved life afterwards!"
12,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19680054-joe,2,"This would have worked better as a longform magazine article. Fisher talks about game theory and how a better understanding of it can lead us to promote cooperation instead of competition. That's a nice theory, and he does a decent job of explaining it, but I don't think there is enough meat in this subject matter to justify 200 pages.Fisher quotes Steven Postrel at one juncture. The quote and Fisher's explanation is itself a good encapsulation of the entire book. ""'Game theory is a toolbox for constructing useful models, rather than an empirically substantive theory. Its power comes from imposing logical discipline on the stories we tell.' In other words, the science is not a tool for controlling the world so much as a tool for helping us to understand it in a new and informative way. It is a guide to decision making that gives us pointers to what is really going on, not an auto-decision maker into which we just feed the facts.""Given that, the rest of the book is really just commentary. Fisher's conclusion, and here I agree, is that it is better to find ways to cooperate in almost every situation. When confronted with someone who won't cooperate, Fisher posits that it is okay to protect one's own interests; particularly if doing so may lead back to cooperation. In that sense the book has some useful tips for promoting cooperation. These can be found in the last chapter. The sentence above as a thesis, with a few examples and explanations, and the last chapter as a conclusion would have made this a very interesting magazine article."
13,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37060155-mike,3,"Rock, Paper, ScissorsI came across this book a few months back. It sounded like a good intro to game theory, making it a bit of fun. While I have a better understanding of game theory basics, it wasn’t as fun as the back cover hinted.My take on game theory is the study of human behavior using mathematical models. Here the author takes to be the capacity of humans to help each other. He wants to demonstrate how humans cooperate and why they don’t at times.I will give the author props for using himself as experimental subject in many of the chapters. Lots of dinner party conversations. His experiment with putting a jacket over a puddle for a lady to walk over was enlightening, highlighting trust. I now see that other books I’ve read about human behavior were utilizing game theory, but they didn’t call it out as such. Now I have a better clue. I thought it would be more fun or filled with more humorous tales."
14,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90980434-julia-farthing-kitay,3,"I have a sudden interest in game theory, as it is a science that studies situations where individuals come up with the best plan of attack to get the most benefit. Game theory is a type of mathematics, but it can be applied to lots of different fields, such as economics, biology, computer science, philosophy, and even international diplomacy. The book ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" has some great anecdotes by the author, but I'm still stuck with a lot of questions. For instance, what is ""Nash Equilibrium?"" ""Are there better examples of the ""Volunteer's Dilemma?"" The book is an engaging read, but I'm finding maybe I need to do further reading to answer a lot of questions that came up about game theory. I only gave the book three stars, because I was left with more questions than when I started."

17,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61654626-mary,1,"Not worth reading. The author admits he’s not an expert on game theory. What he should also tell you is that he does not understand it. He doesn’t even understand the correct meaning and use of the terms. What I find even more ridiculous is his feeling that a Nash equilibrium is a “bad” thing. Bad — as in good vs. evil.

25,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41890350-elizabeth-robinson,3,"A quick note on the subject of this book:-Game Theory, a bit older than epigenetics but not too old, is the study of decision-making and forming strategies in everyday situations. For instance, the game of rock, paper, scissors; splitting up a birthday cake; or when playing chicken with your neighbor. Of course, for more info on either of these topics, you can read the books.Rock, Paper, Scissors This book was very opinionated. There's nothing wrong with that intention; the author's whole stated purpose for studying game theory was to find ways to apply game theory to real-world social problems. So of course those would be mentioned in the book. But personally, I didn't agree with what little was said of those recommended strategies. Fisher briefly explains a skeleton of a plan for real-world applications, but what little there is either comes across as impractical or is inadequately explained. Otherwise, the book is well-organized, entertaining, and informative. Fisher does a great job of explaining the ""seven deadly situations"" and examples of their occurrences in every day life.  The awful thing, though, is that often the examples don't seem to line up with the described theories. It's perfectly understandable to compare the Cold War to a game of Chicken, or disappearing spoons in a workplace as the Tragedy of the Commons. But there are several other examples that become somewhat confusing as to their relation to the assigned Situation.  Non-fiction books are designed to either inform or persuade, and the author does not fully accomplish either of these. The persuasion is cut off by only giving vague ideas of real-life social cooperation solutions; it comes across as food for thought, just prompting the reader to think about the topic and its possibilities. But then the other option, informing, occasionally fails with the chosen examples. Yet I will say that these instances were rare, so it's fair to classify the book as a mostly successful informer.  The organization was a bit confusing before the author explicitly stated its organization a ways in. Maybe I just didn't read quickly enough.  Overall, I do recommend it as an informer. Game Theory, mostly as far as social decisions are concerned, is something that I know intuitively on a basic level. Many people probably do. But even so I still recommend the book for its mathematical/scientific perspective of looking at things.  Another reason I would recommend it: it somehow makes math sound fun!

"
26,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809206-nick-gotch,4,"The first thing you'll want to know before looking any further is: what is game theory? It's more than just a bunch of math for how games work, it applies across the board to a whole host of social and global situations: things ranging from deciding on the best plan for a date night to the global nuclear arms race. And even though it does apply to real games too (like card games, board games, and video games,) those are only a small part of the full field of study.""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" is an introductory course in what game theory is and how its various situations apply to real-world problems. In fact, the topics covered span a wide range of everyday situations and include many references to actual incidents when these topics applied. The book works through various solutions to many of the common dilemmas people run up into when dealing with others. The best part is that the solutions aren't just a matter of opinion they'rereal solutions that demonstrated mathematically.As far as complexity goes anyone should be able to grasp everything in this book with just a little effort. That said, it might be more tedius than the average casual reader prefers. The situations presented can be pretty rigorously analyzed so if you're not of the analytical mindset you might not be interested.I particularly enjoyed the final chapter on Quantum Game Theory. It so fascinated me I've gone on to looking at other works on the subject.I'm going to have to read this book again. There's just so much valuable knowledge that I need to go through again and takes detailed notes. In fact I'd even say ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" could serve as an introductory course textbook for the subject."
27,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15889513-matt-erickson,0," The book discusses social inequality, or the ""have not's"" in society to a ""prisoner's dilemma"". The idea that if people always act in their own self interest they may lose the benefit of what the other party could have offered them. He says this is one of the major problems in sociology, and after 2 1/2 years of college I agree! The conclusion that some have come to, and to which the author is coming is that one or the other has to take a disproportionate amount to impel others as motivation. The book advocated a regulatory solution, where a third party (often coin tossing or the book's game namesake is suggested) that ensures both parties receive a reward, but neither knows the actual cost of what had been prescribed. A distant science, focused on prediction, like sociology could use game theory. The idea that introductory theory now calls functionalism is the negotiation bit dressed in different clothing. When those in a position to make a decision don't consult the parties, they lose what might have come from the other side. Losing, is done away, because a recognized reward is still given. Game theory also assuages the tragedy of culture, (that once we are us, we cease to be what we once were.) because we are a new us, each retaining all that is distinctly them, only a new possibility has emerged out of the union. A conquerer would be careful in what he destroys because of what he may lose. The book could be shorter, but this is supposed to be more like a compilation, as the author stated."
28,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,4,"Game theory is a concept that has come up several times in particular conversations, usually leaving me stupefied because I didn't really know what it meant. Honestly, after reading Len Fisher's book, I'm still a little dumbfounded, but I have a better grasp now than I did before starting.Fisher's approach is a simple one to follow. He outlines the different situations, problems or ""dilemmas"" that can arise in the study of game theory, and then promptly gives simple, quotidian examples of them. He talks about the classic Prisoner's Dilemma, the game of Chicken, the Stag Hunt, and many other situations that stem from John Nash's study of cooperation and defection, draws them out with simple graphs, and then relates them to our lives in tangible ways. From there, he describes the ways in which we can either ""solve"" or devise a strategy in which to bring the parties involved closer to the most positive state. It's not always very straightforward, but that's because the subject matter can get a little complex, especially when Fisher decides to venture into quantum mechanics.All in all, it was a fun read. Just today, I emphatically called out ""Game theory!"" in the middle of a conversation. I instantly felt a little smarter, which validates this book completely."
29,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13682064-donna-woodwell,4,"This book is exactly what it claims to be: game theory for dummies. Len Fisher is not a game theorist, but a chemist with a talent for popularizing science. This book is an exploration of his fascination with game theory. It's a little history, a little theory, and a lot of irreverent examples. If you are looking for a book to teach you how to use game theory for world domination (or just dominating your friends), this is not the book for you. Fisher is honest about coming from the book from the perspective of how people can play nice, not take advantage of others. But it is an excellent introduction to game theory concepts in simple language. And he did succeed in giving me a few tools for looking at situations in my own life in a new way. (for example, I'm sure one could apply game theory ideas to reading reviews in goodreads... why people post them and say what they do.)Also, this book works well as a bridge between topics... especially readings on complexity theory and the neurology of trust. If you want to learn more, I'd recommend reading the notes in the back... which are 56 pages of this 256-page book. He's got many more links and anecdotes, which made me wish I had the ebook version (if the hyperlinks actually work)."

But it also oscillated between purely technical / theoretical explanations of different dilemmas and oddly personal and irrelevant examples for them. (Another reviewer said ""Fisher lazed out"" with the illustrations. I tend to agree.) So I don't really feel like less of a dummy now, and it seems like I remember barely anything specific from the whole book.I'll leave you with a funny, although only loosely relevant, quote, just so you get a glimpse into the ridiculously things that make me giggle on trains.
The Yagan Indians of Tierra del Fuego had a wonderful word: mamihlapinatapai, which means ""looking at each other hoping that the other will offer to do something that both parties desire to have done but are unwilling to do themselves.It was described in the 1993 Guinness Book of Records as the most succinct word in any language. It covers a multitude of situations, from siblings sorting out who is going to do the washing up to migrating wildebeest crossing crocodile-invested rivers. Game theorists view the Volunteer's Dilemma as a multiperson (or multiwildebeest) version of the Prisoner's Dilemma.

31,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1041468-jerry-smith,4,"This book has been on my ""to read"" shelf for ages and I finally got around to picking it up after having read ""Soccernomics"" which alludes to game theory in a discussion about penalty shoot outs. It was sufficient to get me wanting to find out more about game theory without a detailed, technical or academic treatise on the subject. This fit the bill perfectly and spurred me onto thinking about finding out more about this fascinating topic.It is very well written, relatively short and very approachable. Fisher mixes in anecdotes that both illustrate the points he is making and also make the book funny and engaging. Game theory itself is naturally approached in a somewhat superficial way as depicts the title of the book, but it works to provide an introduction and that is very valuable. The approach of the book is largely an examination of how game theory can help us in day to day co-operation and what it has to say about interactions at a micro and macro level. I would be interested in further examining how it might apply to confrontations (this is covered in a small way) as in the penalty shoot out example. I will certainly be reading more about the subject. "
32,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3184846-christina,3,"Not bad, but I don't think it's really sure what it wants to be. It's a little too science and math heavy to be really reader-friendly as a self-help book (which is most often what it tries to be). There is, for instance, a chapter on quantum computing. But it's too goal-oriented and political to be really credible as a popular science book. It's also a little elementary in places. For instance, Fisher spends a few pages simply defining ""social norms."" Ultimately, I think, it's a very well-meaning physics professor trying to make the world a better, gentler place, where we all get along and no one is trying to blow anyone else up. That's commendable, but it's not always fascinating reading. If you are in a position where you need to broker agreements and build trust between competing parties, and you are unfortunate enough to have no background in the social sciences, this is a worthwhile read, but I imagine there are probably better books on the art and science of cooperation and competition."
33,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2376590-ryan-groesbeck,3,"The author achieved his stated goal : I now find myself shouting ""Game theory!"" at things that happen in life that I hadn't previously thought of in those terms. So that's good, I suppose. It's a good introductory primer to the concepts of game theory, and how we might use them to cooperate better, but it goes a little strange at the end with something called quantum game theory, which I am not going to profess to understand even with his attempts to dumb it down, and I think that subject might have been best left elsewhere. He also has a tendency, in the name of readability, to highly compress topics, or refer you to footnotes for more explanation. Having to flip back and forth from the text to the end got very old, very fast, particularly in a book that wasn't that big to begin with. In an attempt to give a wide understanding, he perhaps goes too wide, and might have been better served by narrowing his focus and giving a better understanding of the issues he chose to include. "
34,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1151946-jacqui,3,"This book talked about applying the finding of game theory to everyday life. I thought one of the most useful recommendations was to use the Stay if you win, shift if you lose strategy. In computer simulations it was found to be the most successful strategy for repeated interactions. Basically, you start out cooperating. If the other person cooperates as well, you win, and cooperate again the next round. If they don't, you lose and change to a non-cooperating strategy next round. It's different from a classic Tit for Tat strategy in that if you both don't cooperate one round, on the next round you switch back to cooperating, offering the proverbial olive branch in hopes of reintroducing cooperation.I also really liked the discussion of quantum game theory. Apparently, quantum computers will in theory allow negotiations wherein the negotiators are constrained in ways where it becomes impossible to benefit from betrayal. I don't totally get it but it sounds very useful."

While the Predictioneer's Game was a great read, it was (at times) a bit technical for a newcomer to the subject. Rock, Paper, Scissors gives a better layman's introduction to the subject of Game Theory as well as it's numerous real world applications. Fisher also delves into many different classifications of ""games"" as well as their potential resolutions, all with a nice mix of humor. This would be a great book to own if you're interested in or studying the subject.And yes, he does spend a little time talking about Rock, Paper, Scissors."

Though I suppose most people interested in Game Theory are also math buffs. But for those of use who can barely function without a calculator the book sheds some light on the subject.Mostly, however, Fisher talks about examples and little about practical application. In fact he spends a lot of time pining away about how Game Theory could end war. Which made the book more about the theoretical uses of this mathematical science. And since there is very little math in this book, no conclusions are made, only hopes.Still, if you just want to know what people are talking about when they say Game Theory its a good book. Though in the end I wasn't as impressed by the science as I thought I would be."
37,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/526331-richard,3,"This book had a really strong start, with wonderful examples of principles of game theory at play in every day life. The examples were strong, identifiable and fit The concepts of things like the prisoners dilemma and Nash's equilibrium quite exquisitely. Maneuvering a thin sidewalk or awkward traffic made perfect sense.But then, after about three chapters, examples started to wear thin. The first time I most consciously noticed it was when Fisher used the rather apocryphal story of Kitty Genovese, stories that prove less applicable when you know the deeper level of detail. This is where Fisher's method of trying to use every day, real-world examples starts to work against him, especially as the ideas grow more intricate and tougher to apply with quick references. A notable book for delivering some key concepts in a very accessible style, but only for about half the journey."
38,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/418065-pat,2,"A few of the examples provided in the book were apt illustrations of game theory in everyday life, but the overall effect was to trivialize the subject rather than elucidate it. I wish that, instead of explaining how game theory applied to, say, the reason spoons disappear from the office kitchen, how game theory could be applied to the big problems like global warming, modern warfare, global poverty, etc.. Fisher suggests that game theory could help solve these problems, but in the end, it seems more descriptive of the human condition than prescriptive about how might free ourselves of it. That is to say, I'm not sure anyone quite knows how to solve the Tragedy of the Commons or the Prisoner's Dilemma. "
39,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1816198-e,5,"Len Fisher, an award-winning author of popular science books, has written an entertaining, enlightening and practical guide to the abstruse discipline of game theory. Fisher shows how game theory explains phenomena as mundane as why spoons go missing from a coffee break room, as ingenious as rabbinical problem solving in the Talmud and as fateful as global warming. getAbstract finds that his lively writing invites a wide audience. Fisher engages lay readers by elucidating an intensively mathematical subject without heavy reliance on equations or jargon. His treatment of the subject makes game theory appear only slightly more complicated than child’s play. In fact, he often uses children’s games to illustrate the role of game theory in daily life. "
40,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1923397-ninakix,3,"I was excited to read this book, I'd taken a little bit of Economics in school that brushed up against game theory, and I wanted to see how this would apply to some different situations. But when I actually read this, I was disappointed because a lot of the examples were a bit mundane, consisting mostly of examples from dinner parties and five-year-olds' birthday parties. When actually hitting on an interesting example (like, for example, the cold war), the issue was just mentioned in passing, or described to such a simplistic level, all potential to learn was basically removed. This book was a bit too simplistic for me, but maybe you'll enjoy it. The explanations of game theory on the most basic level were not bad."

Prisoner's dilemma, nash equilibrium.... some really cool, interesting stuff backed by cool stories to explain these concepts. Somewhere around page 100, I hated this book. Unbearably boring. I knew little of game theory, but many of the ideas expressed seem like common sense. Ok, so if I want to go to the ball game and you want to go to the play, let's flip a coin. Ok. got it.Basic idea of the book: how can we cooperate as a bunch of selfious humans. Well, start TRUSTING people you bum. Oh, that's not a win-win. Ok. got it.

If you're interested in the topic, skip this.The book tries to be an introduction to game theory. It starts off with the standard introduction about prisoner's dilemma and explains how multiple self-interested individuals can force themselves into outcomes that are worse than if they had cooperated. Fisher tries to simplify the relatively basic tables associated with the prisoner's dilemma game by adding smiley faces, and ultimately just over-complicates the explanation.After the introduction, the book suggests a handful of more advanced game theory situations and problems and a handful of Fisher's bizarre attempts to apply game theory to his life."

I'm finishing my final semester of grad school and this probably wasn't the best reading material for the end of the semester light-reading to break of the studying I've been doing for finals. Fisher did a good job of bringing high level concepts down to a simple, basic level without oversimplifying and making the reader feel like a moron. He uses humor to keep things light and moving and I really felt like I grasped a lot of what he was relating to the reader.Overall, a good read that I likely read at the wrong time. "

Fisher wrote this book to make the subject more accessible to non-practitioners. The book is readable, and some of Fisher's (possibly apocryphal) personal anecdotes give entertaining demonstration of concepts of game theory. However, Fisher managed to mangle some of his explanations of game theory itself and its terminology and tools. The book is a decent overview of game theory and its applications, but if you want to learn to practice the actual mechanics of the discipline, there are much better books on the market."

284,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1062735-tracy,3,"Things I learned from reading this book: always go with paper, never trust your fellow man, and be the first to take the deal. It's a pretty basic explanation of game theory and how it can be seen in everyday interactions. "

286,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/696298-lt,4,"A whole chapter devoted to Rock, Paper, Scissors - I'm in heaven!"
287,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/654288-sara-wilson,4,This is a very clever book about why it's so darn hard for humans to cooperate with each other. It's quite fascinating.

291,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4091081-patrick,5,A very good introduction that doesn't go either too far above or too far below the reader. I did like the opening chapters considerably more when game-theory itself was more of the focus.

295,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3437934-courtney,1,"This book didn't actually talk about game theory all that much. It was mostly a series of anecdotes, quips, and news clippings."
296,0465009387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2112867-tim-paul,3,"Pretty good, but a little shallow. His 'experiments' were largely anecdotal (and possibly apocryphal) - but the subject matter was interesting."
