The story itself - that a boy who hates math learns to like it through a series of dreams in which he interacts with a Number Devil - is a little thin and repetitive. But what I found bothered me the most were the explanations of the math concepts. I've seen some great nonfiction books that make math concepts interesting AND explain them in multiple ways for students who catch on differently. This book would introduce a concept, state some random things you could do with it (but usually not why you might want to), and move on without trying to address WHY something was the way it was, or multiple learning styles. Another thing I couldn't totally get on board with was renaming math concepts. I get that some of the terms might have been easier to remember, but the real name for them is never mentioned, so kids might come away knowing all about ""prima donna numbers"" and never put together that they're really called prime numbers. And some seemed unnecessary - is ""Bonacci numbers"" really that much easier to remember than ""Fibonacci numbers""? I just had such high hopes for this one and came away disappointed."

In fact, that would describe Robert, the main character in this book. He has been struggling with maths for as long as he can remember. One night, he dreams that he meets a little devil, The Number Devil, who teaches him, as he sleeps, all sorts of useful tricks with numbers.When you enjoy something, and gain immediate benefit, you obviously learn more.My Dad made all aspects of mathematics enjoyable for me from a very early age, almost from when I could walk and talk, by relating what we were seeing in the real world to mathematics in some way. He didn't label the principles as geometry, algebra, arithmetic, and so on. He just mde it all part of my world. Consquently, I never scored less than 90% in any maths test or exam in my life. I just enjoy maths as much as living.The same holds for Robert, and for readers of this lovely little book.My grandson was hating maths, and couldn't see the point. When I took him through the first chapter of The Number Devil, he could suddenly, and effortlessly, multiply 11 by 11, 1111 by 1111, 1111111 by 1111111 and so on. He also learned, through self motivation inspired by his ""new trick"" to multiply any number you could throw at him by eleven.This may seem a small step, but you can believe me when I tell you that it was a massive step for Alfie. Furthermore, he couldn't wait to get to school the next day to show his new skills to his class-mates and his teacher.That wasn't all. There was much more magic to be revealed in this great little book, and I would encourage anyone to share it with their children, even if they are already very numerate. It just gives them, and you, a new spin on an ancient subject."

3,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763514-tung,1,"Imagine that a math teacher wanted to write a children's book to show kids how cool math really was; but since it's a math teacher and not an English teacher doing the writing, all you end up with are math concepts written out in analogies similar to what you'd hear in a math classroom -- that's what this book is like. The story is about a boy named Robert who hates his math class and math teacher and by extension math in general. He falls asleep and over a series of twelve different dreams over twelve different nights, he learns about different math concepts from a dream guide who calls himself a Number Devil. The devil presents math concepts in kid-friendly terms and even uses kid-friendly language to describe them. For example, instead of using the term exponents, the devil uses the term ""hopping""; he also calls prime numbers prima donna numbers. And obvious spoiler, but Robert comes to appreciate math by the end of the book. My first criticism is that half of the number concepts aren't described as cleverly as prima donna numbers. Calling Fibonacci numbers Bonacci numbers or Pascal's Triangle a Numbers Triangle is simply lazy. My second and bigger criticism is that the prose is terrible. The dialogue between Robert and the devil reads far less like a boy talking to a dream figure, and more like a math teacher talking to an imaginary student who is engaged in his lesson. I like math and find it fascinating, but this book irritated me more than made me appreciate numbers. I'm sure math teachers are massive fans of this book; I was not."

...But as he stood in front of his mirror in his pajamas, brushing his teeth, he felt something tickling his chest and looked down to see a tiny five-pointed star on a thin golden chain. He couldn't believe his eyes. This time his dream had come true! ...After he'd dressed, he took the chain off and stuck it in his pocket: he didn't want his mother asking silly questions. ...Where'd that star come from? she'd want to know the minute she saw it. Boys don't wear jewelry! ...How could he tell her it was the emblem of a secret order?
Perhaps a mathematical fairytale (yes! what a truly delectable combo) is a dubious inclusion in a round-up of the golden ratio in literature. Does a story in which the purpose is clearly didactic and in which the emphasis is on the exposition of the nifty niceties of various numerical patterns really qualify as literature? Isn't a mathematics text thinly disguised as a children's story a bit suspect?In its defence, I have to say that The Number Devil does have the three essential C's of a story - character, conflict and context - so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. The plot, moreover, floats as lightly as a feather on a froth of allusions to some truly great tales told by (or about) mathematicians down the ages: the mushrooms of Alice in Wonderland* make an appearance, the cave of Plato** is the setting for one of Robert's dreams, the anecdote about the schoolmaster and young Karl Gauss***is re-enacted by Robert and Mr. Boekel, and the great mathematical mystery which plagued medieval theologians - 'How many angels can dance on the point of a pin?' - is restated in a new guise.Ahhh, what a glorious book! But I didn't give it five stars just because I love mathematics and fairytales. I did it because it made a point I've never ever seen elsewhere.Robert, the young dreamer of The Number Devil, has a problem with mathematics. He hates it. His teacher, the pretzel-loving Mr. Boekel, is apt to ask such sinister questions as: 'If 2 pretzel makers can make 444 pretzels in 6 hours, how long does it take 5 pretzel makers to make 88 pretzels?' Fortunately for Robert and his mathematical future, his dreams are invaded by a chirpy little chap who introduces himself as 'the number devil'.Starting with the number one and its properties, the number devil explores different facets of the realm of mathematics. Robert, despite his initial antagonism, becomes increasingly intrigued. The sixth night of dreaming is devoted to Mr. Bonacci and his rabbit clock (a peculiar eared device where the markings correspond to months rather than hours), while the tenth night of dreaming is devoted to the golden ratio. On that night, the number devil re-introduces the Fibonacci numbers of the sixth night, much to Robert's disgust ('You and your Bonacci!' he exclaims. 'Tell me, is that guy your best friend or something?') and shows him how the golden ratio is hidden in the sequence.Enzensberger has made an interesting observation at this point - and this is what made me decide to include The Number Devil in my catalogue of the golden ratio in literature and to give it five stars. I don't know of anyone else who has actually bothered to point out that it's not just the Fibonacci sequence which turns up the golden ratio. Pick any two numbers (Robert chooses 11 and 17) and use them as the basis of a Fibonacci-like additive sequence: add them together, then add the last number to the total to make a new term and keep on doing this for as long as you please. Pretty soon, the ratio of those last two numbers is going to tend towards the golden ratio, no matter what initial numbers you chose.'Is it buried in all numbers?' Robert asks.'It is,' said the number devil.At the end of the book, Robert is awarded the Order of Pythagoras (Fifth Class) - and is given a gold star on a chain. As ever in The Number Devil, no reference is made to the historical precedent, no explanation is given about the allusion. The five-pointed gold star is, however, the symbol of the Pythagorean Brotherhood and Robert is right in thinking of it as the emblem of a secret order. It was exactly that: the pentagram was called 'the number of man' and was the device by which members recognised each other.The Number Devil is a delightful book, where even the most whimsical incidents are drawn from the history of mathematics. I caught quite a few of the allusions, but I suspect just as many went over my head. While there's an extra dimension of pleasure in recognising those hidden references, the book is truly enjoyable anyway. I hope it becomes a modern classic. It certainly deserves just such an accolade.* Alice in Wonderland was written by the mathematician and theologian, Rev. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym, Lewis Carroll. The famous answer - 'forty-two' - to the question in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 'What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?' is taken from Alice Through the Looking Glass.** Pythagoras was admired by Plato who used some of his ideas (particularly in what is called the geometry of the 'Platonic solids').*** The incident at the very end of The Number Devil is similar to a story told of Karl Gauss. The boy, later to become 'The Prince of Mathematicians', was in a class asked by the teacher to add up all the numbers from 1 to 100. Almost at once, Gauss had the correct answer (not a calculator in sight either!). He used the same technique Robert uses to work out the answer. "
8,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284410-beth,5,"What do you get when you cross Alice in Wonderland with a small, red, horned man obsessed with numbers? No, it isn't an arithmetic problem - it's a middle school math primer!Robert, a boy who hates math and is frustrated because his teacher doesn't allow calculators, has strange dreams all the time. One night he dreams up a character called the Number Devil, who takes him away to a surreal world of numbers where Robert learns basic math concepts and a few handy shortcuts. After all, says the Number Devil, ""you learn best when you sleep.""Over the course of 12 different evenings, Robert learns factorials, how to find a square root, and more. Concepts such as the importance of the number zero and the idea of infinity are stressed over and over. Robert discovers triangle number, Bonacci numbers, imaginary numbers, and irrational numbers. Did you know that you can take any even number larger than two and find 2 prime number that add up to it? Robert is even able to apply what he's learned in an actual math class.The Number Devil makes up fun - and punny - terms for things. Roots become ""rutabagas"" (a root vegetable) and prime numbers are ""prima donnas."" Squaring becomes ""number hopping,"" and factorials (!) are renamed ""vrooms."" A warning at the end reminds kids to use the proper terms in class. The index doubles as a brief glossary, defining terms in a few words.It is truly remarkable how clearly the theories are presented. Enzensberger translates math to German, and Berner translates the German to English. The concepts are well explained and provide jumping off points for many discussions, from pyramids to mosaics to biographies of mathematicians. Whimsical illustrations and colorful charts and diagrams add to the text. Practical applications relate to nature in many cases. Bonacci numbers are illustrated with rapidly multiplying bunny rabbits. Similar examples would have been great! Related activities include playing with number triangles and making 3-D geometric shapes. There are no pages of practice problems or exercises, although one or two chapters end with a question for a student to solve by extrapolating new information.Middle school teachers can spice up their lectures with a chapter from this book. Homeschoolers can it as a unique supplemental text. While some might object to the negative imagery surrounding math (Robert is in number hell, and learns from a devil), the book may reach some kids relate to the main character. This math-phobic librarian (the only numbers I'm good at are Dewey Decimal ones). Can't wait for the sequel!"

This book doesn't have a ton of story, but just enough to make it a page turner. Robert's math teacher, Mr. Bockel doesn't seem to be a very inspiring educator, doing little else but assigning word problems while surreptitiously munching on pretzels. Robert thinks math is confusing and boring. All that changes when his dreams are visited by a strange genie-like character called The Number Devil. Through the course of many visits to The Number Devil's mathematical dreamscape, Robert learns that not only does math make a lot of sense, but it's actually pretty interesting. The Number Devil gives mathematical concepts silly names, calling prime numbers ""prima donna numbers"" and exponents ""hopping numbers,"" which could be confusing, but there's a guide at the end of the book which explains what everything is really called. I actually think not using the ""correct"" names might make the book more accessible to kids. Robert has the chance to meet other ""number devils,"" mathematicians from throughout history, and asks why more of them aren't women. It's a great questions, and though the book doesn't delve into that issue too deeply, it's nice to see it addressed. "
11,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12840427-dany-hdz,4,"Well, that was interestingly cute... like if you took math class in Wonderland or if you studied math on drugs, or something, but I cannot deny it was great. Honestly, I don’t think this book will make you better at math, however it may help you understand some complex theoretical concepts, since it doesn’t focus in the applied mathematics, but rather in the pure theory behind them. The narration is fantastic and creative, and in fact, pretty attractive. Besides, the pictures and dares really complement the story. So whether you struggle with math or not, I would recommend to read this book. :)P.S. I believe that the fact that the math geniuses are portrayed as devils is a pretty straight forward message... I mean, there’s math hell!! I know maths are mischievous and devilish, but this is literally saying *maths are hell*, isn’t it? Nah, just kidding, haha. "

The author has written a loose structure of a novel in order to painlessly and seamlessly teach children some basic math concepts. Along the way, he makes math fun and interesting and accessible. (I actually happen to think math *is* fun and interesting and accessible, but I realize that not everyone does.)The book is geared towards middle schoolers, but it works well for older children and adults as well. It also works well for both people who love math and its intricacies as well as people who are math-phobic, as it provides explanations and projects for experiential learners, all in a fun and light-hearted way.I would best characterize the book as a novel about math. If that intrigues you, then read the book!"

It's wrapped in a story about a boy with crazy dreams that begins dreaming about math and learning things from a number devil.My impression was that the book got the formula all wrong. The story is nonsensical and tedious, so you're ready to get to the math. The math is then explained via conversation between the main character and the number devil, so you really have to reflect on the topics after each chapter to understand them. You could easily read through the book and learn nothing but the overall story.The worst offense of this book is the made up names for mathematical terms. They have a warning at the end of the book telling readers that they should listen to their teacher and use the proper name instead of the dream term. If you want me to use the correct term, don't teach me the wrong term! For example, they refer to prime numbers as prima donnas, the Fibonacci sequence as Bonacci numbers, and 4! (four factorial) as four vroom!As somebody that already knows the mathematical concepts, this book was a big disappointment. Unless it really grabs a kid's attention, I don't see how this book would be a preferred way of teaching math concepts - it takes longer than an explanation and example of the topic, the explanation gets muddled down, and it teaches the wrong terms."

He has dreams where he meets with a devil who calls himself a number devil. He teaches Robert about some of the more crazy and interesting things numbers do. The proper names for these math concepts are not used in the course of the book, but an index is provided at the end connecting the proper name with the weird names the number devil calls them.I feel like this is a book that would be best used with a teacher or parent. You have to have a certain understanding of these concepts to get what is being taught. A teacher or parent could use this book with children to discuss and learn about these concepts. If a child is trying to read this on their own, though, I don’t think they will be able to get much out of it. At best it might increase their interest."
25,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3839736-passang,3,"	This summer I decided to read the book The Number Devil: A Mathematical Adventure by Hans Magnus Enzensberger. The story is about a boy named Robert who hates math because he finds it very boring at school. He keeps dreaming about being eaten by a giant fish or sliding down a never ending slide until one night he suddenly finds himself dreaming about meeting the Number Devil (Teplotaxl). During the twelve nights Robert finds himself learning different mathematical principles every night. In the first four nights, Robert learns about the importance of one and zero, exponents, negative numbers, prime numbers, and square roots. After the fourth night, Robert was not able to find the Number Devil until he dreamt of himself on a beach where the Number Devil taught him about triangular numbers. After the sixth dream, Robert’s mother begins to notice the change in his mathematical interest. On the seventh and eighth night Robert learns about Pascal’s triangle and Permutations and Combinations. On the ninth night Robert dreamt he was sick with the flu. The Number Devil appeared beside him and taught him about natural numbers and the characteristics of infinite. On the tenth and eleventh night he learns about irrational numbers and mathematical proofs. Robert shows great interest in math on the eleventh night. On the twelfth night Robert and the Number Devil were invited to Number Heaven which concluded that his time with the Number Devil was ending. In Number Heaven Robert learns about Pi and he meets famous mathematicians like George Canto and Fibonacci, whom the Number Devil calls them Bonacci and Professor Singer. The story ends with Robert in class answering a question provided by his math teacher Mr. Bockel and thanking the Number Devil for helping him.A question that popped up for me was how did Robert all of a sudden dream of the Number Devil? If he kept on dreaming the same dreams over and over again how did he suddenly dream about something completely different from sliding down a never ending slide and being eaten by a giant fish? It was a very random way to start a story, but overall it was pretty interesting thing to read about."
26,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35058930-yuta,4,"Count as 2 books (Review 3 and 4)I have read the book ""The Number Devil"" because my grandpa sent it to me from Japan in Japanese translation. The book was amazing. This book made me like math and this is when I first understood radicals and other mathematic things. I will tell you that, by the time you finish this book, you will think ""Oh, math is so cool!"".CharactersIn the book, Math Devil teaches math to this boy named Robert (Who hate Math),many interesting facts about math, and the secret behind it. In fact I never knew the fact that, ""11 times 11 = 121, 111 times 111 = 12321, 1111 times 1111 = 1234321, 11111 times 11111 = 123454321"" (Pg.23),creating a palindrome.(Any words, phrase, verse or numbers that can be read exactly same,from foreward or backward).In addition, the number devil talks about the pythagorean theorem, geometry, prime numbers, importance of one and zero, rutabaga etc. (rutabaga is the real way to say square root) There is way more interesting information about math than what I just mentioned. In fact, do people know what fibonacci numbers are? Probably, only those ""math person"" search for fibonacci numbers, and I didn't really know it until I read this book. (It explaines fibonacci numbers using diagrams and picture so even a small boys and girls can read this book). ConclusionThis book taught me that, there is so much inside math. You might think that you know math, you might be thinking too shallow. This can be connected to anything, not just math. You have so many information in which you don't know, in this world. RecommendationThis book, as mentioned, is written in large font. Although this book isn't that complex, it has so much inside. I recommend it to anyone from 4th to 9th grade. "
27,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2894776-steven,4,"I really enjoyed The Number Devil. I thought that it was a worthwhile book and if you are having trouble in math, it can really help you. I thought that the book was very good in its way of delivering the information. Robert, the main character, is always asleep when he is with the Number Devil and in his dream world, math is completely different from ours. One thing i didn't really like about the book is how they do not always use real math terms. They use words like coconuts and rutabagas and such to describe real mathematical methods. I wish that Hans Magnus Enzenzberger had just used real math terms and not fake things to talk about the math. However, after you finish the book they do acknowledge that the words they used in the dream world were not always real for math terms and that people wouldn't understand what your saying. Enzenberger actually had a whole section at the end dedicated to the mathematics covered in the book, and some that weren't, with the real word for the term if it was a word that was used in the dream world and not in the real world. Overall, The Number Devil was truly a mathematical adventure and is a worthwhile read for anybody interested in getting better in math or just for some fun."
28,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101529-gabriel,3,"A cute book that holds many of the same principals as Magic House of Numbers, but is written with a middle school/very late elementary school audience in mind. Some great (and advanced) mathematical ideas are presented in here. These include some ideas as young as Russel's Paradox or Countable Infinities. Others are much older (Pascal's Triangle and Diagonal length of squares). All of this told in a quiet, simple manner akin to Daniel Quinn's Ishmael - though a little more entertaining than that book.So for those of you who don't like math ... for those of you who don't think it's interesting or fun ... check out this book. Much like Flatland before it, The Number Devil takes a very interesting and complex topic and simplifies the explanations while allowing the reader to expand beyond. AND it also leaves off with a good idea of where mathematicians get stuck. Very nice and entertaining.For the really adventurous of you, read this book and discuss with a child."

In Enzensberger's The number devil, the boy Robert is able to contact this devil through 12 dreams and learns that math isn’t that bad at all. The whole purpose of this book is to reveal to young people that mathematics is something worth exploring and not just a sadistic intellectual exercise made by teachers just to give us more work. In this Story the number devil everything is math based from start to end for example: On the first night, the Number Devil appears to Robert in an oversized world and introduces the number one. The next night, the Number Devil emerges in a forest of trees shaped like ""ones"" and explains the necessity of the number zero, negative numbers, and introduces hopping, a fictional term to describe exponentiation. In some parts I felt intrigued by the characters how they acted how they reacted but that was only the first after a couple of chapters it became dull and boring and I wished it just ended."

Who would I recommend it to?Not math people - The terminology will drive this reader crazy! The author took math terms and called them something else. For example, instead of ""the square root of 9 equals 3,"" it was ""the rutabaga of 9 equals 3."" OOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKKK!Not non-math people - 1. With the strange verbiage, you won't be able to talk to other people, and 2. I'm not sure how interested a non-math person would be.To the author's credit, he does say, ""Your teacher is right to use the expressions used by mathematicians the world over. Please do the same (or you may get into trouble)."""

I was expecting something along the lines of The Phantom Tollbooth but this book doesn't even come close to that level of whimsical profoundness. I was definitely disappointed. The encounters between the dreaming child Robert and the Number Devil quickly become repetitive and stale. The author is trying to make children realize for themselves that mathematics are beautiful but the execution of this goal is actually quite ordinary. This book is recommended for kids 10+ but I think it's more appropriate for an even younger audience. When I was 10, I was reading A Wrinkle in Time and its sequels... The Number Devil would have bored me to tears."

I agree with another reviewer who said that this is exactly like how a math teacher would try to explain things--math through math analogies. Not helpful at all. Grade school me is crying in a corner, not only because I have been reduced to finding alternate sources of trying to understand concepts, but also because this source only made it even more horrific to learn."

39,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69066997-brandon-moore,4,"The Number Devil is an interesting take on number theory, giving insights into these theories in a relatively simple way for anyone to understand. The book follows the main character, Robert, who is 12, through 12 nights of dreams in which he had never experienced before. Robert meets a number devil in his dreams who teaches him about all the fantastic world of numbers and the many concepts of mathematics. Each dream houses a new idea which the number devil teaches Robert. Some of these include fractions, square roots, square numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and prime numbers, along with many more. The number devil introduces these topics in fun, interesting, and magical ways to Robert, as he’s someone who never enjoyed math, or numbers for that matter.The book is great for children who are learning about math, or who love the discipline of mathematics, or even for those who may be struggling with numbers. Though it is helpful, it could also be confusing – which may stem from the age I am and the knowledge I already have, but the author uses random words for things which have actual names in the field of mathematics, which was a bit bothersome while reading. For example, the number devil in Robert’s dreams calls square roots, rutabagas and prime numbers, prima donnas. While this may help children, I think the real names of these concepts are important as well and they should be learned, but this may also be because of my age and the knowledge I already have. The Number Devil is a great book for students of a younger age who are either interested in Mathematics, or for those who are struggling with mathematics, or for anyone in-between, but I would not recommend for anyone with previous knowledge of the concepts introduced, as the made up names for things gets a bit annoying. While that is true, it could deem useful for students of a younger age who are learning about these concepts for the first time, as it lays out the ideas in a nontraditional way, which many times is helpful for some students. I read this book for a college education course, and if I were teaching mathematics to a younger age group, it would be easy to include this book into a lesson plan, as each chapter dives into a new concept. This would be easy to come up with lesson plans for while students read the chapter before the class outlining the concept. While I don’t suggest it as a book to read for people with knowledge of these concepts, it can be a great learning tool for students currently learning the concepts held in the book."
40,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80996489-sarah-lubow,5,"This novel follows a young man named Robert as he interacts with a “number devil” who has decided to take him on as an apprentice of sorts in order to show him the joys of math. Though this novel has a negative sounding name, the “mathematical adventure” part of this title demonstrates the novel’s real appeal to readers. The character of Robert is designed as a reluctant and frustrated math student who has decided once and for all that he does not like math. The number devil presents himself as an excited teacher, but he is shown to be over eager, quick to rage, impatient, and flawed. This presentation of the number devil makes him relatable. The true cleverness of the number devil comes in the construction of each of the adventures in a dreamscape accompanied by beautifully detailed illustrations. Each illustration helps flesh out the world of the dreams and provides the reader and Robert with a more tangible way to learn about math. In the first dream, Robert and the reader learn about limits and fractions through the use of a story about chewing gum. This story illustrates how the number devil blends literary devices and techniques with mathematical explanations and logic to build a universe that can appeal to students who love literature and math alike. This novel appeals to middle school students and teenagers. I still count this as a children’s book because of the simplicity and methodology which Enzenberger uses to describe a variety of math concepts. From the Kienberg bottle to logical conundrums to the importance and function of the numbers 1 and 0, Enzenberger writes explanations and examples that are creative and adventurous showing deep compassion for readers who do not (yet) enjoy math. This novel challenges the notion of children’s literature because it deals with complex mathematical concepts that I, as a college student, have yet to touch in my coursework. This book appears to hold its readers to a higher standard than most children’s books and entrusts to them the opportunity to learn about math that likely would not get covered in their middle school classes. By treating its readers as having the capacity to learn complex math, The Number Devil challenges the notion of simplifying concepts. Children’s literature is often assumed to teach a child fundamentals, but this book goes beyond this notion and incorporates higher level math exercises into its pages using a dreamscape setting and whimsical and edifying images. Rather than appearing as only abstract, math instead appears concrete aided by Berner’s images. "

She went on to a Math degree.I have always believed numbers are magic. They are beauty and logic.My daughter, at only 7, already believes this.We were prepared to love this book, and to embrace it's lessons.Within pages Daughter was asking to take the book to show her teacher (who specialises in Math Education). Once she'd finished it, of course.It's a good book.So, what did we think?First up, Daughter was not ready for all the information. Some of the basics (eg division, squares) had not been sufficiently covered in school for her to easily build on them. We should have waited 6-12 months (SA year 4).Even with that, she followed most of the math discussion, made some effort to ""prove"" it on paper and calculator, and absorbed it. The surrounding story of Robert, the Number Devil, dreams and an increasing understanding by Robert of math, engaged her. And she asked for more chapters each night.She wants the Number Devil to visit her in dreams, too.From a math pov, topics are introduced well and with multiple explanations. Graphically, verbally, and numerically. The reader is shown how to determine the answer, how to explore further, as well as being given solutions where appropriate. There are some tricks to reach the solution as well as from first principles. We also see how one concept leads to the next.Some of the concepts Enzensberger introduces are Big Thinking. It does pay to take it a day at a time to let them percolate. And Enzensberger plays with terminology (vroom! for factorial, prima donna numbers rather than prime). Which, while a little irritating, is simple to work with/around.Has this book made a difference in her life?Yes.Even with some of the math principles beyond her, she has now seen them. She knows the words. She has seen it in action. She has traced the beauty of 1. It has given her a better understanding of how and why numbers are as she moves forward to learn what they do.Maybe she'll read it again. Perhaps when her future teachers introduce Fibonacci or factorials or geometry Daughter will say yes! I've seen that before!. The book may be cracked again to get that alternative explanation.And just maybe her teacher will read it, too, and see ways to incorporate the magic of numbers into the dry curriculum that is so often forced onto the students.References:w'pedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Numb...Age:Read aloud - 7+ (but it really depends on where the child is in his/her math learning and your ability to explain and teach).Read yourself - 10+(ISBN 978-1-84708-053-0)-CR-"

I believe it can make a kid fall in love with math. I had fun with my son showing him no matter what dot-edge figure he imagines, it always follows dots+spaces-lines = 1 and Fibonacci numbers through growth of rabbits and how the ratio of those numbers slowly converge. I plan to try the folding of paper to build exquisite three-dimensional figures. Robert is bored by mind-numbing math problems from school. In a dozen dreams, he befriends a number devil, who shows him, real math is not number crunching, but a beautiful game of patterns and though from game, the patterns seem to keep popping up in real life in unexpected ways. The dreams -- sometimes in a hot desert, some times in wintry cold -- go like this: why there is an infinite number of numbers, you can always add one; zero's importance in place-value number systems; how thinking division as multiplication-in-reverse helps see why division by zero is meaningless, find primes by elimination; from repeated decimals to unreasonable (irrational) numbers, the diagonal of a square; play with triangular numbers, by extension with quadrangle, pentagonal, hexagonal numbers; Fibonacci numbers through rabbit growth, or branching of trees; pascal's triangle; kids unable to decide where on the bench s(he) should sit give vroom (factorial) and vroom's unbelievable growth rate, triangle numbers reappear while kids handshake, pascal's triangle reappear when needs to decide which kids should clean up the messy school-playground; a series, infinite though, sometimes settles on a number and sometimes runs without bounds; golden ratio as the ratio of Fibonacci numbers, Euler's theorem for planar figures, folding creates rich three-dimensional figures out of rather bland planar sheets dutifully respecting Euler; why proof is central, satisfying yet so difficult, some problems like traveling salesman can trip even the best number devils; a visit to the math heaven/hell where you meet famous devils like Lord Rustle thinking away Russel's Paradox still to date."

His teacher gave him and his classmates random math problems that had no connection to every day life, and Robert was finding it more and more difficult to keep his engagement up. That is, until the Number Devil started showing up in his dreams. For twelve nights, the Number Devil showed him the magic of math, from looking at triangle numbers to add up consecutive sums to analyzing rabbit mating habits and its connection to the Bonnacci sequence. Numbers are patterns, and these patterns show up in the unlikeliest (or actually, likeliest) of places. With these revelations, Robert starts to see the world in a whole new light.But will he ever solve that pretzel problem?There's a lot to take away from this book. It's aimed at younger children, though I do think some further discussion around the concepts might be required to help kids understand just what some of the subject matter is. Then again, the process of discovering it on their own is a magic all its own. I could see some applications in the classroom from some of the chapters, and some great extension activities based on the concepts. Definitely something to check out for anyone looking to add in to a math curriculum. Might be geared more towards high school or middle school classes, but could have potential in elementary classes as well."

Teaching young readers about many different levels of math, from fractions to square roots, in a unique and creative way The Number Devil is very informative and helps readers understand the math shown in the book.While instructive and creative The Number Devil failed to keep my interest and attention for long. Letting my mind wander was something this particular book excelled at as it traveled along the nights of Robert’s dreams. Because there wasn’t much of a “plot” the book just led the reader through Robert’s dreams with the Number Devil, who had a terrible temper and didn’t seem to understand that Robert did indeed go to school and that he knew basic math, where Robert and the Number Devil took it in turns to snipe at each other creatively. The Number Devil being a different book then what I was accustomed to reading it rather bored me as it went on about triangular numbers, quangs, and other such thing. Because the Number Devil used such strange words to describe normal math terms to Robert it was rather confusing and I think that if anyone read this book before actually learning the math in school they’d probably talk about quangs or rabbit numbers instead of the proper mathematical terms used to describe such things.

This book might look like a fantasy story about a boy and devil, it is actually more of math text book. The devil teach Robert math every night. The level of math he is doing is easy, around 5th graders level. But the way devil explains it makes it way much interesting than how we learned in our elementary school. Another good part about this book is that Robert, is not a genius. What this means is if Robert is genius and could understand everything, the story will be bored. Because Robert hates math, he ask good questions that we might be wondering. The devil won’t just give you random equations. He start of by explaining simple topic like this. “How were numbers created?” Everything devil explains, it seems like it is super easy, and we all can answer it. But he goes much deeper in into the question like if we think about it, we have never learned it. Devil teach us the different way than how we learn at out schools. Therefore we can find new way of thinking. I recommend this book to everyone. From elementary student to adult. Even if you have learned addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and all other basic maths, I am pretty sure that you will learn something from this book. By knowing more, It develops our why and how. "

The 2nd was about zeros and multiplication. 3rd was about division.4th was about decimals and fractions. 5th was about triangles and addition, also hopping which is a way of multiplication that they use in the book. 6 is about Bonacci numbers and has a lot of rabbits in it. 7th is about pyramid typed math. 8th is about possibility and patterns. The 9th night he is sick and the number devil comes and does a little about decimals and fractions. 10th it shows decimals, fractions, dotting, and folding. 11th has multiple copies of his math teacher Mr.Bockel chasing him and abcd pattern. 12th dream he goes to number heaven/ number hell where he goes and meets many other number devils and becomes a member of the organization.This book isn't the best.

A Number Devil teaches a student who hates math how fun math can be in a fantasy adventure that will charm people of all ages.Difficult mathematical concepts are broken down very simply to make them approachable to even the most anti-math person. Using simplified ideas, complicated ideas such as Fibonacci Numbers, Triangle Numbers, Series, and Pascal's Triangle, making them all simple rather than terrifying beasts. Many of the mini-adventures can be recreated for practice at home and so readers can experience the math themselves rather than just read about it.I recommend this to any parents who wants their child to enjoy math and see a different side than what we see in schools.

He was really kind of excited about getting his hands on this book., so that intrigued me. I am not good at math, have not been good at math since about the 6th grade. So this sounded like maybe a fun way to have math concepts explained (once again) to me. Maybe I might finally find them interesting, exciting, understandable. But, no. I struggled through it, but even the author calling prime numbers ""prima donna"" numbers did not lighten the mood, or make math my friend. And it was written in a really clunky way. Or maybe the translation is clunky. Either way, a lot of the writing was just awkward.Still, I can see how this might interest someone who is new to these concepts, and who just takes to the whole math thing. I am not that someone."

It's a very cute exploration of a lot of mathematical concepts designed to promote a sense of mathematical wonder and intrigue in its readers. Enzensberger frames this as a series of dreams by a young student who learns to appreciate math through his interactions with the Number Devil.I think Enzensberger has a similar style and sense of humor to  Norton Juster of

Although, the concepts can sometimes be a bit confusing, but, thankfully, there is a copy where that you can refer to find what each of the renamed concept is. But the only reason the rating is a four-star is because of the repetitive storyline and mixed up names, and it does not really go that far into a story or the math.

It would have done much better as a picture book.At times, it's a bit hard to follow.Overall, 3/5"
59,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32020925-susana-pierce,3,"This young adult book is an entertaining mathematical story. It illustrates some mathematical principles clearly so that they're fairly easy to understand. Though the author chooses to use ""imaginative expressions"" instead of the accepted terms, he gives an explanation as to why. Interestingly, I think it would be easier for a child to just accept and run with it than it was for me (not a child) as I kept trying to think of the ""proper"" terms for the mathematical processes/expressions."
60,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15933809-david,4,"Overall a worthy book for both kids and adults interested in math. Like others, I too felt it was a bit disjointed with the random topics and I didn't like the silly phrases replacing the official words but if you take your time reading this book then it ends up being pretty rewarding. I would spend anywhere from 2 days to over a week on each chapter to think about the ideas presented. It was interesting and pretty deep in the issues they covered. "
61,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65130511-cindy-kumpen,5,"If it was possible to give this book more than 5 stars, I would have done it.Best book ever written about maths…I read it together with my son… He asks for a new chapter everty evening (and rather 2 chapters than 1)… He's laughing about the telduivel and Robert fighting, he's enjoying the math… He is amazed about how beautiful maths can be…We had the book from the library but for sure are going to buy it now…. We plan to read it over and over again… :-)"
62,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65842201-bri,3,"For what this book is, it wasn't that bad. I was forced to read this for a class. Now mind you, I hate everything that has to do with math, so naturally the book wasn't my favorite thing to read. However it did teach the math concepts in interesting ways, and would definitely help someone who was attempting to learn the mathematics discussed in the book. "
63,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28610556-suzanne-lapierre,5,"This is a fiction chapter book that speaks to children who love numbers and mathematical concepts. It introduces advanced abstract concepts under the cloak of narrative fantasy. The number devil comes to ""torment"" (humorously) the boy as he sleeps and takes him to fantasy worlds where he learns mathematical theories. "
64,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46866175-delanie,4,"I probably would have liked this more if I had read it when I was the targeted age. I had trouble going through it now, but probably cuz I knew almost everything. Where I a kid at trying to learn about math but like to learn in a fun fantasy way, this would be absolutely perfect. 10 year old me would have eaten this up"
65,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10764116-molly,5,I read this book when I was in the 5th grade and then again much later for nostalgia. I remember this book and loved every minute of it when I read it both times. It actually made sense for me with math and I would highly recommend it to parents and teachers for their students. It's a lot of fun to read.
66,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84226544-bradley-stephen,2,"I had to read this book for my content literacy class. I get the idea behind it but I think the students will find the book confusing. I don't like that he uses different names for terms (rutabagas for square roots, etc). We also never find out why Robert is having these dreams. The kid needs to see a psych."
67,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70810155-mike-gunderloy,3,"Picked it up for my 8th grader, read it myself. It was OK, but not great - certainly not nearly as good as The Phantom Tollbooth. The use of non-standard words for math terms in dreams started interesting and ended up annoying, and there wasn't much here to actually provoke either of us to want to pursue things further."
68,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93543683-rebecca,3,"I remember this one as a kid in primary school.The language was meant for that age, but I didn't get the maths back then.Almost a decade later, the maths are probably my level, but I just can't read it because the language if far below my age.But a good book overall, nice illustrations.I am talking about the Dutch version."
69,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79161799-jolana-k,4,"Matematický was a book of my childhood, which I loved. I read it when I was about eight, barely comprehending most of the concepts, and feeling slightly dumb for not understanding them. Now I decided to re-read the book when I found on my shelf, finally ""connecting the dots"". Anyways, still a beautiful book!"
70,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108741504-frederikke-j-rgensen,5,"This book is particularly fun for people, who understand or are familiar with the mathematical subjects it discusses. In my opinion, it fails at its attempt to describe rather complex ideas with literary means. Nevertheless, the storyline is well carried out, and it could still be enjoyable for the curious."
71,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6591726-carson-hall,1,"My husband and I jokingly have made mention of ""The Rutabaga of All Evil"" and I found it humorous when I quit this book after the author started rambling about Rutabagas. I closed the book and marked it, thinking I would try again the next day. When I started re-reading I realized how much I disliked it. I didn't finish it, it was just too strange (in a bad way) to continue on. "
72,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66269957-infamous-sphere,3,"I thought it was a great premise and a fun way to explain various mathematical concepts. Unfortunately for me I'm still hopeless at maths and most of the mathematical concepts went in one ear and out the other, so I can't say how well it would work to actually improve the skill of children who find maths difficult. Depends on the child, I guess. "
73,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57762868-allyce-louisa,4,"I very much enjoyed reading this story about the Number Devil. While it is a children’s book, I learnt a lot about how mathematics words and how numbers interact with each other. I believe that this book is a must read for any primary/elementary aged child, especially if they are not confident in their abilities. "
74,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82413802-nathan-robinson,3,This is a pleasant and fairly easy read. I usually look at math from an application point of view but this book approaches it more looking at patterns. It is fairly fascinating to see the relationship of the numbers and patterns. 
75,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/866349-jeff-lochhead,3,"While I enjoyed the mathematical aspects of the story and some of the creative exploits revealed, the actual literary value was quite juvenile. (I don’t mean to say that writing for juveniles is juvenile, quite the opposite, but this particular written effort left me wanting for better.)"
76,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999177-andy-mitchell,3,"An excellent concept. I wonder if I would have rated this book more highly as a student.As an adult, I didn't enjoy the book as much as I had hoped. But I don't think I am the target audience.Share this title with a kid in your life who enjoys math and numbers and logic puzzles."
77,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/616280-kathy,4,Wonderfully restored to me a new love for math & the way the patterns all fit together. Also a confidence in my ability to do and comprehend math. Realizing my love for math theory & philosophy as never before & a dream to show others the fun and beauty that math can provide. 
78,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34286410-ankeeth-maganlal,5,"I read this when I was in early elementary school, and I have always enjoyed it since then. I clearly remember that this book made math a lot more fun for me, and it made me want to learn and do more in mathematics. "
79,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26955824-heather-penner,4,"First of all... I have no idea how to categorize this. It's a fantastical adventure about... math. And although the narrative style is perfectly suited for a smartypants kid, I learned a lot as an adult, as well.My son received this book many years ago as a birthday present, when he was about 8 years old. It became one of his all-time favorite books - he read it dozens of times. Finally, with many reminders from my son (who is now 15) I read it. The story is a little bit bizarre, but it's fun, and it will make you think about the natural patterns of numbers in a whole new way (you don't actually have to do math while you enjoy this book - just enjoy the patterns and shapes of things.)If you have a math-oriented kid in your life, this book is a MUST. It's a pretty good choice for the rest of us mere mortals, as well!"
80,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2052740-nathalie,5,Got it for bedtime reading - which you can do - but it's also an interactive storyline with exercises so my 8yo and I wanted to get up and do the drawings and crafts. Kid loved the story and I loved the lessons snuck in there for him.
81,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1723377-david-meyer,3,"This felt like the distant cousin of Flatland, twice removed. I loved the idea, and parts of it were brilliant, but a lot of it left me wanting more. More depth, more explanation, more of just about anything. "
82,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62518027-brandon-wiles,3,"It was an okay book. I kept reading because I was curious to see the next lesson, but thought it was not great at explaining the math. Also very confusing for a child to understand, in my opinion. I had to reread a couple times, myself. "
83,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89595019-newman,4,A whimsical and mathematical adventure with lots of fascinating magic and tricks to adore. You can listen to me read the whole book episode by episode on my podcast called Daily Short Stories. Available on all major podcast apps.
84,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5416028-jake-berlin,3,"cute and clever, but probably better suited to a 10-year-old."
85,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29951959-victoria,4,I enjoyed this. A fun story about the properties of numbers. And I liked the drawing too.
86,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52492540-kristen-brown,1,"So, I didn't finish this. I guess I thought it would be more in line with _Flatland_And it is? But for basic number concepts and def. for children "
87,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69057910-irene,3,Loved this when I was little.
88,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72956711-lilly,5,This fun little book helped me learn many cool tricks about math AND keep me engaged with a funny little story line. I love this book and I definitely want to read it again!
89,0805062998,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7819857-yannicke,4,Read this book when I was little.. must have been 10 or so. Still remember it - combined a world of fantasy with numbers. Loved it
