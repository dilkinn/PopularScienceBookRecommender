I now know that the maths of the shape of the fifty pence coin is much less interesting than I might have imagined, also that gambling is a mugs game - think I knew that from playing penny up at school or cards with my card counting father, and that the variability of weight of loaves of bread may be affected by sample variance and local factors as much as by the baker making smaller loaves. No magic here, and possibly therefore no magical bonuses for the publisher that year!"
1,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16077597-matt,3,"This was a mixed bag for me. On one hand it’s an easy read, a beach read if you will, and it covers quite a lot of math’s ground in relatively little space. Most of the anecdotes and stories about former mathematicians I already knew, but it’s nice to have them all in one place. On the other hand the bock sometimes lacks a certain depth. It is noticeable that the author is trying to offer something to readers who have little or nothing to do with numbers and maths. Only those people would probably not want to read the book in the first place. The chapter on gambling (Slot/fruit machines, Roulette, Black-Jack) is too long, and my dear Gödel is missing completely! A conditional recommendation for people who like to brush up on their maths and not beaten up by formulas.

He has organized the book in the way that allows him to be chronological while also taking diversions from time to time to connect with what's happening now in the field of mathematics.He begins with a systematic exposition of the idea of numbers and the need for them and progresses steadily at a really comfortable pace to cover everything from shepherds using a hybrid base of numbers for counting their sheep to humans understanding incredibly weird and abstract concepts in mathematics with the help of crochet!On this journey, he makes some astonishing revelations and keeps you thoroughly entertained. I'm an engineer, so I might be slightly better positioned to understand this text, but the format and language of the book assumes nothing of the reader (without being condescending) and explains every concept in a way that even a lay person will be able to follow.It's no mean feat to be able to explain concepts like Zeno's paradox, regression to the mean, squaring a circle and Riemann's non-Euclidean geometry without using any equations. Bellos does that and more! He's juggling hardcore mathematics, entertaining (and often humorous) anecdotes and practical applications of math at the same time!The most endearing aspect of the book is that it doesn't take sides. It is incredibly neutral in its treatment of all the branches of math, no matter how bogus they may seem (I'm looking at you, Vedic math). All the people in this book have been treated as creative artists and their work has been explored with childlike wonder.There are many tidbits in the book that refresh your ideas of math. Indeed, for me this was a refresher of my entire math curriculum from school. And this book is also an answer (without actually trying to be) to all those people who ask – 'Why do we learn math if it has no real application in life?' Well, as amply demonstrated by Bellos, everything that is ever done in mathematics, be it silly games or idle curiosity, everything has been put to some use and had contributed to the progress of humanity.If nothing, you should read this book to learn about an encyclopedia of sequences (that also converts them into music), to see the unbelievable impact of the invention of the electronic calculator, to imagine a world of rivalries between human equation solvers and where human calculators would indulge in math duels! But if showmanship is not your cup of tea, then there's a really good critical examination of Pascal's wager, an exploration of the wonders of Pascal's triangle and of course, a fitting end to the book with a mind-mangling (a term I learned from this book) discussion of Cantor's various infinities.You must, must, must read this book. See the excerpts to know why (excerpts annotated with a lot of love)Thirty-fourth book reviewed as part of the 130 Challenge| Read on my blog"
3,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4385204-alan-wightman,3,"Alex Bellos attempts to engage the general public in mathematics by describing maths in a way that anyone can understand. He commences by describing how different cultures use counting and numbers, and in many ways this is the most interesting part of the book. Several cultures, for instance, have no name for any quantity greater than about 4. I have a degree in mathematics, but there were many things in the book that were new to me, and some that made my jaw drop. My feeling is though, that anyone without mathematical training may start to lose interest at about Chapter 5, when algebra is introduced. Probability, Number Theory, Geometry and Statistics follow, and in the limit as the page number tends to infinity, the book tends to resemble a maths textbook. Having said, as infinity was reached and the book finished, I was quite sad. There were six appendices to console me, however.I think that non-mathsy people will enjoy at least the first half, perhaps more. The title is enough however, to put off my non-mathsy girlfriend, who accused me of being a ""geek"" for reading it. Here are some of my favourite snippets:The current record for reciting the digital expansion of pi from memory is held by Akira Haraguchi, a 60 year old retired engineer from Japan. In 2006, he was filmed in a public hall near Tokyo reciting pi to 100,000 decimal places. The performance took him 16 hours and 28 minutes. He used a mnemonic technique, assigning syllables to each number from 0 to 9 and then translating pi's decimals into words, which in turn formed sentences. The record for pi memorisation whilst juggling is held by Mats Bergsten (Sweden) who has recited 9778 digits while juggling three balls. (p162/163).Ramanujan, in the early twentieth centiry, developed some remarkable infinite series for pi, including the mind blowing one on page 164 (can be seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan) without the help of computers. In the 1980s, presumably with the help of comupters, the Chudnovsky brothers developed an even more ferocious formula (p165).In December 2009, the record for determining the digital expansion of pi was broken, and now stands at 2.7 trillion places (p 168).The Great Internet Mesenne Prime Search (GIMPS) links about 75,000 computers across the world in the search for higher and higher prime numbers. The highest found (at the time of publication of the book) was 2^43112609-1, which is a number almost 13 million digits long (p 271).""Regression (to the mean) is one of the least grasped but most useful mathematical concepts you need for a rational understanding of the world"" (p 378)."
4,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42757570-chaitanya-sethi,5,"'Alex's Adventures in Numberland' is a book that I would want everyone to read. Part history, part sociology, and part philosophy, it traces the origins of man's desire to introduce numbers and counting into his life and how that choice has led to the growth of Mathematics today.While it may sound strange to us, the desire to question the need for math, Alex sets the ball rolling right from the first chapter(the zeroth, in the book) where he introduces a tribal community in the Amazon who don't have the vocabulary for numbers beyond 5 because they have no need for counting the things they own. It is at that point he makes you realize how much about the math around us we take for granted - why do we have a base 10 for counting, how did the names for the numbers come about, how did humans over the world establish math as a globally standard way of communicating, and where did the ideas for concepts like probability, statistics, and infinity come from?He also explores what he terms 'ethnomathematics' - the approach of different cultures towards Mathematics; how Indians(Hindus) have made Vedic math as a symbol of past glory and how Japanese have made mental arithmetic and the abacus a mark of intelligence. He's also traced the link of innovations and ideas over time - how one idea led to another and it snowballed into fads and theories. There are sprinkles of neat mathematical tricks and patterns to amuse the reader - curious little observations and theorems. There are references to religion and how many people associated the exploration of math to getting closer to divinity.Although it runs nearly 450 pages, it is a book one can breeze through. The writing is easy to follow and so are the mathematical explanations(for the most part). In any case, the point isn't to grasp the math but the philosophy behind it. If you'd like to spend some time being impressed with the ingenuity of brilliant minds who lived before us and had the ability to invent these concepts, then this book would be a field day for you."
5,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"The world of maths can seem mind-boggling, irrelevant and, let's face it, boring. This groundbreaking book reclaims maths from the geeks.This is how the blurb on the back cover starts. Alex's Adventures in Numberland isn't quite as awful as that suggests, but it's very apparent Bellos is a journalist, not a mathematician. He shares with most of his colleagues a subconscious but profound contempt of experts (to his credit, at least it is subconscious), an inability to distinguish substance and legitimacy from woo and crankery, or at least a belief that woo and crankery are interesting (he talks to ``Puff Daddy'''s numerologist (whom he calls a ``modern-day Pythagorean''), representatives from the cult behind Vedic maths, and economists), an unwillingness to let truth or nuance get in the way of a ``good story'', and a preference for expensive and pointless trips abroad to interview people he barely knows anything about over genuine research.The things he covers are the usual pedestrian party tricks and low-level trivia not even worth enumerating. The whole thing is analogous to someone who has just discovered the Flemish Primitives drawing a whole bunch of stick figures in an attempt to convey his new-found enthusiasm for painting; it's nice that you're enthusiastic (and I do believe he genuinely is), but dude, lurk before you post.I would say that this book would have been better if it had been written by a mathematician, but of course it has been, a thousand times over."
6,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3013648-priya,5,A must read for everyone. Those who love math will enjoy it thoroughly and those who don't are likely to develop a keen interest in the subject. 
7,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49023050-sumit-gouthaman,5,Didn't believe I'll read an entire book just about math. But this one is just weirdly engaging.
8,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33085883-benjamin-or-so-they-say,4,What an amazing adventure through the world of math. 
9,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,5,"Is this a great book, or did I read it at the right time? I am tutoring high-school math and found much inspiration in these pages. While there is little that is completely new for me, most of what is there is well explained. He provides a lot of historical background, starting with tribes using a number system of one, two, many. The author is not afraid of philosophy, as can be seen in this meditation on the number zero:“Indian philosophy embraced the concept of nothingness just as Indian math embraced the concept of zero. The conceptual leap that led to the invention of zero happened in a culture that accepted the void as the essence of the universe. The symbol that emerged to represent zero, the circle, encapsulated the message that mathematics cannot be separated from spirituality. Zero means nothing, and it means eternity.”He later informs us that when math prodigy Jedediah Buxton was taken to see Shakespeare's Richard III, his reaction was that the actors had taken 5,202 steps and spoken 14,445 words. Before one generalizes about crazy mathematicians, note that a prodigy means an ability to do complex mental arithmetic, such as multiplying two six-digit numbers. Other than that, the guy was barely literate. To me, the story reveals why they are able to do seemingly impossible tasks - they spend their entire lives doing nothing but arithmetic, and by practice get very good at it. In contrast, mathematicians deal with abstractions, so maybe they are slightly crazy in different ways.As for the math, the book ends with what I think is the best explanation of multiple levels of infinity I have seen. Or was I just at the right state of knowledge for his explanation? Still, I highly recommend this book for those interested in mathematics at the high school level."
10,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1026662-christy,4,"This strays so far from my normal read, but I found it very interesting, and Bellos' writing was engaging.I've been spending the summer feeling like one of the teachers from Pink Floyd's The Wall, forcing my 12 year old to study Algebra in preparation for next school year. It's been shear hell for both of us. Neither of us likes math, but I'm a really stubborn woman & I've been seeking sources that will make math & algebra more accessible, more understandable, maybe even interesting. Who knew? There's a lot out there! YouTube is rich with cool math tricks, etc., and there are some how-to books that explain it well.This is not a book of practical applications, and I won't make my 12 year old read it - there are some tough spots for sure. Maybe if I forbid him from reading it he will. This is more an exploration of math throughout history and around the world, different ways things have evolved, what mathematicians do for fun - such as adding digits to Pi - and why they do it. It's just a whole lot of interesting!One of the big take-aways was that plenty of great mathematicians weren't very good at ""math"". Wish I could deliver that message to a few students who've been turned off by math and their teachers. "
11,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/909939-brian-sison,5,"This is a great book that delves into the fascinating history of math. Stops along the way include the advent of zero, the use of the abacus and the sliderule, the search for the trillionth decimal in pi, the Fibonacci sequence, the golden ratio, fractals, varying levels of infiniti, counting cards in blackjack, the definition of what's ""normal"", and straight lines that aren't straight.Unlike some books that try to cover so many topics, Bellos goes into enough depth in each chapter to educate, entertain, and satisfy even a well-versed mathematician. As the subtitle states, this is truly ""A Surprising Excursion through the Astonishing World of Math."""
12,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,5,"When I was a kid, I remember reading and loving E.T. Bell's ""Men of Mathematics"". I later learned that his scholarship leaves something to be desired, but he brought out the humanity and genius of the big names and famous characters of mathematics. Bellos doesn't have a similar goal in ""Alex's Adventures in Numberland"", as he's just as interested in applications and the quirky patterns of maths as he is in the people behind it, but he captured my interest the way no writer since E.T. Bell has. You should read this book.I normally collect the Good Bits from books in my reviews, but I'm not going to do that this time: you should buy or borrow it, read it, and enjoy it."
13,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8444260-dave-hill,5,"If you read just one book about math this year, it should totally be this one and I am right about everything."
14,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44789316-raquel-evans,4," The irony of this book is that it was so good I wanted to go through it slowly enough to absorb all the information, which led to me getting distracted and reading other things instead, so it took me approximately forever to finish it.  Entertaining and informative, and occasionally mind blowing, I would recommend this book be read by anyone who is considering whether to study higher branches of mathematics. If the concepts here intrigue you, go for it! If they put you off, go for a different focus of study, but at least you'll have a basic exposure to the concepts, which is more than a lot of people have.  I'd also highly recommend this book for anyone who's about to teach math to children, as it goes into some of the differences between how different cultures teach math, and will give you ideas for fun ways to present some math concepts. "
15,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46616940-oscar-despard,4,"This was an excellent, fascinating read. A comforting mix of history, anecdote and mathematical wonder, it was a brilliant book. While I preferred the style and presentation of the second book in this duo (Alex Through the Looking Glass, which I actually read before this one, and to which I gave five stars), the abstract mathematics in this book far surpassed its successor in the sheer amazement it created. The last chapter utterly stunned me, in particular.I have always loved maths, but knew only a small amount of the facts, wonder and beauty that this book describes. No matter your mathematical knowledge, this varied description of the the relationship of maths to linguistics, psychology and philosophy cannot fail to delight and amaze. I would recommend it to anyone."
16,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16326219-ishwarya,5,"I would highly recommend this book to all high school students, college students and everyone else who have learnt basic Maths. Especially, teachers and parents who teach Maths, pls read!! The beauty of this book is that the history of centuries of Math has been covered in a breezy fun to read way. It is an easy read and yet made me almost spiritual by showing me the beauty of Maths..I pity myself for not seeing it all this time and glad I read this book!"
17,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80316235-jitendra-singh,4,It's an exceptional book but at the same time I must confess that I didn't fully understand some of the portions. But I highly enjoyed it. A must read for anyone who loves math
18,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35454681-howard-tobochnik,4,"I read Here's Looking at Euclid after reading Bellos' other book Grapes of Math. These two books have a very similar style, and I think I enjoyed both equally. Bellos really does a great job explaining big ideas in mathematics, while fitting in history, mathematicians, puzzles, and jokes. Here are a few interesting quotes from Here's Looking at Euclid:For the Munduruku, [who do not have a counting system past the number 5], the whole idea of counting anything was ludicrous. (4)When King David counted his own people he was punished with three days of pestilence and 77,000 deaths. Jews are meant to count Jews only indirectly, which is why in synagogues the way of making sure then are ten men present, a minyan, or sufficient community for prayers, is to say a ten-word prayer pointing at one person per word. Counting people with numbers is considered a way of singling people out, which makes them more vulnerable to malign influences. (4)Why do Indians and children think that higher numbers are closer together than lower numbers? ... The Munduruku and the children seem to be making their decisions about where numbers lie by estimating the ratios between amounts. In considering ratios, it is logical that the distance between five a one is much greater than the distance between ten and five. (6)The precedence of approximations and ratios over exact numbers, Pica suggests, is due to the fact that ratios are much more important for survival in the wild than the ability to count. Faced with a group of spear-wielding adversaries, we needed to know instantly whether there were more of them than us. When we saw two trees we needed to know instantly which had more fruit hanging from it. (7)Mathematical truths cannot be influenced by culture or ideology. On the other hand, our approach to mathematics is very much influenced by culture. The selection of base ten, for example, was premised not on mathematical reasons but on physiological ones, the numbers of our fingers and toes. (35)The ability to calculate rapidly has no great correlation with mathematical insight or creativity. Only a few great mathematicians have demonstrated lightning calculator skills, and many mathematicians are surprisingly poor at arithmetic. (96)The first time a digit [of pi] is repeated six times consecutively is 999999 at the 762nd decimal place. the likelihood of six 9s occurring so early if they occur randomly is less than 0.1 percent. This sequence is known as the Feynman point, since physicist Richard Feynmanonce remarked that he wanted to memorize pi until that point and finish by saying ""nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, and so on."" (117)Logarithms, wrote Napier, were able to free mathematicians from the ""tedious expense of time"" and the ""slippery errors"" involved in the ""multiplications, divisions, square and cubical extractions of great numbers."" With Napier's invention, not only could multiplication be made into the addition of logs, but division the subtraction, square roots the division of logs by two, and cube roots the division of logs by three. (129)The concept of ""persistence"" is the number of steps that it takes to get to a single digit by multiply all the digits of the preceding number to obtain a second number, and so on until you get down to a single digit. For example: 88 -> 8x8 = 64 -> 6x4 = 24 -> 2x4 = 89. So according to Sloane's system, 88 has persistence 3 ... Sloane has never discovered a number that has a persistence greater than 11, even after checking every number all the way up to 10^233, which is 1 followed by 233 zeros. (175)The concept of ""powertrain"" is that for any number written abcd, then its powertrain is (a^b)(c^d)... Conway wanted to know if there were any indestructible digits - numbers that did not reduce to a single digit under the powertrain ... Conway's powertrain is such a lethal machine that it annihilates every number in the universe apart from 2592 and 24547284284866560000000000 - two seemingly unrelated, fixed points in the never-ending expanse of numbers. (177)Recaman Sequence: (A5132) 0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7, 13, 20, 21, 11, 22, 10, 23, 9, 24, 8, 25, 43, 62, 42, 63, 41, 18, 42 ... The numbers are generated using the following simple rule: ""subtract if you can, otherwise add."" To get the nth term, we take the previous term and either add or subtract n from it. (178)Gijswijt's Sequence: (190822) 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2 ... (180)What is the largest number less than 1? It is not 0.9, since 0.99 is larger and still less than 1. It is not 0.99 since 0.999 is larger still and also less than 1. The only possible candidate is the recurring decimal 0.99999 .... Yet this is where we come to a paradox. It cannot be 0.99999... , since 0.99999... is identical to 1! Think of it this way. If 0.99999... is a number different from 1, then there must be space between them on the number line. So it must be possible to squeeze a number in the gap that is larger than 0.99999.... and smaller than 1. (188)\The delights of the harmonic series (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 ...) are profuse, so let's have some more fun with it. Consider the harmonic series excluding every term that has a 9 in it, which is also an infinite series ... Recall that the harmonic series adds up to infinity, so one might thing that the harmonic series with no 9s also adds up to a pretty high number. Wrong. It adds up to just under 23. (191)Here's another interesting mathematical property of the Fibonacci sequence. Take any three consecutive F-numbers. The first number multiplied by the third number is always different by 1 from the second number squared. This property is the basis of a centuries-old magic trick, in which it is possible to cut up a square of 64 unit squares into four pieces and reassemble them to make a square of 65 pieces ... The trick is explained by the fact that the shapes are not a perfect fit. Though it is not obvious to the naked eye, there is a long thin gap along the middle diagonal with area of one unit. (199)Insurance is much like playing the slots. Both are systems built on probability theory in which the losses of almost everyone pay for the winnings of a few. And both can be fantastically profitable for those controlling the payback percentages ... Buying an insurance policy is a negative expectation bet, and as such, it is a bad gamble. So why do people take out insurance if it's such a bad deal? The difference between insurance and gambling in casinos is that in casinos you are gambling with money you can afford to lose. With insurance, however, you are gambling to protect something you cannot afford to lose. (222-223)Why is gambler;s fallacy such a strong human urge? It's all about control. We like to feel in control of our environment. If events occur randomly, we feel that we have no control over them. Conversely, if we do have control over events they are not random. This is why we prefer to see patterns where there are none. (226)Mathematically speaking, lotteries are by far the worst type of legal bet ... In rare instances, however, lotteries can be the best bet around. This is the case when, due to ""roll over"" jackpots, the prize money has grown to become larger than the cost of buying every possible combination of numbers ... In 1992, [Stefan Mandel, a Romanian mathematician] identified the Virginia state lottery - a lottery with seven million combinations, each costing $1 a ticket - whose jackpot had reached $28 million. Mandel got to work. He printed out coupons in Australia, filled them in by computer so that they covered the seven million combinations, and the flew the coupons to the United States. He won the first prize and 135,000 secondary prizes too. (230-231)"

I figured anyone with a good sense of humor like that might do a reasonable job on a popular math book. It exceeded expectations!Bellos does a lively romp through various everyday (and some not so everyday) things with little resort to heavy equations or other soporific or brain-wrenching stuff. He covers sudoku, magic squares, number sequences, the probability and statistics of gambling and betting systems, pi and transcendental numbers, phi and nature, people's number sense, infinity -- you name it! Only the very last chapter had my brain contorting in an attempt to understand the concepts he was presenting. But I still enjoyed it!Only two very small quibbles. There are a handful of places where there are errors which could lead to confusion. They are minor, and only if you're reading very closely would you catch them. Secondly, the endnotes for the chapters, and the appendices, are online only. I really don't like that. If I want to refer to the book about something 10 years from now, is that website still going to be there? I'm sure this wasn't Bellos' choice, but the publisher's. Very poor choice, Mr. or Ms. Publisher! I'm sure 20 more pages in an already thin book wouldn't have broken the bank! Thoroughly readable by the mathphobic and mathly-challenged. Lively, interesting, entertaining. A delightful read I can recommend to anyone. Mr. Bellos: WRITE MORE BOOKS!"
21,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1567963-emily,4,"I'm not a math person by any stretch of the imagination, but I found this book to be a lot of fun...until about halfway through when some of the math discussions started going way over my head (but that's my fault, not the author's). This is basically a book about the history of mathematical thought and Bellos does a good job of pulling it all together in an entertaining and informative way. We learn where numbers come from, how we went from counting sticks to written numbers, the invention of zero, number mysticism, infinity and beyond infinity, mathematical crochet(!), and my personal favorite chapter, the Japanese soroban (abacus)--learn how to move the beads in your head and you can become a calculating rock star, adding strings of numbers quicker than you can type them into a calculator. Kids in the US should really learn how to use this thing. Anyway, a great book highly recommended for anyone with even a slight interest in the subject. "

Can anyone please explain to me why it is important to know that there are sets of numbers larger than infinity? Some of the stuff made practical sense, but who cares if the numbers between zero and one is a set of numbers larger than infinity? Will it solve a bigger problem some day or is it mathematicians doing the equivalent of ""mine's bigger""? I enjoyed the chapter on odds, percentages and gambling. That had a real-world application. Even the crocheting of different dimensional shapes had a practical application, as a physical model. The Infinity Hotel, not so much, at least to me. I'm not trying to be rude, I really want to know the practical application for it. I'm curious. Until my curiosity is resolved, I'm skeptical. "
23,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"Deftly written and engaging, and manages to be (mostly) comprehensible to the non-mathematician. Bellos clearly loves him some numbers, and expresses his wonder and excitement well. It's also a fun and quirky ride that covers counting, maths tools from the Rig Veda, gambling, geometry, sudoku and more.No, I did not know that there are sets of infinities greater than infinity. I wasn't aware that crochet was instrumental in 20th Century breakthroughs in maths and physics. Fibonacci numbers help explain the position of leaves around a stem, or seeds in a flower? Shut up!"

Mr. Bellos also weaves in studies and observations about how math wires the brain, and how children in some cultures learn to count earlier because of the names of numbers.This is a very interesting and inspiring book, especially for those of us who think in words, not numbers, but who are interested in the very act and method of thinking."

33,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33744149-robert-h-gh,3,"The most sacred object in Islam is a Platonic solid: the Ka'ba, or Cube, is the black palladium at the centre of Mecca's Sacred Mosque, around which pilgrims walk anticlockwise during the Hajj. (In fact, its dimensions make it just off a perfect cube). The Ka'ba also marks the point that worshippers must face during daily prayer, wherever they are in the world. Mathematics plays more of a role in Islam than in any other major religion. More than a millennium before the advent of GPS technology, the requirements to face Mecca relied on complicated astronomical calculations - which is one reason why Islamic science was unequalled for almost a thousand years. (98)Origami, the art of paper-folding, evolved from the custom of Japanese farmers thanking the gods at harvest time by making an offering of some of their crops on a piece of paper. Rather than placing the produce on a flat sheet, they would make one diagonal fold in the paper to give the offering a human touch. (102)The ability to calculate rapidly has no great correlation with mathematical insight or creativity. Only a few great mathematicians have demonstrated lightning-calculator skills, and many mathematicians have surprisingly poor arithmetic. (144)'Man is never more ingenious than in the invention of games,' said Gottfried Leibniz, for instance, whose love of peg solitaire resonated with his obsession with binary numbers: a hole either has a peg in it or it doesn't, it is either a 1 or a 0. (233)Eadem mutata resurgo, or 'Although changed, I shall arise the same'. (294)It could be argued, in fact, that the invention of probability was the root cause of the decline, over the last few centuries, of superstition and religion. If unpredictable events obey mathematical laws, there is no need to have them explained by deities. The secularization of the world is usually associated with thinkers such as Charles Darwin and Friedrich Nietzsche, yet quite possibly the man who set the ball rolling was Girolamo Cardano. (305)The above argument is known as Pascal's Wager. It can be summarized as follows: if there is the slightest probability that God exists, it is overwhelmingly worthwhile to believe in Him. This is because if God doesn't exist a non-believer has nothing to lose, but if He does exist a non-believer has everything to lose. It's a no-brainer. Be a Christian, go on, you might as well.Upon closer examination, though, Pascal's argument, of course, doesn't work. For a start, he is only considering the option of believing in a Christian God. What about the gods of any other religion, or even of made-up religions? Imagine that, in the afterlife, a cat made of green cheese will determine whether we go to Heaven or Hell. Although this isn't very likely, it's still a possibility. By Pascal's argument, it is worthwhile to believe that this cat made from green cheese exists, which is, of course, absurd. (312)The law of large numbers says that if a coin is flipped three times, it might not come up heads at all, but flip it three billion times and you can be pretty sure that it will come up heads almost exactly 50 per cent of the time. (317)An insurance premium is no different from a gamble. You are betting on the chance that, for example, your house will be burgled. If your house is burgled, you receive a payout, which is the reimbursement for what was stolen. If your house isn't burgled you, of course, receive nothing… Since insurance companies pay out less than they receive in premiums, their payout percentage is less than 100 per cent. Buying an insurance policy is a negative-expectation bet and, as such, it is a bad gamble.So why do people take out insurance if it's such a bad deal? The difference between insurance and gambling in casinos is that in casinos you are (hopefully) gambling with money you can afford to lose. With insurance, however, you are gambling to protect something you cannot afford to lose. While you will inevitably lose small amounts of money (the premium), this guards you against losing a catastrophic amount of money (the value of the contents of your house, for example). Insurance offers a good price for peace of mind. It follows, however, that insuring against losing a non-catastrophic amount of money is pointless. (321)True randomness has no memory of what came before. (324)Whenever you have a randomly selected group of 23 people, it is more likely than not that two people in it will share the same birthday. The phenomenon is known as the 'birthday paradox.' (326)In a mathematical context, regression to the mean is the statement than an extreme event is likely to be followed by a less extreme event.

34,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38595471-misty-chien,3,"I was still reading Quantum when I went ahead and read the introduction of Alex’s Adventures in Numberland by Alex Bellos because it had arrived in the mail that day. From the beginning, I liked Bellos’s language. It is straigh-forward and easy to read. It is like talking to a fellow mathematics nerd who is more knowledgable than yourself, not a mathematician.My favorite chapter is definitely the one on the history of Pi. It is very well-written, and it explains what is the deal with Pi very clearly, starting from its origins, proofs, computations, and modern applications. All are very interesting and worth reading if you are curious about the irrational.However, in my opinion, I didn’t find anything so strikingly insightful that a university level math or science student must read. I think this is a fun read for slightly younger students to get excited and see that mathematics exists beyond the classroom. For me, an already established physics nerd, I became more aware of the numbers that I encounter on a daily basis, but I didn’t think the book made me love mathematics per se. This book didn’t get me excited as some other physics books, like Max Tegmark’s Our Mathematical Universe or even Manjit Kumar’s Quantum, did. Although, I did recommend this book to my lab partner in physics class, as it mentioned something about whiz wheels that pilots need to learn how to use during a conversation about logarithms, since my friend wants to be a pilot. I am somewhat indebted to this book, because I spent most of my time talking about it with my maths teacher and physics classmates on the last day of school when nothing is really happening in classes. The book is filled with lots of interesting facts and trivial information that one might be able to make connections from.A thing about this book is that it is quite involved numbers and recreational mathematics. For example, there is a part on numerology, which shares the mysticism in astrology, and a large part of a chapter on Vedic mathematics, which focuses on very simple operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying), as well. This is just a personal preference that I prefer to read a more in depth discussion of the pure mathematical concepts that are more intriguing and the application in other sciences, but for that I would go for a separate book. The book alludes to the maths somewhat and its applications, but for many chapters, the text revolves around certain segments of Bellos’s trips to meet people involved with numbers and maths at varying levels. Again, I feel like I don’t appreciate all the emphasis on numbers and off-beat mathematicians.Also, the book is heavy on diagrams, which may seem daunting when one is just flipping through the book. This should not scare off the reader though, as they turn out to be very very simple as one reads along. This also means that it is relatively easy and fast to go through the pages as the diagrams take up so much space.Yet I must not forget that the book gave me a nice picture of mathematics as a subject. I saw that I should not take numbers as we know it for granted. Starting from counting and mathematical intuition to the development of modern mathematics, the book goes chronologically, but never too in depth. I learned that modern mathematics involves the study of the hyperbolic, where Non-Euclidean geometry applies, and the study of infinities. This is where the book stops. I think the book is missing a finishing thought, some sort of Feynman-style closing speech on the wonders and value of mathematics. Otherwise, I do think this is a fun read and would recommend to anyone slightly interested in science, maths, engineering, or even the social sciences (as the book does dip into a variety of side topics)."
35,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Numbers are not ubiquitous in human societies. This is just one of the many facts that can be learned from “Here’s Looking At Euclid,” an entry on popular mathematics from Alex Bellos. That isn’t to say that numbers themselves are useless or that the people have no concept of number, they just don’t need to have numbers past five or so. I have heard of tribes of people that are like this, and it is quite fascinating. For instance, take the number line, you know, that thing you learned in second grade that organizes all the integers into an evenly spaced line. Apparently, if you tell a kindergartner or someone unfamiliar with numbering to arrange numbers from 1 to 10, they will arrange those numbers in a logarithmic fashion. After all, 10 is twice as large as 5. Thus, it is thought that ratios play a bigger part than exact answers. This makes sense. If you encounter a pride of lions, why bother counting the exact number of lions in the pride? It is sufficient to know if your tribe or troop has more members.There is other interesting information in the book as well. Take the idea of changing to base-12 for everything. This so-called “dozenal” system has many ardent supporters. It makes some fractions easier to grok. Some have even tried to go all the way to a base-60 system, but it requires far too many terms. It talks about why your average Chinese person can memorize more digits than your average English speaker (the words for the numbers are shorter, allowing them to fit more into the phonetic loop) and the mastery of the abacus for mental calculations.Some things seem obvious right now but were not to people of the past. Take the concept of nothing, the zero for instance. The zero has tons of utility as a placeholder and as a concept in and of itself. Without zero we might have to do arithmetic with Roman Numerals or something, and who honestly would want to do something so cumbersome? It talks about Vedic Mathematics, Mental Math, the method of exhaustion for finding the value of pi, and so on.Speaking of pi, that is another interesting subject. Back before we knew of algebraic expansions and series, we had to put a circle between two polygons. There were tons of contests and shows of prowess to get the number as accurate as possible. The fact that it isn’t practical wasn’t the point; the point was that it could be more accurate. It’s like people climbing Everest or going to the South Pole. Sometimes it is the romance that draws people.Some of it follows logically from the previously covered material. Take the idea of logarithms; immediately following those is the invention of the Slide Rule, the obsolete tool that got us to the Moon and back. Then there is the section on Recreational Mathematics. It covers Sudoku, Magic Squares, the Fifteen Puzzle, Tangrams, the Rubik’s Cube, Chess Problems, ambigrams, and Martin Gardner.Throughout the book are such interesting bits of trivia. The book doesn’t really contain many equations that would put a person off of reading it, and Bellos writes in a manner that shows his own fascination with the subject, and his enthusiasm shines through the pages."
36,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29553403-mark-howard,5,"Just finished “Everything and More - A Compact History of Infinity” by David Foster Wallace prior to reading “Here’s Looking at Euclid”. Bellos’ book was much easier to read and way more enjoyable. I can’t deny that these two books caught my attention initially because of their fantastic titles. Love them both!In the final chapter of “...Euclid” I was rewarded for having persevered through “Everything and More...” with Wallace’s rambling style and his endless footnotes. In the discussion on infinity (which Bellos related ever so much more succinctly and clearly than Wallace) was a lengthy quote from Wallace describing, rather artfully, the price that Georg Cantor paid in taming infinity for the benefit of us mere mortals.In “Here’s Looking at Euclid” Bellos covers a lot of ground, explaining complex math concepts in a way that’s easy to grasp and follow along, adding just enough human interest and background storytelling to make it interesting.I could have done with less discussion on the odds and mathematical underpinnings of gambling. He carries on at length about probability, almost all of it in the context of casinos and Black Jack tables. Oddly missing from the chapter on probability was even a mention of the famed “Monty Hall” problem. I was looking forward to Bellos’ take on this classic conundrum but was ultimately disappointed. A highlight of my experience reading this book occurred when I tried to access the appendices. The text instructs the reader to check the book’s website. Alas the web site no longer hosts the appendices, but it does provide an email link and a note from the author promising to send them as a zip file upon request. Sure enough I got a personal reply within 48 hours including the sought for bonus material!"
37,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40340179-alisa,3,"i’m undecided between rating this three stars to reflect my feelings of the book in light of my expectations of it, or four stars to match my history of inflated ratings (by which scale three stars might be harsh). here’s looking at euclid has a lot of fascinating math factoids and very naturally leads even an uninterested reader along many different fields of math and their origins and applications. i personally learned quite a bit, even in sections where i already had previous knowledge, and it was definitely nice to match my knowledge to societal and historical events and people that affected or were affected by that particular bit of math. overall, the book does not delve into any one thing deeply enough to give the reader enough interest in any of the many subjects to be impactful - at least, as someone who is interested in math, i was disappointed to have the commentary cut short at times, and left with no real desire to pursue any of the covered topics in greater depth. other things that bothered me about this book was the touches of sexism — the idea that crocheting and other handiwork is a woman’s activity and therefore only a female mathematician could make a mathematical contribution in relation to such craft. i also took issue with the idea that “after reimann and cantor, math lost its connection to any intuitive appreciation of the world” (291). after numerous stories of how crazy abstract mathematical concepts became ways to describe the world, how could the author make such an assumption, and use that assumption to conclude the book?that all being said, there were still highly interesting parts. my favourites were the ones about probability and statistics, which is good because i’ll be taking a class on that very soon!"
38,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66088505-katja,5,"Fascinating insights into the world of mathsI wish, I had discovered this book earlier in my life. It's not that I was bad at maths, but it was always elusive to grasp and to really understand. This book takes fear out of maths by explaining even the most complex concepts calmly and patiently. I especially loved the historical development: from the need of numbers higher than five, to establishing geometric axioms with nothing but a compass, to calculating logarithms without having the technical equipment we have now.Basically, that's what students need to learn at school, I think. Because one of the most often complaints about maths (at least when I was at school) was ""Why do I need to learn this, if I can get my smartphone to calculate everything for me?"" This book teaches why certain concepts (for example like Pi) are so special and fascinating and how mathematical principles have evolved into what they are today. Overall, a great, interesting, and highly entertaining read! It's not the easiest book, but it made me think in a way not many other books did. If someone told me at school that I would ponder mathematical theorems in my free time, I wouldn't have believed them. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to give maths a second chance and discover a whole new world of numbers and patterns. 5/5"
39,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2151106-anne-potter,4,"Here's Looking at Euclid is an undeniably fascinating read. My interest in math is casual at best, and my proficiency level has not improved since high school. Still, I never felt like the history nor concepts were getting so involved that I wanted to give up on the read, which was my initial fear. There were certainly more challenging parts, but even touching on the more mentally strenuous areas, there was always enough interesting anecdotal narrative to pull me through.This book (the US version to the UK's Alex's Adventures in Numberland) covers everything from primitive counting, the invention of zero, and early geometry all the way to probability/gambling, sudoku, the golden ratio, hyperbolic shapes (even hyperbolic crochet!), and of course - infinity. There truly was not a dull moment in this book. My only con is that the US version features no appendix. You have to email the author to get it. He responded next business day, but I read this mostly over a long weekend and therefore had to go back through the book to re-explore some key concepts once I received it. And it wasn't long, so I'm unsure why it isn't simply part of the book itself. That being said, I highly recommend."
40,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63086025-danielle,5,"Alex Bellos is quickly becoming one of my favorite math authors and I can't wait to read something else from him. I would sincerely recommend this book to people who enjoy math, both beginners, amateurs and maybe even professionals. Bellos does great on several accounts. All three points I make may be the same. First: depth and originality. A lot of these books talk about the same things we all know and love about math; Bellos touches a many of those same topics but takes them to new levels of depth and in new relationship with concepts both old and recent, with the history of math and the current-day investigation. Second: his writing style. The way he takes a single topic and strings it along different characters, geographies and related subjects with great ease and interest, always finding the more human and emotional side. Third: length. Neither this nor Grapes of Math are a collection of his Sunday columns on a newspaper: they are a handful of essays written specially for his books, so they are longer, making it possible for him to have a personal style and tackle things with depth and originality. "
41,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47247994-chris-waraksa,4,"Bellos walks you through a sort of mathematical sideshow, telling us to look at this and that curious and freaky area of math. It is an interesting journey and often leaves you gobsmacked. Sometimes the interest lies in the curious way that math works and sometimes the interest lies in learning about the people who have extreme mathematical talents and obsessions. For example you learn that there are people who can do a rubric cube blindfolded, others who spend their time coming up with new number sequences, a religious leader of India with his own methods of math, a woman who folded 66,000 business cards to form a four foot square menger sponge, and on and on. The chapters stand alone, so you can dip into this one or that one and can skip any that seem too esoteric. I have to admit that there were times when an explanation lost me due to being too compact and abbreviated. There were also times when I, realizing that the math was a bit beyond me, skipped ahead, but those moments were few and for the most part anyone, even an English major like me, can enjoy this glimpse at the odd and curious corners of math."
42,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76445961-fiona,3,"I really liked this book. I began reading it a few years ago and never got round to finishing it, but I'm glad I finally did. I loved the first part of the book which talked about more abstract elements like the number 0, base 12 and the Amazonian tribes. I also really liked all the anecdotes about different mathematicians that were dotted throughout the book; it's amazing to see how different all their areas of maths were.If I was unexperienced with maths, I think would've been the ideal way to introduce myself to some concepts like logarithms and sequences and infinite, but having studied maths for a while it was just nice to see things explained in a more 'human' way. I'm not sure if that makes sense.I'm not the biggest fan of probability and statistics because no matter how nicely you dress it up with stories about casinos and card games, it just reminds me of school work and it isn't fun for my brain to read about. Overall a really good introduction into a lot of different areas in maths. 3/3.5 out of 5 stars."
43,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12853697-olga-zhilitskaya,3,"I think I’d have loved this book more, if I actually read it as a paper book rather than listened to an audio version. It was often hard to concentrate and follow an idea, when the author described some heavy calculations, formulas or patterns. This might as well be related to the fact that I generally understand new concepts much better when they’re presented visually.I also completely agree with one of the commentators below who said that the book is full of anecdotes which you’d never be able to remember a minute later. That’s true. So, funny to read (or in my case - to listen), but I doubt I’d ever amuse my friends with any of these anecdotes.The author also added a lot of descriptions of mathematicians he met personally trying to make them more ‘alive’ to the reader. But to me it made no sense at all, as it brought no additional value and hugely overloaded the chapters.To sum up, I recommend to read, and it’ll most probably be an easy read for you. But it’s unlikely to become one of your favourites."
44,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110738527-toni-borisov,5,"This is literally a journey across numberland, and quite interesting I would say. The author takes you from the invention of numbers to intricate concepts such as the complexity of Pi, probability theory or ""Non-Euclidian"" geometry while telling real stories about people and their math enthusiasm. I expected something more difficult to grasp but actually you don't need any elaborate knowledge in math to understand this book. It is self-evident how much work Alex Bellos has put in order to write it. He evaluates all kinds of statements and using rational thought shows how flawed the human mind could be. Not only that but the whole book makes your look on math filled with appreciation and numinosity.I hesitated between 4 and 5 stars because of a few a bit boring chapters filled with too much history and less math. This can be explained with regression to the mean. The Gaussian distribution varied toward 5 stars so that's my final score. If you don't know what I'm talking about, read the book and find out!"
45,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3993729-jenny,4,"I don't like math. When I picked up this book, it was for my daughter who thinks that kind of thing is interesting. Before giving it to her, I flipped it open just to look at it and I got hooked! The first chapter was absolutely fascinating, talking about tribes with no words for numbers beyond 5 and discussing what a number system that wasn't based on 10 would look like. Since I never think about this stuff, it was totally mind-boggling to me. Anyway, I don't think my daughter ever did read the entire book. It became mine, and although after the first chapter it wasn't exactly a page-turner (I had to struggle to understand some of the math concepts so it wasn't what I'd call a beach read) it was still fascinating and I'm glad I slogged through it. It stretched my mind and led to some interesting table conversations.All in all, it was very well-written. If I enjoyed a math book written by Alex Bellos, you know he's a good writer!"
46,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12899070-jacek-laskowski,1,"Very disappointed after all the high-rank reviews (here on Goodreads, “The Sunday Times Bestseller” and “Shortlisted for the BBC Samuel Johnson prize” and the other award titles on the cover). I think my great expectation for the book may’ve been because of my degree in computer science and that I somehow got used to reading math-heavy books. I actually hoped this one would’ve been lighter on the content and been like a novel. The need to read it wore off around the page 165 (half through the chapter 4 “Life of Pi”) and I must admit that I was to have abandoned it after the first two chapters actually. I thought I’d give the book a longer try, but the more I tried the tougher it became. I seemed to have actually hoped to read a more math-deep book, but the book quickly turned out too shallow and eventually very boring."
47,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16707866-andrew,4,"A very enjoyable and highly informative read. However, just one point on the final chapter regarding the empty Hilbert Hotel problem. It is stated at the beginning that an infinite number of guests arrive with t-shirts displaying decimal expansions between 0 and 1 and that ""every single decimal expansion between 0 and 1 is covered"". The author then goes on to artificially construct a decimal expansion from the previous ones by simple operations. He proposes that this number cannot be on the list created by the receptionist and hence the guest cannot be allocated a room. Surely, if every expansion is covered, then this is a contradiction and there must be a guest with that number.It is highly probable that I am not intelligent enough to grasp the concept and so perhaps another reviewer, or even the author himself could provide a simple guide for this idiot.AW"

It was clear from the first chapter that it was more like the history of maths. No problem, it could be quite interesting. And some parts were very entertaining. But sometimes I had to listen for minutes on end to number after number after number. For example in the chapter about pi. It was really interesting to hear about what pi is and how accurate it has to be to still be practical. But at that year person x got to 20 numbers after the decimal, and 20 years later person y broke that record by calculating 50,... Or the chapter about the soroban where he wrote about those super calculators and was writing number after number. It was an entertaining book but it could be way shorter."

I realized the nature of Zero, how it represents everything that can not is quantified, but wait not like infinity, but not the opposite either. I realized how Log represents a more natural way of counting than counting with numbers.I realized why x is where the x is.I realized How math and problems went and goes hand in hand and can never be separated, it would not be wrong to say, that math is where problems where and math will be where problems are today. The only constant and truth. I always thought as a kid in real life we will use everything thought in school but math, boy I was wrung so wrong can't even calculate the extend of it :P"

Or at least if you never wondered about them before, you will after reading about it. The books doesn't go deep into detail and doesn't require any prior knowledge. It is more like a travel guide for numberland. Showing you places you might want to revisit again.My favourite chapter would have to be the chapter on our innate sense of numbers. I must have also enjoyed the chapters which present physical mathematical devices and puzzles, since I ended up buying a second hand engineering slide rule, just so I could play with one myself."

The topics I found particularly intriguing and beautiful are Life of Pi, Playtime (about puzzles), Infinity, Fibonacci Number and The Golden Ratio. It's fascinating to see how Mathematics developed into a very abstract subject rather than talking mostly about real things (in the past) and how different fields in Mathematics actually relate to each other in special and peculiar ways. It doesn't contain much Mathematics so it's definitely worth a read even if you dislike (or hate :P) Mathematics!"
53,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7643418-vivike,4,"A foreign correspondent who once in a distant past got a degree in math, decided to combine these two skills. The result is a book that touches on a lot of mathematical topics, but that feels more like a travel guide than a math book.He touches on all the familiar topics, but also on some (non-European) topics that I haven't read much about before (counting by chimpanzees, soroban, the number system of the Yupno). As it goes with these type of books, every topic is touched only superficially, but the sheer number of topics touched upon is enormous, and as such the book can serve as good inspiration for someone looking for a workshop topic, for example."
54,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100542167-michael,3,"First off, the only reason why I rate this excellent book a 3 star is almost definitely down to personal taste. There are certain chapters where I was absolutely in love with the concepts and writing, especially in the chapters that covered Pi, Phi, and Succession. however, there were chapter which I found myself just trying to get through it to get to the next topic.This is an excellent read for someone thoroughly interested in mathematics, and to some degree those who are less so inclined. I believe that there is at least one chapter in this book that someone will - maybe not make them fall in love with mathematics, but perhaps they respect it more or find it in some way beautiful."
55,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37644039-erik-molnar,5,"Mind blown. Mission accomplished. Numbers are part of our everyday lives, but how much thought do you put into them other than figuring out how much to tip or how much you should budget for the month. I wanted to get a better understanding of numbers without having to learn all of the difficult math behind it all, most if which I never learned or already forgot how to do. This book is exactly what i was looking for. Easy read. Mind blowing concepts. There is no why behind it all, don’t look for that here. This book just shows what we know about seemingly magical properties of numbers and how we came to know it. "
56,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38065453-luna,5,"So many interesting storys about math in one book! I'm a physics student and consider myself very into math but I knew maybe a fifth of all the stuff mentioned in this wonderful book. It's also entertaining and fairly easy to read, the ""heavier"" things are in the appendix as opposed to the text.The only thing I didn't like were all the (imo) unnecessary descriptions of the people the author was meeting but I guess that stems from his journalist days.Fully recommend this to anyone interested in maths & science."
57,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88412591-patrick,5,"This book was recommended by YouTube personality and PhD physicist Simon Clark for anyone who was interested in studying physics, however I would take it a step farther and suggest that anyone who would like to improve their understanding of mathematics absoutely must read this! Alex Bellos takes you through a concise history of maths in a way that is both highly entertaining and extremely instructive. It definitely improved my conceptual understanding of mathematics and sparked an interest in it's history that I never knew existed."
58,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5717592-martin,3,"Bellos' follow-up is the superior, and more fun, product, but this first foray is nonetheless excellent. However, with the follow-up, nearly everything was wonderfully curated, whereas in this first dive in to the pool, you have to look for the ""oitzres"" (yiddish for ""treasures""), and there certainly are plenty. The book definitely picks up steam as it goes along, as it marches towards infinity. Perhaps this was a learning process for the author himself, about what might be interesting, and what might not."
59,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16392456-janani,4,"A history of mathematics jam packed with interesting tidbits from history and Bellos' own anecdotes of meeting current mathematicians. The math was easy to follow. Although I had learnt a lot of it in school and college, it was more from the perspective of how to solve sums, and Bellos focused on why things are done as they are. I also liked the interplay of maths with other fields of study. A fun read, with interesting bits that will show up in my next quiz."
60,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56383613-anna,5,"I really recommend this book, especially if you’re considering reading mathematics at university! I am currently in Year 12 and read this book as wider reading because I would like to read mathematics at university. It is so detailed and interesting! This book has given me a solid background knowledge about the history of mathematics, which will be useful for my university applications. I also highly recommend this book if you’re just generally interested in mathematics!"
61,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5514516-genetic-cuckoo,4,"This book was fascinating, but I would say it’s not designed for a very general reader, as it does rely on some understanding of mathematic principles. Some concepts left me confused, and I didn’t really understand the finger multiplication section, but it was fascinating. This is a wonderful book likely to spark the reader’s curiosity, and really brings mathematics alive. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in mathematics, statistics, or anyone in the STEM field. "
62,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68610628-anotherfungurl,2,"I expected much more than this book. I guess I had very high expectations. I read in reviews that people who had no interest in math did start to get the 'world of math'. For me, personally, even though I love math, the book was very uninteresting for me. The first chapter about Munduruku was very interesting, however.I guess educational books are not for me, I get very distracted easily. I should stick to fantasy."
63,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30866944-almustafa-couch,4,"An excellent Tome which provided a good introduction to the intricacies of mathematics. The development of number theory including the discovery of various numbers such as zero, it also contained various divergent parts such as ""The Gamblers Fallacy"". There were parts of the book which weren't worded clearly enough for immediate comprehension but they did give some direction as to where to go next."
64,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88697556-alisa,3,"Can be dry and boring, especially if the particular chapter is uninteresting to you. It also comes across as almost a math history lesson while attempting to actually describe the mathematical concepts in detail which makes some parts really hard to go through. Despite that I thoroughly enjoyed some chapters and would recommend to anyone interested in mathematics. If that's not you I don't know how much you're going to enjoy this book. "
65,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111683367-jaede,4,"I bought this book in the airport when I was flying to France. I put it down as soon as the plane landed and didn’t pick it up again until Lockdown happened. As a maths novice I really enjoyed this book, I’m about to start a maths degree and thought this book was a great gateway to understanding maths as a whole. Some bits were less exciting than other parts such as the last chapter but overall it was a great read and I would recommend to anyone interested in maths or numbers. "
66,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80086150-cameron-williams,5,"A very enjoyable read. Bellos’ style is accessible though does not touch on the most complex of content. That said, even though I have studied some mathematics at a tertiary level, this book’s clear writing was able to add to my basic understanding of some concepts, and give novel ways of explaining others. Highly recommended for anyone interested in mathematics, particularly for those looking for an easy-to-read primer on the history of Mathematics."
67,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105209140-olaf-humann,5,"I really can't recommend it enough. The tone is just perfect, with delightful mathematical anectodes that sometimes simply blow your mind. If you have at least a slight interest for math, and a little bit of perseverence while reading it, you will absolutely love it. If you are worried if it is a very hard read or not: Personnaly, I'm 16 years old, not particularly gifted at maths and I had no problems reading it, even though it took like three weeks. EXCELLENT BOOK. "
68,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18664809-jenny-trick,3,"I didn’t find this book as interesting as I thought I which was a little disappointing but there were some parts that I really liked. It was mostly just an introduction to a lot of ideas though so I found myself looking up the things I was actually interested in to get more info. There was also a lot in this book that I didn’t understand, even after reading it a couple times over. Overall I enjoyed it though and it was definitely worth the read."
69,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35915235-elisabeth,4,"I really liked this book. It covered all the aspects of math, at least as far as i could see. I especially enjoyed the chapters about math's origin, the golden ratio, and probability. I got kind of lost or maybe I zoned out while reading about algebra and infinity. But anyway, it was a great book and I recommend it to readers of all ages that have finished elementary school. "
70,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18940910-james-miller,4,"Borrowed from the school maths library, this was jolly good fun. Bellos is a good communicator of ideas and I liked the fact he puts more detailed maths in appendices rather than either overloading the prose or omitting altogether. Some chapters were better than others, but if you like books in this genre (Simon Singh, du Sautoy, etc.) this one is worth a read."
71,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58887116-heckpoint,4,"a playful romp through a variety of mathematical topics. no equations involved.it covers a lot of the usual topics for pop-sci math books. but since Alex Bellos weaves in lots of anecdotes and interviews related to the topics at hand, is a witty narrator, and features more sociology than usual, he keeps it entertaining."
72,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45356256-jhst-kmil,4,"A very good book, that I will re-read. I must confess that I skimmed some hard-to-grasp concepts in the book, but the author did a good job of pairing mathematical concepts with their histories, which made them easier to understand in an intuitive manner, much like the concepts in a physics or chemistry book."
73,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89038902-matthew-warren,4,"Thought provoking, and nicely flowing. It is a read that makes you want to pick up another maths books and read further, perhaps into the ideas of card counting and probability, or even languages. The vast spectrum that this book manages to cover is a good baseline I think, and has made me want to read on "
74,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8509871-liz,4,"A light romp through the history of mathematics. I especially enjoyed the beginning, about how different the human perception of numbers can be and has been, across cultures and time. All the etymological tidbits were icing on the cake. Not as mind-blowing as, say, Gödel Escher Bach, but also not as dense or irritating. Just a fan of math demonstrating how fun math can be."
75,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4645818-richard,3,Fun and easy to follow but occasionally swerves into the confusing and alienating. I was pretty much ok with it but the helpful proofs at the end of the book were bewildering to my non maths mind and took away the pleasure of the chapters. I think this is the definition of a mixed bag. Some bright light moments and some drawn out pages of nothing

From the invention of numbers by the early man, to using probability to make money from a casino. This is a wonderful books. Though some parts of the book, are a little bit boring, and book comes more and more interesting when the real life applications and the use of mathematics is introduced. I would definitely recommend this book!!"

80,1416588256,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"[3.5]I may get around to writing a review later. For now, I'll just single out the sweeping statement on page 305 that I can't make my mind up about ""It could be argued that the invention of probability was the root cause of the decline, over the last few centuries, of religion."""
