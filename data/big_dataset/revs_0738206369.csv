0,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399189-weinz,4,"To my dearest R.P. Feynman:Our love affair (read: my infatuation with you) started blooming years ago when I happened upon your lectures. Your wit, charm and intelligence was the triple combination that wooed me into bewilderment. For years I devoured anything I could find about you. I swooned over tales of your bongo skills. Your grace and humility when accepting the Nobel made my heart flutter. So when I came across your letters nothing could keep me from them. It has been a rare joy the past week to be deep inside your writing filled with humor, intellect and your unique charisma. When faced with the nutzos that come with fame you handled them in a way that left them dazzled and slowly putting the pitchforks away. What can I say? I'm a sucker for a man with brains who makes me laugh. Very Truly Yours,A very smitten Michelle "
1,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,4,"A collection of letters by Richard Feynman, ranging from private things to his loved ones to tips and answers to fans and students from all over the world. The part with his letters to his wife is extremely beautiful, and there is in particular one I'd like to share. Arline Feynman, the love of Richard's life, died of tuberculosis on the 11th of June 1945. Roughly one year and a half later Richard wrote a letter to her, and sealed it. It was opened after his death in 1988. Here it is: October 17, 1946D’Arline,I adore you, sweetheart. I know how much you like to hear that — but I don't only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you. It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you'll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing. But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can't I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the ""idea-woman"" and general instigator of all our wild adventures.When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don't want to be in my way. I'll bet you are surprised that I don't even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can't help it, darling, nor can I — I don't understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don't want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.My darling wife, I do adore you. I love my wife. My wife is dead.Rich.PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don't know your new address. "
2,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,4,"This is my favorite of all the various Feynman books, because it's not cluttered up with Feynman playing the lovable, picaresque, eccentric. Instead of the slightly buffoonish public persona (or ""curious character"") he (or his publishers) seemed to feel compelled to present in his various autobiographical writings, the letters speak for themselves. And, to my mind, the picture they paint is ultimately far more flattering than that which he himself tried to present. Sure, there are lapses - he is not always charitable towards colleagues, he is sometimes impatient, and there is that characteristic unwillingness to suffer fools gladly. But the traits that shine through again and again in these letters, so much so that one has to think of them as his defining characteristics are generosity and graciousness. Over and over he takes the time to respond to strangers, who have written him out of the blue, with letters that are astonishing, both for their empathy as well as for the obvious care that he spent in writing them. He may have preferred to be considered a rebel, a free-thinker, a bit of a rogue. And he certainly relished the opportunity to twit the imagination-free defenders of the status quo. But these letters establish, beyond doubt, that at heart Feynman was a true mensch. "
3,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90798-christina,4,"Yeah, sometimes Feynman's a cocky jerk, but aren't we all? These letters are just so darn lovely and human. For as many (often justified) snotty replies he gives, there are just as many instances of unexpectedness tenderness and support for people in the same quest to figure things out.About a comment he made in the early '60s about the minds of women, he received loads of letters calling him sexist, an idiot, etc. When, in the more enlightened times of 1987, he was asked permission to reprint this article, Feynman touched on the issue with wry humor:""Dear Professor Jodl:You have my permission to translate and publish the article in your journal. But the world has changed--and I made a remark about 'a girl instructing another one how to knit argyle socks.' Could you add a footnote, by the author (me) to that paragraph: 'How wonderfully the world has changed. Today conversations among women on analytic geometry are commonplace.'Sincerely,Richard P. Feynman"""
4,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76679-kristin,5,"Know those cheesy movie reviews that say ""I laughed, I cried"" and make you think that the reviewer never bothered to even watch the film? Yeah? Well, I actually did read this book. And it really did make me laugh. And it really did make me cry. And it really did teach me some physics and a few life lessons as well. The book covers about 50 years of Feynman's life from grad school through death via letters to and from him. It's a wonderful, compelling read and one that I'd recommend over and over and over again. And one that I know I'll eventually read over and over and over again. "
5,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105482-ari,5,"As the subtitle indicates, this is an anthology of Feynman's letters. This is one of the relatively few books that I have read based on a published review -- in this case, Freeman Dyson's review, anthologized in ""Scientist as Rebel.""I started browsing in these a few nights ago, on the theory of ""I'd just read a few"". A few hours later, I realized three things. First, I was utterly absorbed. Second, Feynman had a wonderfully clever and crisp prose style. Third, he was impressively thoughtful, sensitive, and wise in his dealings with others. My only caveat about the book is that the context on both physics and biography is limited -- you will get much more out of the book if you have browsed in ""Surely You're Joking..."" or at least read the Wikipedia page about Feynman.Many of the letters are highly quotable, but here is my favorite. A former student had written to Feynman, and had commented that he wasn't doing anything important or notable. Feynman responded with a long and thoughtful letter. Here are two paragraphs that struck me very forcefully.""Unfortunately, your letter made me unhappy for you seem to be a truly sad. It seems the influence of your teacher has been to give you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems. The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and we see some way for us to make a little headway into it. I would advise you to take even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you can really solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasure of success, and of helping your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a question in the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take away from yourself these pleasures because you have some erroneous idea of what is worthwhile.""""You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself -- it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of the naive ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teachers's ideals are."""
6,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655723-nick-black,5,"Very likely the finest book to emerge from the Feynman crap-publishing machine from which a public can't seem to buy enough (only  QED The Strange Theory of Light could compare, and that's kind of a apples-and-oranges or, if you'll allow, baryons-and-leptons deal). An incredibly well-edited selection of great intimacy and scope, giving a much more insightful and indeed sympathetic look into the great man than his self-serving, posturing autobiographical releases."
7,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,3,"I think that this collection of letters has a lower ratio of interesting or funny stories to pages, than other Feynman memoirs or biographies. It also has significantly less science (very little, actually). I would recommend reading some of those first. What we do learn from the letters, however, is a humanizing portrait of Feynman, beyond his brash public persona and genius science. There are some great moments documented here. I also couldn't help but be impressed by Feynman's generosity, after winning the Nobel, in writing thoughtful letters back to complete strangers, sometimes even crackpots. > He realized soon after that he was falling in love with her and that he wanted to propose.Then he faulted himself for being too impulsive. He proceeded to mark a day on the calendar a few months ahead and thought, ""If I still feel the same way then, I'll ask her."" The night before that day arrived, he could not stand the wait and kept her up until midnight. They were married a few months later.> My academic life has its usual characteristic of being ""not write home-able."" However, last week things were going fast and neat as all heck, but now I'm hitting some mathematical difficulties which I will either surmount, walk around, or go a different way—all of which consumes all my time—but I like to do very much and am very happy indeed. I have never thought so much so steadily about one problem—so if I get nowhere I really will be very disturbed—However, I have already gotten somewhere, quite far—and to Prof. Wheeler's satisfaction. However, the problem is not at completion although I'm just beginning to see how far it is to the end and how we might get there (although aforementioned mathematical difficulties loom ahead)—SOME FUN!> ""You cannot develop a personality with physics alone, the rest of life must be worked in.""> I am anxious for the responsibilities and uncertainties of taking care of the girl I love. I have, however, other desires and aims in the world. One of them is to contribute as much as to physics as I can.This is, in my mind, of even more importance than my love for Arline. It is therefore especially fortunate that, as I can see (guess) my getting married will interfere very slightly, if at all with my main job in life.> Dearest Putzie: Lots of things happened today. First, I found out about the boxes. The x±<= people up here didn't send them out from there yet.> I am writing this Tuesday Morning. I love you Tuesday Morning. But that is just a symptom of a far more extensive ailment. I love you always. … The key to my interest in all this is probably because I like puzzles so much. Each lock is just like a puzzle you have to open without forcing it. But combination locks have me buffaloed. You do too, sometimes, but eventually I figure out you. I love you, too. … This time will pass—you will get better.You don't believe it, but I do. So I will bide my time and yell at you later—now I am your lover, devoted to serving you in your hardest moments. I am your husband, call on me for help—or tell me to go—as you prefer. I will understand everything. I want to comfort you.> The food was good and so was the company. As usual I was the only one without a coat or tie. I'm getting good at that. Now I can't go to anybody's house with a coat because everybody will be insulted to whose house I go without a coat.> We finally got into the buses and started home. We asked one of the bus drivers on the way what his impression of the [nuclear] explosion was.""Well, I don't know—you see I never had an opportunity to see one of these things go off before.""> The real entertainment gimmick is the excitement, drama and mystery of the subject matter. People love to learn something, they are ""entertained"" enormously by being allowed to understand a little bit of something they never understood before. One must have faith in the subject and in people's interest in it. Otherwise just use a Western to sell telephones!> There is a great deal of ""activity in the field"" these days—but this ""activity"" is mainly in showing that the previous ""activity"" of somebody else resulted in an error or in nothing useful or in something promising, etc.—like a lot of worms trying to get out of a bottle by crawling all over each other. It is not that the subject is hard—it is just that the good men are occupied elsewhere. Remind me not to come to anymore gravity conferences.> I like Hans so very much that I feel I ""ought"" to do what you want—but who invented this infernal idea of writing an article for a guy when he gets to be 60? Isn't there an easier way to show friendship and regard? I feel like I feel on ""Mother's Day.""> Congratulations on Nobel award. Delighted to see that good textbook writing finally is being recognized. Donald Jones Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.> Dear Mr. Jones, et al: Thank you for your telegram of congratulations. I was quite unaware of your enormous influence with the Nobel Committee and shall never underestimate the power of a publishing company. Thanks to all of you who conceived and carried out this ingenious publicity maneuver. Sincerely yours, Richard P. Feynman> You write that true Americans have a big and generous heart, which shows only what a big and generous heart you have. For you must know that a great nation, at least one where the British ideas of freedom flourish, is very complex and side by side lie the great and the mean, the generous and the selfish, just as they lie side by side in each man. To see generosity you must be generous enough not to see the meanness, and to see just meanness in a man you must be mean enough not to see the generosity.> Do not be too mad at Mike for his C in physics. I got a C in English Literature. Maybe I never would have received a prize in physics if I had been better in English.> Thank you very much for your letter of congratulations. Some measure fame by just a Nobel Prize but I have had a cat named after me! Thank you for such a distinguished and subtle honor.> Unfortunately your letter made me unhappy for you seem to be truly sad. It seems that the influence of your teacher has been to give you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems.The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and we see some way for us to make a little headway into it. … No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it. You say you are a nameless man.You are not to your wife and to your child.You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office.You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself—it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of the naïve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher's ideals are.> [to Watson, on his memoir, ""The Double Helix""] And the entire ‘novel' has a master plot and a deep unanswered human question at the end: Is the sudden transformation of all the relevant scientific characters from petty people to great and selfless men because they see together a beautiful corner of nature unveiled and forget themselves in the presence of the wonder? Or is it because our writer suddenly sees all his characters in a new and generous light because he has achieved success and confidence in his work, and himself? Don't try to resolve it. Leave it that way.> Dear Kac, I'm sorry, but I don't want to go anywhere to give lectures. I like it here and I want to work in peace and quiet—preparing, going, lecturing, and returning is too much of a disturbance to my tranquil life. Thanks for the invitation, though. Yours, Richard P. Feynman> Mr. Auden's poem only confirms his lack of response to Nature's wonders for he himself says that he would like to know more clearly what we ""want the knowledge for.""We want it so we can love Nature more.Would you not turn a beautiful flower around in your hand to see it from other directions as well? … the emotions of awe, wonder, delight and love which are evoked upon learning Nature's ways in the animate and inanimate world, together (for they are one) is rarely expressed in modern poetry where the aspect of Nature being appreciated is one which could have been known to men in the Renaissance. … My lament was that a kind of intense beauty that I see given to me by science, is seen by so few others; by few poets and therefore, by even fewer more ordinary people> Dear Ilene: I am now unique—a physicist with a fan who has fallen in love with him from seeing him on TV. Thank you, oh fan! Now I have everything anyone could desire. I need no longer be jealous of movie stars. Your fan-nee, (or whatever you call it—the whole business is new to me). Richard P. Feynman> It seems to me that we should keep the conference as small as possible and have only guys that are really working actively in the subject attend. On item 1, what the hell is Feynman invited for? He is not up to the other guys and is doing nothing as far as I know. If you clean up the invitation list, to just the hard-core workers, I might begin to think about attending. Sincerely, Richard P. Feynman Professor Coleman wrote back to say that Feynman was off the list and urged him to come. Feynman attended the conference.> My schedule is such lately that I must refuse to get bogged down reading someone else's theory; it may turn out to be wonderful and there I'd be with something else to think about.> P.S. IF YOU CAN'T READ THE ABOVE HANDWRITING, HAVE NO FEAR—IT IS UNIMPORTANT RAMBLINGS. I AM WELL AND IN ATHENS.> Naturally I could never understand why the girls I went out with in Ithaca wouldn't go out with me again. At last I find out—it was my brown leather jacket! So often, was I thus frustrated by pretty girls (like you) that I came out to California. Since the weather was so much better I threw away my leather jacket and at last found someone who would go out with me more than once—so I married her. I always thought that the girls in California were more tolerant—but now I know the inner workings of the phenomenon. Physics is much easier to understand.> You said, ""I was asked to assist in the creation of the world's most destructive machine but I was never asked how to use it. Now I realize what I have done and what that machine could do, and I am afraid.""> [to Wolfram] You don't understand ""ordinary people."" To you they are ""stupid fools""—so you will not tolerate them or treat their foibles with tolerance or patience—but will drive yourself wild (or they will drive you wild) trying to deal with them in an effective way. Find a way to do your research with as little contact with non-technical people as possible, with one exception, fall madly in love! That is my advice, my friend.> See you soon, Commissioner Feynman, Nobel Prize, Einstein Award, Oersted Medal and utter ignoramus about politics> All three have received the Prize as the result of simultaneous, independent theoretical work conducted during 1947-1949 in quantum electrodynamics. Though the results of the three were later shown to be equivalent, Feynman introduced the pioneering ""Feynman diagram,"" a powerful tool greatly simplifying quantum-dynamical calculations. As Feynman himself explained: ""It was the purpose of making these simplified methods of calculating more available that I published my paper in 1949, for I still didn't think I had solved any real problems, except to make more efficient calculations. But it does turn out that if the efficiency is increased enough, it itself is practically a discovery. It was a lot faster way of doing the old thing.""> ""Dick is always calling up to see whether Murray is working,"" says Mrs. Margaret Gell-Mann, an attractive blond from Birmingham, England. ""If I say he's in the garden, Dick is happy for the rest of the day. But if I tell him Murray is doing physics, then Dick gets nervous and immediately wants to come over."""
8,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13680195-arjun,4,"Very good, and likely the best I've read of/by/on Feynman. I've always felt that the Feynman depicted in Surely You're Joking and Gleick's Genius felt pained – maybe a bit largely than life, if you will. While it's perfectly understandable, the picture of a fun-loving, quirky, womanizing physicist always felt overly romanticized. Reading his unadulterated communication felt voyeuristic, but my model of Feyman evolved and felt altogether more humanistic. An absolutely brilliant physicist and a gem of a human, though he has his moments of anger, misunderstanding, and even in some cases, pettiness (the overly blithe attitude that's been associated with him always felt a bit off). Admittedly, some of his communication with his first wife made me tear up – I can only hope to feel the same level of connection with someone. While 50% or so of his letters felt trivial, the few letters I'm going to be re-reading for years made this worth the slog. Highly recommended for Feynman enthusiasts."
9,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4740685-salsaaram,5,"I listened to this on cd. Professor Feynman had a fantastic sense of himself and his strengths, and weaknesses, and it is interesting to hear how he lived his life through his own words. The letters that he wrote, and were wrote to him, are well narrated and given a real life to them. It shows a man who knew exactly who he was and what honor, truth, and scientific research means without becoming egocentric or self-involved. Truly a fantastic audiobook and person. "
10,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5165613-lorena,3,"Feynman has become a cult figure for some, though I saw no evidence to support why this might have happened. The book was so thick, and he seemed so ordinary, I couldn't wrap my mind around the attraction. "
11,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"I am addicted to Feynman. Everything about him, everything he writes, anything about his life its a total addiction! Can't get enough. Surely your Joking Mr. Feynman was still the best though. "
12,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321805-sarah-kelleher,5,"What a cool dude. I happened upon this book on my dad's shelf and it gave me giggles and chuckles, And it made me cry big dripping tears that landed in fat globs on the page. Feynman was awesome."
13,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3321431-kadri,5,Very enjoyable (if reading someone else's letters is appropriate :) )
14,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6564745-james-swenson,3,"As you can tell by the title, Perfectly Reasonable Deviations... is a collection of letters written by Nobel-Prize-winning physicist Richard P. Feynman. To me, it was intriguing, and there are letters here that would appeal to anyone, but I think you'd have to be (like me) a Feynman fan already, anxious to know everything about the man, to enjoy reading the book from cover to cover.Anyone considering reading this book should first read Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character. After they enjoy that, they should try What Do You Care What Other People Think? Further Adventures of a Curious Character. If they also like that, then they might try Perfectly Reasonable Deviations.... Among titles not written by Feynman, I enjoyed the biography Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick, and have heard very good things about No Ordinary Genius by Christopher Sykes, which daughter Michelle Feynman recommends in her introduction to Perfectly Reasonable Deviations.... If, after reading those, one still wants more, the letters will be waiting here."
15,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24511135-anshul-thakur,5,"This book is a collection of letters that were written to and by Richard Feynman, a great person, a Nobel laureate in Physics, a great iconoclast, and a beautiful, beautiful man. These letters span his lifetime, from his letters when he first left his parents to study at Princeton and MIT, to his love and wife Arline, and later to Gweneth among the many letters he wrote (and this surprises many that he did, and did so much).His willingness and excitement to communicate the most complex of problems in the simplest of analogies is evident when he responds to small students, and awkward fan mails from the orient. A person is not just what is described by the press, or by his autobiographies, or by his friends and family, no, the world is much bigger than that! We meet far more people than that and we touch many lives, in some way. What these people think of us, and how we touched them is a much larger picture. This book, is an example of how he fared and to me, he was phenomenal. And that is not it, he still continues to inspire people, like he inspires me. Ironically, he also authored ‘What do you care what other people think?’ but there is no conflict...How does one review someone’s life, or letters that were meant for individuals, without a purpose of being published one day, perhaps, as a compendium mirror of your image? Does one write a letter to be critiqued by posterity on what he told an individual about? I think it would be none of our business, except to enjoy them while we can, if we can, and have opinions...This isn't the complete review, but I sure am on to one long discussion about Richard Feynman.

16,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914674-isis,4,"Well-organized and edited collection of letters, some to, most from Richard P. Feynman. Some of them are fascinating, some a bit dull, although which letters fall into which category probably depends on the reader. I most enjoyed the letters to his mother while in college; the congratulatory letters, and his responses, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize; his sharp responses to requests that he viewed as requiring him to violate his strongly-held principles (for example, asking him to attend a conference in the USSR, or to receive an honorary degree), and his thoughtful responses to questions posed by serious students and crackpots alike. The section I liked least was the exchange of letters between Feynman and his (ill) wife during his Los Alamos years, which was just a little too personal for comfort. Some things should remain a couple's private domain. I did, however, love his description of witnessing the first atomic test.The audio version was well done, with a male reader for Feynman's letters, and a female reader for letters to Feynman, as well as for the explanatory notes before some of the letters, as the editorial voice of Feynman's daughter Michelle, who put together the book. But I think the text rather than audio version might be better for dipping in a little here, a little there rather than just gulping them all down at once (as I did, with a couple of weeks' break in the middle). "
17,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,4,"I've read very few books of letters, biographies, and autobiographies, so I'm very much in the early stages of calibrating my scales. This is a good book. Not every letter is scintillating or contains a gleaming gem. A minor few seem to be included only for completeness. I would have lost only a little, in one sense, by reading a booklet of the best ten or so. However, there are certainly gems to be found, some of them very fine, others more like nice shells you find on a beach and then hang onto for a few paces before setting them back down. Some of the letters are incredibly moving, to the point that I wasn't sure I ought to be reading them, others are more straightforwardly touching, and most are at least a little amusing. So what you do gain from reading the extra 400 pages or so you are given here relative to that hypothetical best-of booklet, if not a wealth of extra wisdom or zany genius, is a gradually growing sense of warmth towards a man with a plain love for family, ""Nature"", teaching, and the joy of discovery, as well as a generosity of spirit that shines through. And if you're anything like me, you get fair bit of inspiration along the same lines.I'd only read one book by or about Feynman previously, and I'm not sure whether DYHTTT was the best book to read to learn more about the man, or even whether that's what I wanted from it. But I would recommend it, at least to people who could do with being taught a thing or two."
18,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,3,"This collection of letters has brought me to tears in two separate instances. Once out of sadness, and once out of joy.The first instance was early in the book, when we are given insight into Richard Feynman's relationship with his first wife, Arlene, who for the adult part of their relationship was suffering from an, ultimately, fatal case of Tuberculosis. The letters to his wife were extremely touching, and outlined the great tragedy of it all.The second instance was while I read the last pair of letters. A concerned father asks for advice on how to encourage his son's love for physics, as he was not doing very well. I will not defile's Feynman's response by trying to summarize it, for I can do it no justice. I will only remark on the fact that it gave me a great sense that there can be goodness, and compassion in this world."
19,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28353007-priyanka--,5,"There is so much love,modesty,grace,intellect,humour,optimism,clarity of thoughts in Feynman's letters that you can simply admire and appreciate each of them.Some of them overwhelmed me and some of them kept me in awe.How wonderfully he would break difficult problems into small and comprehendible questions and answers.Feynman never failed to call himself a fool when he found out his mistake.The quest in him to find answers about the world about where we have come from is simply brilliant and praiseworthy.It is unlikely you might not fall for him!A must read for everyone."

25,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92020622-bishop-adler,4,"Didn't want to read this at first because I assumed reading someone else's letters was kind of creepy, but I got the audio book for free and figured that the man has been dead for long enough to not matter. Anyways, this book is sort of like a companion to his autobiographical Surely You're Joking and What Do You Care, as it presents the same events from a closer perspective. Like the autobiographies it was a mix of really intriguing, funny, and the occasional sad story, however the Arlene letter in this one probably gives it the title of ""most sad"". Also the part where someone from Feynman's old frat writes him a letter and mentions how one time Feynman wanted to watch him and his girlfriend make out - it was kind of funny but underscored how much Feynman missed Arlene since he was in university.I'm sure one day there's going to be another Feynman bio pic/musical/piece of popular media and all of these books will become relevant again. They'll probably have to release an edited version of Surely You're Joking too, because one of the chapters is quite controversial. Anyways, great book, although this is where I draw the line on how much information I will consume about Feynman's personal life. I swear I won't read a biography."

Over time, I recovered sufficiently to read other economics books by other Nobel awardees. All these were readable enough...researched, written, rewritten, edited, etc. to prepare them for public consumption. This collection of Richard Feynman's letters was my first foray into ""real"" science. (opened only because it was in my book club's batting order this year) My only knowledge of Feynman owed to watching the occasional episode of The Big Bang Theory.What an experience! With no editorial intervention between me and Feynman, it was an amazing read. His letters to his first, written while he worked at Los Almos and she was dying of cancer are incredible. His replies to the numerous letters of congratulations he received following his Nobel Prize reveal he ability to communicate with a remarkable range of people: President Johnson, a multitude of fellow scientists, and high school classmates.A remarkable smorgasbord....sample it by all means!"

The letters are a pretty good way of seeing his character without filers: very independent, diligent, earnest, with unbending rectitude and a hatred of pretentiousness."

The book is not written by Richard2.) It is a collection of Richard's mails curated and narrated by her daughter. You can read his correspondence with his mom, wives, colleagues, and strangers.Nor the mails nor the narration were particularly interesting to me. In fact, I felt like a voyeour, or some tabloid reader. I did not find the aspects I liked in previous books."

What made Feynman different was he wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo and ask 'Why?' and even more importantly 'Why not?'Nobel prize-winning physicist, loving husband, father, enthusiastic bongo player, and may I add devilish trickster with a wicked sense of humour; this book containing selected letters from the man himself is a must read for any Feynman fan.Happy Reading.C"

41,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/183639-irwan,4,"I was really fascinated by physics in high school. I saw it as a heroic human endeavor: such a romantic view of it. It certainly was inspired by big names like Einstein, etc, households names people associated with geniuses, groundbreaking and revolutionary theories and so on. Who doesn't want to associate with such grandeur?I knew Feynman a little later when I frequently visited the library in the Physics department in the University in Oslo in which I was majoring Informatics. I still wanted to escape to the romantic world of physics amidst my own occupation with the world of information technology. It does provide interesting problem solving challenges, but unfortunately not as romantic as physics :-) I guess this is just a neighbor's-garden-is-always-greener kind of thing.This book portrays Feynman as a person in his own words and others in a series of letters to and from him. The quality that attracts me most is his curiosity. Secondly is his sense of humor: not taking things or himself too seriously. Most of the letters are full of praises for him and he responded to it in a way that was not arrogant but not hypocritically humble either. I enjoy more his responds to less complimentary, sometimes critical, letters. He is a genius who doesn't hesitate to admit his mistakes, or simply to say ""I don't know"". "
42,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3540997-derek-woodgate,4,"Decided to reread this book after some ten years after a very engaging conversation with my girl-friend about quantum physics and consciousness. I chose this book over others of his from my library simply because it gives such an amazing insight to the depth and breadth of his scope of interests, his intrigue with life itself, his remarkable energy and ability to explore and connects so many disconnects. As a futurist, Feynman is a must read. My esteemed colleague Jim Dator would probably feel that Feynman met a large number of the qualifications/characteristics Jim deems essential to the futurist's make-up. This book travels through his correspondence with fellow scientists, friends, fans, family, students, etc. on a plethora of topics such as causality, time travel, the state of science education, Soviet politics of the day, his Nobel prize, complexity and chaos and so much more. His enthusiasm for discovery and life itself have always been an inspiration. Not so much a hero, but a directional influence. Very interesting read."
43,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349719-mender,2,"It was ok. It's a collection of Feynman's letters, which means exactly what it says - his correspondence with various people across his life. I'm not sure what I was looking for, but my feelings were really encapsulated in one of Feynman's own interviews, transcript in the appendix. He said that there were three types of people who asked him questions about his work; those who wanted to know what was in it for them (the new big development, would it make their cars faster etc). Those who wanted to know what he was up to because they were really fascinated by nature itself, and wanted to know how the stars were made. He loved talking to them. And a third kind, that wanted to know about him because they wanted to know more about him. Sort of a cult of personality. And he really didn't like those sort of people as much.This book is targeted at those people, because that's the only group that it can really be a hit for. I'd have said I was in that category - I've loved others of his works and am reading books about him because it's him. But it really didn't hit for me, because it missed his love of nature, and the inspiration I get from looking at the world through his eyes."
44,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/402848-maria-menozzi,5,"I have been a fan of Feynman for some years now. I began with the Feynman essays in the collections then bought the lectures which I'm still getting through after several years. So I bought this heavy tome when it arrived a couple years ago and finally got a chance to delve into it this past month. It is really a thorough, well-drawn compilation of Feynman's life in letters and a reminder of what we have lost with our social media age. Letter writing is a lost art and I can't imagine an email compilation being that fascinating except for fans of Paris Hilton. I digress, but this book worked on a few levels for me, historically, personally, and scientifically. This is a life well-lived and a testament to the values of family, humility, service and education, and the importance of living to our potential and being given the nurturing and opportunities to develop that potential. Feynman's authentic humility coupled with his integrity shows how important these qualities are to being able to balance out and respond to both the pleasures and difficulties that excellence brings. It is funny, heartwarming, heartbreaking and satisfying. "
45,0738206369,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29337213-annie-su,3,"Ahh I am slowly working my way through all the info I can get on Richard Feynman! This book was a lovely collection of letters and correspondence between Feynman and friends, loved ones, professionals, random fans, and other people throughout his life. I will admit some stretches of letters were dry, especially since each letter involves a context switch. But in its totality, the book portrays a lovely image of Feynman as a humorous, humble, and endlessly curious person. I was particularly moved by a letter Feynman wrote in 1986 to a worried father soliciting parenting and life advice. Feynman said,""Even in my crazy book I didn't emphasize—but it is true—that I worked as hard as I could at drawing, at deciphering Mayan, at drumming, at cracking safes, etc. The real fun of life is this perpetual testing to realize how far out you can go with any potentialities...when you get older you find nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.""Furthermore, I love that Feynman approaches problems with this childish novelty of trying to find a new solution every time to the same problem. This is how I want to approach life! "

The letters to/from his first wife were poignant and painful to read.I enjoyed Feynman's attitudes toward science: the ultimate 'truth' of which lies in experimentation, and life: find something you love doing, and do what you love.I find myself wondering about our future. No one writes letters like this anymore. There won't be books like this in our future.Some comments throughout - a letter from a guy comments that he didn't think much of how Feyman spoke on a TV program. Feynman replied that he was probably right, but that he always found it more important to speak clearly than to use big words.Writing about the Challenger accident and the NASA investigation, he noted that it was 'happening again,' that fear of 'bad news' was causing problems and poor communication: '...I hear the same thing is happening again—complex questions being hidden in innocuous little ""bullets.""

Yeah? Well, I actually did read this book. In fact my husband and I both read the book. As I started it, the title was so LONG and different I asked him if he has ever taken this guy in college, and he said that he has some of his books. I'm going to ask to look at them. And it really did make me laugh. And it really did make me cry. And it really did teach me some physics and a few life lessons as well. The book covers about 50 years of Feynman's life from grad school through death via letters to and from him. It's a wonderful, compelling read and one that I'd recommend over and over and over again. It's all letters to him from him to someone else. That is becoming one of my favorite genres. Delightful language and again, me reading this. I loved it. Recommend!!!"

This book is completely made up of a bunch of correspondance between Feynman and others from the time he was a student until the time of his death. Getting an autobiographical portrait of Feynman strictly through letters is pretty interesting. Richard Feynman had many admirable qualities. Among other things he was super brilliant and he loved learning, he was confident but humble, he really cared about teaching and inspiring people to learn and persevere, and he was very gracious and respectful to his harshest critics. He was also a pretty fun guy."

The Manhattan Project-era letters are understandably sparse in their scientific content (thanks to wartime censors) and focus mainly on his terminally ill first wife. These letters suggest how Feynman masked his pain with his jokester image. (He makes no mention of his brief, unsuccessful second marriage.) The letters are mostly non-technical and are readily accessible to anyone with even a passing interest in physics, although casual readers might find them occasionally obscure.

Feynman's was a letter writer who kept everything. Here are his observations on the Nobel awards and his patient replies to the entreaties of ordinary people who make inquiry of him on a variety of issues. Here is his correspondence with government agencies as he tries to decide about attending a Russian sponsored symposium he has been invited to attend during the height of the ""Cold War"".

Love the format of this as it chronologically goes through letter sent and received by Feynman himself. Each letter had something insightful that said something about the physicist, humorist, and family man that Feynman was. The letters to and from his first wife were very emotional and heartfelt. As things progressed there were wonderful letters regarding the atomic bomb, evaluating science textbooks, and his late work evaluating the Challenger disaster. It's a must read for any Feynman fan or anyone who enjoys the unique format of creating a chronological story with personal letters woven in."

He refused to accept honorary degrees, because he thought they devalued the degrees one had to work for. He played a big role in determining the technical cause of the '86 Space Shuttle accident. As a young man, during WWII, he was part of the Manhattan Project in New Mexico. He was considered a great teacher. All this is well known. What I liked was reading his own written words. The book could have been shorter by a quarter, however, due to the presence of letters that really did not further understanding of the man. No matter, I enjoyed it."

Some letters are very moving, esp. the last letter to his first wife Arline Greenbaum written two years after her death and a letter responding to a Japanese scientist considering himself a failure because he was not brilliant. Feynman's letters responding to teenagers or parent seeking advice, and the mere fact that he took time to answer these requests for guidance from total strangers, also show some very fine qualities of the man that do not come through in other books by or about him."

During his lifetime he was an excellent correspondent and, clearly, people saved his letters, so that today we are privileged to see the man he was -- intensely curious, generous, fun loving, encouraging to others, loving to his family, and never afraid to appear the fool or to fail."

Charming, surprising and inspiring - we would expect nothing less of Feynman, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that some were also very moving. There are lots of beautiful moments, but the letter that he wrote to his first wife a year and a half after she died is amazing, heartbreaking, hopeful. The only thing that I would have changed about this collection is that it could have benefitted from being edited down a bit further. Some letters were a bit repetitive and I think that overall the book would have been better if it was slightly shorter. It was a lovely touch that it was compiled by Feynman's daughter."

However there were other sections of the book that I found myself simply skipping over as they were of no real interest such as his in depth analysis of school text books or 101 notes of congratulations on winning the Nobel Prize. Overall though a good insight into a unique character."

Richard Feynman is counted among top 3 brains of the 20th century but going through this book you will realise how passionately curious he was. As I neared the 80% completion of book, I felt sad as all good things has to stop someday. The book may evoke a similar kind of feeling among many.The responses are not preaching about his way of thinking but an effort to make the other comfortable. There are very few instances where Feynman provided a rude answer. A must read."
