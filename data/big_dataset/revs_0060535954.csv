0,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"Light on science, heavy on the history of cosmology.It's a nice, short read.There is, however, one horrible mistake.Ferris credits Christian creation mythology with contributing the idea of a beginning to time.There is no historical (or logical) basis for this.The theory that the universe began a finite time in the past was a natural outcome of the distance-correlated redshift of extra-galactic objects.It is irrelevant to the history of scientific progress what beliefs some desert religion happen to hold before the invention of the telescope.Religion can NEVER contribute scientific progress.It can only HINDER science by defaming (Charles Darwin), torturing (Galileo Galilei), and outright killing (Giordano Bruno) scientific thinkers."
1,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1146813-moire,4,"I had always meant to read this book, but somehow I never had gotten around to it. But I decided recently that, while I spend all day thinking about astronomy (as an astronomy grad student), it might be good to get a ""popular science"" take on some of these topics so that I can actually speak intelligibly about astronomy with non-astronomy folks. Despite the fact that some of the later chapters are out-of-date on the astronomy and physics results, this was a very fun read. The first section on historical astronomy was particularly fun; it was very similar to the astronomy class I took in high school that got me into the field in the first place. Ferris does a very nice job of conveying the material more or less accurately, while also making it approachable for the lay audience. The one quibble I would have is that people like Caroline Herschel, Maria Mitchell, Cecilia Payne-Gaposhkin, Henrietta Leavitt, Annie Jump Cannon (got the pattern yet?) didn't get as much attention relative to others as they deserve given their contributions to the field. This was particularly noticeable to me because I had just read a biography of Maria Mitchell and was in the middle of a biography of Cecilia Payne-Gaposhkin. It is one of those amazing things - some of the most important discoveries in 19th and 20th century astronomy in this country were made by women, most of whom couldn't get PhDs, barely got recognition for their work, and were often discouraged from thinking about the science. Maria Mitchell found a comet, and in so doing single-handedly brought much-needed credibility and prestige to the struggling field of American astronomy and the fledgling Harvard University. Henrietta Leavitt basically solved the biggest problem in astronomy - how to measure distances to distant objects - without which Edwin Hubble could not have made his discovery of the expanding universe. Cecilia Payne-Gaposhkin was the first to figure out the puzzle of what stars are truly made of and created what many consider to be the best astronomical thesis ever written."
2,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/663348-tyler,5,"The perfect layman's guide to the universe. It gets pretty hairy as soon as quantum mechanics take the stage about 3/4 in, especially if you have no background in physics whatsoever (as i certainly don't) but i doubt Ferris could have written about the various quantum theories in a simpler way, at least not without cheating the subject of its inherently complex grace. I came away from this reading experience with not only a renewed interest in astronomy (and science in general, really) but also a greater appreciation for the size of the universe and our relative inconsequence in the grand scheme of things. Exciting stuff."
3,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,2,"Ferris provides his reader with an extremely abbreviated version of discovery from Columbus through now. There are some aspects of his stories that are lesser known, which makes them quite enjoyable. The layout of the book is really great as well. Not too many books provide a summary of biology and physics in tandem. Adding to that, Ferris keeps each subject brief so that it packs as much information as possible, while remaining fairly uncomplicated. Considering all the positive aspects of this book, I can see why it received the accolades it did. However, historians must have a hard time reading this book. It's not that Ferris kept the descriptions of Newton and Darwin brief. It is more that his representations of the scientists seem to be under researched. If Ferris is going to portray various scientists in a manner that is far different from how just about every other author, whose life work has been to study the biographies of their chosen scientist, has portrayed these scientists, then he is going to need to provide some proof for his alternate version of their personalities. For example, according to Ferris, Newton was humble, didn't care about fame, and instead cared only about the work. This would describe Darwin but not Newton. When describing Newton's reputation as a ""monster"", Ferris seems to misunderstand why people called him that. His depiction of Darwin was equally naive. Writing books that are short, easy to understand, and not overly complicated are essential in helping scientific information disseminate into the public at large. Anytime writers choose brevity over jargon-laden prose, a book always trades a bit of accuracy for relatability. That is par for the course. So, my critique is not coming from an ideology that believes books should be both brief and extremely accurate. However, they should strive to be as accurate as possible, not just in relating the science itself, but in portraying the scientists' personalities. If an author does not know enough about the life and personality of the scientists, then the author should just leave them out. It's preferable to an inaccurate portrayal. "
4,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,3,"I struggle with the rating on this one. The author is inaccurate and dismissive on questions touching on religion and inaccurate and incomplete on matters of women's contributions to science. The book is frustrating in the earlier historical parts because of this. It gets better in the third part, where he waxes rhapsodic about physics, but he's also not nearly as eloquent as he thinks he is. That said, the parts about the ""stairway to heaven"" describing conditions going back to fractions of a second after the Big Bang and the scale of the universe were pretty good. A decent read but there are much better science books out there that cover similar material."
5,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11207931-emily,4,"Having had no physics or chemistry beyond the eighth grade, some of this was way beyond me, but it's a testament to Ferris' beautiful prose that I was still able to get the basic gist, finish the book, and get a lot out of it. It's not an easy read, but it just kept blowing my mind and making me think. There are so many great thoughts encapsulated here! If you like to be challenged by science, this is the book for you.On a side note, as a musician, who ostensibly makes beauty for a living, who feels called to put it out into the world for the sake of humanity, it was really fascinating to learn that physicists feel very similarly about their work."
6,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/555558-ryan-marquardt,5,"This is the book that made me get an astronomy minor in college. OK, it was only a minor, but still...I appreciate this book more in retrospect as an example of really excellent science writting. Ferris is equally good at crafting interesting narratives about the discovery process and the figures involved as he is about presenting readable, detailed, and accurate descriptions of astronomical concepts. What distinguishes it as excellent writting, for me, is that he doesn't patronize the reader by trying to make concepts too simple, and his writting does not needlessly repeat information presented earlier in the book.Though it is not as detailed as an introductory level astronomy textbook, it presents all the same baisc ideas and in a very readable fashion. I think that reading this book prior to taking astro courses gave me a better understanding of the concepts presented in class.The organization of the book is effective because it follows the development of the science of astronomy. As such, it necessarily builds on earlier concepts and the questions raised by answers to questions asked earlier in time. Overall, this was a great read and a useful text."
7,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24098395-emily-shepley,5,"Fantastic book that covers the relatively short history of cosmology and human discovery that acted to expand the long history of the universe.This book has been on my shelf for a while but, like Carl Sagan's Cosmos, once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. It's easy to read, while still appealing to readers with some background knowledge."
8,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30656264-kededra,4,"This was like a coming-of-age story, except with the journey of the human mind. Light on the science, heavy on the history and pretty decently written. If you have even the slightest interest in space, you'll enjoy this one. "
9,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26223717-cropredy,4,"I hate to use cliches but in this case, apt - Ferris has a lyrical quality to his writing about the evolution of knowledge about the universe - from the earliest days of the Greeks to the latest cosmology.The book in the first few chapters deals with the discovery of planets, moons, and the heliocentric perspective of the solar system. It is mostly told via 'great man' chapters from the usual suspects - Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, Herschel and others.Of course as science got more complex with better tools, further truths about the universe became a mix of discoveries upon discoveries from a mix of astronomers and physicists. And these chapters are less about individuals as geniuses (some exceptions here: Einstein) than about what was learned and how.A reasonably easy read, with no math although having at least high school physics helps. Excellent illustrations throughout. It only bogged down in the chapter on subatomic particles but fortunately, the next chapter got more macro and was easier to follow.Worth reading? Yes to anyone who wants in one place a grand scale, chronological epic narrative of how humans have come to understand the universe in which we live."
10,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"I loved this book! Though not a dry collection of facts, it's crammed with information. It's a feast for the mind. It's more like a biography or a historical novel than a textbook. It expresses the beauty and power that happens when we get science right. It was perfect for me because I know little about the subject but wanted to absorb an overview written in an easy to read and entertaining manner. Though so much of modern physics was established well before I was born, none of it was taught in my high school general education classes. We didn't get past Newtonian mechanics. Human attempts at the explanation of our world are a mess of false starts and tangents. The early scientists were philosophers. They saw the randomness and unpredictability of this terrestrial muck and imagined that perfection must exist in the heavens. Many of them didn't observe the stars; they contemplated them, imagining symmetrical geometric beauty and music. Those who actually observed the stars and the planets worked hard to fit what they saw into the prevailing theories. They were also led astray by their own perceptions, such as that the earth stands still while the heavens move. Without the empiricism of science, we'd have the same beliefs today.It's so easy to be complacent in hindsight and wonder why scientific discovery seemed to progress so slowly. This beautifully written story makes me sympathetic to the struggles. The people are brought alive with wonderful descriptions. I really enjoyed the trenchant profiles of Tycho, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. Until now, those individuals for me were a sculpture at Griffith Park observatory. Even the animation of them in the new Cosmos series didn't do it. But I'm a reader, and this book was like candy.Reading the final chapters on the search for unified field theories made me think we have come full circle. We are still vainly searching for perfection in an imperfect universe, except now we've replaced Plato's perfect geometrical figures with supersymmetry and strings and hyperdimensionality. It's harder to follow as the concepts get more abstract. The author continues with colorful descriptions of eccentric and egocentric scientists and their sometimes clashing, sometimes meshing theories.Sometimes as I read about theoretical physics I felt like the character Charlie in Flowers for Algernon might have felt. I could appreciate only a mere shadow of the many concepts contemplated by great minds. Without really grasping any of it, I managed only to pick up a few terms I can drop to sound knowledgeable in conversation. But it was fun to read.The writing is gorgeous. The author is so skillful in his use of vocabulary, and of literary devices such as hyperbole, metaphor, and simile, that the reading experience never felt trite or pretentious. It just flowed. Sometimes it was as pleasurable as eating chocolate -- and for me that's saying a lot.""Space may have a horizon and time a stop, but the adventure of learning is endless."" This book gave me a taste of the joy of that adventure and at the same time a bittersweet sense of humanity's -- and my -- ignorance. I can't recommend it strongly enough.Addendum: I do have a couple of complaints that I chose not to mention because of my overall enchantment, but I keep thinking about them. The author mentions a mythical deity an awful lot for a science book. Though he describes many ways the church hindered scientific inquiry, in one passage he actually credits it with inspiring further exploration into the age of the earth. I don't understand how someone who so clearly comprehends the magnitude of what we have learned from science could possibly reconcile that with religious belief. I was unable to hold two such incompatible world views without feeling schizophrenic. One of them had to go, and my reading list and profile should make it clear which one that was.I thought the chapter on Darwin was rather out of place. Maybe the author was trying to draw an analogy between the modern synthesis as a sort of ""theory of everything"" in life science with the search for something similar in astrophysics and cosmology. I found it annoying that he chose to quote from the 1860 edition of The Origin of Species, which contains the phrase ""by the Creator,"" which Darwin added possibly because of pressure from religious groups. See http://darwin-online.org.uk/Variorum/... and https://edge.org/conversation/there-i...One more thing. Gendou gave this book a poor review because it's ""light on science."" I agree, but that doesn't make it a bad book. Right now I'm trying to read Not Even Wrong by Peter Woit. I don't have a background in mathematics and physics, so though it covers much the same subject matter as Coming of Age in the Milky Way, I'm finding it incomprehensible. I might try reading Lee Smolin's The Trouble With Physics, because it's recommended for a more general readership, but what I'm starting to see is that you don't really need to comprehend physics to realize that string theory is a bit like complimentary and alternative ""medicine"" in that a lot of money and effort are being spent on hairbrained, dead-end concepts -- ones that are ""not even wrong."""
11,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15790274-wes-cobb,4,A tour de force of the history of science. Ferris does a surprisingly good job of making even the most complicated topics somewhat understandable for the lay reader (though a few remained out of grasp) while also avoiding too much pop-science speculation. 
12,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4475067-peter,5,"Absolutely first class! Tim Ferris knows his science and writes about it in the language of a poet. I wanted to put in an excerpt, but I never found a place to stop ... One of the best science books I've ever read."
13,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3495040-caroline,5,"Ferris begins with the ponderings of ancient societies and brings us forward, with clarity and painstaking research. This approach can lend itself to a predictable scientific greatest hits parade (say it with me, preferably in the singsong of Sherri and Terri twirling the jump rope on The Simpsons: and Brahe begat Kepler and Kepler begat Newton...). But Ferris does one better and balances the march of scientific discoveries with a regard for the fumbling humanity of the steps, both forward and back, toward piecing together an understanding of the universe in which we find ourselves. As we as a species grew in our understanding, the universe in turn grew around us, showing us more as we were increasingly capable of seeing more. To peer out across the galaxy, beyond the galaxy, into the universe, is of course to peek backward in time. To look ever deeper into the traces of history is to dig at the mystery of the beginnings of time. And so the book is divided into three sections, following the pursuits of space, time, and creation.Where the weave of clarity becomes looser in the later chapters of Coming of Age, Ferris steers toward the marvelous, bringing us alongside the puzzles faced by cosmologists and particle physicists in the late 20th century. It was not until these final chapters that I realized the book was written in the late 1980s, with a quick 2003 afterword appended. No matter. As it dwells less on explaining the then-current state of affairs in favor of pursuing the theoretical implications that arise, Ferris's book does not feel particularly dated (although a particle physicist will undoubtedly beg to differ). In fact, its ending seems less dated than prophetic. Researched and written in the late 1980s, Ferris ultimately imagines and describes what from my armchair in 2013 appears to be an interstellar internet, a series of self-replicating communications hubs that would network civilizations throughout the galaxy, allowing them to interact exponentially faster than the speed of light would demand. And not only that: ""Growing in sophistication and complexity with the passage of aeons, forever articulating itself among the stars, the network would come to resemble nothing so much as the central nervous system of the Milky Way. [...] Life might be the galaxy's way of evolving a brain"" (379).For all the pop science and science fiction I have been ingesting of late, this suggestion is the most eye-popping and intriguing of all, for it simultaneously hands us a purpose and relegates us to the backwaters of Purpose. The notion, seemingly Ferris's own, giveth and it taketh. It reminds me of the Portuguese man o' war, which walks and talks, so to speak, like a single animal but is in fact comprised of a colony of organisms. Perhaps my solar system is but a polyp that has yet to link up with its brethren in the formation of an interstellar intelligence (Galactus, I presume?).Ferris then takes his bow and ends on a note familiar to fans of Carl Sagan:""Science is young. Whether it will survive long enough to become old depends upon our sanity and courage and vigor, and, as one always must add in this nuclear age, upon whether we blow ourselves up first. 'Nothing that is vast enters into the life of mortals without a curse,' as Sophocles said, and the knowledge of how the stars shine is very great, and its dark side is very dark indeed.""Epictetus the former slave remarked thatevery matter has two handles, one of which will bear taking hold of, the other not. If thy brother sin against thee, lay not hold of the matter by this, that he sins against thee; for by this handle the matter will not bear taking hold of. But rather lay hold of it by this, that he is thy brother, thy born mate; and thou wilt take hold of it by what will bear handling.Therefore, we say--speaking as living and (we think) thinking beings, as carriers of the fire--therefore, choose life"" (387-88)."
14,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16261925-keit-doesntcare,5,"Astronomy, physics, math, chemistry- these are all subjects that in the past, would have made my stomach cramp, as if I've eaten a whole bowl of suspiciously looking beans...When I was a little kid those were my biggest fears. I just didn't get it, it made no sense, it made my life miserable. Of course, school didn't help the slightest. We had the kind of teachers that tried their best, to make you hate the subject even more. I have a very vivid memory from school, where we had to solve just one equation and we could go home. I was the last one to  not  solve anything and was left alone in the classroom, thinking of all the magical possibilities, of growing up to be another empty-headed parasite of society. Needless to say I grew up resenting everything from math to astronomy. Whenever I would go to a romantic date with boys, consisting of the obligatory ""stars sighting"" I would always be the one to ruin the moment by saying ""What's so special about them, they're just dots!"". Even my current boyfriend, who has a spiritual boner every time he mentions ""cosmos"" or ""string theory"", couldn't kindle my passion for the vastness of space.This is why I was extremely skeptical when picking up this book, but form the first sentence, I knew this would be a keeper. Not only does it have an enormous amount of information, it is written with a certain doze of humor and elegance, that makes it so much more, than your typical informative blabber. I can happily say that Timothy Ferris has lighten a big-ass fire in my heart, and a big-ass love for everything that has to do with astronomy, physics, math and chemistry. If a book can completely alter a person's world view, it's a hell of a good book worth giving a chance! "
15,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,4,"There's something poetic about the nature of the universe, and it is this as much as a desire for knowledge which drove early man to strive toward a solution of its riddles. The universe, in turn, has also driven men to write poetry, and there's something of the poetic in Ferris' history of cosmology, a book which takes us from the first recorded beliefs of our forebears through to recent discoveries at CERN. The book is structured in sections which cover first the development of our understanding of the scale of the universe, then the nature of time and its relation to space, and finally plunges into the subatomic ballet which is currently expanding our knowledge of how the universe was formed.Ferris has a light, elegant style which lends itself well to this kind of book, both in the lyricism with which it draws the readers through the early stages and in the skilled use of metaphor which allows him to illustrate concepts in quantum physics, although these come so thick and fast toward the end that you'll not so much struggle to understand as remember them all. You can appreciate the view of one scientist who, on seeing the mass of particles predicted by quantum physics, said that if he could remember all that he would have become a botanist. Like trails in a cloud chamber, however, what is left imprinted on the reader is an appreciation of just how far we've come.My one niggle was in the section on Herschel, where I thought he gave his sister Caroline - a skilled astronomer in her own right - somewhat short shrift. Perhaps this is understandable in a work of this scope - it certainly shouldn't detract from the enjoyment and edification which flows from its pages."
16,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37313804-jeffrey-schwartz,5,"I went back and forth on whether to rate this 4 or 5 stars. COMING OF AGE IN THE MILKY WAY is a wonderful but challenging book; the latter quality is particularly evident when Timothy Ferris discusses Quantum Mechanics or String Theory. In the end, though, a 5 star book is one I know I will return to, and I can't imagine not returning to this book.In less than 400 pages, Ferris manages to describe the history of humanity's understanding of the universe, from the pre-Socratic Greeks to String Theory. There are, of course, subjects you wish he would dwell on longer, and the understanding of such subjects requires a sustained effort, but Ferris' ability to condense complex ideas and movements into a digestible length is highly impressive. In the end, though, this book gets the 5 star rating because of Ferris' prose. Short of Carl Sagan, I've never read a science writer able to adeptly explain complicated subjects AND evoke a such a formidable sense of wonder. The language throughout is precise, elegant, and lyrical. This book not only allows for an appreciation humanity's ceaseless progress in the sciences, but it captures some of the beauty and strangeness and awe of the cosmos."
17,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,5,"Ferris' book is a readable and engaging summary of the history and philosophy of cosmology with supporting vignettes into mathematics, physics, astronomy, chemistry, and evolution (Darwin). He does a good job of weaving together historical events, personalities, and the little questions. Though he doesn't address it directly until the concluding chapter, throughout this book Ferris presents the human drive to know and understand our place in nature as specific questions have been posed. Thus, Ferris builds from the immediate questions and applications to the larger question of human existence and in fact, beyond with his consideration of ET. The only error I found was his referral to cell walls in human skin cells -- no animal cells have cell walls -- which does not detract from his point but is erroneous and therefore, annoying. In the world of biology, it matters that animal cells do not have cell walls. I found this book to provide an excellent historical framework in which to organize the many articles and books I have read in this area. Highly recommended."
18,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5042259-sharyn,5,"This is the best book I've ever read. I made up the dates, because I don't remember when I read it. It's a book to be savored and read a little every day, except that it's so interesting, it's hard to put it down. I missed a lot of sleep because of that fact.Timothy Ferris puts so much together in this book, that it's impossible for me to describe. In fact, I have to read it again, and vow to not devour it quite so quickly this time. He weaves a golden and silver tapestry with threads of history most of us never really understood, and creates a masterpiece in everyday language explaining all the great thinkers, artists, and scientists.The perspective I come away with is one of the bird's eye view of human thought and something much farther out, when viewing the Universe. I'm left knowing that we are just in the baby stages of understanding our own existence. "

Yet the starry heavens fascinate me. In this I’m no different from the ancient Egyptians.

It is an echo."" pg. 366""The Roman Catholic Church, convinced that humans are essentially immaterial spirits, felt threatened by the materialistic point of view: When Giordano Bruno, the Renaissance doyen of pop mysticism, asserted that matter 'is in truth all nature and the mother of all living things,' and declared that God 'is glorified not in one, but in countless suns; not in a single earth, but in a thousand, I say, in an infinity of worlds,' he was tied to an iron stake and burned alive, on February 19, 1600, in the Piazza Campo dei Fiori in Rome."" pg. 369-370""Growing in sophistication and complexity with the passage of aeons, forever articulating itself among the stars, the network [of interstellar communication] would come to resemble nothing so much as the central nervous system of the Milky Way."" pg. 379""And, it suggests a cosmic role for intelligence--that the combination of intelligence and technology could awaken the universe to its own life and thought and history. That would make us all the substance of a cosmic mind."" pg. 380""Why, then, does science work? The answer is that nobody knows. It is a complete mystery--perhaps the complete mystery--why the human mind should be able to understand anything at all about the wider universe. As Einstein used to say, 'The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.' Perhaps it is because our brains evolved through the workings of natural law that they somehow resonate with natural law. Nature exhibits a number of self-similarities--patterns of behavior that recur on different scales, making it possible to identity principles, such as the conservation laws, that apply universally--and these may provide the link between what goes on inside and outside the human skull. But the mystery, really, is not that we are at one with the universe, but that we are to some degree at odds with it, different from it, and yet can understand something about it. Why is this so?"" pg. 385""Science is young. Whether it will survive long enough to become old depends upon our sanity and courage and vigor, and, as one always must add in this nuclear age, upon whether we blow ourselves up first.

26,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22665379-nicholas-seders,2,"Broad, Informative...and UnimpressiveI came to this book with a casual interest in the night sky, hoping to learn more about the cosmos; and, undoubtedly, I finished with a much better understanding of the universe than I had before. Though it's meant to be a brief overview, Coming of Age in the Milky Way introduces the reader to a great variety of discoveries and scientific theories in an organized manner.However, as someone who has spent the majority of my time in the arts, I found certain portions of the book to be cumbersome. While Part One is more biographical in nature (and SUPER fascinating), Part Two begins a shift toward heavy reliance on less familiar terminology and more comprehensive explanations of the science itself. Ferris refocuses on the history as he nears the conclusion - but all of the narrative momentum, by that point, is completely lost.Another bothersome element was the combination of chronological snobbery and anti-religious sentiment that rears its head throughout, as if the only people who truly made substantive contributions to cosmology were post-Enlightenment materialists. Never mind the fact that we'd be nowhere without the inquiry of the ancients and the theists, or the fact that there is still so much we simply do not understand.So, though broad and informative, this books comes up short. I'm sure there is better material out there, and I'd suggest you look elsewhere for insight into the history of astronomy."
27,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6671857-saachi,4,"Absolutely enlightening! The chronology of the book is very well-defined and spaced out, the key characters are delightfully described, and one really gets a feel for the great development we've made over the centuries in cosmology and astronomy. It is really satisfying to see all the discoveries made from Grecian times to Einstein in our theorizing of space and time together in one space. The impersonal subject of the phenomena is coupled with very intuitive explanations, which was very rewarding, and gave me a better feel for what physicists are like (I get the wacky mage impression that has further magnetized me to the field). The broad sweep of our intellectual changes in history, punctuated by rich narrative and scientific descriptions of phenomena and philosophies, was extraordinarily summarized by Ferris. The one huge qualm I have with the text is that it was so Western-centric and male-focused. If I didn't know of women who contributed to the field (ex Lisa Mitner, thank god for the mention of Henrietta Swan Levitt and her contribution to defining the magnitude of the Milky Way with Cepheids) or the extraordinary efforts of the Islamic world during the Dark Ages in preserving and contributing to astrological studies, or the efforts of Mesoamerican societies in predicting and theorizing about astrological movement, I would consider the world to be made up of European men and European men only. Sad...especially given that Ferris was the one who orchestrated the collection of information on the Voyager plate that is ""representative of mankind."""
28,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32158137-kirsten,4,"I appreciated the author's methods in this book. First, he mostly focused on the people rather than on the details of various theories, giving just a general overview of each theory along with the history of its development. This kept the book from getting bogged down in complicated technical details, and gave a good background and context for each progressive step in our understanding of the cosmos. Also, I don't think I realized quite how eccentric some of these guys were, so that was entertaining. Second, the author did a nice job of showing how various scientific developments in astronomy, geology, biology, and physics were all connected, and all instrumental in piecing together our knowledge of the universe. The chapter on the history of physics wasn't quite as readable as the rest of the book, and of course the book was published thirty years ago so it doesn't include any theories or discoveries post-1988, but overall I found this to be an interesting history of human understanding of the cosmos."

This book tells their stories, their breakthrough, and how the universe was understood in each time. So I thought this book is more of a history of science until I got to the second and third part when it took a turn to Darwinism and (expectedly) quantum physics. By that point, it became very similar to most popular science books, which by no means is wrong. It even gets a little technical, but just on the right amount not to bore you. Not being a physician or a mathematician, some of those concepts I still find hard to understand, but this book is another step in the path of learning. "
30,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6101948-bryan-dunk,5,"Maybe the best book I've ever read. Definitely the best popular science book.Ferris doesn't just spout facts, he weaves a story.

It was not only about astronomy/cosmology, as I expected it to be, but it covered also the fields if physics and biology.The deep discussion of especially modern developments in physics may be a bit too much for the casual reader, though, so I would only recomment this for those who have at least a moderate interest in and some asic knowledge of modern physics and astronomy. In any case, the book is well writen, so it is worth a try."
32,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78591412-vinay-ayilavarapu,4,"What is space and time? How do we quantify where we are? Ferris tries to address this question by narrating a three-act play. Act I: ""One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind"" -ArmstrongEnter the Greeks, who had many things on their minds. But understanding the skies was the least of their concerns. Thus, cosmology took a back seat. Eudoxus, Plato's student proposed a spherical model of the universe that met the symmetrical requirements of his teacher. This approach didn't correlate with measurements. It took us a while before Copernicus came along to provide a remedy. And thus, we switched to a heliocentric system from a geocentric universe. Kepler & Newton further enhanced our understanding by providing a mathematical model. Ferris places a special emphasis on empirical data. For example, 1. Nebulae catalog from William & Catherine Herschel2. Understanding the functions of Cepheid variables by Henrietta Leavitt3. Studying stellar doppler shifts by Edwin Hubble With newly invented tools, we were able to map the skies and gain newer insights into our universe. A discrepancy in mercury's orbit was still unresolved. Einstein's general relativity answered this question. He theorized that space and time are made up of the same fabric. Thus ends the first act ends with a shocking reveal that gravity bends space-time.Act II: ""The two most powerful warriors are patience and time."" - TolstoyWhile the scientific community was busy exploring space, others questioned the origins of time. Didn't our species always exist? Darwin, who enthusiastically traveled the world hypothesized that, we as a species evolved from other primates. To prove his theory, we needed a way to measure the age of the earth. With the discovery of radioactivity, we found the tool necessary to estimate this. Act III: The Quantum DivideRadioactivity needed a lot of explanation. Quantum mechanics was the answer to all of these. Hubble observed that space was expanding. Thus scientific community speculated that if we rewind time, we could reach a convergent point, a singularity. Why then did the singularity collapse? Ferris explores few theories in this part that recall discussion of symmetry from act I.End of the play.I've one major objection to the author's viewpoint. He seems to deem Nobel prize as the only indicator for the accomplishments of modern scientists.Overall, what he achieves here is phenomenal. He makes this all about humanity's pursuit of identity. "
33,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84370858-harriman,5,"This book should be on the reading list of anyone who is college-educated in our modern, technical, scientific world. Much of the book is fairly easy reading and is a historical account of the development of knowledge and understanding of our physical world.

44,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12594799-subodh,4,"The most fascinating journey in the history of mankind is the journey of the mind - the attempt by us to make sense of the world around us, to detect patterns in the apparent jumble and to create theories to explain the world. The journey began with our ancestors looking at the sky and noticing regularities in the motion of stars and planets. At the same time people were also trying to understand the behaviour of more mundane objects like gold crowns immersed in water and levers. They were also studying the natural world and noticing similarities in the structure and behaviour of unrelated species. Aristotle, Archimedes, Ptolemy and others like them took the science of the Greeks to a high level around the beginning of the Common Era.We had to wait a millennium and half for the next leap forward in this journey. Copernicus, Tycho Brahe and Kepler laid the foundation for the understanding of the cosmic order. Newton took that and combined it with insights of Galileo about movement of mundane objects to come up with a grand synthesis that explained both the cosmic and the mundane in one single elegant theory. The age of discovery had begun and there was no stopping it. Atomic theory, natural selection, electricity, magnetism, understanding of light followed in quick succession. The pace of development itself kept going up exponentially. Around the end of the nineteenth century all the known science was beautifully summed up in the equations of electromagnetism by Maxwell.The journey up to this point gave us the vision of the day when one single beautiful and elegant theory will explain everything. But soon nature showed us that it was more complex than we thought. Einstein's theory of Relativity modified our understanding of space, time and gravitation but didn't take this vision away. It was quantum mechanics, the behaviour of matter at the sub-atomic level that forced us to abandon the hope of understanding the working of nature at the fundamental level. We did develop mathematical models that predicted experimental results with astonishing accuracy, but these models didn't lead to a satisfactory mental model of the working of nature. Even Einstein, who was instrumental in the birth of the new Physics, was never comfortable with the direction it was taking.If Newton brought together the cosmic and the mundane, Physics today has brought together the cosmic and the microscopic and on the way accounted for the findings of geology and biology. The achievements are phenomenal, but the hope of finding a satisfactory conceptual and intuitive understanding has receded, and some scientist are despairing whether this hope would ever be realized.Timothy Ferris presents us with a highly readable and informative account of this journey and gives us valuable insights into the process of discovery and brings alive the events and personalities that have taken the journey forward. Highly recommended."

In this book, intended for a general audience, Mr. Ferris describes how humans over millennia and centuries of scientific efforts have developed a credible picture of the world around us and the larger universe and calls it a coming of age.The book is divided into three sections:1. Space2. Time3. CreationThe section on space deals with developments in astronomy and cosmology since the days of the ancient Greeks, Newton's theories of motion and Einsteinian relativity. The section on time deals with developments in geology, research into the age of the earth, the structure of the atom, radioactivity and theories of stellar evolution. The final section on creation deals with quantum mechanics, subatomic particle research and theories of the origins of the universe.As a creationist, I must take issue with some of the points Mr. Ferris discusses but agree that he does a very good job of describing mainstream science in a way that the layman can understand. Furthermore, he points out personality traits and cultural influences that impact how the various scientists did their work as well as whether they succeeded or failed. Overall, this book was fun to read, and I recommend it."
47,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51094215-vinay-sharma,5,"This is an excellent book for the people interested in astronomy. For the people fascinated by the stars this book is an inspiration to start learning about them. Starting from the earth centered system of Ptolemy to the quantum mechanical phenomena that govern the formation of every element in the universe, this book is a voyage through time. In between are the stories of great women and men who were brave enough to think big and advance this science. Those people to whom in some sense we owe our existence.In this book at various instances one can find the hints if not the complete answers to the questions that usually plague the curious minds, like : How did they calculate the distances to the planets ? How did they calculate the distance to the sun, and the stars hundreds of light years away? How do we know the age of the sun and the earth ? How complex molecules in the universe came into being ? and much more. A curious reader would be surprised that the answers to some of these questions have something to do with the voyage of Capt. James Cook, the origin of species by Charles Darwin and a small dynamo governed by Maxwell's equations inspiring the theory of relativity by Einstein. "

If you're looking for a history on astronomy/cosmology, you could do worse than this book. The only problem is it's a bit dated, having been written in 1988, and then updated in 2003. But it does a pretty good job of explaining the discoveries prior to that. Ferris covers all the main points, and gives a good amount of detail to them and the people involved, even if the writing isn't the most entertaining. The book discusses the theories, philosophies, and discoveries of Aristarchus, Archimedes, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, Brahe, Galileo, Newton, Herschel...and thats just the first half or so of the book, and there are lesser known names as well. Really, any review I give won't do justice to the amount of info that is contained in this book. Just know there is a lot of information covered.Still, its a good place to start if you're looking for a history of astronomy.

Ferris was a great choice for an introductory tutorial, even though I stumbled on to him randomly at the used book store. The best part of this book was his description of the four fundamental forces (""interactions"" he calls them as they always involve two or more ""things"") and how these relate to the evolution of the basic physical components of the universe (quarks, atomic nuclei, atoms, stars and galaxies). That evolution begins in the intense (actually, beyond intense) heat of the Big Bang that was necessary in the first fractional seconds of time to bind together the initial particles of matter. It's quite a story, and I'm positive I don't really understand most of it. But that's not the real point of this book. Ferris has a way of capturing the magnificance of the subject matter, and inspiring the reader to learn more. "
50,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15893990-d-wavrock,3,"This book had me very conflicted. On the one hand, it builds a very entertaining narrative out of the history of western astronomy through the ages, but on the other hand, it's entirely Eurocentric and leaves a lot to the imagination of how other societies came to understand astronomy.One part of the book, in specific, left me dumbfounded: the part where it compares Fermilab to CERN, basically lauding and praising the Americans for creating such a great particle accelerator decorated with all sorts of adornments, and criticizing CERN for ""making it look like a used parts scrap yard"". I'd like to see Ferris' face 20 years after this book was published, when Fermilab is closed down and CERN has the particle accelerator that Ferris envisioned the US to build in the future.Overall, it's a good book and I'd recommend it, but don't think you're getting an unbiased, complete view of astronomy by reading it, cause you aren't."

It ultimately cost me nearly two weeks of finals-study time, but I couldn't say that the price was too high.While in principle it's simply a history of astronomy, the material, in Ferris's capable hands, winds up feeling more like a detective story. How have we come, from our fixed vantage point on the limb of a spiral galaxy, to know what we know about the size, structure, and composition of the universe?Ferris walks us through the evolution of our astronomical models, demonstrating how each new one incorporated new observations to refine and build upon its predecessors.If I could choose only one popular-science book to keep in my library, this would be it."

This process is what the author calls our ""coming of age"" as we have, through centuries of fitful effort, finally begun to comprehend a few of the fundamental facts about the universe which is prerequisite to even a modest claim of cosmological maturity.The fact that the subjects of science and history are (and always have been) my two favorite subjects of study make this the perfect book for me. It is essentially a history of science and scientific discoveries, and of our universe to the best of our current understanding. The entire reading experience was so interesting and so illuminating and educational that I really did not want it to end, which is a pretty good sign that for me it is a 5-star book."

Ferris made science interesting, engaging, fun, and most importantly, incredibly accessible. After several misogynist jerk science teachers (a threatened fail for refusing to dissect a foetal pig in 10th grade - i was vegetarian; a promise that every girl fights with her mother because she secretly wants to sleep with her father in ninth grade; a show and tell chemistry class - we never got to actually do the experiments in the wonderful lab in 11th grade; a 600+ person university lecture with a handsy instructor), i'd all but given up on science.

Provides various significant realizations about our universe, while later informing the reader on possible hypotheses on how the universe came into existence. I cannot recommend highly enough. Much of the book is written in a way which is easily accessible to even those who do not have a background in physics or astronomy. Beware the later sections of the book that contain information regarding quantum mechanics. Here the explanations cannot be as easily understood as previous chapters, and you will find yourself truly challenging yourself to comprehend the concepts presented.

Ferris demonstrates their faults and failures. It points out that all of us foul-up at some points in our lives.For example, who would have guessed that the women natives of Tahiti would trade sex for a nail and Captain Cook's sailors pulled so many nails from their ship that it almost fell apart. Galileo was so absorbed with self-promotion that he wouldn't help Kepler get better telescope lenses because he feared that Kepler's skills would make him (Galileo) look bad. Kepler described his wife as 'simple of mind and fat of body'. So we see that these intellectual giants are human just like the rest of us. "

You know, like, stars and shit.It's actually fantastic, not only in its explanations of processes that are downright miraculous, but also in its biopics of various astronomers, physicists and geologists, some of whom (Kepler) I'm determined to learn more about. My one complaint is that the discoveries of the 20th Century, the complexities of which fill many textbooks, were diluted to a point that the layman (Matt) could not understand them. On the bright side, this shortcoming left me with lots of questions that I'm going to pursue further.This may be the best science writing I've ever read. "

This book tours human knowledge of our place in cosmic history, covering Astronomy, Cosmology, Physics (Classical, Quantum, String Theory), Evolution. It's a more in-depth tour than A Short History of Nearly Everything, spending less time on anecdotes and more time on explaining concepts via analogy and exploring the nature of science. One could summarize this book as a better version of A short history..., but that would be selling it short. I have been a fan of Mr. Ferris ever since reading The Red Limit and now I'm off to find more of his stuff. This is really a tremendous book. It should be the next non-fiction book you read."

In the chapters about quantum physics near the end of the book, Ferris assumes the reader has come with background knowledge of the subject; his explanations are too brief compared to the format of all other chapters. For its breadth of subject this book is short, which is good because the entire read is quick and engaging. However, more than a few topics not only left me wanting more, in the cliched sense, but were frankly too thin a soup for this reader's stomach, especially considering the ingredients at hand. Still highly recommended for pop sci fans."

I recall that this book was included in the ""suggested reading"" list of a ""History of Astronomy"" course I took several years ago (which I did not read then). I can see why now. It should probably be on the required/recommended reading least of any such course, including intro to astronomy courses for non-majors. "

My favourite parts are how the author describes not only the theory, or the scientific discovery, but the personality of the man or woman behind it. The book gave me insight into the great minds of the human race - how they were as people. As I got closer to the end (closer to the boundaries of human knowledge), the book becomes even more beautiful as I realise how little we actually know - how limited human knowledge is. At times I was frustrated with how long it took me to finish the book, but I am glad I did. Thank you, Mr Ferris. "

(It was easier than you might think.)One by one, history's brightest and hardest-working marched through time and solved mystery after mystery, building knowledge of our modern world.A can't-put-down...and not just for scientists.Did I mention the 16th-century astronomer Tycho Brahe had a metal nose? I'm just sayin...:)"
64,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32361219-ismael-de-leon-h,0,"Good source for the history of cosmologyThis is not a science book, but rather a history of science book. Although precise and interesting, it does go way too far in scientific nomenclature for the average reader. The part on quantum physics gets a little too specific, making concepts hard to understand, possibly making the reader feel lost at times.It does a great job though, unifying many centuries worth of knowledge (and ignorance) into a compact book that helps to grab the whole scope of cosmology throughout the centuries. "
65,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368231-ellie,5,"I read this book for a physical science class in college. Absolutely brilliant. Timothy Ferris has a rare talent in that he can convey complex topics in a compelling and entertaining way and make historical figures come alive. I can still recall little tidbits from this book, like how evil Tycho de Brahe was to poor Kepler, and that he kept a dwarf named Jep beneath his table and fed him table scraps. "
66,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/566692-joe,3,"I read this a long time ago. It is a nice primer on the history of major scientific discoveries and how they changed the collecive worldview of mankind. A fairly succinct summary of the major paradigm shifts that affected the entire world. A compilation of stories of the great discoverers and how they arrived at their big ahas, told in an an enjoyable narrative style. Also a reminder that the more we learn, the more we realize how much more there is that we have yet to learn."
67,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/874009-brandie,5,"This history book personalizes all of the iconic moments in the history of astronomy. It strings together people, places and events in a narrative more captivating than any fiction could hope to be. Really: we're talking supernovae and quasars and epicycles.And some of the personal stories (Kepler comes to mind) are amazing. They pull together science, personalities and discovery in novel ways that really enhanced my previous understanding of astronomy."
68,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7583034-noah,3,"I didn't like how this book was written. The author seemed compelled to use every big word he possibly could. It seemed like he was almost showing off his use of big words and complex sentences. Luckily, the kindle makes it easy to look up words but it was still arduous and an unnecessary style of writing. The history of astronomy is difficult enough to grasp by itself. I do like the concept behind what he wrote."
69,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18710563-carl,5,I've lost count of the number of times I've read this book. I'm no scientist and the later chapters of the book (string theory et al) are somewhat difficult for me but I still read them every time I go back to the book and understand a little more.I have a love of history and that's where this book really catches me with the historical perspective of cosmology and physics (some of the characters are fascinating and I would love to find a good biography of some of them).
70,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20451957-rauri-finan,2,Reading and ADHD are difficult to combine. So far I'm finding too many sentences run on and on for up to 5 or 6 lines and contain an unnecessary amount of commas. I attribute this to bad editing or having an academic style in which references are always required. But I'd hate to feel stupid not being able to read a smarty pants book so I'll give it another go after I've read something written with a bit more style and grace.
71,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/281380-anton,5,"An amazing story, superbly organized, written beautifully, at times rising to highly memorable philosophical-poetic rhetoric. Mostly, though, just essential information about our present understanding of reality, explained for non-scientists without stooping to dumbness or hyperbolic crooning & swooning. The parts on the investigations of the ancient Greeks, Newton, Kepler, Galileo, Brahe, and Gell-Mann were my favorites; also the explanation of hoe elements are made in stars. "
72,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99357-theodore-wilson,4,Non-fiction. A string of biographies of the great theories of the universe including their eccentric religious brilliant destitute or crazy creators. A amazing introduction to modern cosmological thought though more detailed and rich then anything bouncing around on the web. It's like if Gould wrote on astronomy. 
73,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/767519-chanel-earl,5,"Instead of plowing through this book in a week or two (which is my normal reading style) I read this book a chapter at a time throughout an entire semester. I was reading it for my Honors Physics class, and the discussion sessions really made the book better. By the end of the class I loved it. I do however want to read it again really quickly to see what that experience is like. "
74,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1383343-stewart,5,"Timothy Ferris is a PhD with an amazing ability to translate quantum physics, high level astronomy, and cosmology into plain english. Not only can you understand the concepts, but his narrative style makes it a very enjoyable read. I highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in how the universe we are in was formed."
75,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1736354-nate,5,"I'm reviewing this since my only friend on this site would never read a book like this although she should. True there is no ""plot"". There is no ""character development"". But it's a brief, readable, understandable (for the most part) history of humans as scientists. It really makes you appreciate how far we've come and how far we can still go."
76,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7905796-tom-adams,4,"This was one of the first general (popular) cosmology books I ever read, and it started my ongoing interest in all things cosmological. Ferris is a gifted writer, and presents a great deal of information in with panache. The book is now somewhat dated (lots has happened in the field since 1988 - a considerable understatement) but it is still a great introduction."
77,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7001329-kendra,4,"I'm not going to lie - I'm pretty sure I didn't understand most of this book, especially the later chapters that dealt with recent advances, and especially anything that involved equations/math... but I'm still glad I read it and I think I got a lot of good information out of the parts I did understand. "
78,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18698416-rick-watts,4,I love all of Timothy Ferris's books - and this one is a favorite. Illuminating and fascinating - even if you have a slight passing interest in science and astronomy - this book will make you love it even more. Mr. Ferris is a great storyteller showcasing several scientific pioneers and their accomplishments in a new and highly interesting light. Loved it!

Although the acceleration of our understanding of the universe through science seems undeniable I was left with the unsettling feeling that the ratio of what we understand to what ""we know that we don't know"" has been declining rapidly since Galileo."

He kind of lost me, about the time quantum mechanics to the electroweak theory popped up. Nice book, though I felt throughout that Carl Sagan had covered all this more interestingly in Cosmos"
81,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7657599-jake,3,"This review of the journey from early astronomy to modern day astrophysicists was more entertaining that I would have thought. Small anecdote and the idiosyncrasies of the various scientists (along with their often-times less than stellar early lives and careers) made for an engaging read. The last chapter was my favorite, including a more in-depth accounting of the Big Bang."
82,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36136591-mark,5,"Amazing book--blew my mind. Great overview of humankind's search for knowledge around cosmology, evolution, theory of relativity, quantum physics, the Big Bang, the origin of the universe, etc. This book was fascinating, in that it's incredible we know as much as we do (though ""our knowledge is finite, but our ignorance is infinite,"" but it also made me feel very, very small in the universe. "
83,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20553112-julian-munds,2,"There was a whole section of this book that I found difficult to read and understand. I read a lot of this type of ""scientific thought for the laymen"" type book. When Ferris drifts into Quantum Physics I didn't follow it a lick. Is this my failing? Likely. I found the first half fascinating. The closing conclusion trite... but the Quantum Physics unfathomable. "
84,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113673-billy,4,"Engaging popular treatment of cosmology through the ages. Since it covers a lot of ground in a few hundred pages, there are holes, but if you're looking for an intro to the topic, this isn't a bad place to start. However, I don't think the writing is quite as strong once it enters the age of quantum mechanics. Then again, it's not an easy topic to make digestible to the lay audience."
85,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21071-mitchell-szczepanczyk,5,"Timothy Ferris gets my vote for being the best writer alive -- in any genre. This book, a history of Western science, is a dazzling romp, and exquisitely written. Thanks to the chapter on Einstein, I was able to dispense with any further reading on Einstein -- the book is that good. "

87,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/913652-preston,3,Well written introduction to cosmology and physics.

89,0060535954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763879-martha,5,Where we come from. How we got here. Who discovered it all along the way. What we still don't know. What's happened and what's going to happen. Well written and fascinatingly told. IMO best one-volume start to astronomy and cosmology.
