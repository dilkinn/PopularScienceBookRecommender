0,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"Whereas Newton, Hooke, Locke and Descartes were pop stars of the first scientific revolution in the 17th century, Richard Holmes looks at what Coleridge called a “second scientific revolution,” the era of scientific breakthrough between Captain Cook’s first circumnavigation in 1768 and Darwin’s journey on the Beagle in 1831. He does this by a sort of relay, beginning with Joseph Banks, a botanist on Cooks’ ship, Endeavor, connecting him to William Herschel, an astronomer who with his sister, Caroline, revolutionized how we look at the heavens, building the first huge telescopes, including a 40 foot reflecting telescope. He discovered Uranus (insert jejune joke here) which had another, less entertaining, name before the final one was universally agreed upon. He and his sister mapped a host of comets, planetary moons and other astronomical phenomena. From the Herschels we ascend to the world of ballooning, quite a big deal at the time, and mortally dangerous. The Montgolfier Brothers put in an appearance as do other daredevils of both scientific and adventuresome bents. Mungo Park was a world class explorer who combined a daring spirit with a medical degree and an interest in exploring unknown Africa. He sought the origins of the Congo and Niger rivers with encouragement from Banks, by then head of the Royal Society. Humphrey Davy figures large in this tale, sharing most of the real estate here with the Herschels. Davy experimented (on himself as often as not) for years with gases of various sorts. He was successful in the short term in creating a lovely form of intoxication, but in the long run, had hit on a safe way to anesthetize medical patients. Later, as a sort of superstar science stud of his day, Davy was asked to come up with a way to make mining safer. He designed the first safe-to-use miner’s lamp. It cut down on fatalities dramatically, and earned him the gratitude of the nation.  Not only do we have scientific advances, we have the arts of the time. These scientists were not lab-bound nerds. Herschel was a working musician, head of a band, a fellow who dashed off 24 symphonies. Caroline sang at a professional level in addition to becoming the first woman to be a paid, professional scientist. The scientists, portrayed here in mini-biographies for the primary characters, also wrote and often sold poetry. This combination of interests and the personal passion to persist against sometimes daunting odds gave the era its character. It is from this time that we get the notion of a Doctor Frankenstein (based on a real person, who was attempting reanimation) the mad, obsessed scientist, alone in his castle. Could one revive dead tissue? If one did would it have a soul? There was animated discussion going on about what makes us human. Is man merely a product of chemical interactions or is there some vital force, some chi that exists outside the scientifically observable plane, that makes us human, a soul maybe? It became a major political acid test at the time, probably equivalent to the abortion issue today. These are all fascinating people, with great accomplishments and plenty of quirks to their credit. The period is dazzling in the mixing of art with science, artists with scientists and the renaissance character of many of the figures portrayed here. It makes you want to know more about them and about the era, as well as providing a contrast to our current age of hyper-differentiation.Holmes writes with great affection for his subjects and with a charming sense of humor. The golden age of ballooning certainly did include the first members of the Mile high club. It is a fun read with new information around every turn, and offers us an appreciation for what an amazing age that was. It won the National Book Critics Circle award for 2009, among other awards. It deserved to win a lot more. There is only one word that can sum up this book, wonderful.==============================EXTRA STUFFFor a good review of this book, you should read this one. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/boo...Or this onehttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/boo...Bringing home mass quantities from storage, in the hopes of becoming unburdened by that obscene cost, I opened a box of National Geographics. And being the sort I am, could not help but skim through. Came across an article from the November 1996 issue, by T. H. Watkins about Joseph Banks, a significant person in the story told in The Age of Wonder. The article is titled The Greening of the Empire. Sadly, the available on-line archive from NatGeo extends only back to 2005. But I did find a smaller version of the article, at the website StrangeScience.net. It is a quick and fascinating read. And if you have boxes of National Geographics tucked away in a garage or attic, you might want to go exploring and dig this one out. Your journey will be well rewarded.It is impossible for me to pass any mention of the Montgolfier Brothers without succumbing to this bit of silliness from the pythons."
1,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,3,"There's nothing like reading a book about really smart and energetic people back in ye olden days to make you feel like a lazy piece of crap. I'm sitting here in front of a magic box where I could type in the words 'Hubble telescope' in an image search and instantly see pictures of distant planets and galaxies but it seems like too much effort. William Herschel had to invent his own telescopes just to get a decent view of the moon. I'm sure Sir William would like nothing better than to crawl out of his grave and beat me senseless.Just as the title promises, the book explores the scientific revolution that occurred from the late 1700s through the early 1800s by focusing on several key figures and examining the impact their work had in science and on the Romantic movement going on at the same time. There's some really interesting people and stories in this book that show how wild and wide open the different sciences were at this time. A gentleman like Joseph Banks could sail with Captain Cook to Tahiti, collect a wealth of data, and have a pretty good time in the process. (Apparently in the 18th century, what happened in Tahiti, stayed in Tahiti.)Banks went home to England where he served for decades as the president of the Royal Society and championed guys like Herschel, who was a German immigrant and a professional musician who taught himself astronomy and came up with telescopes superior to anything else at the time. In addition to discovering Uranus (stop snickering in the back), he made numerous other discoveries. His sister worked as his assistant and was an accomplished astronomer in her own right. Humphry Davy was another person with little scientific education who started doing experiments with gas, primarily huffing nitrous oxide, and went on to become one of the pioneers in the field of chemistry. Crazy balloonists kill themselves in the earliest flights. Bold African explorers vanish into the uncharted regions never to be heard from again. Periodic clashes about faith versus science make everyone uneasy and political. Some of the Romantic writers embrace the bold advances and some mock or fear them. Rivals clash over ideas and credit, and eventually a split among the English researchers leads to the invention of the word 'scientist'.There's a lot of ground covered here, and the first half of the book flew by with the tales of Banks in Tahiti and his career afterwards, along with the story of Herschel and his sister, Mungo Park and his exploration of Africa, and the daredevil balloonists. However, the book gets bogged down with more philosphy and poetry in the second half once Humphry Davey and his chemistry revolution is introduced. The author does a nice job of conveying how utterly amazing it must have been to be one of these curious people at this time just as new technology was leading to whole new realms of study, but he also doesn't make excuses for some of the imperalism, racism, or sexism that was inherent to the people and time.Interesting read, but the second half was a bit of a struggle."
2,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly,3,"I think the time has come for me to admit that I am either not going to finish this, or at least that I will finish it in very slow chunks over a much longer period than I had planned.Holmes' book purports to put forth a unifying thesis about how science influenced the Romantic generation. All the new discoveries in science are meant to have communicated to this generation endless new possibilities, which goes a long way to explaining the reputation this bunch has gone down with for credulity, extremes of emotion, hilarious mistakes, and pose-striking. And Holmes is sure to talk about this towards the end of each chapter, with several paragraphs detailing the interests that the famous poets, writers and political leaders of this generation took in science, how imagery inspired by astrological discoveries or explores' voyages could be found in the public imagination.But the bulk of the book is the story of the individual scientists. We get mini-biographies and blow-by-blow recountings of the processes and thinking that lead to each scientists' discovery, as well as entertaining bons mots and anecdotes to keep the good times rolling on the way. Unfortunately, however, this ends up making the unifying theme seem rather forced. To be honest, this felt like a pile of research notes reworked into pleasing long essay form for appearance in high-brow periodicals. It reads like a survey of the most exciting things going on in science in the period, chosen for the outsize personalities behind them as much as concrete achievements they put forth. Therefore the thesis that prefaces the book seems forced by the book format, rather than an organic result of research. I've seen this particular academic disease once too often. In order to sell books and create interest, somebody somewhere along the line wants to create the sense that this book is making a grand statement rather than simply being honest about it was.It doesn't prove much to me. Well, other than that the English ruling class was small-everybody could introduce you to everybody- and poets looking for radical causes and inspiration are going to embrace radical things they read about. And it doesn't need to. It is a series of individual tales of scientific adventures and individuals that are mostly well told, in that Oxbridge old boy sort of way that I happen to find charming. I'm not sure why we needed to tack on Byron and Shelley at the end of the chapters, other than to give this book the broadest possible appeal to people interested in this period. But honestly, these people are interesting enough on their own without them. If the tales sometimes veer off into salacious side stories and irrelevant personality examinations, well, I never oppose books that counteract the idea that history is dry and boring. If nothing else, Holmes gets that part right, which is why I will probably return to finish it in bits and pieces later."
3,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Holmes profiles prominent British scientists of the Romantic Era - botanist Joseph Banks, astronomer William Herschel and chemist Humphrey Davy. We meet their friends and acquaintances including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy and Mary Shelly, James Watt, Michael Faraday and many more. Holmes focuses on their cultural impact. He shows how new ideas such as deep time, deep space, a universe in motion, invisible wavelengths of light, and electricity from chemicals influenced the writings of Erasmus Darwin, Keats, Wordsworth and other thinkers and poets. New concepts about nature and the cosmos confronted established religious teachings and deeply held personal beliefs. Science began to shape societies values. At the same time, the public’s imagination was stoked by Mungo Park’s exploration of mysterious Africa and the balloonists’ exploration of the skies Holmes starts with Joseph Banks, who sailed around the world with Captain Cook from 1768 to 1771 documenting the flora and fauna and even becoming an early ethnographer. Holmes focuses on Banks three months in Tahiti, visited so Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne could observe the transit of Venus across the sun. Banks spent his time collecting plant and animal specimens as well as artifacts. He documented the islanders’ culture taking a personal interest in the young females. Upon his return he became the President of the Royal Society, embraced the rapid developments in science, and advised King George III on scientific matters. His massive plantings transformed Kew Gardens into a grand setting.Next Holmes describes William Herschel, a self-educated amateur astronomer who came to England from Germany. By trade a musician his approach to observing the heavens was unique, reading the stars almost like sheet music. One night looking at the stars through his homemade telescope an intrigued passerby stopped to find out more. The passerby was a member of the Royal Society who was impressed with Herschel’s knowledge of the night sky and his beautifully crafted telescopes. Herschel’s papers and craftsmanship gained him recognition from Banks, Maskelyne and even King George III, a fellow Hanoverian. Herschel became a Fellow of the Royal Society and was appointed the King’s astronomer. He became a premier builder of fine telescopes. With his sister Caroline, Herschel regularly scanned the sky discovering numerous comets and nebulae which his superior telescopes enabled him to recognize often to be configurations of stars. Perhaps most importantly he offered a picture of a universe in constant motion confronting the conventional assumption of a static universe as a backdrop to the solar system. He posited that all the stars had solar systems of their own which were teeming with life. He discovered Uranus, the first new planet found since antiquity. Herschel explored the nature of light and discovered infrared radiation. His sister Caroline made history as one of the first women to be recognized for her scientific achievements. We move on to the balloon craze starting with the first manned flight on November 21, 1783 in Paris with the launch of a hot air balloon. Hydrogen, just discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1766, was also used to fill balloons. Some even tried hybrid hydrogen and hot air balloons, a dangerous combination. Primarily exploited for entertainment and adventure, launchings drew huge crowds. However, some scientists used balloons to understand the weather and to assess the ground below. For the first time they could gauge the impact of cities, the distribution of cultivated fields, pasture and forests.Holmes takes us to Africa to follow the explorations of Mungo Park. Banks wanted Park to find the fabled Timbuktu and trace the course of the Niger River. Starting in Gambia in 1795 he headed east to find the Niger. He was captured and imprisoned by Moors somehow escaping and wandering for hundreds of miles on his own to find his way back a year later. Unfazed he returned in 1805, this time with troops. They succumbed to disease or attacks by hostile residents. Boating down the Niger Park was last seen only 300 miles from its mouth in a final assault by natives. Accounts of his journey fed the British fascination with Africa. People believed almost any type of strange creature or society could be found there.Finally we turn to Humphrey Davy who learned chemistry in his hometown of Penzance working in the pharmacy of a local surgeon. Davy took a position at the Pneumatic Institute in Bristol where he became intrigued with nitrous oxide (laughing gas). He and his friends, inventor James Watt, poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey all became regular users. Davy tried many different gases on himself and others but preferred nitrous oxide for the euphoria and altered consciousness. He was accused of using it for sexual exploitation. Although he recognized and noted its use as an anesthetic, for which there was great need, this use was never developed. In 1801 Davy received an appointment to the Royal Institute in London. Always the showman, his lectures were very popular. Davy was fascinated by Volta’s new battery and used electrolysis to isolate the elements potassium and sodium. He used the latter for dramatic demonstrations. Young girls flocked to his lectures; including Mary Shelly whose Professor Waldman gives similar lectures to Frankenstein. Vitalism, the idea that some innate force differentiated humans from other animals, was hotly debated. This concept was at the heart of Mary Shelly’s plot. With the advent of Volta’s battery, bizarre experiments were conducted to see if electricity could be the vital force. Victor Frankenstein may have been inspired by German scientist Johann Ritter who tested the effects of electricity on himself, on live animals, and to revive dead animals and possibly human cadavers. Davy achieved even greater recognition with the Davy safety lamp, an invention that saved the lives of countless miners who were continually getting blown away by methane explosions. He was knighted and became President of the Royal Society. Success made him increasingly contentious, particularly towards his assistant, Michael Faraday, whose later study of electromagnetism would lead him to develop the electric motor and eclipse the fame of his mentor. Late in life Davy wrote Consolations in Travel a strange mix of philosophy and science fiction which influenced many in the upcoming generation of scientists including Charles Babbage and Charles Darwin. Holmes shows us how new ideas entered the public perception. We see the seeds of change. Reliance on faith and mysterious forces is challenged by scientific reason. The romantic poets were quick to react to the mechanistic explanations of science. Did science destroy mystery and beauty? If one sees a rainbow as distinct wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation what does that mean for the rainbow as a source of wonder and inspiration? Does it lose its magical promise? Are human feelings merely the result of chemical processes? Whatever our opinion, today we are used to such questions, but in the Romantic Era these thoughts were new and startling. Holmes’ engaging book gives us a unique look into this era of dramatic discovery."
4,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4,"Description: 'The Age of Wonder' is Richard Holmes' first major work of biography for a decade. It has been inspired by the scientific ferment that swept through Britain at the end of the 18th century, and which Holmes now radically redefines as 'the revolution of Romantic Science'.Never has a book left me feeling so completely inadequate, however it is highly probable that I am not alone in this sentiment. So whilst none of the information could be deemed as original, this book is put together to engender a true scientific lust in those younguns on whose shoulders the future lies. Truly engrossing and highly recommended.I must own up to be the owner of an un pc mind because I was tickled to tickledum with 'Fawaday'.

5,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/141327-tyler-mcgaughey,5,"I was a little upset at this book for having to end. Holmes writes with a palpable compassion for his subjects. The book's major players are so fully animated that I couldn't help but feel a sadness at parting with these historical figures, most of whom I had never heard of before and all of whom, of course, had been dead for more than a century before I was born. I think that the way Holmes structured the book, with the same kind of intricate plot architecture as a good 19th century novel, really contributed to this feeling; the people introduced in the opening chapters are still there, growing old and being swept aside by the inevitable tides of the decades, in the final ones. He is a master at seamlessly weaving in excerpts from his primary sources - letters, diaries, scientific log books - and also not afraid to throw in some scatological references, of a academic bent. "
6,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen,5,"AWE: ""an overwhelming feeling of reverence, admiration, fear, etc., produced by that which is grand, sublime, extremely powerful, or the like.""I would like to put in an official plea to wrest the word AWE back from the frantically freaked-out readers of teen romance who squawk ""epic awesomeness"", sorry, that should be ""EPIC AWESOMENESS"" and then a spasm with the shift-1 key, because words just cannot express the eloquence they feel at an author's ability to re-hash perennial adolescent angst at balancing individuality with conformity, magi-mixed with an awakening interest in sex.Howzabout this for a catalogue of the truly awe-inspiring: Herschel, who had the intellectual audacity to conceive of deep space (in the 1780's this is!), and to realise that a Newtonian reflector telescope would be better suited to plumbing its depths than the refractor type. And since large reflector telescopes were unavailable, designed and made his own, innovating the use of exquisitely fine reflective specula cast in metal rather than glass. Or the story of the 18th century space race between France and Britain. What must it have been like to take off from the ground suspended from a cloud in a paper bag? Intrepid might be a word specifically invented for those early aeronauts. Then there is Humphrey Davy, yes, he of the safety lamp, who nearly killed himself inhaling carbon monoxide. Deliberately. To find out about its properties. The real tragedy is that he discovered the euphoria-without-risk that could be induced by nitrous oxide (laughing gas), but unfortunately didn't recognize how it might be used as an anaesthetic. The world had to wait for ether and chloroform, too late for poor Fanny Burney who underwent excruciating surgery for breast cancer in 1811. (And survived!). Or restless Mungo Park, who could not settle to life as a doctor in the cold wet climate of Peebles, and set off on a second, fatal voyage (ah! the error was to allow imperial interference!) to try to find the legendary city of Timbuktu.Richard Holmes is the opposite of a serial killer, he is a serial bringer-to-life of the huge personalities, these lions of society at a time when there was still no concept of different disciplines. Both poet and 'natural philosopher', these men (and occasionally women too - Caroline Herschel for example) were engaged in examining the wonder of nature and in expressing their sense of awe in verse. There was an exchange of ideas between the likes of Coleridge, Shelley, Keats and the men who became the first professional 'scientists'. Added into this heady mixture there is also the history of the venerable institutions that funded and promoted research and ideas: the Royal Society, and what later, in 1831, would become the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Holmes has an ease and elegance of expression that kept this science-challenged reader hooked like a fish on a line. He can even explain Schelling's Naturphilosophie in understandable terms, a feat for which he deserves the five stars alone."
7,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"Excellent account of ""the second scientific revolution"" led by astronomy and chemistry at the end of the 18th century. The period Holmes covers with his engaging biographical focus on the careers of a handful of individuals is between Cook's voyage of 1768 and Darwin's of 1831. In this epoch of ""Romantic"" science, leading figures tended to see no conflict between what they did as scientists and as poets and philosophers. In fact, the term ""science"" was not widely adopted until 1834. Holmes account delves into Joseph Bank's early study of the Tahitians' ""Edenic"" state, William Herschel and his sister Caroline's astronomical revelations of the Milky Way as one among countless other evolving galaxies, Humphry Davy's elucidation of the carbon cycle, and the close attention paid by major figures in poetry and philosophy in such advances. As an example of the pleasurable range of this delightful quilt of a book, the craze in ballooning and the origins of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein each get chapters. Holmes succeeds is his intentions not just to cover ""science versus religion, sicence versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics"": ""We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe."
8,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a wonderful book about science during the Romantic era. The first few chapters are best for understanding the development of science. The last few chapters are best for understanding the interactions between science and culture, mostly prose and poetry. At the beginning of the story, the English word ""scientist"" did not even exist. Scientists were called ""philosophers"", and many of the greatest works of scientists during this era, were philosophical speculations. This is a beautiful book, in all senses of the word."
9,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1419068-elaine,5,"Wow! I finished this yesterday, and I'm still reeling. Who knew that Balloonists soaring across the skies fomented the French Revolution? Or that poets like Keats, Shelley, Coleridge, Wordsworth--all the Romantic greats--thought they were akin to the great scientists of the age, and the scientists themselves were poets. Actually, scientist was not yet a word when Herschel was exploding European mindsets with his discoveries of the infinity of the stars. Discoverers like Herschel, Faraday, Davy, and their contemporaries were thought of as philosophers or clergymen or physicians. Yet the foundations of modern science like impartial observations, inductive reasoning, avoiding conclusions based upon what God supposedly set up, blind studies, all had their origins in the Age of Romanticism.Science was not yet compartmentalized, nor was it separate from what we today lump together as ""the Humanities,"" as if uncovering the laws of nature and the cosmos itself were not human endeavors.Holmes includes in his history poems about scientic discoveries by poets still revered today, as well as poems by the great innovators like Joseph Banks and Humphrey Davy. Banks, who went to Tahiti in the late 18th century, a Briton of the ruling class, went native. The descriptions of him doing the Tahitian version of ""dirty dancing"" are so vivid I could see them as in a movie. Did I mention that he, in effect, founded anthroplology?Women? Well, as usual, they were either witty and beautiful, like Lady Davy, or serious and knowledgeable while enabling their menfolk to sweep the skies, like Caroline Herschel. There seems to have been an unwritten law that spinsters lived only to serve. Caroline Herschel was a faithful dog to her famous brother, but, on her own, she, too, discovered comets. Like a talking dog, she was a curiosity in society, a woman who actually innovated. Oh, her brother did manage to get a lifetime Royal stipend for her stargazing, making her the first female in England to get a salary Her brother arranged for this stipend when he finally got married, and his wife didn't want Caroline hanging around the the house. Maybe I'm being too harsh. Holmes certainly doesn't put it in these terms. He is way too polite. For instance, although he chronicles Davy's arrogance (my term) and his damaging treatment of his faithful protoge and lab assistant, Holmes is careful not to come right out and say that he was a nasty man. Part of Holmes's genius as a historian is his ability to portray people objectively, but give the reader enough to form his or her opinion. What he does is to objectively state what Davy, for instance, did, and how his peers felt about Davy's heading the Royal Society.This is a 600 page book. To illustrate its sweep and scope would make a review of far greater length and breadth than appropriate for Goodreads. Unless you hate history and biography, and only read torrid romances or improbable action novels, this is a wonderful, engrossing read. One caveat: in a book this long with portrayals of so many people, an eBook is more than helpful. If someone appears on a page, and you don't recall who it is, you touch his or her name, and, on the Nook Tablets, up pops ""Find."" You touch it, and it gives you every sentence in the book with that person's name. ""Oh, that person!"" This has the added benefit of helping you remember events better. The repetition alone aids long term memory . But then again, I'm an old lady. Maybe you don't need such jogs to recall what Holmes wrote so winningly of."
10,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"I read this book a while ago and didn't take notes or write a review immediately following. That was a mistake because it would have been hard even then to do this book justice. The following will not be the review this book deserves, but it's better than nothing. Holmes has written a truly exceptional book. It's been on my list for quite some time, but I never seemed to get around to reading it. Had I known how exquisite and often lesser known a science history it would turn out to be, I would have bumped it up to the top of my list long ago. Even though this book was published in 2009, the nature of it makes it timeless. Holmes included some of the following biographies for this book:- Joseph Banks who sailed on Captain Cook's ship. Even though I had read about both Banks and Cook, Holmes' telling was superior to anything I had read before. - The biography of Humphry Davy (his contributions to the field of chemistry, his obsession with inventing safety lamps for miners, and his personal life ) was my favorite part of the book. His letters to his future wife were *the* nerdiest letters any scientist has ever written. Parts of them deserve to be alongside of today's best nerdy Valentine's Day memes. In fact, I might have to make them myself. His letters were just too fabulous for words. - The first mile high club participants who got it on in a hot air balloon - William Herschel and his sister Caroline who helped us map, and indeed understand, the heavens with their revolutionary telescopes. I am not sure whether I more enjoyed the biography of their scientific contributions or the biography of their personal dynamics. I used to love poetry, but as I read more non-fiction, I cannot seem to enjoy poetry quite as much. I am always wishing I were reading nonfiction instead. However, when Holmes wrote about Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, Coleridge, Byron, or Even Erasmus Darwin, I was captivated. *This* is how to write a history of science book in this time period. Bravo! "
11,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12406850-roxanne-russell,5,"Humanists who are fascinated by science but not scientists will love this book. Holmes has that rare talent of being both fastidious and passionate about his subjects. He makes every exploration, every night of star-gazing, every laborious act of tool-building and every failed or successful experiment, a love story.This book came along at a great time for me. I'm a humanist who's been seeking more practical applications for my passions for years, and I find inspiration here. Holmes weaves the literary and philosophical ponderings of the Romantic generation in with the biographies of several science pioneers of the same period. At times, his enthusiasm stretches the power of coincidental themes beyond reasonable limits and into causal territory, but these types of connections and parallels in zeitgeist are difficult to express without that fallacy. I see this mistake in particular in the sub-title's over-reaching claim of discovery. Yet, I'll forgive his zeal because of the incredible and captivating narrative it produced. "
12,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355311-quirkyreader,4,"This was a good introduction to many of the famous figures in this book. If you are unfamiliar with many of the people mentioned this will give you a taste of their lives and maybe prompt you to read more about them.This is my only caveat of the book. There was only a slight mention of Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron's daughter and innovator of modern computer language. This was in an appendix in the back giving a short blurb about Mary Somerville. And I mention this because there was plenty written about Charles Babbage. An in depth book this is not, but it is a good starting point."
13,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,"This is an incredibly well written, thorough, and engaging work. It demonstrates a time when scientists weren't ridiculed, but respected. Not vilified, but lionized. (A time I wish we could go back to.) Many of these scientists were self taught (and some made some seriously ill-advised decisions). It wasn't just an age of wonder but a wonderful age!Cannot recommend this book enough!"
14,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1887905-kevin,5,"This is a fascinating, page turning, fact-filled history of late 18th and early 19th Century science, known as Romantic science due to the epoch it is set in. I know my Romantic poets and authors as I studied a lot of this era, the era being the first phase of the Industrial Revolution in Britain and the earth moving event that was the French Revolution. The era is marked with great social, economic and political change, combined with a major flourishing of culture and the arts right across Europe. What I never really studied however, or at least only briefly read around, were the major transformative discoveries and inventions that were occurring within the field of natural philosophy, otherwise known as science. We all know the Romantic poets, such as Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge et al, but are we just as familiar with their scientific counterparts, such as Davy, Herschel, Faraday, Mungo Park, etc? Equally as important if not more so due to their discoveries and inventions, hence known as the Romantic scientists.Richard Holmes is an incredible biographer, and his book is a study of these famous people. Also, despite writing informative biographical studies in each chapter of figures such as Humphry Davy, William Herschel and his sister Caroline, he also puts these into an historical context, explaining their importance and details the philosophical debates regarding faith and reason which were occurring at the beginning of the 19th Century. There is a fascinating chapter about Dr Frankenstein and the soul, whereby vitalism is discussed that explains how Mary Shelly was influenced with the current scientific discoveries being made during this period, which were a cause of moral concern (such as public lectures using electrical currents to try and reanimate dead animals, sometimes recently hanged people too). Even 190 years later, we still really have similar debates about the nature of existence (minus the public lectures using dead corpses...) but these were the people that really were the forerunners of modern science and a new philosophical understanding of the world and the universe. Humphry Davy is probably the man who did the most in his field and arguably became the most famous. I hope we all know about the safety lamp he designed to stop the methane explosions in the mines, an incredible invention which he never patented, but were you aware he also conducted a whole load of tests on Nitrous Oxide too, otherwise known today as 'laughing gas'? He was an incredible figure, also a very poetical person, knowing the famous people of the day such as Coleridge and Southey whom were his friends. Richard Holmes' study also has two chapters on William Herschel, the famous astronomer, the man who discovered Uranus and over 1000 nebulas with his home-built telescopes that he then turned into a mail order business. I never knew that his sister Caroline Herschel was equally highly regarded person as well, being her brothers assistant and discovered many comets. Richard Holmes writes with a captivating style and excellent prose and found this book a page turner, nearly on every page there were interesting facts and information not only about the biographical studies of these early 19th Century inventors and artists, but also delving into the times they were living and the debates which were sweeping society at that time, making you feel as if you were taking part or at least living during those remarkable times. Towards the final few chapters, it was quite sad to read about these characters dying, leaving the Romantic period to slowly end. I do recommend this book highly. "

I have always enjoyed stories that involve Captain Cooks voyages, in some ways yes they are terribly romantic, but have always found this Banks figure fairly elusive. The opening chapters really spread his life out before me and I felt really connected to the character and his life struggles especially in Tahiti. I became less connected with him during the later chapters (as he was not the focus- and this seemed to bother me a bit). Perhaps it was because I could not get into the stories, Mongo Parks especially threw me off. Which was unfortunate because his should have been terribly interesting! I mean some of his adventures in Africa should have really gotten my tail feathers up! Herschel was good enough but Caroline really stole my heart, she was just a dear! The story where the other young woman had to undergo surgery without anesthetic especially sticks out in my mind and was very vivid. I guess my major beef was with Davy. I mean to be fair the author didn't really set him up to be a hero or anything but I really found a massive distaste for him and hated reading his chapters. The chapters on ballooning were delightful though. It was frankly a more cohesive sampling than my hodgepodge review is making it out to be it was fairly well woven together, I don't know what to rate this! It had some really good moments that I think were absolutely worth it, but man that Davy what a stinker! "

18,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,4,"This is an entertaining and informative, if selective, group biography of several Enlightenment scientists, as well as a broader cultural history of science, art and adventure. It begins in the 1760s, with the voyage of wealthy naturalist Joseph Banks to Tahiti with Captain Cook; continues with brother and sister astronomers William and Caroline Hershel, who emigrated from Hanover to England; and in the later sections is largely focused on chemist and general polymath Humphrey Davy. Overall it covers scientific developments and the art they inspired through the end of the 1820s, more or less chronologically and overwhelmingly focused on England. More self-contained chapters explore the rise and fall of hot-air ballooning, explorer Mungo Park’s expeditions to West Africa, and the views of science espoused in Frankenstein, both Mary Shelley’s novel and its theater adaptations.So: the book is wide-ranging, it draws together multiple disciplines, it’s intelligent and detailed as well as readable and entertaining. It draws complex and sympathetic portraits of its principal subjects, detailed enough that one gets a real sense of their personalities and forms opinions of them accordingly. (I liked Caroline Herschel, though she sounded a bit difficult in person. The charismatic and showy Davy turned me off a bit.) It’s much more history and biography than science text, but the author is certainly interested in the science and in the process of scientific discovery itself: when did people realize they’d made a groundbreaking discovery? Why did some potentially groundbreaking discoveries languish for years without seeing their potential realized? For instance, Davy had a lot of fun experimenting with laughing gas – getting himself and his friends and patients high (or knocking them right out) with variable quantities of it and recording their experiences – but never made the conceptual leap to the idea of using it for surgery; instead, the whole concept of anesthesia had to wait another two generations.I was left with some questions about how Holmes chose his subjects. Histories of science (and everything else) available in English tend to be overwhelmingly Anglocentric, which is frustrating when many of the most important and influential scientists of the time (such as Lavoisier and Linnaeus) were not English and therefore don’t seem to feature in any popular histories. Even within England, I was sometimes a little confused about why we were reading about certain people and not others: Henry Cavendish is mentioned over and over for his importance to chemistry, but we don’t learn about him at all. Obviously an author has to draw the line somewhere to keep the book from being overpopulated – and Holmes does provide satisfyingly detailed biographies of Banks, the Herschels, and Davy, as well as shorter accounts of numerous other people. He seems to romanticize the explorers a bit much given the subsequent history of colonialism, though, and I wished he’d written a bit more about women in science at the time. In some ways Caroline Herschel seems to have had it very easy, as she was entering a field already dominated by her brother; no one seems to have discounted her abilities or discoveries on account of her gender, though she didn’t get much remuneration either.At any rate, this is a somewhat time-consuming read, but also a compelling one. You’ll learn a lot on some fairly narrow subjects and come away with a new appreciation for a very different kind of science – much more ad hoc, free-flowing and accessible – than we see today."

A rapidity of combination, a power of perceiving analogies, and of comparing them by facts, is the creative source of discovery.~ Humphry DavyThe progress of science is to destroy Wonder... ~ Thomas CarlyleTo what degree are the aims of science aligned with those of art? When and why did they begin to diverge? These are some of the more fascinating questions explored in this wonderful book, a masterpiece of narrative history and biography. Richard Holmes returns us to the era of “romantic science,” when scientists were still “philosophers” and philosophers were artists, when discoveries were made (according to the myth) by flashes of insight and obscure inspiration, and when the possibility of scientific horror first began to suggest itself.We start in 1769 with the young Joseph Banks in Tahiti, there in the capacity of gentleman naturalist assigned to Cook’s expedition to observe the transit of Venus. With his treasury of journals, specimens, and anthropological observations, he returns (just barely) to England and moves from notable disillusionment to notable accomplishment. As vigorous, long-lived president of the Royal Society, Banks becomes the patron spirit of the age, and the rest of the book.In addition to Banks, Holmes spends a lot of his time with William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus; with his sister Caroline; with Mungo Park in Africa; and with Humphry Davy, who does for the science of chemistry what the Herschels do for astronomy. We’re also given glimpses of George III, Linnaeus, Benjamin Franklin, Erasmus Darwin, a whole host of balloonists, Dr Johnson, Horace Walpole, Gilbert White, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Percy and Mary Shelley, and – as the new scientific generation comes into its own – Michael Faraday, John Herschel, and the young Charles Darwin.I’m not a specialist or historian of the period, but I loved every page of this book, and I learned something on every page. Richard Holmes has given us a gift, a history that all of us – especially those of us in the western world – are deeply invested in, whether we know it or not. Like a more beneficent, more successful Dr Frankenstein, he knits together a lost era, but reanimates it so convincingly and compellingly that its questioning spirit, its anxieties, and its sense of wonder become our own again."
20,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1009562-moonglum,4,"I adored this book. It is filled with great mini-biographies-- I especially liked the parts of William and Caroline Hershel (I knew nothing about Caroline before reading this). But to me one of the most relevant things about the book is that one of the things its about is the creation of the genre of science fiction. There is a chapter about Frankenstein, which is often thought of as the first real science fiction novel, but also it lets you see that the western European world is, even 200 years ago, becoming science fictional. Herschel and Davies both make forays into science fictional speculation. The book gave me a neat historical perspective into one of my favorite fiction genres. "
21,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"No matter how you slice it, the way we do science now is very different from the way we did science a few centuries ago, or even a single century ago. Or even a couple of decades ago. Just as the concept of science, itself a fairly recent term, has changed dramatically over the centuries, so too has the scientific method and the infrastructure through which we do science. Richard Holmes elects to analyze a significant era in the history of science, namely the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, with a focus on Britain.The Age of Wonder is not, however, a popular science book that retells and explains scientific discoveries through historical anecdote. There is plenty of mention of Faraday’s personal relationship with Sir Humphrey and Lady Davy, but there is nary a whisper about the electron. William Herschel’s tentative steps towards spectroscopy are only just alluded to in a brief aside about his experiments with thermometers and the spectrum. Rather, as the subtitle, How the Romantic Generations Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science, implies, this book is an argument for the influence of Romanticism on early nineteenth-century science, as contrasted by the Victorian era’s influence on science. Holmes’ specialized knowledge of the era allows him to interweave biographies of prominent scientists with poetic allusions.Holmes begins with Joseph Banks and his voyage with Captain Cook to Tahiti. Banks acts as a common thread throughout the subsequent chapters of the book; Holmes links the rise of many of his later subjects to Banks’ influence as the President of the Royal Society. Banks is the ur-scientist of Romantic bent: a man of independent means, pursuing knowledge for its own sake, adventuring in his early years and then settling down to a more stable, sociable life in his later ones. This is a tale that Holmes is to repeat several times as he examines the lives of William Herschel and Humphrey Davy. Others, like the ill-fated Mungo Park, become the mythical Romantic hero, lost in a foreign land. Of course, the point here is that our modern image of the “scientist” as a somewhat-eccentric loner genius pursuing an idea at great personal risk is a holdover from these Romantic sentiments. Likewise, he points out how Dr. Frankenstein’s transformation into a stereotypical “mad scientist” was populist corruption of Shelley’s purer, Romantic hero who was obsessed and passionate.The Age of Wonder is valuable precisely because it isn’t trying to explain the science done by its scientists. I’ve read plenty of those and will happily read plenty more. But this is something different. It’s a semi-biographical examination of the zeitgeist of science at a particular time. Moreover, it’s a perfect way of learning about some of the most fascinating individuals from that time of British history without having to devote the time and energy to reading a full-blown biography of each.For me, the breakout stars of this book are William and Caroline Herschel. Their chapters are some of the most interesting, both from the personal perspective of their lives as well as the chronicle of their contributions to astronomy. It’s remarkable what they accomplished. And it’s great to see the spotlight on an oft-forgotten woman scientist like Caroline. I didn’t know that she received such contemporary acclaim for her discoveries, and although it would be anachronistic to label Banks and the others as progressive in this sense, it’s nice to know that some contemporaries were willing to acknowledge that women could do science (even if that, for some reason, didn’t mean they could be elected to the Royal Society). Holmes spends a lot of time with the Herschels, but if anything, he just makes me want to know even more about them—and that’s exactly what I want a non-fiction book to do.Holmes pits his Romantic analysis against a second force that drove British science at the same time: imperialism and nationalism. Cook’s voyages of “exploration” were in fact meant to stake a claim to the Polynesian islands for Britain. The tension between Britain the Continent during the Napoleonic era had a significant impact on how Britain funded science. In the chapter on ballooning, Holmes explains that the research into hot-air and hydrogen balloons was not just out of a romantic urge to ascend ever higher into the heavens—some people honestly thought that Napoleon might decide to invade Britain by balloon. And if that sounds silly, just imagine how silly a “drone strike” would sound to them.If the book founders anywhere, it’s towards the end. The last three chapters chronicle the rise of imperialist, Victorian science as the Romantic generation ages and ossifies under people like Humphrey Davy. Holmes displays a penchant for mixing Romantic poetry into the book at regular intervals, and this tendency accelerates towards the end of the book. Soon he’s regularly quoting entire chunks of Coleridge and Keats. On one hand, I understand that Holmes is a Coleridge scholar. It’s neat that he is able to find these links between contemporary science and poetical metaphor; the English teacher in me is interested in it. On the other hand, I can see how one might think he is overdoing it.Still, we don’t often get enough poetry in our science books, and that’s a problem. The Age of Wonder appeals to me because it reminds the reader that science and the humanities are not oppositional but complementary. Scientists like Davy were (bad) poets; Herschel was both an astronomer and a renowned musician. Artists like Coleridge were also avid subscribers to scientific discourse, going so far as to integrate the latest discoveries in their poetry and art. We can try to act like Science is some Platonic and objective ideal towards which we can all strive … except it isn’t. It’s an ever-changing, mutable concept, like everything else human beings do, and it’s fallible and subject to the same biases and prejudices that infect our other activities. To not acknowledge this is unscientific. Holmes’ argument is not just that Romanticism influenced science but that it actually makes science better by embracing the humanity that is going to be present in our science whether we like it or not.This strikes a strong chord with me. I’m a math teacher. I’m also an English teacher. I can do both, yet when I explain this to people, the reaction is almost invariably one of surprise in a way that a math/science or English/history teacher does not get. Somewhere along the way we’ve created a myth that STEM and the humanities are disjoint pursuits. How many times do you hear the old chestnut about “left-brained” versus “right-brained” people/thinking? (It’s a myth, which is not surprising considering most people are good at more than one type of activity….) Let’s not even get started on all the jokes about socially-awkward scientists versus socially-successful (but vapid) liberal arts majors.More damaging, however, at least in my humble opinion, is the pernicious phrase that comes out of many mouths when I introduce myself as a math teacher: “Oh, I can’t do math!” (Variously: “I don’t have a head for numbers”, “I was never good at math”, “I’m just not a math person!”) Can you imagine if you put a document in front of someone and they recoiled in fear and said, “Oh, I can’t read!” And I’m not talking, here, about people who are genuinely illiterate—illiteracy is a serious problem that should be addressed. But that’s just the point. We live in a society that disproportionately values functional literacy over functional numeracy—yet we increasingly punish humanities graduates and privilege STEM ones.No wonder my generation is so confused about career prospects.The dichotomization of science and the arts is a recent phenomenon, as The Age of Wonder attests. Hence, it’s possible for us to become polymaths again, to know the wonders of knowing science and the joys of writing poetry. It’s not only possible but desirable and—oh, I’ll go there—essential for the improvement of society. We need people who understand the technology on which we rely and empathize with each other. Neither science nor the humanities are the “most important” of human endeavours—both are. And it’s not possible to separate them into good little silos. Science and math are creative endeavours. Art can be rigorous, logical, and exacting. So why do we teach kids the opposite?That’s what I took away from The Age of Wonder. It might just be my personal position with regards to doing science and doing art. Hopefully, though, there are enough people who feel like me that, as I age and become just as crotchety as Joseph Banks, I’ll see the world around me start to change for the better.

22,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"The iPhone is a wondrous thing. People rave about it, but would anyone consider writing a poem about it? That's very unlikely. Poetry still exists, but it has been almost entirely subsumed into musical lyrics given to us by the relative few who write the songs we hear. Lyrics can speak to the heart but they do not come from one's own heart. The Age of Wonder continually cites poetry as it was a natural way for people of the time to question and address feeling toward an exciting, but bewildering and disconcerting world of discoveries. Poetry put wonder to words.In ancient times, religion provided an authority that made people passive, accepting life as something to be endured. Then came the Enlightenment and the period this book is about, when anyone and everyone could explore and discover the world, even if only by looking at a flower, because things could be seen in a new way. In modern times, passivity has returned. Most people haven't a clue about the cutting edge of science/math and the production cornucopia presents us with new things effortlessly each day. Our minds are not aroused by mystery, as there are virtually no mysteries that someone, somewhere cannot explain - no need for us to try. You want an answer? No need to pause and consider, Google it.Richard Holmes gives us a masterful account of the period centered on the end of the 18th century by taking the remarkable life of Joseph Banks to frame it. Banks, who became the president of the Royal Society (dedicated to the promotion of scientific exploration), led a life of investigation of the natural world. Most significantly, as a young man he traveled to Tahiti with Captain Cook and lived the life of fully expressed and uninhibited sexual passion that could not have been more in contrast to English life. The impact upon him was so great that it took some time after his return to Europe for him to be able to readjust. A marriage that was considered a done deal before he had left was called off. The shock of his personal experience is the perfect introduction to the shocks of science that were to come to society as a whole. Even the term ""scientist"" had yet to be coined.William Herschel (1738-1822), a man who, all by himself, was able to craft telescopes that surpassed all others of the time is the next to be brought to our attention. His dedication to surveying the universe with the assistance of his sister, Catherine, through countless frigid English winter nights, brought revelations such as the planet Uranus, and informed speculations on his part that impressively foreshadow our current knowledge about the size and shape of our own galaxy and the distribution of matter in space.Then, we meet Humphry Davy (1778-1829) who was to chemistry what Herschel was to astronomy - a man who without hesitation attacked a subject to follow wherever his discoveries led. Davy's life is the most poignant account of the book, the most fascinating personality in it. The Age of Wonder would be well worth reading if Davy had been the only subject.Banks, Herschel and Davy were all swept up in and driven by wonder. Each day was greeted with expectation. As mentioned, in keeping with the times, poetry, either their own or that of the great poets (Shelley, Keats, Wordsworth, etc.) is continually brought into play as humanity struggled to make sense of, to integrate, the new science with the old, received wisdom.The status of women and the relationship of races are fully explored as within the three lives they come into play. Richard Holmes proves to us how any age is an inexhaustible mine of treasures, if only the author knows how to expose them.  "
23,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653081-becky,5,"What an incredible book! Holmes is a biographer and the book is more like a biography, or several biographies, than a science book - as it should be. Isaac Newton died in 1727 and Darwin didn’t make his voyage until 1831. Science was not dead between those years. Holmes uses those years to identify the years of what he calls the age of Romantic science - the Age of Wonder. The big names were Joseph Banks, William Herschel and Humphrey Davy. Banks explored and wrote about Tahiti, Herschel, with his sister Caroline, studied the stars and Davy was a chemist. These men of science were also men of the arts, Herschel being a musician and Davy a poet. Scientists (and that word was not used yet) n the days of the great men were described as loners who had moments of “aha!” The book shows this is not totally the case, there was much collaboration going on. And what with the advent of electricity and a free press, the common man was interested and often involved. Holmes’ account reads like a novel -or maybe several novels. The narrative is told like an adventure story (which much of it is) with a bit of foreshadowing, tension, character analysis and so on. The chapters include the stories of Joseph Banks’ adventures in Tahiti, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, the one-mistake sport of balloonists and what they learned, Mongo Park in Africa, Humphrey Davy’s chemical experiments and Mary Shelley’s indictment of science (Frankenstein). It strikes me that we have these kinds of people today to and maybe we always have. During the space age we had science fiction. In the computer age we have geek love and William Gibson. These are artists who find inspiration from the science of the day. We'll see if Holmes makes this point. Meanwhile the stories are told in a pretty straightforward fashion although two of them, the chapters on ballooning and Mary Shelly's Frankenstein are respectively funny and chilling. I'd be really hard pressed to say which of the sections I enjoyed most - they’re all delicious. My only criticism of the book might be the length - were all those poems by Davy necessary? "
24,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"This book is a fascinating voyage back to the Romantic Age in Europe when there were still far flung parts of the globe to explore, most of the chemical elements awaited discovery, and time and space were found to be much vaster than anyone had expected. Even more wonderfully, scientists and artists were not naturally at odds—chemist Humphry Davy and poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge were friends, Percy Bysshe Shelley attended science lectures at the Royal Society and a musician, William Herschel, became the leading astronomer of England. Poets looked to the brave new world of science for inspiration, and many scientists—including Davy and Charles Darwin’s grandfather Erasmus—wrote poetry. While scientists were perfecting the inductive reasoning of Newton and Francis Bacon they also used poetic devices like analogies to advance their understanding and inspire their research. It was an exciting and unsettling time and that makes for a great reading experience. "

26,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"This book is as the title suggests a collection of chapters related to the Age of Wonder or discovery in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the U.K. There is a good deal of arbitrariness in this definition but most of the chapters tangentially relate to the scientist Joseph Banks who, after his endeavor expedition with Captain James Cook, became the President of the Royal Society and controlled a lot of funding and promotion of science and exploration. The chapters on Joseph Banks, Herschel, the balloonists, and Munro Park were all very interesting, highly educational, well written and cleanly fit into the Age of Wonder. I felt the later chapters on Mary Shelley, Humphry Davy, and the younger Herschel were not quite as interesting and the relationships to the age of wonder were not as convincing.Richard Holmes is a superb writer and there is a enormous amount of original research done for this book. However as a writer he can forget to properly paint a scene and does not always separate the truly interesting from the mildly interesting. I had to use Google maps several times to find locations casually mentioned especially those in the U.K. "
27,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3578169-marguerite-kaye,5,"The late 18th and early 19th Centuries saw science change our understanding of the world - the universe - we inhabit at a fundamental level. The Herschells mapped the stars, discovered new plaets and comets, and proved that our galaxy is just one of millions. Humphrey Davy discovered new elements and introduced us to the beginnings of electricity. Anatomists studied circulation, and wondered what particular form of electricity animated the human body - and the human soul. Balloonists conquered the skies thanks to science, and science influenced the Romantic poets too - Coleridge, Keats, Shelley and Southey. Above it all sat the hugely influential Royal Society and the polymath Joseph Banks. And as a subtext underneath it all lay the studiously avoided question of God's role in all this, which came to the fore in the next generation of scientists. Richard Holmes's book shows us this world, where science and the arts were not yet distinct but complementary. A world where people were both fascinated, repelled and terrified of these discoveries. A world which he portrays brilliantly. I'm not a scientist, but I understood all the science, and I found myself wanting to know more. The stars of this book, the men and women making all these discoveries, are drawn with affection that is not blinded by admiration, and in every case, the narrative ensures that the reader is aware of the wider context, the wider implications. It's a very close world in many ways, a world where it sometimes seems as if everyone corresponds with everyone else, or is a member of the same club, or is best friends with, or married to, another star. This is a book that anyone interested in the age where the Englightenment gave way to the Romantics. It is a book that inspired me to have every one of my heroines in my current quartet represent a different field from the book - astronomer, botanist, geologist and physician. It is a book whose successor I would love to read, though it seems it's not yet written. But hopefully soon. It's a book I'd highly recommend. "
28,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1397766-paul,5,"Holmes, author of a magisterial two volume biography of Coleridge, probably knows more about the Romantic Poets and their circle than anyone alive, knowledge which informs every page of this wonderful historical narrative. A narrative of scientific discovery, hinged upon the belief that there existed at the end of the 18th century one culture -- not two -- in which poets and scientists conversed in the same language. Call it 'romantic science.' It is a rip-roaring tale, filled with indelibly drawn characters, that, in its telling, reproduces in the reader the same sense of wonder felt by its participants as they rushed to discover the nature of matter, electricity, the elements, the heavens above, and, to a certain degree, life itself.Though the tale ends nearly two hundred years ago, its pertinence to our culture, in which we desperately need to bring Science and Art together, cannot be overstated. If you feel daunted by the book's size and subject, just take a look at the Epilogue and Cast of Characters. They are wonderful in and of themselves, and should inspire further reading."

34,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,5,"In writing this review, I am keeping in mind that an old and very dear friend of mine (who has read and liked this book) is highly interested in my evaluation. I mention this because it leads to an important point about the book: the background of the reader will strongly determine what he or she gets out of reading The Age of Wonder. For my part, I approach this work as a sociologist who is currently (fall 2013) preparing to take a doctoral exam in the sociology of science. Hence, I already have some grounding in this field and I will use this book as deep background for my own work in science and technology studies.To extract the maximum value from this work, the reader will need some knowledge of Romanticism and the history and philosophy of science – in particular the “two cultures” debate deriving from C.P. Snow’s famous work of that name. This is not to say that this book is entirely useless to the reader lacking such a background, but it will be more difficult for the reader to grasp the overall argument, as Holmes does not provide such contextualization. However, his skills as a biographer are so good that the reader can derive enormous value simply reading the book as a set of biographical vignettes and it would not be a waste of time.  However, the core of Holmes’ work involves an extended critique of the notion that art and science are invariably at odds. Holmes’ objective is to show that this tension is largely a product of Late Romanticism (early 19th Century) and in sociological terms is very much a cultural and political “project”. Indeed, Holmes provides compelling evidence not only that science and art are not inherently adversarial but that in Early Romanticism the two were deeply interconnected and (Holmes argues) drew strength from each other. Hence the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) was not only a Romantic author but worked with Humphry Davy (the chemist) and conducted experiments with prisms in Germany. Davy for his part wrote both early science fiction as well as poetry. And these are but two examples that Holmes provides. He builds a picture of how through Romantic philosophy both science and art were unified by the feature intrinsic to both: creative thought. In this way, Romantic science can be distinguished from the more purely rationalistic viewpoint of the Early Enlightenment (in the works of Descartes, Spinoza, and Hobbes for example). Spinoza forms a case in point (I get this from Steven Nadler’s study of Spinoza in A Book Forged in Hell). Spinoza asserted that there was no role for imagination in rational society (including science) and that knowledge was based on the accumulation of facts. However, scientists of the Romantic Age (and after, such as Richard Feynman) dismissed the adequacy of simply collecting facts. Scientific understanding required conceptual breakthroughs, and this was only available via creative thought and imagination. (The cultural meme of the creative scientific breakthrough – Archimedes’ “Eureka!” moment – remains strong in present day public understanding of science. Witness how nonscientists regard Einstein or Stephen Hawking.)All of this is a long way from the divided and acrimonious relation between art and science described by C.P. Snow in his landmark “The Two Cultures”. Holmes locates the inflection point at the “Immortal Dinner” held in December 1817 by the fundamentalist Christian painter Benjamin Haydon (see pages 318-321). Attending this event were the poets William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, and John Keats. However, Holmes notes that this dinner did not include Coleridge, Byron, or Shelley – persons whom Holmes asserts would have had no patience for either Haydon’s rhetorical aims or the acrimony towards science espoused by their fellow poets. In the long run, however, the constructed antipathy between art and science put forward at the “Immortal Dinner” have become part of the dogma about science and art.Holmes’ central objective in Age of Wonder, then, is to usefully refute the “Two Cultures” hypothesis and to provide biographical evidence of its inadequacy both past and present as well as to partly rehabilitate the role of Romantic art and sensibility in furthering the Scientific Revolution – a viewpoint joined by Lisa Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution) and others, including, interestingly, the arch-atheist Richard Dawkins. Within the limits of my knowledge, I feel that Holmes has successfully provided a rich source of materials for his case as well as vivid biographical portraits of the personalities involved in this second stage of the English Scientific Revolution – with Lisa Jardine having provided a very useful synopsis of the first stage of the English Scientific Revolution.However, Holmes does not provide a good overall contextualization of the issues at stake, making it difficult for those without existing specialist knowledge to either understand or to evaluate his thesis. This contextualization would not have to be large – a short chapter at the beginning of the book, or rather a reworking of his introduction – would suffice to ease general readers into the debate on “two cultures” (he never actually deals with C.P. Snow’s thesis in depth here – a significant omission. Another issue is that this work is almost entirely Anglo-centric, with some mention of Antoine Lavoisier, Alexandre Charles, the Mongolfiers, and other French and German scientists. This Anglo-centrism is merited to a degree because of the key role played by Britain in the early Industrial and Scientific Revolutions. But at the same time, the reader can wonder how well Holmes’ interpretation of Romantic science translates to the broader European context. So, in closing, while this is a great book, it is not a standalone work. To extract full value from it, I would recommend looking at the back of the book, where Holmes provides a highly welcome background reading list. For anyone interested in modern political and intellectual history, some knowledge of Romanticism is a must and well worth acquiring. By the same token, some knowledge of either the sociology of science or the history and philosophy of science (these can be somewhat adversarial fields) will provide context for why it is important to understand how scientists actually practice their craft as well as the greater social context in which science takes place (see for instance Bruno Latour, Laboratory Life.) So, while I would recommend this book for anyone interested in science and early modern history, it is a book that provides greater rewards for external study than most. "
35,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"This book took me an unusually long time to finish, which at first I was inclined to blame on my own deficiencies. But by the time I finished the book, I was otherwise inclined. Quite simply, this book seemed to strive mightily to connect the major Romantic poets to some major Romantic-era scientists, but ultimately the author’s thesis fell flat for me. Granted, I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book, which focused on Joseph Banks’ voyages to Tahiti, the brother and sister astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, the African odyssey of Mungo Park, and the escapades of daredevil balloonists. Holmes does an admirable job of writing juicy mini-biographies of these and other personages, but, dazzled as I was by his eye for detail and ability to enable the reader to peer beneath his subjects’ skin, early on I found myself a bit baffled at why these disparate people were sharing space in the same volume. Then, in subsequent chapters, particularly those devoted to chemist/poet Humphrey Davy, I hit a wall. Davy, to me, was not nearly as engaging a person, despite his obvious brilliance and importance, but more to the point, at this point in the book the author begins to strain very hard to bring in connections to the Romantic poets. Davy was friends with Coleridge and wrote a great deal of (alas, not very good) poetry himself. Holmes quotes reams of Davy’s poetry (which I immediately learned to skim), as well as poetry by Coleridge, Keats, Byron and Shelley. And it was at this point that I sincerely wished that the author were NOT a specialist and biographer of the Romantic poets, for he strained so often and so hard to work in any poetic reference, however tangential, to science that I became quite impatient. His thesis.... well, I’m not entirely sure what it was, to be honest. (And hence my initial impulse to feel it was my fault as a reader, for surely there is a thesis?) Something about how the divisions between science and poetry/philosophy are artificial and that, indeed, we should endeavor to unite the two fields, which are both grounded in wonder.  But, gee, that’s an awfully broad net to cast, don’t you think? I’m afraid the result was a great deal of bycatch. Then, too, during the second half of the book, the discussion of Davy et al. becomes quite bogged down in the discussion of Davy’s various relationships (romantic and otherwise), the political wranglings of the Royal Society, and the rise or fall of various scientists’ reputations. The narrative became dense and hard to follow. However, I persisted to the end of the book, feeling that, surely, the author would tie all these disparate strands together for me in some cohesive way.No such luck. "
36,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn,4,"Interest and Science TogetherThis book is meant to emphasize that research and art go together and are inseparable. Holmes discusses how leisure time gave way to thought,involvement and art caused the scientific revolution a a is could not exist without the other. He uses examples from all over Europe and pulls stories out quite well. "
37,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"“Science is truly a relay race, with each discovery handed on to the next generation. Even as one door is closing, another door is already being thrown open. So it is with this book. For this, I believe science needs to be presented and explored in a new way. We need not only a new history of science, but a more enlarged and imaginative biographical writing about individual scientists. The old, rigid debates and boundaries — science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics — are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.”I am abashed at how much of this book I did not know, and am grateful that I do now. Slightly dry and scattered, it was hard to get through, not full of wonder but details, but worth the time. I wish there was a timeline, as the narrative moves all over the place, ostensibly chronologically but confusingly.The revolution of the time was an explosion of astronomy, chemistry, geology, exploration of the world, and changes in society “to the point that the greatest astronomer of the age would turn out to be an immigrant German musician (William Herschel and his sister!), the greatest chemist was the son of a Welsh ne’er-do-well (Humphry Davy), and a whole new branch of study—electromagnetism—would be founded by the son of a blacksmith (Michael Faraday). All these figures appear as characters in Holmes’ fascinating work, along with poets, novelists, explorers, aristocrats and even balloonists.” The scientist was also philosopher, and the lines were blurred. The author includes poetry that was inspired by the science, by Coleridge, Byron, Keats, and Shelley, and that adds a layer to the Ancient Mariner and other famous poems of the time that might be my favorite part of the book. I am reading The Second Mountain by David Brooks, and he writes of times in history when the moral ecology was changing, and Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael would say when Mother Culture gets more strident, and the frog in the boiling water doesn’t feel the heat yet. I can see the arc of time in this age of wonder, and how scientists of the time had an intense drive to be an individual, to achieve grand and stupendous things (telescopes to discover Uranus, mapping Africa, discovering potassium, etc) with recklessness and fearlessness. “Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration. These were Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world expedition aboard the Endeavour, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage to the Galapagos islands aboard the Beagle, begun in 1831. This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder, and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”I had always revered the Enlightenment Age so may have glossed over anything called Romantic, hence the ignorance. The author focuses on three Romantic themes: ballooning, global exploration and soul hunting along with the science. The author writes that far back in antiquity, “Plato argued that the notion of ‘wonder’ was central to all philosophical thought: ‘In Wonder all Philosophy began: in Wonder it ends…But the first Wonder is the Offspring of Ignorance; the last is the Parent of Adoration.’” This was quite lost during the rational Enlightenment and the Romantic poets put the wonder back into the science, and drew the lay people in to experience it. Can you imagine scads of modern poetry written about Carl Sagan or Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Like Wordsworth:Romantic traveller amidst the stars: And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The Antechapel where the Statue stood Of Newton, with his prism and his silent face, The marble index of a Mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.Wordsworth again:My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky; So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man...Epigraphs:He thought about himself, and the whole Earth, Of Man the wonderful, and of the Stars, And how the deuce they ever could have birth; And then he thought of Earthquakes, and of Wars, How many miles the Moon might have in girth, Of Air-balloons, and of the many bars To perfect Knowledge of the boundless Skies; And then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes. BYRON, Don Juan (1819)Those to whom the harmonious doors Of Science have unbarred celestial stores … WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ‘Lines Additional to an Evening Walk’ (1794)Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific … JOHN KEATS, ms of sonnet (1816)“Their minutely recorded telescope observations, published in over a hundred papers by the Royal Society, would change not only the public conception of the solar system, but of the whole Milky Way galaxy and the structure and meaning of the universe itself. It was immediately apparent that Herschel had created an instrument of unparalleled light-gathering power and clarity. He saw, for example, what very few astronomers even suspected: that the Pole Star — which had been the key to navigation, and the poet’s traditional emblem of steadiness and singularity, for centuries — was not in fact one star at all, but two stars.”“Surrounded by infinite space, and swallowed up in an immensity of being, man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean, mixed and confounded with the general mass. But from this situation, perplexing as it is, he endeavours to extricate himself; and by looking abroad into Nature, employs the powers she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.”“An unfathomably larger universe was steadily opening up, and this gradually transformed popular notions of the size and mystery of the world ‘beyond the heavens’Indeed, the very terms ‘world’, ‘heaven’ and ‘universe’ began to changetheir meanings. It was the psychological breakthrough that Kant had predicted in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens back in 1755: ‘We may cherish the hope that new plane is being uncovered.”Poetry from Erasmus Darwin celebrating the astronomical discoveries of Herschel:When Love Divine, with brooding wings unfurl’d, Call’d from the rude abyss the living World, ‘Let there be Light!’, proclaimed the Almighty Lord, Astonish’d Chaos heard the potent word; Through all his realms the kindling ether runs And the mass starts into a million Suns. Earths round each Sun with quick explosions burst, And second Planets issue from the first; Bend as they journey with projectile force, In bright ellipses their reluctant course; Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll, And form, self-balanced, one revolving whole. – Onward they move, amid their bright abode, Space.David Bourgeois both published handbooks to the science of flight in 1784. Bourgeois opened ecstatically: ‘The idea of taking to the air, of flying through sky, and navigating through the ether, has always appealed so strongly to mankind, that it has appeared in numerous classical legends and folktales from the remotest antiquity. The wings of Saturn, the eagle of Jupiter, the peacocks of Juno, the doves of Venus, the winged horses of the Sun all bear witness …’ By the end of 1784, the second year of the great balloon craze, no fewer than 181 manned ascents had been recorded, mostly in France and England.Jeffries also gave the first truly vivid account of the changing appearance of the ground as seen ‘from a bird’s eye view, as it is called’. This too was constantly surprising. As they took off, there was the white sea of upturned faces in the city squares, swiftly reduced to tiny, unrecognisable points. There was the unearthly silence, the sense of their own motionlessness as the earth seemed to revolve below the basket. Though they did not appear to move, their compass needle steadily turned. Below them, the earth appeared transformed. There was the strange flattening out of hills and buildings, the emergence of previously unsuspected patterns in the foliage of woods, or the cultivation marks in fields, or the branching streets of a town. There was the constantly delusive appearance of clouds, and sudden showers of rain or even snowflakes. (No electrical charges were recorded, much to Jeffries’ relief.) The whole world became ‘like a beautifully coloured map or carpet’Wordsworth began his poem Peter Bell (1798) with a playful image of flying in a sort of dirigible airship, or balloon boat. There’s something in a flying Horse, There’s something in a huge Balloon: But through the Clouds I’ll never float Until I have a little Boat Shaped like the crescent-Moon … Away we go! — and what care we For treason, tumults, and for wars? We are as calm in our Delight As is the crescent-Moon so bright Among the scattered Stars.Perhaps Shelley put it best:‘The balloon has not yet received the perfection of which it is surely capable; the art of navigating the air is in its first and most helpless infancy; the aerial mariner still swims on bladders, and has not yet mounted the rude raft … It would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned. It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa? — Why do we not despatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction, and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon, which a vertical sun would project precisely underneath it, as it glided over that hitherto unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.’This method of viewing the galaxies (‘to continue the simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom’) presented the entire universe in a new kind of light, with the most radical implications. ‘The heavens are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions, in different flourishing beds … and we can extend the range of our experience [of them] to an immense duration.’Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that ‘deep space’ must also imply ‘deep time’. He wrote in his Preface: A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past … [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand — that is — almost two million years on their way.’ The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great dealof explanation to the layman.Keats likens his own discovery of Homer’s poetry to the experience of the great astronomer and the great explorer finding new worlds. … Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific — and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise – Silent upon a peak in Darien.Herschel also mentioned applying Newton’s theories for measuring the speed of solar light to ‘inconceivably distant bodies’ in the stellar system, with unimaginable results. ‘Then speaking of himself, he said with a modesty of manner that quite overcame me, when taken with the greatness of the assertion: “I have looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars of which the light, it can be proved, must have taken millions of years to reach the earth.”’Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably ‘ceased to exist’ millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. ‘The light did travel after the body was gone.’Banks was soon sponsoring small but highly adventurous expeditions into Egypt and the horn of Africa. Its motives at this stage were scientific and commercial, with no missionary or colonial intentions. Its primary aim was discovery, not conquest. This would change once Banks was appointed to the Privy Council in 1797, and became ever more closely involved in prosecuting the war against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then all exploration took on a more political and frankly imperial significance. Yet Africa and Australia always fascinated Banks for their own sake.Explorer Mungo Park: “At this moment, painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small moss in fructification, irresistibly caught my eye. I mention this to show from what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive consolation; for though the whole plant was not larger than the top of one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves, and capsula, without admiration.’ In that moment of pure scientific wonder, Park’s thoughts and outlook were transformed: ‘Can the Being (thought I) who planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed?”Shelley’s wilderness, while it includes ‘dark Aethiopia in her desert hills’, is geographically vague, though it moves more towards India and an imaginary East. But he catches something of Mungo Park’s enigmatic wanderlust, and transforms it into an unearthly Miltonic quest for the strange and magnificent limits of the known world: The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, And o’er the aerial mountains which pour down Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, In joy and exultation held his way; Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched His languid limbs.I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air …To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling … A mind that has once imbibed a taste for scientific enquiry has within itself an inexhaustible source of pure and exciting contemplations. One would think that Shakespeare had such a mind in view when he describes a contemplative man finding Tongues in trees — books in the running brooks Sermons in stones — and good in everything Where the uninformed and unenquiring eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he walks in the midst of wonders. It is intriguing that Herschel was quoting from Shakespeare’s As You Like .."
38,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This is a fascinating account of the growth of science in Romantic Age of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Holmes looks at the period through the lives of ground-breaking scientists, and illuminates the intersections between science, literature, and art during the period.Among the scientists discussed in detail are Joseph Banks, William and Caroline Herschel, Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday, and a collection of truly nutty but ground-breaking (or is that, and ground-breaking) balloonists.One of the most engaging aspects of science in this period is that it was all new enough that any smart, interested person with some (not necessarily large) resources could potentially make an important contribution. Joseph Banks was educated as a botanist, and made one of his greatest contributions with detailed and insightful anthropological observations of the Tahitians. William Herschel was trained as a musician, and his sister Caroline barely educated at all; they became prominent astronomers who made major contributions to the study of the heavens. Michael Faraday was a bookseller who was hired by Humphrey Davy as a lab assistant. Some of these men were born wealthy; some were not. None started out on the path where they made their greatest contributions.Joseph Banks accompanied James Cook on the first of his voyages to the south Pacific, as a naturalist, the same role in which Charles Darwin later sailed on the HMS Beagle. A major purpose of that voyage was to observe an eclipse of the sun that would be visible in Tahiti. While Banks did a great deal of botany while he was in Tahiti, he also made extensive and detailed observations of the Tahitians, differing from most of his fellow British by being open to--indeed, becoming deeply involved in, the Tahitian culture. Initially friendly relations with the Tahitians soured as Cook and others, unable or unwilling to let go of their own preconceptions, repeatedly offended them. After they left Tahiti, the voyage deteriorated further, with conflicts, epidemic illness, and death. The survivors, including Cook and Banks, arrived back in Britain devastated and took months to recover. Still a young man at this point, Banks was at the beginning of his career, and remained a major force in British science for decades to come--but less as a scientist himself, rather as the president of the Royal Society, guiding and encouraging the scientific careers of others.With Banks' story setting the framework, we see the Herschels start out as a musician and his singer/housekeeper sister and become two of the most important astronomers of the age, Davy beginning as a medical student and transforming into a chemist and engineer, and then into a mystical, visionary writer. We see the beginnings of true specialization in science, and the founding of the first subject-specialized science professional associations, separate from the Royal Society, which had, and still sought, to encompass them all. We see, also, the connections and interactions between the scientists and the writers and artists of the age, including Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats.It's a fascinating story, and I promise I have not even scratched the surface of it. Holmes seeks to reveal character as well as accomplishments, and show the ways in which the romantic sensibility, which we generally thing of as antithetical to science, in fact inspired and encouraged the Romantic Age scientists.Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from the local library."

He falls head over heels in love with William Herschel’s sister Caroline, so essential to Hershel’s exploration of the heavens through a series of homemade telescopes, the only kind of telescope to be had at the time. The story of Humphrey Davy inventing the safety lamp that saved so many coal miners’ lives is so real he might have been an eyewitness, including all the times Davy blows up at Michael Faraday, not to mention all the times he blows up his lab. 	Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats were fascinated and inspired by these new scientific explorations and discoveries, and employed many of them as images in their work. There is a whole chapter on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, where Holmes traces the Monster’s beginnings to lectures given at the Royal Society in London, which Shelley attended and which included the attempt by one philosopher to use a primitive form of electricity to shock a corpse back to life. Eeew. 	Holmes writes of what may have been our most polymathic age in deft and witty prose. Of Herschel, an accomplished musician as well as an astronomer, he writes, “He moved from earthly music to the music of the spheres.” He writes demurely of the balloon ascension of a Mr. Biggin and a Mrs. Sage, which may or may not have given birth to the Mile High Club. He quotes a contemporary critic as saying, somewhat apologetically, “Poetical descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid principles of the Science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple unadorned language.” 	And then Holmes lets Keats underline the point,  …Then felt I like some watcher of the skies	When a new planet swims into his ken...	That watcher of the skies was Herschel. And the new planet? Uranus."
40,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027264-monika,5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. What strikes me most about Holmes is his ability to weave together what modern man has learned to compartmentalize- the sciences and the humanities. Before science was ""science,"" it was natural philosophy. Before scientists were ""scientists,"" they were natural philosophers and poets. Richard Holmes brings science and art back together in order to tell the story of how the late eighteenth century produced the foundation of what would become modern science. Framing the book with the story of Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who took part in Captain Cook's expedition to Tahiti later becoming the president of the Royal Society, Holmes moves to William Herschel, the musician and amateur astronomer who would discover Uranus with a telescope of his own making, and his sister, Caroline, who herself was responsible for discovering several comets. From the Herschel's the story moves to Mungo Parks and his travels to Africa and mapping of the Congo, followed by Sir Humphry Davy, who many believe is the founder of modern chemistry.What makes this book a wonder, however, is the pervasive spirit of inquiry of the age. Whereas now we seem to accept platitudes like ""I'm good at English, so I must not be good at math,"" this age embraced the idea that the only way to express the wonder of science is through poetry, literature, and the arts. Poets like Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley attended lectures from the great thinkers of the age, then expressed the same concerns about man's place in the world as the men who gave the lectures. What a time it must have been... human curiosity leading to unimaginable discoveries, discoveries that would forever alter the way we view our place in the universe... and such is the terror. To borrow from Carl Jung, this period marked the dawning of our self-awareness as a species in a universe that very quickly became immeasurably large and unimaginably old. Suddenly, we became ants in an ant farm instead of products of some intelligent design... Richard Holmes captures the complexities of the period in a most poetic way. I will be coming back to this book many times."
41,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779830-andrew,3,"I forgot about this book until I saw it again here. My father sent this book to me a few years ago. I enjoyed learning about the various people, scientists as well as non-scientists. I like that Holmes gives so much detail about, for instance, the grinding of the mirror for the telescope. And how it was paid for. For me, the book would be just as enjoyable if it was a collection of anecdotes and free of any speculation as to whether or how the literature and paintings of the time may or may not have influenced the scientists of that time. Holmes undertakes the great challenge of finding connections between Romantic notions and the scientific pursuits of those times. I really don't see how such connections can be made without knowing the biographies of the scientists well enough to know the extent of their interest in Romantic notions. That can be hard to know for anyone. I did enjoy learning that S.T. Coleridge was solicited to join a convention of people doing science, at least partly for the purpose of helping to choose a word to apply to the people who do science. As a result of this convention, the word scientist came into general use. It seemed to me that, of all the regard these scientists had for Romantic notions, Holmes related more about Humphry Davies' than any other. "
42,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/392337-sarah,5,"This is an amazing book. It doesn't have as much to do with literary Romanticism as I had originally hoped, but by the end of the first chapter I didn't care. Holmes is an excellent writer, and he makes the excitement and amazement of the scientists and explorers he profiles live. I think my favorite sections are the ones that deal with Joseph Banks, who went on a scientific voyage to Tahiti as a young man and, despite a successful career as a botanist in England, mentor to many younger scientists, and long-time president of the Royal Society, never seems to have found anything that moved him in the same way as Tahiti. To some extent, this book is a series of linked biographies: Banks, astronomer William Herschel and his sister Caroline, Sir Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday. Holmes is also very good at drawing out the political (whether national competition over who should be credited with discoveries or in-fighting over who should lead the various scientific societies) and philosophical (German Romantic writers and Coleridge make appearances here) implications of the scientific discoveries involved. It's not often a book is so informative, gripping, and well written all at once. "
43,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,4,"This was the first book assigned for my new semester, which means I'm going back to reading school stuff round the clock again, but luckily this first one was a great one. It's really a combined biography of Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Science, explorer of Tahiti), William Herschel (discovered Uranus), and Humphrey Davy (experimented with nitrous oxide, and also became President of Royal Society), along with a couple of other secondary stories. The best is probably the history behind Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, tracing it to the debates about the existence of a cosmic ""vitalist"" force, a debate that originated in the circle of German ""nature philosopher"" Frederich Schelling.The book was probably too long though, and plodded through parts of Herschel's and Davy's biographies (especially Davy's atrocious poetry), but it does do a great job showing how the worlds of Romantic literature and early modern science interacted. One takeaway, they all loved Coleridge."
44,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43247-emi-bevacqua,3,"This book is kind of the ultimate departure from my personal comfort zone: nearly 500 pages on the history of western science juxtaposed with poetry. Richard Holmes is an amazing researcher and writer, he really brings the age to life and I loved the beautiful color art inserts. The first section was very straightforward, about the young explorer Joseph Banks and his discoveries in Tahiti; in the next we meet a young astronomist that Banks discovered, named William Herschel and also his sister-assistant Caroline. Then with each chapter and introduction to subsequent scientists the reader is keeping track of more and more complexity, collegial scientists and poets, their discoveries and published work, their travels, and family relations! Throughout it all - anthropology, cosmology, flight, mesmerism, chemistry - the unifying thread is the history of the Royal Society of London scientists, led for the most part by Joseph Banks. My favorite quote is when somebody asks ""What's the use of a (hot air) balloon?"" and Benjamin Franklin responds, ""What's the use of a newborn baby?"" "

Everyone raves about this book - so far I am finding it choppy, hard to read, all over the map and not particularly well-written. Holmes's penchant for including every detail of everything he ever read about his subjects is exhausting - a better writer would take the trouble to pare things down in the service of a more readable narrative. Part of my disappointment so far is that I didn't find Joseph Banks, the subject of the first 70 pages, a particularly engaging or interesting character. His major contribution to scientific progress appears to have been to bring back a bunch of specimens from Tahiti, a fundamentally pedestrian activity. Darwin's voyage on The Beagle was interesting because of how he subsequently synthesized his observations - Banks is a far duller character, no matter how many natives he slept with.Maybe things will pick up with Herschel and Davy."

We need to understand how science is actually made; how scientists themselves think and feel and speculate. We need to explore what makes scientists creative, as well as poets or painters, or musicians. That is how this book began. The old, rigid debates and boundaries -- science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics -- are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.
The Age of Wonder isn't quite the book I expected it to be: I was looking forward to a lot of science, which I find intriguing, but I found this work to be laden down with a lot of biographical information, which I find to be less so. The Romantic Period must have been an astonishing time to be alive, indeed an Age of Wonder; a time when any amateur, even a foreign musician like William Herschel, with enough curiosity and funds could literally point out new discoveries in the self-same night sky humans had been regarding for millennia. A privileged young man, like Joseph Banks, could buy himself passage on a voyage of discovery under Captain Cook and, in the process of collecting botanical specimens from Tahiti, invent the new field of Anthropology. Science, at the beginning of this period, was accessible and democratic: a barely educated young man, like Humphrey Davy, was able to wrest the study of the elements from the grip of the Alchemists and properly begin the discipline of Chemistry -- no longer searching for how to transmute the impossible, Davy (et al) did simple experiments to discover what does happen. Imagine a time when that was revolutionary thinking. Imagine if there were still basic discoveries to be made in nature; discoveries waiting to be plucked like low hanging fruit.I was delighted by the intersections between Science and Literature and Philosophy; how each informed the others; how so many of these early Scientists not only rubbed elbows with the likes of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Byron, but also expressed their own amazement in well-regarded verse. This also worked in reverse, with the great poets of the age attending scientific lectures in order to learn the terminology, the great metaphors of the day -- could this possibly be happening today?This book is exhaustive, and ultimately, I found that to be…exhausting. The following is more for my own memory than part of a proper review (and as I would probably advise anyone reading this review to just end here, I'm going to hide it all as a spoiler).(view spoiler)[I was charmed by Banks in Tahiti, and appreciated all of the primary source materials that were provided (the personal letters and journals and articles that filled in the big picture, that made the age come alive), but in some later sections these additions felt gossipy and a bit pointless. My favourite part from Tahiti: On their last day they discovered an enormous stone 'marai' or funeral monument, shaped like a pyramid, some forty-four feet high and nearly 300 feet wide, with steps of superbly polished white coral down both sides. This, the 'masterpiece' of Tahitian architecture on the island, was unsettling to Banks because its construction seemed technically inexplicable. 'It is beyond belief that Indians could raise so large a structure without the assistance of Iron tools to shape their stones or mortar to join them.'Not far away was another mystery: a huge wicker man constructed of basketwork, evidently for some obscure sacrificial rite. 'The whole was neatly covered with feathers, white to represent skin and black to represent hair and tattow.' I love stuff like that, and yes, I watch Ancient Aliens: not because I believe extraterrestrials built this curious 'marai', but because I revel in the mystery of these sorts of ancient structures and monuments and that show has a new one for me every week. Because of the noted intersections with literature, I was jotting down the books I was reminded of as I was reading. For this section, it was : Jamrach's Menagerie, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Unfamiliar Fishes (and how sad to note the evolution of Captain Cook from his empathetic treatment of the Tahitians to his brutality towards the Hawaiins), Parrot and Olivier in America, Moby Dick.I enjoyed the first section on William Herschel, but again, the biographical information was simply overwhelming -- I would have much preferred a general overview of his life in Hanover before emigrating to England and found no benefit at all in the biographies of his family members other than Caroline. When the book revisited the Herchels later -- more of the same and more of the same plus the details of his marriage and family -- I was seriously bored. I suppose the fact that his son, John, went on to become a leading figure in the Victorian Age of Science explains why we must follow William to the grave, but that wasn't what I wanted from this book (which I understand is a fault of my own, not the author). Since Caroline was profoundly affected by the Lisbon earthquake, I was put in mind of Candide and also of Frankenstein (not realising this book would be quoted at great length later).I was amused by the section on ballooning, and appreciate how at the time it must have seemed like the dawn of the Jetsons with their flying cars, but since in the end it was dismissed as a fad, more suited to carnivals than scientific study, I don't know that it belonged in this book. I did like this part: Benjamin Franklin, American Ambassador in Paris, watched the launch (of the first manned balloon flight) through a telescope from the window of his carriage. Afterwards he remarked: 'Someone asked me -- what's the use of a balloon? I replied - what's the use of a newborn baby?'Obvious choices, but I was reminded of Around the World in Eighty Days and The Wizard of Oz.Age of Wonder picked up (after another dull visit with the Herchels) when it told the thrilling story of Mongo Park and his two expeditions to find the source of the Niger in Africa. While the first trip was pure adventurism, the second smacked of imperialism, and it was probably due to his own self-important beliefs that he failed to pay due respect to the local tribes and was never seen again. Literary tie-ins: Heart of Darkness (for which Park was likely the inspiration for Kurtz), and because so much of this book takes place during the Napoleonic years and the war between France and Britain, A Tale of Two Cities.Humphrey Davy was a Poet and Chemist who experimented on himself with Nitrous Oxide, like a Timothy Leary for his time, without making the leap to its use in surgery. (A later section on the mastectomy that Fanny Burney endured without benefit of anesthetic made for a harrowing reading experience, but it was one more event that I wasn't certain belonged in what I thought this book was meant to be). Davy then made the leap to the study of Galvinism, and this sparked the great debates about Vitalism and ""is there an animating principle"" -- a soul? -- in humans, the great parlour discussion topic of the time, and that led to the first inklings of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This was interesting, but the very lengthy quoting from the book and its reception by the public and the stage play that came later -- all of this seemed beside the point to me. As was Davy's disintegrating marriage and political dealings with the Royal Academy of Science and his ""little nurse in Illyria"" -- so much biography, so little actual science. I did, however, appreciate when Davy put his mind to creating a safety-lamp for miners -- his great effort to demonstrate that science was for the benefit of mankind; theory that may be put into practise. The literary tie-ins at this point were all poetry: Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Prometheus Unbound.  (hide spoiler)]Okay, so after that long stretch of what was interesting and not so interesting to me, I return to Richard Holme's quote that I started with, the bit he actually ended with, and specifically:  Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. How many of us have this hope and wonder? I don't know that I believe the scientists of today are imbued with hope and wonder; that they are philosophical about their work; that they have the creative souls of artists. But perhaps I'm wrong and I thank Age of Wonder for forcing me to think of Science in this way.I wanted to love this book, but it was ultimately brought down by the immensity of the information it contained -- had it left out the society news and letters from home, I might have enjoyed it much more. "
47,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23672960-brian-willis,5,"Conventional wisdom places the scientific and rational achievements of the Age of Enlightenment in direct opposition to the fundamental values of the age of Romanticism in the arts. Poetry and art exuberantly shifted from an emphasis on cold rationality and collective achievement as well as logical procedures of the calculating mind towards exploration of the sentimentality of the human spirit, the individual within the natural world, and the subconscious. In other words, the movement was from the visible (or that which could be explained through rational observation) towards explaining the invisible (the interior subjective human self, the passions, the drives, and impulses that cannot be explained through science, at least in that era).Richard Holmes, perhaps the great living biographer of the Romantic era presents us with a multi-part biography of the scientists that influenced the Romantics, but instead of playing the party line of this dialectic, he demonstrates that the Romantic Era existed INFUSED with the spirit of exploration of the science of the age. Beginning with Sir Joseph Banks, he explains the foundation of the Royal Society. Then he divides a large part of the book following and documenting the life and achievements of Sir William Herschel and Sir Humphrey Davy. Herschel made his fame discovering Uranus, but Holmes argues effectively that his development of advanced telescopes as well as a method towards cataloguing the night sky were influential for future generations. One of the unsung heroes of the book is Caroline Herschel, his sister, who actually become the first patronized and influential female astronomer. Davy expanded our knowledge of natural gases and their containment, most effectively with his staggering safety lamp for miners. Other topics discussed are the passion for tales of the exploits of explorer Mungo Park and the origination of aerial flight through hot air ballooning. Holmes ties these achievements into the ongoing saga of the leading Romantics, particularly their encounters with Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley, and Keats (with Wordsworth gliding in the background and occasionally making an appearance). He points out moments in their compositions that reference the achievements of Banks, the Herschels, Davy, Park, Sadler, and many others. As the Romantics ascended, the reputation of science seems to have retroactively been placed into competition with the values of the age of Romanticism and later Victorianism. The Romantics grappled with the same issues that the scientists did however; the revelations of the cosmos and the sanctity of particles in observation of tiny objects were revealing the same troubling conclusions for both scientists and poets. If there are uncountable galaxies, is it ludicrous to think that Christ was crucified millions of times to redeem the universe? Surprisingly, this hint at atheism backfired on scientists and their reputation for years to come while Romantics with their celebration of pagan values and occasionally an atheist or two, somehow escaped the judgement of posterity though facing criticism in their time. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, inspired by the electrical current experimentation of Galvani, was interpreted as a condemnation of the limits of science (though that was not Shelley's intent).In the end, Holmes writes an incredibly enlightening and informative group biography, argues for the art of biography as a window into the discovery process of science, and demonstrates that these scientists not only created the profession of scientist but also the groundwork for the scientific method, as eventually perfected by Charles Darwin (who also makes an appearance). Another triumph from one of my favorite writers."
48,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16010931-douglass-gaking,5,"The Age of Wonder is a solid history of British scientists in the Romantic era. It focuses on the individual scientists' lives, their experiments, their writings–both personal and published–and their connections to each other.Scientists in focus include Joseph Banks, William Herschel, Michael Faraday, and even the fictional Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Each chapter is as in-depth as a biography.I especially like the chapter on William Herschel. I had not realized how close he came to our current understanding of the construction of the universe, despite being formally trained as a musician, and self-taught as a scientist.My main takeaway from this book is how imaginative these scientists were. Whether it is believing in the chemical nature of the soul or the existence of life on the moon, they had wild theories that certainly fit in with the sentiment of the Romantic era. While so many of these hypothesis proved to be false, whether in their lifetimes or later, it is the pursuit of proving them through experimentation that advanced human knowledge into the modern age."
49,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8355999-betsy,4,"This is an engrossing book about the development of science during the late 18th and early 19th century. It focuses on four individuals, Joseph Banks, (explorer and driving force behind the Royal Society for many years) Caroline and William Herschel (sister and brother astronomers) and Humphry Davy (chemist). Two things stand out from the rest for me. First, the author discussed women's roles in science and the role of Caroline Herschel in particular. She was the first woman awarded a stipend by the King for her astronomical work (albeit at half the rate a man would have received). Second, I was surprised by the strong overlap of science and poetry. Many of the scientists were published poets, including Herschel and Davy and many of the poets were also active in the sciences (Coleridge and Wordsworth among others).At almost 500 pages the book dragged in a few places, particularly when the author was describing societal trends rather than giving biographies of the various scientists and poets. But, all in all, well worth the time it took to read it."
50,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11684178-lauren-barr,5,"There is something about the age of exploration that I find fascinating and, yes, incredibly romantic. It makes me wish I lived in the Victorian ages just so I could go here these talks on nascent principles and ideas, no matter how off they were in the long run. In my Victorian fantasies I’m super rich and, apparently, male. But just reading about these explorers, these astronomers, these scientists developing these wonderful inventions and ideas that went on to better the world … it’s heady stuff. At times the book is a bit dry, but for the most part the subject matter is so rich you get entirely wrapped up in it."

Starting with Joseph Banks, it is ideal for anyone interested in the intellectual impact of James Cook's voyages, and takes the reader onwards into the marvellous scientific discoveries of the age, through the lives of some of the discoverers (known names, but not necessarily the ones we know most about). Very enjoyable and marvellously informative."

57,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24591006-april,4,"I enjoyed hearing the backstories of these famous men of science and discovery. It's enlightening to understand their motivation for their actions. The author was also very interested in literary pursuits of the scientists, analyzing and interpreting their poetry. I liked that philosophical men of science felt encouraged to write their own poetry. I don't believe that is the case very often nowadays.This was such a dense read. It took me a long time to get through it, not because it was poorly written or boring, but because there was so much information to absorb on each page. And each page was equally as interesting as it was dense.""To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling ... a soap bubble ... an apple ... a pebble ... He walks in the midst of wonders."" - John Herschel, A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1830). pg. xiii""But while Cook clung to the necessity of European forms and discipline, Banks was rather inclined to dwell on the superfluity of European needs. These were perhaps the reflections of a man who had always been used to wealth and comforts. 'From them appear how small are the real wants of human nature, which we Europeans have increasd to an excess which would certainly appear incredible to these people could they be told it. Nor shall we cease to increase them as long as Luxuries can be invented and riches found for the purchase of them; and how soon these Luxuries degenerate into necessaries may be sufficiently evincd by the universal use of strong liquors, Tobacco, spices, Tea &c. &c.'"" pg. 39""Riding between musical engagements, from one remote provincial northern town to another, often crossing over the moors alone at night, he found himself studying the panoply of stars overhead as he had done as a boy. He became well acquainted with the moon, and would later write that at this time he had intended 'to fix upon the moon for my habitation.' He also later told several tales about these lonely rides, one being how on one occasion he was reading so intently that when his horse stumbled and threw him, he somersaulted over its head and landed upright still holding his book in his hand, a perfect demonstration of the Newtonian law of 'circular motion.'"" pg. 74""Characteristically, Pilatre ignored these protests, and calmly went on telling d'Arlandes to work at feeding the brazier. He himself took off his bright green topcoat (put on for the crowd), rolled up his sleeves, and went on throwing on straw till his wooden fork broke. Once, when d'Arlandes was desperately shouting at him, 'We must go down! We must go down!,' Pilatre called back soothingly: 'Look d'Arlandes. Here we are above Paris. There's no possible danger for you. Are you taking this all in?' Many witnesses later said that they could hear the two men shouting excitedly to each other as they passed overhead. They assumed they were describing the glories of flight."" pg. 130""It was a glorious pink-and-yellow, candy-coloured balloon, thirty feet tall, and the crowd loved it. The wickerwork basket, a sort of chaise longue for two, was completely festooned with flags and bunting. Dr Charles had a full payload of scientific equipment aboard--mercury barometer (which was used as an early form of altimeter), thermometer, telescope, sand bags and several bottles of champagne."" pg. 131""Surprisingly, balloons did not appeal to the gothic novelist Horace Walpole, though perhaps at sixty-six he was a little old for such perilous novelties. He thought balloons might be sinister: 'Well! I hope these new mechanic meteors will prove only playthings for the learned and idle, and not be converted into new engines of destruction to the human race--as is so often the case of refinements or discoveries in Science. The wicked wit of man always studies to apply the results of talents to enslaving, destroying, or cheating his fellow creatures. Could we reach the moon, we should think of reducing it to a province of some European kingdom.' It was an ominous prophecy."" pg. 135To note: What we Americans call the Revolutionary War, the British call the American War of Independence. pg. 147""Ballooning added to this new awareness of the complexity and subtlety of clouds, a growing Romantic preoccupation which can be followed in the paintings of Turner and Constable, the notebooks of Coleridge and the poetry of Shelley. When Shelley refers to 'the locks of the approaching storm' in his 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819), he is using Howard's definition cirrus. 'The Cloud' (1820) demonstrates a remarkably accurate and scientific understanding of cloud formation and the convection cycle. Goethe wrote a number of essays on clouds, atmospheric pressures and weather, and translated passages of Howard, asking him to compose and send his Autobiography to Germany, and describing him as 'the first to define conceptually the airy and ever-changing forms of clouds, thus delimiting and fixing what had always been ephemeral and intangible, by accurate observation and naming.'"" pg. 160""Clouds became fascinating both as scientific phenomena--the generators of electricity, the mysterious indicators of winds and changing air pressure--and as aesthetic phenomena: the 'moods' of the sky reflecting those of the observer, alterations of light over landscape, symbols of change, destruction, regeneration. It could be argued that the Romantics actually invented the idea of 'the weather' itself, as it now preoccupies us; as well, of course, as 'inner weather.'"" pg. 160""Ballooning produced a new, and wholly unexpected, vision of the earth. It had been imagined that it would reveal the secrets of the heavens above, but in fact it showed the secrets of the world beneath. The early aeronauts suddenly saw the earth as a giant organism, mysteriously patterned and unfolding, like a living creature. For the first time the impact of man on nature was clearly revealed: the ever-expanding relationship of towns to countryside, roads to rivers, cultivated fields to forests, and the development of industry. It was comparable to the first views of the earth from space by the Apollo astronauts in the 1960s, producing a new concept of a 'single blue planet' with its delicate membrane of atmosphere. The famous photograph 'Earthrise' was taken from lunar orbit in December 1968."" pg. 161""As he grew older, Herschel was becoming a remoter figure in the household. His mind was ranging through the universe. His later papers for the Royal Society had begun to show an increasing awareness of the philosophical significance of astronomy. This was something urged upon him by his old supporter William Watson, who looked forward to conversations 'on Kant's metaphysics,' and wished to know how far Herschel agreed with the 'ground and sources' of Kant's philosophy of knowledge."" pg. 203""Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that 'deep space' must also imply 'deep time.' He wrote in his Preface: 'A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past ... [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand--that is--almost two million years on their way.' The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great deal of explanation to the layman."" pg. 203""Herschel continued to reach carefully towards the idea of an evolving universe, a concept as radical in its eventual implications as Erasmus Darwin's notion of evolution within plants and animals. In a late paper published in 1811, 'Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens,' Herschel further developed the idea . . . that all nebulae and large star clusters were at particular points in their sidereal life-cycles, which could be visually identified and catalogued almost in a Linnaean manner. Their characteristic shapes suggested distinct moments of youth, maturing and ageing."" pg. 204""It presented the universe as a living, growing, organic entity, with all nebulae belonging to one enormous extended family: 'There is not so much difference between them, if I may use the comparison, as there would be in an annual description of the human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a man in his prime.' This comparison is an intriguing premonition of 'time-lapse' photography, now one of the most powerful illustrative tools of modern natural history."" pg. 204-205""Physical vision--one might say scientific vision--brings about a metaphysical shift in the observer's view of reality as a whole. The geography of the earth, or the structure of the solar system, are in an instant utterly changed, and forever. The explorer, the scientific observer, the literary reader, experience the Sublime: a moment of revelation into the idea of the unbounded, the infinite."" pg. 207""At all events, it was clear that the Milky Way 'cannot last forever'; and equally that 'its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.' It followed that neither the earth, nor even the solar system, was a separate creation, but merely an infinitesimal part of a galactic evolution. Our galaxy had a physical beginning, and would have a physical conclusion. Our solar system, our planet, and hence our whole civilisation would have an ultimate and unavoidable end."" pg. 209""Campbell recalled that he felt he had been 'conversing with a supernatural intelligence.' Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably 'ceased to exist' millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. 'The light did travel after the body was gone.' After leaving Herschel, Campbell walked onto the shingle of Brighton beach, gazing out to sea, feeling 'evelvated and overcome.' He was reminded of Newton's observation that he was just a child picking up shells on the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay all before him."" pg. 210""It is evident that the death of his father, and all the subsequent emotional upheavals, profoundly shook the sixteen-year-old Davy, and started an intellectual ferment that never left him. Besides writing poetry, he also started his first diary, set himself reading lists and work timetables, and began a series of essays on religion versus materialism. During 1796 he wrote an essay 'On Mathematics,' and another 'On Consciousness,' which gleefully explored the implications of materialism. He described the body as 'a fine tuned Machine,' and wrote a syllogistic proof that the 'soul' could not exist, since it was said to be eternal and 'unchangeable,' while every known part of the human body, including the brain, was temporary and changed perpetually. 'QED the soul does not exist.'"" pg. 243""One of Burney's many extraordinary reflections was whether extreme physical pain could not only induce unconsciousness--'I have two total chasms in my memory of this transaction'--but actually force the soul out of the body. She also found that the act of recollection carried its own pain, and that she had taken three months to complete the account, as a letter of nearly 10,000 words to her sister Esther. She had severe headaches every time she tried to go on with it. Once finished, she could not look back over what she had written. 'I dare not revise, nor read, the recollection is still so painful.' It is an astonishing record of courage, not least in Fanny's determination to protect her husband from the trauma of the operation. But it also recalls what the real conditions of surgery were at this period."" pg. 306""But speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical ideas of Friedrich Schelling and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine, perhaps best translated as 'science mysticism,' defined the entire natural world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity as a series of 'polarities.' According to Schelling's doctrine, the whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical objects 'aspired' to become something higher. There was a 'world-soul' constantly 'evolving' higher life forms and 'levels of consciousness' in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards a higher state."" pg. 315""Davy's notebooks for this period also suggest a new pattern of philosophical speculation, almost approaching German Naturphilosophie. Some of his observations would have been recognised by Coleridge: 'The aspirations for immortality are movements of the mind similar to those which a bird makes with its wings before they are furnished with feathers.' Others were more closely tied to his laboratory work. On the subject of scientific 'analogy,' for instance, he wondered if there was a wider principle at work. 'Probably there is an analogy in all existence: the divided tail of the fish is linked in a long succession of like objects with the biped man. In the planetary system it is probable man will be found connected with a higher intellectual nature; and it is possible that the monad, or soul, is constantly undergoing a series of progressions.'"" pg. 357""In November 1827 Davy returned briefly to London to resign his presidency of the Royal Society. He later gave a moving glimpse of his disillusion with his own scientific career on this sad return: 'In my youth, and through the prime of manhood, I never entered London without feelings of pleasure and hope. It was to me as the grand theatre of intellectual activity, the field of every species of enterprise and exertion, the metropolis of the world of business, thought, and action ... I now entered the great city in a very different tone of mind, one of settled melancholy ... My health was gone, my ambition was satisfied, I was no longer excited by the desire of distinction; what I regarded most tenderly [my mother], was in the grave ... My cup of life was no longer sparkling, sweet, and effervescent ... it has become bitter.' In a wonderfully sardonic aside, Davy added that this metaphor of the 'cup of life' was scientifically derived from the chemical fermentation of 'the juice of the grape,' and then after a certain lapse of time, its oxidisation and acidification."" pg. 419""Babbage perhaps intended a sort of parable of science for the new generation. His story went as follows. When Babbage first peered carefully at the shimmering solar image projected through Herschel's prism, he could not see these dark Fraunhofer lines, though he knew they were there. Herschel then commented to him: 'An object is frequently not seen, from not knowing how to see it, rather than from any deficit in the organ of vision ... I will instruct you how to see them.' After some time spent re-examining and refocusing the image, Babbage could see them perfectly. The point was that science must always be more than the simple observation of phenomena or data. It was simultaneously a subjective training in observation skills, self-criticism and interpretation: a complete education. This was of course precisely what William Herschel had said forty years before, about learning to see with a telescope."" pg. 440Book: borrowed from the SSF Main Library."

64,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,5,"In writing this review, I am keeping in mind that an old and very dear friend of mine (who has read and liked this book) is highly interested in my evaluation. I mention this because it leads to an important point about the book: the background of the reader will strongly determine what he or she gets out of reading The Age of Wonder. For my part, I approach this work as a sociologist who is currently (fall 2013) preparing to take a doctoral exam in the sociology of science. Hence, I already have some grounding in this field and I will use this book as deep background for my own work in science and technology studies.To extract the maximum value from this work, the reader will need some knowledge of Romanticism and the history and philosophy of science – in particular the “two cultures” debate deriving from C.P. Snow’s famous work of that name. This is not to say that this book is entirely useless to the reader lacking such a background, but it will be more difficult for the reader to grasp the overall argument, as Holmes does not provide such contextualization. However, his skills as a biographer are so good that the reader can derive enormous value simply reading the book as a set of biographical vignettes and it would not be a waste of time.  However, the core of Holmes’ work involves an extended critique of the notion that art and science are invariably at odds. Holmes’ objective is to show that this tension is largely a product of Late Romanticism (early 19th Century) and in sociological terms is very much a cultural and political “project”. Indeed, Holmes provides compelling evidence not only that science and art are not inherently adversarial but that in Early Romanticism the two were deeply interconnected and (Holmes argues) drew strength from each other. Hence the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) was not only a Romantic author but worked with Humphry Davy (the chemist) and conducted experiments with prisms in Germany. Davy for his part wrote both early science fiction as well as poetry. And these are but two examples that Holmes provides. He builds a picture of how through Romantic philosophy both science and art were unified by the feature intrinsic to both: creative thought. In this way, Romantic science can be distinguished from the more purely rationalistic viewpoint of the Early Enlightenment (in the works of Descartes, Spinoza, and Hobbes for example). Spinoza forms a case in point (I get this from Steven Nadler’s study of Spinoza in A Book Forged in Hell). Spinoza asserted that there was no role for imagination in rational society (including science) and that knowledge was based on the accumulation of facts. However, scientists of the Romantic Age (and after, such as Richard Feynman) dismissed the adequacy of simply collecting facts. Scientific understanding required conceptual breakthroughs, and this was only available via creative thought and imagination. (The cultural meme of the creative scientific breakthrough – Archimedes’ “Eureka!” moment – remains strong in present day public understanding of science. Witness how nonscientists regard Einstein or Stephen Hawking.)All of this is a long way from the divided and acrimonious relation between art and science described by C.P. Snow in his landmark “The Two Cultures”. Holmes locates the inflection point at the “Immortal Dinner” held in December 1817 by the fundamentalist Christian painter Benjamin Haydon (see pages 318-321). Attending this event were the poets William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, and John Keats. However, Holmes notes that this dinner did not include Coleridge, Byron, or Shelley – persons whom Holmes asserts would have had no patience for either Haydon’s rhetorical aims or the acrimony towards science espoused by their fellow poets. In the long run, however, the constructed antipathy between art and science put forward at the “Immortal Dinner” have become part of the dogma about science and art.Holmes’ central objective in Age of Wonder, then, is to usefully refute the “Two Cultures” hypothesis and to provide biographical evidence of its inadequacy both past and present as well as to partly rehabilitate the role of Romantic art and sensibility in furthering the Scientific Revolution – a viewpoint joined by Lisa Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution) and others, including, interestingly, the arch-atheist Richard Dawkins. Within the limits of my knowledge, I feel that Holmes has successfully provided a rich source of materials for his case as well as vivid biographical portraits of the personalities involved in this second stage of the English Scientific Revolution – with Lisa Jardine having provided a very useful synopsis of the first stage of the English Scientific Revolution.However, Holmes does not provide a good overall contextualization of the issues at stake, making it difficult for those without existing specialist knowledge to either understand or to evaluate his thesis. This contextualization would not have to be large – a short chapter at the beginning of the book, or rather a reworking of his introduction – would suffice to ease general readers into the debate on “two cultures” (he never actually deals with C.P. Snow’s thesis in depth here – a significant omission. Another issue is that this work is almost entirely Anglo-centric, with some mention of Antoine Lavoisier, Alexandre Charles, the Mongolfiers, and other French and German scientists. This Anglo-centrism is merited to a degree because of the key role played by Britain in the early Industrial and Scientific Revolutions. But at the same time, the reader can wonder how well Holmes’ interpretation of Romantic science translates to the broader European context. So, in closing, while this is a great book, it is not a standalone work. To extract full value from it, I would recommend looking at the back of the book, where Holmes provides a highly welcome background reading list. For anyone interested in modern political and intellectual history, some knowledge of Romanticism is a must and well worth acquiring. By the same token, some knowledge of either the sociology of science or the history and philosophy of science (these can be somewhat adversarial fields) will provide context for why it is important to understand how scientists actually practice their craft as well as the greater social context in which science takes place (see for instance Bruno Latour, Laboratory Life.) So, while I would recommend this book for anyone interested in science and early modern history, it is a book that provides greater rewards for external study than most. "
65,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"This book took me an unusually long time to finish, which at first I was inclined to blame on my own deficiencies. But by the time I finished the book, I was otherwise inclined. Quite simply, this book seemed to strive mightily to connect the major Romantic poets to some major Romantic-era scientists, but ultimately the author’s thesis fell flat for me. Granted, I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book, which focused on Joseph Banks’ voyages to Tahiti, the brother and sister astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, the African odyssey of Mungo Park, and the escapades of daredevil balloonists. Holmes does an admirable job of writing juicy mini-biographies of these and other personages, but, dazzled as I was by his eye for detail and ability to enable the reader to peer beneath his subjects’ skin, early on I found myself a bit baffled at why these disparate people were sharing space in the same volume. Then, in subsequent chapters, particularly those devoted to chemist/poet Humphrey Davy, I hit a wall. Davy, to me, was not nearly as engaging a person, despite his obvious brilliance and importance, but more to the point, at this point in the book the author begins to strain very hard to bring in connections to the Romantic poets. Davy was friends with Coleridge and wrote a great deal of (alas, not very good) poetry himself. Holmes quotes reams of Davy’s poetry (which I immediately learned to skim), as well as poetry by Coleridge, Keats, Byron and Shelley. And it was at this point that I sincerely wished that the author were NOT a specialist and biographer of the Romantic poets, for he strained so often and so hard to work in any poetic reference, however tangential, to science that I became quite impatient. His thesis.... well, I’m not entirely sure what it was, to be honest. (And hence my initial impulse to feel it was my fault as a reader, for surely there is a thesis?) Something about how the divisions between science and poetry/philosophy are artificial and that, indeed, we should endeavor to unite the two fields, which are both grounded in wonder.  But, gee, that’s an awfully broad net to cast, don’t you think? I’m afraid the result was a great deal of bycatch. Then, too, during the second half of the book, the discussion of Davy et al. becomes quite bogged down in the discussion of Davy’s various relationships (romantic and otherwise), the political wranglings of the Royal Society, and the rise or fall of various scientists’ reputations. The narrative became dense and hard to follow. However, I persisted to the end of the book, feeling that, surely, the author would tie all these disparate strands together for me in some cohesive way.No such luck. "
66,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn,4,"Interest and Science TogetherThis book is meant to emphasize that research and art go together and are inseparable. Holmes discusses how leisure time gave way to thought,involvement and art caused the scientific revolution a a is could not exist without the other. He uses examples from all over Europe and pulls stories out quite well. "
67,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"“Science is truly a relay race, with each discovery handed on to the next generation. Even as one door is closing, another door is already being thrown open. So it is with this book. For this, I believe science needs to be presented and explored in a new way. We need not only a new history of science, but a more enlarged and imaginative biographical writing about individual scientists. The old, rigid debates and boundaries — science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics — are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.”I am abashed at how much of this book I did not know, and am grateful that I do now. Slightly dry and scattered, it was hard to get through, not full of wonder but details, but worth the time. I wish there was a timeline, as the narrative moves all over the place, ostensibly chronologically but confusingly.The revolution of the time was an explosion of astronomy, chemistry, geology, exploration of the world, and changes in society “to the point that the greatest astronomer of the age would turn out to be an immigrant German musician (William Herschel and his sister!), the greatest chemist was the son of a Welsh ne’er-do-well (Humphry Davy), and a whole new branch of study—electromagnetism—would be founded by the son of a blacksmith (Michael Faraday). All these figures appear as characters in Holmes’ fascinating work, along with poets, novelists, explorers, aristocrats and even balloonists.” The scientist was also philosopher, and the lines were blurred. The author includes poetry that was inspired by the science, by Coleridge, Byron, Keats, and Shelley, and that adds a layer to the Ancient Mariner and other famous poems of the time that might be my favorite part of the book. I am reading The Second Mountain by David Brooks, and he writes of times in history when the moral ecology was changing, and Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael would say when Mother Culture gets more strident, and the frog in the boiling water doesn’t feel the heat yet. I can see the arc of time in this age of wonder, and how scientists of the time had an intense drive to be an individual, to achieve grand and stupendous things (telescopes to discover Uranus, mapping Africa, discovering potassium, etc) with recklessness and fearlessness. “Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration. These were Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world expedition aboard the Endeavour, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage to the Galapagos islands aboard the Beagle, begun in 1831. This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder, and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”I had always revered the Enlightenment Age so may have glossed over anything called Romantic, hence the ignorance. The author focuses on three Romantic themes: ballooning, global exploration and soul hunting along with the science. The author writes that far back in antiquity, “Plato argued that the notion of ‘wonder’ was central to all philosophical thought: ‘In Wonder all Philosophy began: in Wonder it ends…But the first Wonder is the Offspring of Ignorance; the last is the Parent of Adoration.’” This was quite lost during the rational Enlightenment and the Romantic poets put the wonder back into the science, and drew the lay people in to experience it. Can you imagine scads of modern poetry written about Carl Sagan or Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Like Wordsworth:Romantic traveller amidst the stars: And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The Antechapel where the Statue stood Of Newton, with his prism and his silent face, The marble index of a Mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.Wordsworth again:My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky; So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man...Epigraphs:He thought about himself, and the whole Earth, Of Man the wonderful, and of the Stars, And how the deuce they ever could have birth; And then he thought of Earthquakes, and of Wars, How many miles the Moon might have in girth, Of Air-balloons, and of the many bars To perfect Knowledge of the boundless Skies; And then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes. BYRON, Don Juan (1819)Those to whom the harmonious doors Of Science have unbarred celestial stores … WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ‘Lines Additional to an Evening Walk’ (1794)Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific … JOHN KEATS, ms of sonnet (1816)“Their minutely recorded telescope observations, published in over a hundred papers by the Royal Society, would change not only the public conception of the solar system, but of the whole Milky Way galaxy and the structure and meaning of the universe itself. It was immediately apparent that Herschel had created an instrument of unparalleled light-gathering power and clarity. He saw, for example, what very few astronomers even suspected: that the Pole Star — which had been the key to navigation, and the poet’s traditional emblem of steadiness and singularity, for centuries — was not in fact one star at all, but two stars.”“Surrounded by infinite space, and swallowed up in an immensity of being, man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean, mixed and confounded with the general mass. But from this situation, perplexing as it is, he endeavours to extricate himself; and by looking abroad into Nature, employs the powers she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.”“An unfathomably larger universe was steadily opening up, and this gradually transformed popular notions of the size and mystery of the world ‘beyond the heavens’Indeed, the very terms ‘world’, ‘heaven’ and ‘universe’ began to changetheir meanings. It was the psychological breakthrough that Kant had predicted in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens back in 1755: ‘We may cherish the hope that new plane is being uncovered.”Poetry from Erasmus Darwin celebrating the astronomical discoveries of Herschel:When Love Divine, with brooding wings unfurl’d, Call’d from the rude abyss the living World, ‘Let there be Light!’, proclaimed the Almighty Lord, Astonish’d Chaos heard the potent word; Through all his realms the kindling ether runs And the mass starts into a million Suns. Earths round each Sun with quick explosions burst, And second Planets issue from the first; Bend as they journey with projectile force, In bright ellipses their reluctant course; Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll, And form, self-balanced, one revolving whole. – Onward they move, amid their bright abode, Space.David Bourgeois both published handbooks to the science of flight in 1784. Bourgeois opened ecstatically: ‘The idea of taking to the air, of flying through sky, and navigating through the ether, has always appealed so strongly to mankind, that it has appeared in numerous classical legends and folktales from the remotest antiquity. The wings of Saturn, the eagle of Jupiter, the peacocks of Juno, the doves of Venus, the winged horses of the Sun all bear witness …’ By the end of 1784, the second year of the great balloon craze, no fewer than 181 manned ascents had been recorded, mostly in France and England.Jeffries also gave the first truly vivid account of the changing appearance of the ground as seen ‘from a bird’s eye view, as it is called’. This too was constantly surprising. As they took off, there was the white sea of upturned faces in the city squares, swiftly reduced to tiny, unrecognisable points. There was the unearthly silence, the sense of their own motionlessness as the earth seemed to revolve below the basket. Though they did not appear to move, their compass needle steadily turned. Below them, the earth appeared transformed. There was the strange flattening out of hills and buildings, the emergence of previously unsuspected patterns in the foliage of woods, or the cultivation marks in fields, or the branching streets of a town. There was the constantly delusive appearance of clouds, and sudden showers of rain or even snowflakes. (No electrical charges were recorded, much to Jeffries’ relief.) The whole world became ‘like a beautifully coloured map or carpet’Wordsworth began his poem Peter Bell (1798) with a playful image of flying in a sort of dirigible airship, or balloon boat. There’s something in a flying Horse, There’s something in a huge Balloon: But through the Clouds I’ll never float Until I have a little Boat Shaped like the crescent-Moon … Away we go! — and what care we For treason, tumults, and for wars? We are as calm in our Delight As is the crescent-Moon so bright Among the scattered Stars.Perhaps Shelley put it best:‘The balloon has not yet received the perfection of which it is surely capable; the art of navigating the air is in its first and most helpless infancy; the aerial mariner still swims on bladders, and has not yet mounted the rude raft … It would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned. It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa? — Why do we not despatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction, and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon, which a vertical sun would project precisely underneath it, as it glided over that hitherto unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.’This method of viewing the galaxies (‘to continue the simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom’) presented the entire universe in a new kind of light, with the most radical implications. ‘The heavens are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions, in different flourishing beds … and we can extend the range of our experience [of them] to an immense duration.’Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that ‘deep space’ must also imply ‘deep time’. He wrote in his Preface: A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past … [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand — that is — almost two million years on their way.’ The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great dealof explanation to the layman.Keats likens his own discovery of Homer’s poetry to the experience of the great astronomer and the great explorer finding new worlds. … Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific — and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise – Silent upon a peak in Darien.Herschel also mentioned applying Newton’s theories for measuring the speed of solar light to ‘inconceivably distant bodies’ in the stellar system, with unimaginable results. ‘Then speaking of himself, he said with a modesty of manner that quite overcame me, when taken with the greatness of the assertion: “I have looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars of which the light, it can be proved, must have taken millions of years to reach the earth.”’Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably ‘ceased to exist’ millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. ‘The light did travel after the body was gone.’Banks was soon sponsoring small but highly adventurous expeditions into Egypt and the horn of Africa. Its motives at this stage were scientific and commercial, with no missionary or colonial intentions. Its primary aim was discovery, not conquest. This would change once Banks was appointed to the Privy Council in 1797, and became ever more closely involved in prosecuting the war against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then all exploration took on a more political and frankly imperial significance. Yet Africa and Australia always fascinated Banks for their own sake.Explorer Mungo Park: “At this moment, painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small moss in fructification, irresistibly caught my eye. I mention this to show from what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive consolation; for though the whole plant was not larger than the top of one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves, and capsula, without admiration.’ In that moment of pure scientific wonder, Park’s thoughts and outlook were transformed: ‘Can the Being (thought I) who planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed?”Shelley’s wilderness, while it includes ‘dark Aethiopia in her desert hills’, is geographically vague, though it moves more towards India and an imaginary East. But he catches something of Mungo Park’s enigmatic wanderlust, and transforms it into an unearthly Miltonic quest for the strange and magnificent limits of the known world: The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, And o’er the aerial mountains which pour down Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, In joy and exultation held his way; Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched His languid limbs.I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air …To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling … A mind that has once imbibed a taste for scientific enquiry has within itself an inexhaustible source of pure and exciting contemplations. One would think that Shakespeare had such a mind in view when he describes a contemplative man finding Tongues in trees — books in the running brooks Sermons in stones — and good in everything Where the uninformed and unenquiring eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he walks in the midst of wonders. It is intriguing that Herschel was quoting from Shakespeare’s As You Like .."
68,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This is a fascinating account of the growth of science in Romantic Age of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Holmes looks at the period through the lives of ground-breaking scientists, and illuminates the intersections between science, literature, and art during the period.Among the scientists discussed in detail are Joseph Banks, William and Caroline Herschel, Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday, and a collection of truly nutty but ground-breaking (or is that, and ground-breaking) balloonists.One of the most engaging aspects of science in this period is that it was all new enough that any smart, interested person with some (not necessarily large) resources could potentially make an important contribution. Joseph Banks was educated as a botanist, and made one of his greatest contributions with detailed and insightful anthropological observations of the Tahitians. William Herschel was trained as a musician, and his sister Caroline barely educated at all; they became prominent astronomers who made major contributions to the study of the heavens. Michael Faraday was a bookseller who was hired by Humphrey Davy as a lab assistant. Some of these men were born wealthy; some were not. None started out on the path where they made their greatest contributions.Joseph Banks accompanied James Cook on the first of his voyages to the south Pacific, as a naturalist, the same role in which Charles Darwin later sailed on the HMS Beagle. A major purpose of that voyage was to observe an eclipse of the sun that would be visible in Tahiti. While Banks did a great deal of botany while he was in Tahiti, he also made extensive and detailed observations of the Tahitians, differing from most of his fellow British by being open to--indeed, becoming deeply involved in, the Tahitian culture. Initially friendly relations with the Tahitians soured as Cook and others, unable or unwilling to let go of their own preconceptions, repeatedly offended them. After they left Tahiti, the voyage deteriorated further, with conflicts, epidemic illness, and death. The survivors, including Cook and Banks, arrived back in Britain devastated and took months to recover. Still a young man at this point, Banks was at the beginning of his career, and remained a major force in British science for decades to come--but less as a scientist himself, rather as the president of the Royal Society, guiding and encouraging the scientific careers of others.With Banks' story setting the framework, we see the Herschels start out as a musician and his singer/housekeeper sister and become two of the most important astronomers of the age, Davy beginning as a medical student and transforming into a chemist and engineer, and then into a mystical, visionary writer. We see the beginnings of true specialization in science, and the founding of the first subject-specialized science professional associations, separate from the Royal Society, which had, and still sought, to encompass them all. We see, also, the connections and interactions between the scientists and the writers and artists of the age, including Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats.It's a fascinating story, and I promise I have not even scratched the surface of it. Holmes seeks to reveal character as well as accomplishments, and show the ways in which the romantic sensibility, which we generally thing of as antithetical to science, in fact inspired and encouraged the Romantic Age scientists.Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from the local library."

He falls head over heels in love with William Herschel’s sister Caroline, so essential to Hershel’s exploration of the heavens through a series of homemade telescopes, the only kind of telescope to be had at the time. The story of Humphrey Davy inventing the safety lamp that saved so many coal miners’ lives is so real he might have been an eyewitness, including all the times Davy blows up at Michael Faraday, not to mention all the times he blows up his lab. 	Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats were fascinated and inspired by these new scientific explorations and discoveries, and employed many of them as images in their work. There is a whole chapter on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, where Holmes traces the Monster’s beginnings to lectures given at the Royal Society in London, which Shelley attended and which included the attempt by one philosopher to use a primitive form of electricity to shock a corpse back to life. Eeew. 	Holmes writes of what may have been our most polymathic age in deft and witty prose. Of Herschel, an accomplished musician as well as an astronomer, he writes, “He moved from earthly music to the music of the spheres.” He writes demurely of the balloon ascension of a Mr. Biggin and a Mrs. Sage, which may or may not have given birth to the Mile High Club. He quotes a contemporary critic as saying, somewhat apologetically, “Poetical descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid principles of the Science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple unadorned language.” 	And then Holmes lets Keats underline the point,  …Then felt I like some watcher of the skies	When a new planet swims into his ken...	That watcher of the skies was Herschel. And the new planet? Uranus."
70,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027264-monika,5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. What strikes me most about Holmes is his ability to weave together what modern man has learned to compartmentalize- the sciences and the humanities. Before science was ""science,"" it was natural philosophy. Before scientists were ""scientists,"" they were natural philosophers and poets. Richard Holmes brings science and art back together in order to tell the story of how the late eighteenth century produced the foundation of what would become modern science. Framing the book with the story of Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who took part in Captain Cook's expedition to Tahiti later becoming the president of the Royal Society, Holmes moves to William Herschel, the musician and amateur astronomer who would discover Uranus with a telescope of his own making, and his sister, Caroline, who herself was responsible for discovering several comets. From the Herschel's the story moves to Mungo Parks and his travels to Africa and mapping of the Congo, followed by Sir Humphry Davy, who many believe is the founder of modern chemistry.What makes this book a wonder, however, is the pervasive spirit of inquiry of the age. Whereas now we seem to accept platitudes like ""I'm good at English, so I must not be good at math,"" this age embraced the idea that the only way to express the wonder of science is through poetry, literature, and the arts. Poets like Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley attended lectures from the great thinkers of the age, then expressed the same concerns about man's place in the world as the men who gave the lectures. What a time it must have been... human curiosity leading to unimaginable discoveries, discoveries that would forever alter the way we view our place in the universe... and such is the terror. To borrow from Carl Jung, this period marked the dawning of our self-awareness as a species in a universe that very quickly became immeasurably large and unimaginably old. Suddenly, we became ants in an ant farm instead of products of some intelligent design... Richard Holmes captures the complexities of the period in a most poetic way. I will be coming back to this book many times."
71,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779830-andrew,3,"I forgot about this book until I saw it again here. My father sent this book to me a few years ago. I enjoyed learning about the various people, scientists as well as non-scientists. I like that Holmes gives so much detail about, for instance, the grinding of the mirror for the telescope. And how it was paid for. For me, the book would be just as enjoyable if it was a collection of anecdotes and free of any speculation as to whether or how the literature and paintings of the time may or may not have influenced the scientists of that time. Holmes undertakes the great challenge of finding connections between Romantic notions and the scientific pursuits of those times. I really don't see how such connections can be made without knowing the biographies of the scientists well enough to know the extent of their interest in Romantic notions. That can be hard to know for anyone. I did enjoy learning that S.T. Coleridge was solicited to join a convention of people doing science, at least partly for the purpose of helping to choose a word to apply to the people who do science. As a result of this convention, the word scientist came into general use. It seemed to me that, of all the regard these scientists had for Romantic notions, Holmes related more about Humphry Davies' than any other. "
72,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/392337-sarah,5,"This is an amazing book. It doesn't have as much to do with literary Romanticism as I had originally hoped, but by the end of the first chapter I didn't care. Holmes is an excellent writer, and he makes the excitement and amazement of the scientists and explorers he profiles live. I think my favorite sections are the ones that deal with Joseph Banks, who went on a scientific voyage to Tahiti as a young man and, despite a successful career as a botanist in England, mentor to many younger scientists, and long-time president of the Royal Society, never seems to have found anything that moved him in the same way as Tahiti. To some extent, this book is a series of linked biographies: Banks, astronomer William Herschel and his sister Caroline, Sir Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday. Holmes is also very good at drawing out the political (whether national competition over who should be credited with discoveries or in-fighting over who should lead the various scientific societies) and philosophical (German Romantic writers and Coleridge make appearances here) implications of the scientific discoveries involved. It's not often a book is so informative, gripping, and well written all at once. "
73,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,4,"This was the first book assigned for my new semester, which means I'm going back to reading school stuff round the clock again, but luckily this first one was a great one. It's really a combined biography of Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Science, explorer of Tahiti), William Herschel (discovered Uranus), and Humphrey Davy (experimented with nitrous oxide, and also became President of Royal Society), along with a couple of other secondary stories. The best is probably the history behind Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, tracing it to the debates about the existence of a cosmic ""vitalist"" force, a debate that originated in the circle of German ""nature philosopher"" Frederich Schelling.The book was probably too long though, and plodded through parts of Herschel's and Davy's biographies (especially Davy's atrocious poetry), but it does do a great job showing how the worlds of Romantic literature and early modern science interacted. One takeaway, they all loved Coleridge."
74,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43247-emi-bevacqua,3,"This book is kind of the ultimate departure from my personal comfort zone: nearly 500 pages on the history of western science juxtaposed with poetry. Richard Holmes is an amazing researcher and writer, he really brings the age to life and I loved the beautiful color art inserts. The first section was very straightforward, about the young explorer Joseph Banks and his discoveries in Tahiti; in the next we meet a young astronomist that Banks discovered, named William Herschel and also his sister-assistant Caroline. Then with each chapter and introduction to subsequent scientists the reader is keeping track of more and more complexity, collegial scientists and poets, their discoveries and published work, their travels, and family relations! Throughout it all - anthropology, cosmology, flight, mesmerism, chemistry - the unifying thread is the history of the Royal Society of London scientists, led for the most part by Joseph Banks. My favorite quote is when somebody asks ""What's the use of a (hot air) balloon?"" and Benjamin Franklin responds, ""What's the use of a newborn baby?"" "
75,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,0,"There is obviously something wrong with me. Everyone raves about this book - so far I am finding it choppy, hard to read, all over the map and not particularly well-written. Holmes's penchant for including every detail of everything he ever read about his subjects is exhausting - a better writer would take the trouble to pare things down in the service of a more readable narrative. Part of my disappointment so far is that I didn't find Joseph Banks, the subject of the first 70 pages, a particularly engaging or interesting character. His major contribution to scientific progress appears to have been to bring back a bunch of specimens from Tahiti, a fundamentally pedestrian activity. Darwin's voyage on The Beagle was interesting because of how he subsequently synthesized his observations - Banks is a far duller character, no matter how many natives he slept with.Maybe things will pick up with Herschel and Davy."

We need to understand how science is actually made; how scientists themselves think and feel and speculate. We need to explore what makes scientists creative, as well as poets or painters, or musicians. That is how this book began. The old, rigid debates and boundaries -- science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics -- are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.
The Age of Wonder isn't quite the book I expected it to be: I was looking forward to a lot of science, which I find intriguing, but I found this work to be laden down with a lot of biographical information, which I find to be less so. The Romantic Period must have been an astonishing time to be alive, indeed an Age of Wonder; a time when any amateur, even a foreign musician like William Herschel, with enough curiosity and funds could literally point out new discoveries in the self-same night sky humans had been regarding for millennia. A privileged young man, like Joseph Banks, could buy himself passage on a voyage of discovery under Captain Cook and, in the process of collecting botanical specimens from Tahiti, invent the new field of Anthropology. Science, at the beginning of this period, was accessible and democratic: a barely educated young man, like Humphrey Davy, was able to wrest the study of the elements from the grip of the Alchemists and properly begin the discipline of Chemistry -- no longer searching for how to transmute the impossible, Davy (et al) did simple experiments to discover what does happen. Imagine a time when that was revolutionary thinking. Imagine if there were still basic discoveries to be made in nature; discoveries waiting to be plucked like low hanging fruit.I was delighted by the intersections between Science and Literature and Philosophy; how each informed the others; how so many of these early Scientists not only rubbed elbows with the likes of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Byron, but also expressed their own amazement in well-regarded verse. This also worked in reverse, with the great poets of the age attending scientific lectures in order to learn the terminology, the great metaphors of the day -- could this possibly be happening today?This book is exhaustive, and ultimately, I found that to be…exhausting. The following is more for my own memory than part of a proper review (and as I would probably advise anyone reading this review to just end here, I'm going to hide it all as a spoiler).(view spoiler)[I was charmed by Banks in Tahiti, and appreciated all of the primary source materials that were provided (the personal letters and journals and articles that filled in the big picture, that made the age come alive), but in some later sections these additions felt gossipy and a bit pointless. My favourite part from Tahiti: On their last day they discovered an enormous stone 'marai' or funeral monument, shaped like a pyramid, some forty-four feet high and nearly 300 feet wide, with steps of superbly polished white coral down both sides. This, the 'masterpiece' of Tahitian architecture on the island, was unsettling to Banks because its construction seemed technically inexplicable. 'It is beyond belief that Indians could raise so large a structure without the assistance of Iron tools to shape their stones or mortar to join them.'Not far away was another mystery: a huge wicker man constructed of basketwork, evidently for some obscure sacrificial rite. 'The whole was neatly covered with feathers, white to represent skin and black to represent hair and tattow.' I love stuff like that, and yes, I watch Ancient Aliens: not because I believe extraterrestrials built this curious 'marai', but because I revel in the mystery of these sorts of ancient structures and monuments and that show has a new one for me every week. Because of the noted intersections with literature, I was jotting down the books I was reminded of as I was reading. For this section, it was : Jamrach's Menagerie, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Unfamiliar Fishes (and how sad to note the evolution of Captain Cook from his empathetic treatment of the Tahitians to his brutality towards the Hawaiins), Parrot and Olivier in America, Moby Dick.I enjoyed the first section on William Herschel, but again, the biographical information was simply overwhelming -- I would have much preferred a general overview of his life in Hanover before emigrating to England and found no benefit at all in the biographies of his family members other than Caroline. When the book revisited the Herchels later -- more of the same and more of the same plus the details of his marriage and family -- I was seriously bored. I suppose the fact that his son, John, went on to become a leading figure in the Victorian Age of Science explains why we must follow William to the grave, but that wasn't what I wanted from this book (which I understand is a fault of my own, not the author). Since Caroline was profoundly affected by the Lisbon earthquake, I was put in mind of Candide and also of Frankenstein (not realising this book would be quoted at great length later).I was amused by the section on ballooning, and appreciate how at the time it must have seemed like the dawn of the Jetsons with their flying cars, but since in the end it was dismissed as a fad, more suited to carnivals than scientific study, I don't know that it belonged in this book. I did like this part: Benjamin Franklin, American Ambassador in Paris, watched the launch (of the first manned balloon flight) through a telescope from the window of his carriage. Afterwards he remarked: 'Someone asked me -- what's the use of a balloon? I replied - what's the use of a newborn baby?'Obvious choices, but I was reminded of Around the World in Eighty Days and The Wizard of Oz.Age of Wonder picked up (after another dull visit with the Herchels) when it told the thrilling story of Mongo Park and his two expeditions to find the source of the Niger in Africa. While the first trip was pure adventurism, the second smacked of imperialism, and it was probably due to his own self-important beliefs that he failed to pay due respect to the local tribes and was never seen again. Literary tie-ins: Heart of Darkness (for which Park was likely the inspiration for Kurtz), and because so much of this book takes place during the Napoleonic years and the war between France and Britain, A Tale of Two Cities.Humphrey Davy was a Poet and Chemist who experimented on himself with Nitrous Oxide, like a Timothy Leary for his time, without making the leap to its use in surgery. (A later section on the mastectomy that Fanny Burney endured without benefit of anesthetic made for a harrowing reading experience, but it was one more event that I wasn't certain belonged in what I thought this book was meant to be). Davy then made the leap to the study of Galvinism, and this sparked the great debates about Vitalism and ""is there an animating principle"" -- a soul? -- in humans, the great parlour discussion topic of the time, and that led to the first inklings of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This was interesting, but the very lengthy quoting from the book and its reception by the public and the stage play that came later -- all of this seemed beside the point to me. As was Davy's disintegrating marriage and political dealings with the Royal Academy of Science and his ""little nurse in Illyria"" -- so much biography, so little actual science. I did, however, appreciate when Davy put his mind to creating a safety-lamp for miners -- his great effort to demonstrate that science was for the benefit of mankind; theory that may be put into practise. The literary tie-ins at this point were all poetry: Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Prometheus Unbound.  (hide spoiler)]Okay, so after that long stretch of what was interesting and not so interesting to me, I return to Richard Holme's quote that I started with, the bit he actually ended with, and specifically:  Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. How many of us have this hope and wonder? I don't know that I believe the scientists of today are imbued with hope and wonder; that they are philosophical about their work; that they have the creative souls of artists. But perhaps I'm wrong and I thank Age of Wonder for forcing me to think of Science in this way.I wanted to love this book, but it was ultimately brought down by the immensity of the information it contained -- had it left out the society news and letters from home, I might have enjoyed it much more. "
77,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23672960-brian-willis,5,"Conventional wisdom places the scientific and rational achievements of the Age of Enlightenment in direct opposition to the fundamental values of the age of Romanticism in the arts. Poetry and art exuberantly shifted from an emphasis on cold rationality and collective achievement as well as logical procedures of the calculating mind towards exploration of the sentimentality of the human spirit, the individual within the natural world, and the subconscious. In other words, the movement was from the visible (or that which could be explained through rational observation) towards explaining the invisible (the interior subjective human self, the passions, the drives, and impulses that cannot be explained through science, at least in that era).Richard Holmes, perhaps the great living biographer of the Romantic era presents us with a multi-part biography of the scientists that influenced the Romantics, but instead of playing the party line of this dialectic, he demonstrates that the Romantic Era existed INFUSED with the spirit of exploration of the science of the age. Beginning with Sir Joseph Banks, he explains the foundation of the Royal Society. Then he divides a large part of the book following and documenting the life and achievements of Sir William Herschel and Sir Humphrey Davy. Herschel made his fame discovering Uranus, but Holmes argues effectively that his development of advanced telescopes as well as a method towards cataloguing the night sky were influential for future generations. One of the unsung heroes of the book is Caroline Herschel, his sister, who actually become the first patronized and influential female astronomer. Davy expanded our knowledge of natural gases and their containment, most effectively with his staggering safety lamp for miners. Other topics discussed are the passion for tales of the exploits of explorer Mungo Park and the origination of aerial flight through hot air ballooning. Holmes ties these achievements into the ongoing saga of the leading Romantics, particularly their encounters with Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley, and Keats (with Wordsworth gliding in the background and occasionally making an appearance). He points out moments in their compositions that reference the achievements of Banks, the Herschels, Davy, Park, Sadler, and many others. As the Romantics ascended, the reputation of science seems to have retroactively been placed into competition with the values of the age of Romanticism and later Victorianism. The Romantics grappled with the same issues that the scientists did however; the revelations of the cosmos and the sanctity of particles in observation of tiny objects were revealing the same troubling conclusions for both scientists and poets. If there are uncountable galaxies, is it ludicrous to think that Christ was crucified millions of times to redeem the universe? Surprisingly, this hint at atheism backfired on scientists and their reputation for years to come while Romantics with their celebration of pagan values and occasionally an atheist or two, somehow escaped the judgement of posterity though facing criticism in their time. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, inspired by the electrical current experimentation of Galvani, was interpreted as a condemnation of the limits of science (though that was not Shelley's intent).In the end, Holmes writes an incredibly enlightening and informative group biography, argues for the art of biography as a window into the discovery process of science, and demonstrates that these scientists not only created the profession of scientist but also the groundwork for the scientific method, as eventually perfected by Charles Darwin (who also makes an appearance). Another triumph from one of my favorite writers."
78,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16010931-douglass-gaking,5,"The Age of Wonder is a solid history of British scientists in the Romantic era. It focuses on the individual scientists' lives, their experiments, their writings–both personal and published–and their connections to each other.Scientists in focus include Joseph Banks, William Herschel, Michael Faraday, and even the fictional Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Each chapter is as in-depth as a biography.I especially like the chapter on William Herschel. I had not realized how close he came to our current understanding of the construction of the universe, despite being formally trained as a musician, and self-taught as a scientist.My main takeaway from this book is how imaginative these scientists were. Whether it is believing in the chemical nature of the soul or the existence of life on the moon, they had wild theories that certainly fit in with the sentiment of the Romantic era. While so many of these hypothesis proved to be false, whether in their lifetimes or later, it is the pursuit of proving them through experimentation that advanced human knowledge into the modern age."
79,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8355999-betsy,4,"This is an engrossing book about the development of science during the late 18th and early 19th century. It focuses on four individuals, Joseph Banks, (explorer and driving force behind the Royal Society for many years) Caroline and William Herschel (sister and brother astronomers) and Humphry Davy (chemist). Two things stand out from the rest for me. First, the author discussed women's roles in science and the role of Caroline Herschel in particular. She was the first woman awarded a stipend by the King for her astronomical work (albeit at half the rate a man would have received). Second, I was surprised by the strong overlap of science and poetry. Many of the scientists were published poets, including Herschel and Davy and many of the poets were also active in the sciences (Coleridge and Wordsworth among others).At almost 500 pages the book dragged in a few places, particularly when the author was describing societal trends rather than giving biographies of the various scientists and poets. But, all in all, well worth the time it took to read it."
80,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11684178-lauren-barr,5,"There is something about the age of exploration that I find fascinating and, yes, incredibly romantic. It makes me wish I lived in the Victorian ages just so I could go here these talks on nascent principles and ideas, no matter how off they were in the long run. In my Victorian fantasies I’m super rich and, apparently, male. But just reading about these explorers, these astronomers, these scientists developing these wonderful inventions and ideas that went on to better the world … it’s heady stuff. At times the book is a bit dry, but for the most part the subject matter is so rich you get entirely wrapped up in it."
81,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25211535-rachel,4,"This is a beautifully balanced book, which reflects the subject matter perfectly. Starting with Joseph Banks, it is ideal for anyone interested in the intellectual impact of James Cook's voyages, and takes the reader onwards into the marvellous scientific discoveries of the age, through the lives of some of the discoverers (known names, but not necessarily the ones we know most about). Very enjoyable and marvellously informative."
82,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82236298-graham,5,A great book. I love the concise and highly readable way this book was written. It is a really enlightening work that brings to life such an amazing period in the history of science. I really enjoyed The Age of Wonder. The link between Science and Poetry is profound.

87,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24591006-april,4,"I enjoyed hearing the backstories of these famous men of science and discovery. It's enlightening to understand their motivation for their actions. The author was also very interested in literary pursuits of the scientists, analyzing and interpreting their poetry. I liked that philosophical men of science felt encouraged to write their own poetry. I don't believe that is the case very often nowadays.This was such a dense read. It took me a long time to get through it, not because it was poorly written or boring, but because there was so much information to absorb on each page. And each page was equally as interesting as it was dense.""To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling ... a soap bubble ... an apple ... a pebble ... He walks in the midst of wonders."" - John Herschel, A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1830). pg. xiii""But while Cook clung to the necessity of European forms and discipline, Banks was rather inclined to dwell on the superfluity of European needs. These were perhaps the reflections of a man who had always been used to wealth and comforts. 'From them appear how small are the real wants of human nature, which we Europeans have increasd to an excess which would certainly appear incredible to these people could they be told it. Nor shall we cease to increase them as long as Luxuries can be invented and riches found for the purchase of them; and how soon these Luxuries degenerate into necessaries may be sufficiently evincd by the universal use of strong liquors, Tobacco, spices, Tea &c. &c.'"" pg. 39""Riding between musical engagements, from one remote provincial northern town to another, often crossing over the moors alone at night, he found himself studying the panoply of stars overhead as he had done as a boy. He became well acquainted with the moon, and would later write that at this time he had intended 'to fix upon the moon for my habitation.' He also later told several tales about these lonely rides, one being how on one occasion he was reading so intently that when his horse stumbled and threw him, he somersaulted over its head and landed upright still holding his book in his hand, a perfect demonstration of the Newtonian law of 'circular motion.'"" pg. 74""Characteristically, Pilatre ignored these protests, and calmly went on telling d'Arlandes to work at feeding the brazier. He himself took off his bright green topcoat (put on for the crowd), rolled up his sleeves, and went on throwing on straw till his wooden fork broke. Once, when d'Arlandes was desperately shouting at him, 'We must go down! We must go down!,' Pilatre called back soothingly: 'Look d'Arlandes. Here we are above Paris. There's no possible danger for you. Are you taking this all in?' Many witnesses later said that they could hear the two men shouting excitedly to each other as they passed overhead. They assumed they were describing the glories of flight."" pg. 130""It was a glorious pink-and-yellow, candy-coloured balloon, thirty feet tall, and the crowd loved it. The wickerwork basket, a sort of chaise longue for two, was completely festooned with flags and bunting. Dr Charles had a full payload of scientific equipment aboard--mercury barometer (which was used as an early form of altimeter), thermometer, telescope, sand bags and several bottles of champagne."" pg. 131""Surprisingly, balloons did not appeal to the gothic novelist Horace Walpole, though perhaps at sixty-six he was a little old for such perilous novelties. He thought balloons might be sinister: 'Well! I hope these new mechanic meteors will prove only playthings for the learned and idle, and not be converted into new engines of destruction to the human race--as is so often the case of refinements or discoveries in Science. The wicked wit of man always studies to apply the results of talents to enslaving, destroying, or cheating his fellow creatures. Could we reach the moon, we should think of reducing it to a province of some European kingdom.' It was an ominous prophecy."" pg. 135To note: What we Americans call the Revolutionary War, the British call the American War of Independence. pg. 147""Ballooning added to this new awareness of the complexity and subtlety of clouds, a growing Romantic preoccupation which can be followed in the paintings of Turner and Constable, the notebooks of Coleridge and the poetry of Shelley. When Shelley refers to 'the locks of the approaching storm' in his 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819), he is using Howard's definition cirrus. 'The Cloud' (1820) demonstrates a remarkably accurate and scientific understanding of cloud formation and the convection cycle. Goethe wrote a number of essays on clouds, atmospheric pressures and weather, and translated passages of Howard, asking him to compose and send his Autobiography to Germany, and describing him as 'the first to define conceptually the airy and ever-changing forms of clouds, thus delimiting and fixing what had always been ephemeral and intangible, by accurate observation and naming.'"" pg. 160""Clouds became fascinating both as scientific phenomena--the generators of electricity, the mysterious indicators of winds and changing air pressure--and as aesthetic phenomena: the 'moods' of the sky reflecting those of the observer, alterations of light over landscape, symbols of change, destruction, regeneration. It could be argued that the Romantics actually invented the idea of 'the weather' itself, as it now preoccupies us; as well, of course, as 'inner weather.'"" pg. 160""Ballooning produced a new, and wholly unexpected, vision of the earth. It had been imagined that it would reveal the secrets of the heavens above, but in fact it showed the secrets of the world beneath. The early aeronauts suddenly saw the earth as a giant organism, mysteriously patterned and unfolding, like a living creature. For the first time the impact of man on nature was clearly revealed: the ever-expanding relationship of towns to countryside, roads to rivers, cultivated fields to forests, and the development of industry. It was comparable to the first views of the earth from space by the Apollo astronauts in the 1960s, producing a new concept of a 'single blue planet' with its delicate membrane of atmosphere. The famous photograph 'Earthrise' was taken from lunar orbit in December 1968."" pg. 161""As he grew older, Herschel was becoming a remoter figure in the household. His mind was ranging through the universe. His later papers for the Royal Society had begun to show an increasing awareness of the philosophical significance of astronomy. This was something urged upon him by his old supporter William Watson, who looked forward to conversations 'on Kant's metaphysics,' and wished to know how far Herschel agreed with the 'ground and sources' of Kant's philosophy of knowledge."" pg. 203""Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that 'deep space' must also imply 'deep time.' He wrote in his Preface: 'A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past ... [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand--that is--almost two million years on their way.' The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great deal of explanation to the layman."" pg. 203""Herschel continued to reach carefully towards the idea of an evolving universe, a concept as radical in its eventual implications as Erasmus Darwin's notion of evolution within plants and animals. In a late paper published in 1811, 'Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens,' Herschel further developed the idea . . . that all nebulae and large star clusters were at particular points in their sidereal life-cycles, which could be visually identified and catalogued almost in a Linnaean manner. Their characteristic shapes suggested distinct moments of youth, maturing and ageing."" pg. 204""It presented the universe as a living, growing, organic entity, with all nebulae belonging to one enormous extended family: 'There is not so much difference between them, if I may use the comparison, as there would be in an annual description of the human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a man in his prime.' This comparison is an intriguing premonition of 'time-lapse' photography, now one of the most powerful illustrative tools of modern natural history."" pg. 204-205""Physical vision--one might say scientific vision--brings about a metaphysical shift in the observer's view of reality as a whole. The geography of the earth, or the structure of the solar system, are in an instant utterly changed, and forever. The explorer, the scientific observer, the literary reader, experience the Sublime: a moment of revelation into the idea of the unbounded, the infinite."" pg. 207""At all events, it was clear that the Milky Way 'cannot last forever'; and equally that 'its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.' It followed that neither the earth, nor even the solar system, was a separate creation, but merely an infinitesimal part of a galactic evolution. Our galaxy had a physical beginning, and would have a physical conclusion. Our solar system, our planet, and hence our whole civilisation would have an ultimate and unavoidable end."" pg. 209""Campbell recalled that he felt he had been 'conversing with a supernatural intelligence.' Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably 'ceased to exist' millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. 'The light did travel after the body was gone.' After leaving Herschel, Campbell walked onto the shingle of Brighton beach, gazing out to sea, feeling 'evelvated and overcome.' He was reminded of Newton's observation that he was just a child picking up shells on the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay all before him."" pg. 210""It is evident that the death of his father, and all the subsequent emotional upheavals, profoundly shook the sixteen-year-old Davy, and started an intellectual ferment that never left him. Besides writing poetry, he also started his first diary, set himself reading lists and work timetables, and began a series of essays on religion versus materialism. During 1796 he wrote an essay 'On Mathematics,' and another 'On Consciousness,' which gleefully explored the implications of materialism. He described the body as 'a fine tuned Machine,' and wrote a syllogistic proof that the 'soul' could not exist, since it was said to be eternal and 'unchangeable,' while every known part of the human body, including the brain, was temporary and changed perpetually. 'QED the soul does not exist.'"" pg. 243""One of Burney's many extraordinary reflections was whether extreme physical pain could not only induce unconsciousness--'I have two total chasms in my memory of this transaction'--but actually force the soul out of the body. She also found that the act of recollection carried its own pain, and that she had taken three months to complete the account, as a letter of nearly 10,000 words to her sister Esther. She had severe headaches every time she tried to go on with it. Once finished, she could not look back over what she had written. 'I dare not revise, nor read, the recollection is still so painful.' It is an astonishing record of courage, not least in Fanny's determination to protect her husband from the trauma of the operation. But it also recalls what the real conditions of surgery were at this period."" pg. 306""But speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical ideas of Friedrich Schelling and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine, perhaps best translated as 'science mysticism,' defined the entire natural world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity as a series of 'polarities.' According to Schelling's doctrine, the whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical objects 'aspired' to become something higher. There was a 'world-soul' constantly 'evolving' higher life forms and 'levels of consciousness' in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards a higher state."" pg. 315""Davy's notebooks for this period also suggest a new pattern of philosophical speculation, almost approaching German Naturphilosophie. Some of his observations would have been recognised by Coleridge: 'The aspirations for immortality are movements of the mind similar to those which a bird makes with its wings before they are furnished with feathers.' Others were more closely tied to his laboratory work. On the subject of scientific 'analogy,' for instance, he wondered if there was a wider principle at work. 'Probably there is an analogy in all existence: the divided tail of the fish is linked in a long succession of like objects with the biped man. In the planetary system it is probable man will be found connected with a higher intellectual nature; and it is possible that the monad, or soul, is constantly undergoing a series of progressions.'"" pg. 357""In November 1827 Davy returned briefly to London to resign his presidency of the Royal Society. He later gave a moving glimpse of his disillusion with his own scientific career on this sad return: 'In my youth, and through the prime of manhood, I never entered London without feelings of pleasure and hope. It was to me as the grand theatre of intellectual activity, the field of every species of enterprise and exertion, the metropolis of the world of business, thought, and action ... I now entered the great city in a very different tone of mind, one of settled melancholy ... My health was gone, my ambition was satisfied, I was no longer excited by the desire of distinction; what I regarded most tenderly [my mother], was in the grave ... My cup of life was no longer sparkling, sweet, and effervescent ... it has become bitter.' In a wonderfully sardonic aside, Davy added that this metaphor of the 'cup of life' was scientifically derived from the chemical fermentation of 'the juice of the grape,' and then after a certain lapse of time, its oxidisation and acidification."" pg. 419""Babbage perhaps intended a sort of parable of science for the new generation. His story went as follows. When Babbage first peered carefully at the shimmering solar image projected through Herschel's prism, he could not see these dark Fraunhofer lines, though he knew they were there. Herschel then commented to him: 'An object is frequently not seen, from not knowing how to see it, rather than from any deficit in the organ of vision ... I will instruct you how to see them.' After some time spent re-examining and refocusing the image, Babbage could see them perfectly. The point was that science must always be more than the simple observation of phenomena or data. It was simultaneously a subjective training in observation skills, self-criticism and interpretation: a complete education. This was of course precisely what William Herschel had said forty years before, about learning to see with a telescope."" pg. 440Book: borrowed from the SSF Main Library."

His deft handling the scientific discoveries that made these men and women - the Herschels (William, Caroline, and John), Joseph Banks, Michael Farady, Humphry Davy, et al - so important is admirable, of course, but more impressive is his ability to marshal an enormous amount of research into a coherent, pleasurable narrative.

94,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,5,"In writing this review, I am keeping in mind that an old and very dear friend of mine (who has read and liked this book) is highly interested in my evaluation. I mention this because it leads to an important point about the book: the background of the reader will strongly determine what he or she gets out of reading The Age of Wonder. For my part, I approach this work as a sociologist who is currently (fall 2013) preparing to take a doctoral exam in the sociology of science. Hence, I already have some grounding in this field and I will use this book as deep background for my own work in science and technology studies.To extract the maximum value from this work, the reader will need some knowledge of Romanticism and the history and philosophy of science – in particular the “two cultures” debate deriving from C.P. Snow’s famous work of that name. This is not to say that this book is entirely useless to the reader lacking such a background, but it will be more difficult for the reader to grasp the overall argument, as Holmes does not provide such contextualization. However, his skills as a biographer are so good that the reader can derive enormous value simply reading the book as a set of biographical vignettes and it would not be a waste of time.  However, the core of Holmes’ work involves an extended critique of the notion that art and science are invariably at odds. Holmes’ objective is to show that this tension is largely a product of Late Romanticism (early 19th Century) and in sociological terms is very much a cultural and political “project”. Indeed, Holmes provides compelling evidence not only that science and art are not inherently adversarial but that in Early Romanticism the two were deeply interconnected and (Holmes argues) drew strength from each other. Hence the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) was not only a Romantic author but worked with Humphry Davy (the chemist) and conducted experiments with prisms in Germany. Davy for his part wrote both early science fiction as well as poetry. And these are but two examples that Holmes provides. He builds a picture of how through Romantic philosophy both science and art were unified by the feature intrinsic to both: creative thought. In this way, Romantic science can be distinguished from the more purely rationalistic viewpoint of the Early Enlightenment (in the works of Descartes, Spinoza, and Hobbes for example). Spinoza forms a case in point (I get this from Steven Nadler’s study of Spinoza in A Book Forged in Hell). Spinoza asserted that there was no role for imagination in rational society (including science) and that knowledge was based on the accumulation of facts. However, scientists of the Romantic Age (and after, such as Richard Feynman) dismissed the adequacy of simply collecting facts. Scientific understanding required conceptual breakthroughs, and this was only available via creative thought and imagination. (The cultural meme of the creative scientific breakthrough – Archimedes’ “Eureka!” moment – remains strong in present day public understanding of science. Witness how nonscientists regard Einstein or Stephen Hawking.)All of this is a long way from the divided and acrimonious relation between art and science described by C.P. Snow in his landmark “The Two Cultures”. Holmes locates the inflection point at the “Immortal Dinner” held in December 1817 by the fundamentalist Christian painter Benjamin Haydon (see pages 318-321). Attending this event were the poets William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, and John Keats. However, Holmes notes that this dinner did not include Coleridge, Byron, or Shelley – persons whom Holmes asserts would have had no patience for either Haydon’s rhetorical aims or the acrimony towards science espoused by their fellow poets. In the long run, however, the constructed antipathy between art and science put forward at the “Immortal Dinner” have become part of the dogma about science and art.Holmes’ central objective in Age of Wonder, then, is to usefully refute the “Two Cultures” hypothesis and to provide biographical evidence of its inadequacy both past and present as well as to partly rehabilitate the role of Romantic art and sensibility in furthering the Scientific Revolution – a viewpoint joined by Lisa Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution) and others, including, interestingly, the arch-atheist Richard Dawkins. Within the limits of my knowledge, I feel that Holmes has successfully provided a rich source of materials for his case as well as vivid biographical portraits of the personalities involved in this second stage of the English Scientific Revolution – with Lisa Jardine having provided a very useful synopsis of the first stage of the English Scientific Revolution.However, Holmes does not provide a good overall contextualization of the issues at stake, making it difficult for those without existing specialist knowledge to either understand or to evaluate his thesis. This contextualization would not have to be large – a short chapter at the beginning of the book, or rather a reworking of his introduction – would suffice to ease general readers into the debate on “two cultures” (he never actually deals with C.P. Snow’s thesis in depth here – a significant omission. Another issue is that this work is almost entirely Anglo-centric, with some mention of Antoine Lavoisier, Alexandre Charles, the Mongolfiers, and other French and German scientists. This Anglo-centrism is merited to a degree because of the key role played by Britain in the early Industrial and Scientific Revolutions. But at the same time, the reader can wonder how well Holmes’ interpretation of Romantic science translates to the broader European context. So, in closing, while this is a great book, it is not a standalone work. To extract full value from it, I would recommend looking at the back of the book, where Holmes provides a highly welcome background reading list. For anyone interested in modern political and intellectual history, some knowledge of Romanticism is a must and well worth acquiring. By the same token, some knowledge of either the sociology of science or the history and philosophy of science (these can be somewhat adversarial fields) will provide context for why it is important to understand how scientists actually practice their craft as well as the greater social context in which science takes place (see for instance Bruno Latour, Laboratory Life.) So, while I would recommend this book for anyone interested in science and early modern history, it is a book that provides greater rewards for external study than most. "
95,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"This book took me an unusually long time to finish, which at first I was inclined to blame on my own deficiencies. But by the time I finished the book, I was otherwise inclined. Quite simply, this book seemed to strive mightily to connect the major Romantic poets to some major Romantic-era scientists, but ultimately the author’s thesis fell flat for me. Granted, I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book, which focused on Joseph Banks’ voyages to Tahiti, the brother and sister astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, the African odyssey of Mungo Park, and the escapades of daredevil balloonists. Holmes does an admirable job of writing juicy mini-biographies of these and other personages, but, dazzled as I was by his eye for detail and ability to enable the reader to peer beneath his subjects’ skin, early on I found myself a bit baffled at why these disparate people were sharing space in the same volume. Then, in subsequent chapters, particularly those devoted to chemist/poet Humphrey Davy, I hit a wall. Davy, to me, was not nearly as engaging a person, despite his obvious brilliance and importance, but more to the point, at this point in the book the author begins to strain very hard to bring in connections to the Romantic poets. Davy was friends with Coleridge and wrote a great deal of (alas, not very good) poetry himself. Holmes quotes reams of Davy’s poetry (which I immediately learned to skim), as well as poetry by Coleridge, Keats, Byron and Shelley. And it was at this point that I sincerely wished that the author were NOT a specialist and biographer of the Romantic poets, for he strained so often and so hard to work in any poetic reference, however tangential, to science that I became quite impatient. His thesis.... well, I’m not entirely sure what it was, to be honest. (And hence my initial impulse to feel it was my fault as a reader, for surely there is a thesis?) Something about how the divisions between science and poetry/philosophy are artificial and that, indeed, we should endeavor to unite the two fields, which are both grounded in wonder.  But, gee, that’s an awfully broad net to cast, don’t you think? I’m afraid the result was a great deal of bycatch. Then, too, during the second half of the book, the discussion of Davy et al. becomes quite bogged down in the discussion of Davy’s various relationships (romantic and otherwise), the political wranglings of the Royal Society, and the rise or fall of various scientists’ reputations. The narrative became dense and hard to follow. However, I persisted to the end of the book, feeling that, surely, the author would tie all these disparate strands together for me in some cohesive way.No such luck. "
96,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn,4,"Interest and Science TogetherThis book is meant to emphasize that research and art go together and are inseparable. Holmes discusses how leisure time gave way to thought,involvement and art caused the scientific revolution a a is could not exist without the other. He uses examples from all over Europe and pulls stories out quite well. "
97,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"“Science is truly a relay race, with each discovery handed on to the next generation. Even as one door is closing, another door is already being thrown open. So it is with this book. For this, I believe science needs to be presented and explored in a new way. We need not only a new history of science, but a more enlarged and imaginative biographical writing about individual scientists. The old, rigid debates and boundaries — science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics — are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.”I am abashed at how much of this book I did not know, and am grateful that I do now. Slightly dry and scattered, it was hard to get through, not full of wonder but details, but worth the time. I wish there was a timeline, as the narrative moves all over the place, ostensibly chronologically but confusingly.The revolution of the time was an explosion of astronomy, chemistry, geology, exploration of the world, and changes in society “to the point that the greatest astronomer of the age would turn out to be an immigrant German musician (William Herschel and his sister!), the greatest chemist was the son of a Welsh ne’er-do-well (Humphry Davy), and a whole new branch of study—electromagnetism—would be founded by the son of a blacksmith (Michael Faraday). All these figures appear as characters in Holmes’ fascinating work, along with poets, novelists, explorers, aristocrats and even balloonists.” The scientist was also philosopher, and the lines were blurred. The author includes poetry that was inspired by the science, by Coleridge, Byron, Keats, and Shelley, and that adds a layer to the Ancient Mariner and other famous poems of the time that might be my favorite part of the book. I am reading The Second Mountain by David Brooks, and he writes of times in history when the moral ecology was changing, and Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael would say when Mother Culture gets more strident, and the frog in the boiling water doesn’t feel the heat yet. I can see the arc of time in this age of wonder, and how scientists of the time had an intense drive to be an individual, to achieve grand and stupendous things (telescopes to discover Uranus, mapping Africa, discovering potassium, etc) with recklessness and fearlessness. “Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration. These were Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world expedition aboard the Endeavour, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage to the Galapagos islands aboard the Beagle, begun in 1831. This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder, and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”I had always revered the Enlightenment Age so may have glossed over anything called Romantic, hence the ignorance. The author focuses on three Romantic themes: ballooning, global exploration and soul hunting along with the science. The author writes that far back in antiquity, “Plato argued that the notion of ‘wonder’ was central to all philosophical thought: ‘In Wonder all Philosophy began: in Wonder it ends…But the first Wonder is the Offspring of Ignorance; the last is the Parent of Adoration.’” This was quite lost during the rational Enlightenment and the Romantic poets put the wonder back into the science, and drew the lay people in to experience it. Can you imagine scads of modern poetry written about Carl Sagan or Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Like Wordsworth:Romantic traveller amidst the stars: And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The Antechapel where the Statue stood Of Newton, with his prism and his silent face, The marble index of a Mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.Wordsworth again:My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky; So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man...Epigraphs:He thought about himself, and the whole Earth, Of Man the wonderful, and of the Stars, And how the deuce they ever could have birth; And then he thought of Earthquakes, and of Wars, How many miles the Moon might have in girth, Of Air-balloons, and of the many bars To perfect Knowledge of the boundless Skies; And then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes. BYRON, Don Juan (1819)Those to whom the harmonious doors Of Science have unbarred celestial stores … WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ‘Lines Additional to an Evening Walk’ (1794)Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific … JOHN KEATS, ms of sonnet (1816)“Their minutely recorded telescope observations, published in over a hundred papers by the Royal Society, would change not only the public conception of the solar system, but of the whole Milky Way galaxy and the structure and meaning of the universe itself. It was immediately apparent that Herschel had created an instrument of unparalleled light-gathering power and clarity. He saw, for example, what very few astronomers even suspected: that the Pole Star — which had been the key to navigation, and the poet’s traditional emblem of steadiness and singularity, for centuries — was not in fact one star at all, but two stars.”“Surrounded by infinite space, and swallowed up in an immensity of being, man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean, mixed and confounded with the general mass. But from this situation, perplexing as it is, he endeavours to extricate himself; and by looking abroad into Nature, employs the powers she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.”“An unfathomably larger universe was steadily opening up, and this gradually transformed popular notions of the size and mystery of the world ‘beyond the heavens’Indeed, the very terms ‘world’, ‘heaven’ and ‘universe’ began to changetheir meanings. It was the psychological breakthrough that Kant had predicted in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens back in 1755: ‘We may cherish the hope that new plane is being uncovered.”Poetry from Erasmus Darwin celebrating the astronomical discoveries of Herschel:When Love Divine, with brooding wings unfurl’d, Call’d from the rude abyss the living World, ‘Let there be Light!’, proclaimed the Almighty Lord, Astonish’d Chaos heard the potent word; Through all his realms the kindling ether runs And the mass starts into a million Suns. Earths round each Sun with quick explosions burst, And second Planets issue from the first; Bend as they journey with projectile force, In bright ellipses their reluctant course; Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll, And form, self-balanced, one revolving whole. – Onward they move, amid their bright abode, Space.David Bourgeois both published handbooks to the science of flight in 1784. Bourgeois opened ecstatically: ‘The idea of taking to the air, of flying through sky, and navigating through the ether, has always appealed so strongly to mankind, that it has appeared in numerous classical legends and folktales from the remotest antiquity. The wings of Saturn, the eagle of Jupiter, the peacocks of Juno, the doves of Venus, the winged horses of the Sun all bear witness …’ By the end of 1784, the second year of the great balloon craze, no fewer than 181 manned ascents had been recorded, mostly in France and England.Jeffries also gave the first truly vivid account of the changing appearance of the ground as seen ‘from a bird’s eye view, as it is called’. This too was constantly surprising. As they took off, there was the white sea of upturned faces in the city squares, swiftly reduced to tiny, unrecognisable points. There was the unearthly silence, the sense of their own motionlessness as the earth seemed to revolve below the basket. Though they did not appear to move, their compass needle steadily turned. Below them, the earth appeared transformed. There was the strange flattening out of hills and buildings, the emergence of previously unsuspected patterns in the foliage of woods, or the cultivation marks in fields, or the branching streets of a town. There was the constantly delusive appearance of clouds, and sudden showers of rain or even snowflakes. (No electrical charges were recorded, much to Jeffries’ relief.) The whole world became ‘like a beautifully coloured map or carpet’Wordsworth began his poem Peter Bell (1798) with a playful image of flying in a sort of dirigible airship, or balloon boat. There’s something in a flying Horse, There’s something in a huge Balloon: But through the Clouds I’ll never float Until I have a little Boat Shaped like the crescent-Moon … Away we go! — and what care we For treason, tumults, and for wars? We are as calm in our Delight As is the crescent-Moon so bright Among the scattered Stars.Perhaps Shelley put it best:‘The balloon has not yet received the perfection of which it is surely capable; the art of navigating the air is in its first and most helpless infancy; the aerial mariner still swims on bladders, and has not yet mounted the rude raft … It would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned. It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa? — Why do we not despatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction, and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon, which a vertical sun would project precisely underneath it, as it glided over that hitherto unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.’This method of viewing the galaxies (‘to continue the simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom’) presented the entire universe in a new kind of light, with the most radical implications. ‘The heavens are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions, in different flourishing beds … and we can extend the range of our experience [of them] to an immense duration.’Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that ‘deep space’ must also imply ‘deep time’. He wrote in his Preface: A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past … [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand — that is — almost two million years on their way.’ The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great dealof explanation to the layman.Keats likens his own discovery of Homer’s poetry to the experience of the great astronomer and the great explorer finding new worlds. … Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific — and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise – Silent upon a peak in Darien.Herschel also mentioned applying Newton’s theories for measuring the speed of solar light to ‘inconceivably distant bodies’ in the stellar system, with unimaginable results. ‘Then speaking of himself, he said with a modesty of manner that quite overcame me, when taken with the greatness of the assertion: “I have looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars of which the light, it can be proved, must have taken millions of years to reach the earth.”’Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably ‘ceased to exist’ millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. ‘The light did travel after the body was gone.’Banks was soon sponsoring small but highly adventurous expeditions into Egypt and the horn of Africa. Its motives at this stage were scientific and commercial, with no missionary or colonial intentions. Its primary aim was discovery, not conquest. This would change once Banks was appointed to the Privy Council in 1797, and became ever more closely involved in prosecuting the war against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then all exploration took on a more political and frankly imperial significance. Yet Africa and Australia always fascinated Banks for their own sake.Explorer Mungo Park: “At this moment, painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small moss in fructification, irresistibly caught my eye. I mention this to show from what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive consolation; for though the whole plant was not larger than the top of one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves, and capsula, without admiration.’ In that moment of pure scientific wonder, Park’s thoughts and outlook were transformed: ‘Can the Being (thought I) who planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed?”Shelley’s wilderness, while it includes ‘dark Aethiopia in her desert hills’, is geographically vague, though it moves more towards India and an imaginary East. But he catches something of Mungo Park’s enigmatic wanderlust, and transforms it into an unearthly Miltonic quest for the strange and magnificent limits of the known world: The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, And o’er the aerial mountains which pour down Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, In joy and exultation held his way; Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched His languid limbs.I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air …To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling … A mind that has once imbibed a taste for scientific enquiry has within itself an inexhaustible source of pure and exciting contemplations. One would think that Shakespeare had such a mind in view when he describes a contemplative man finding Tongues in trees — books in the running brooks Sermons in stones — and good in everything Where the uninformed and unenquiring eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he walks in the midst of wonders. It is intriguing that Herschel was quoting from Shakespeare’s As You Like .."
98,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This is a fascinating account of the growth of science in Romantic Age of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Holmes looks at the period through the lives of ground-breaking scientists, and illuminates the intersections between science, literature, and art during the period.Among the scientists discussed in detail are Joseph Banks, William and Caroline Herschel, Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday, and a collection of truly nutty but ground-breaking (or is that, and ground-breaking) balloonists.One of the most engaging aspects of science in this period is that it was all new enough that any smart, interested person with some (not necessarily large) resources could potentially make an important contribution. Joseph Banks was educated as a botanist, and made one of his greatest contributions with detailed and insightful anthropological observations of the Tahitians. William Herschel was trained as a musician, and his sister Caroline barely educated at all; they became prominent astronomers who made major contributions to the study of the heavens. Michael Faraday was a bookseller who was hired by Humphrey Davy as a lab assistant. Some of these men were born wealthy; some were not. None started out on the path where they made their greatest contributions.Joseph Banks accompanied James Cook on the first of his voyages to the south Pacific, as a naturalist, the same role in which Charles Darwin later sailed on the HMS Beagle. A major purpose of that voyage was to observe an eclipse of the sun that would be visible in Tahiti. While Banks did a great deal of botany while he was in Tahiti, he also made extensive and detailed observations of the Tahitians, differing from most of his fellow British by being open to--indeed, becoming deeply involved in, the Tahitian culture. Initially friendly relations with the Tahitians soured as Cook and others, unable or unwilling to let go of their own preconceptions, repeatedly offended them. After they left Tahiti, the voyage deteriorated further, with conflicts, epidemic illness, and death. The survivors, including Cook and Banks, arrived back in Britain devastated and took months to recover. Still a young man at this point, Banks was at the beginning of his career, and remained a major force in British science for decades to come--but less as a scientist himself, rather as the president of the Royal Society, guiding and encouraging the scientific careers of others.With Banks' story setting the framework, we see the Herschels start out as a musician and his singer/housekeeper sister and become two of the most important astronomers of the age, Davy beginning as a medical student and transforming into a chemist and engineer, and then into a mystical, visionary writer. We see the beginnings of true specialization in science, and the founding of the first subject-specialized science professional associations, separate from the Royal Society, which had, and still sought, to encompass them all. We see, also, the connections and interactions between the scientists and the writers and artists of the age, including Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats.It's a fascinating story, and I promise I have not even scratched the surface of it. Holmes seeks to reveal character as well as accomplishments, and show the ways in which the romantic sensibility, which we generally thing of as antithetical to science, in fact inspired and encouraged the Romantic Age scientists.Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from the local library."

He falls head over heels in love with William Herschel’s sister Caroline, so essential to Hershel’s exploration of the heavens through a series of homemade telescopes, the only kind of telescope to be had at the time. The story of Humphrey Davy inventing the safety lamp that saved so many coal miners’ lives is so real he might have been an eyewitness, including all the times Davy blows up at Michael Faraday, not to mention all the times he blows up his lab. 	Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats were fascinated and inspired by these new scientific explorations and discoveries, and employed many of them as images in their work. There is a whole chapter on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, where Holmes traces the Monster’s beginnings to lectures given at the Royal Society in London, which Shelley attended and which included the attempt by one philosopher to use a primitive form of electricity to shock a corpse back to life. Eeew. 	Holmes writes of what may have been our most polymathic age in deft and witty prose. Of Herschel, an accomplished musician as well as an astronomer, he writes, “He moved from earthly music to the music of the spheres.” He writes demurely of the balloon ascension of a Mr. Biggin and a Mrs. Sage, which may or may not have given birth to the Mile High Club. He quotes a contemporary critic as saying, somewhat apologetically, “Poetical descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid principles of the Science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple unadorned language.” 	And then Holmes lets Keats underline the point,  …Then felt I like some watcher of the skies	When a new planet swims into his ken...	That watcher of the skies was Herschel. And the new planet? Uranus."
100,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027264-monika,5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. What strikes me most about Holmes is his ability to weave together what modern man has learned to compartmentalize- the sciences and the humanities. Before science was ""science,"" it was natural philosophy. Before scientists were ""scientists,"" they were natural philosophers and poets. Richard Holmes brings science and art back together in order to tell the story of how the late eighteenth century produced the foundation of what would become modern science. Framing the book with the story of Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who took part in Captain Cook's expedition to Tahiti later becoming the president of the Royal Society, Holmes moves to William Herschel, the musician and amateur astronomer who would discover Uranus with a telescope of his own making, and his sister, Caroline, who herself was responsible for discovering several comets. From the Herschel's the story moves to Mungo Parks and his travels to Africa and mapping of the Congo, followed by Sir Humphry Davy, who many believe is the founder of modern chemistry.What makes this book a wonder, however, is the pervasive spirit of inquiry of the age. Whereas now we seem to accept platitudes like ""I'm good at English, so I must not be good at math,"" this age embraced the idea that the only way to express the wonder of science is through poetry, literature, and the arts. Poets like Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley attended lectures from the great thinkers of the age, then expressed the same concerns about man's place in the world as the men who gave the lectures. What a time it must have been... human curiosity leading to unimaginable discoveries, discoveries that would forever alter the way we view our place in the universe... and such is the terror. To borrow from Carl Jung, this period marked the dawning of our self-awareness as a species in a universe that very quickly became immeasurably large and unimaginably old. Suddenly, we became ants in an ant farm instead of products of some intelligent design... Richard Holmes captures the complexities of the period in a most poetic way. I will be coming back to this book many times."
101,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779830-andrew,3,"I forgot about this book until I saw it again here. My father sent this book to me a few years ago. I enjoyed learning about the various people, scientists as well as non-scientists. I like that Holmes gives so much detail about, for instance, the grinding of the mirror for the telescope. And how it was paid for. For me, the book would be just as enjoyable if it was a collection of anecdotes and free of any speculation as to whether or how the literature and paintings of the time may or may not have influenced the scientists of that time. Holmes undertakes the great challenge of finding connections between Romantic notions and the scientific pursuits of those times. I really don't see how such connections can be made without knowing the biographies of the scientists well enough to know the extent of their interest in Romantic notions. That can be hard to know for anyone. I did enjoy learning that S.T. Coleridge was solicited to join a convention of people doing science, at least partly for the purpose of helping to choose a word to apply to the people who do science. As a result of this convention, the word scientist came into general use. It seemed to me that, of all the regard these scientists had for Romantic notions, Holmes related more about Humphry Davies' than any other. "

It doesn't have as much to do with literary Romanticism as I had originally hoped, but by the end of the first chapter I didn't care. Holmes is an excellent writer, and he makes the excitement and amazement of the scientists and explorers he profiles live. I think my favorite sections are the ones that deal with Joseph Banks, who went on a scientific voyage to Tahiti as a young man and, despite a successful career as a botanist in England, mentor to many younger scientists, and long-time president of the Royal Society, never seems to have found anything that moved him in the same way as Tahiti. To some extent, this book is a series of linked biographies: Banks, astronomer William Herschel and his sister Caroline, Sir Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday. Holmes is also very good at drawing out the political (whether national competition over who should be credited with discoveries or in-fighting over who should lead the various scientific societies) and philosophical (German Romantic writers and Coleridge make appearances here) implications of the scientific discoveries involved. It's not often a book is so informative, gripping, and well written all at once. "
103,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,4,"This was the first book assigned for my new semester, which means I'm going back to reading school stuff round the clock again, but luckily this first one was a great one. It's really a combined biography of Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Science, explorer of Tahiti), William Herschel (discovered Uranus), and Humphrey Davy (experimented with nitrous oxide, and also became President of Royal Society), along with a couple of other secondary stories. The best is probably the history behind Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, tracing it to the debates about the existence of a cosmic ""vitalist"" force, a debate that originated in the circle of German ""nature philosopher"" Frederich Schelling.The book was probably too long though, and plodded through parts of Herschel's and Davy's biographies (especially Davy's atrocious poetry), but it does do a great job showing how the worlds of Romantic literature and early modern science interacted. One takeaway, they all loved Coleridge."
104,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43247-emi-bevacqua,3,"This book is kind of the ultimate departure from my personal comfort zone: nearly 500 pages on the history of western science juxtaposed with poetry. Richard Holmes is an amazing researcher and writer, he really brings the age to life and I loved the beautiful color art inserts. The first section was very straightforward, about the young explorer Joseph Banks and his discoveries in Tahiti; in the next we meet a young astronomist that Banks discovered, named William Herschel and also his sister-assistant Caroline. Then with each chapter and introduction to subsequent scientists the reader is keeping track of more and more complexity, collegial scientists and poets, their discoveries and published work, their travels, and family relations! Throughout it all - anthropology, cosmology, flight, mesmerism, chemistry - the unifying thread is the history of the Royal Society of London scientists, led for the most part by Joseph Banks. My favorite quote is when somebody asks ""What's the use of a (hot air) balloon?"" and Benjamin Franklin responds, ""What's the use of a newborn baby?"" "
105,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,0,"There is obviously something wrong with me. Everyone raves about this book - so far I am finding it choppy, hard to read, all over the map and not particularly well-written. Holmes's penchant for including every detail of everything he ever read about his subjects is exhausting - a better writer would take the trouble to pare things down in the service of a more readable narrative. Part of my disappointment so far is that I didn't find Joseph Banks, the subject of the first 70 pages, a particularly engaging or interesting character. His major contribution to scientific progress appears to have been to bring back a bunch of specimens from Tahiti, a fundamentally pedestrian activity. Darwin's voyage on The Beagle was interesting because of how he subsequently synthesized his observations - Banks is a far duller character, no matter how many natives he slept with.Maybe things will pick up with Herschel and Davy."

We need to understand how science is actually made; how scientists themselves think and feel and speculate. We need to explore what makes scientists creative, as well as poets or painters, or musicians. That is how this book began. The old, rigid debates and boundaries -- science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics -- are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.
The Age of Wonder isn't quite the book I expected it to be: I was looking forward to a lot of science, which I find intriguing, but I found this work to be laden down with a lot of biographical information, which I find to be less so. The Romantic Period must have been an astonishing time to be alive, indeed an Age of Wonder; a time when any amateur, even a foreign musician like William Herschel, with enough curiosity and funds could literally point out new discoveries in the self-same night sky humans had been regarding for millennia. A privileged young man, like Joseph Banks, could buy himself passage on a voyage of discovery under Captain Cook and, in the process of collecting botanical specimens from Tahiti, invent the new field of Anthropology. Science, at the beginning of this period, was accessible and democratic: a barely educated young man, like Humphrey Davy, was able to wrest the study of the elements from the grip of the Alchemists and properly begin the discipline of Chemistry -- no longer searching for how to transmute the impossible, Davy (et al) did simple experiments to discover what does happen. Imagine a time when that was revolutionary thinking. Imagine if there were still basic discoveries to be made in nature; discoveries waiting to be plucked like low hanging fruit.I was delighted by the intersections between Science and Literature and Philosophy; how each informed the others; how so many of these early Scientists not only rubbed elbows with the likes of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Byron, but also expressed their own amazement in well-regarded verse. This also worked in reverse, with the great poets of the age attending scientific lectures in order to learn the terminology, the great metaphors of the day -- could this possibly be happening today?This book is exhaustive, and ultimately, I found that to be…exhausting. The following is more for my own memory than part of a proper review (and as I would probably advise anyone reading this review to just end here, I'm going to hide it all as a spoiler).(view spoiler)[I was charmed by Banks in Tahiti, and appreciated all of the primary source materials that were provided (the personal letters and journals and articles that filled in the big picture, that made the age come alive), but in some later sections these additions felt gossipy and a bit pointless. My favourite part from Tahiti: On their last day they discovered an enormous stone 'marai' or funeral monument, shaped like a pyramid, some forty-four feet high and nearly 300 feet wide, with steps of superbly polished white coral down both sides. This, the 'masterpiece' of Tahitian architecture on the island, was unsettling to Banks because its construction seemed technically inexplicable. 'It is beyond belief that Indians could raise so large a structure without the assistance of Iron tools to shape their stones or mortar to join them.'Not far away was another mystery: a huge wicker man constructed of basketwork, evidently for some obscure sacrificial rite. 'The whole was neatly covered with feathers, white to represent skin and black to represent hair and tattow.' I love stuff like that, and yes, I watch Ancient Aliens: not because I believe extraterrestrials built this curious 'marai', but because I revel in the mystery of these sorts of ancient structures and monuments and that show has a new one for me every week. Because of the noted intersections with literature, I was jotting down the books I was reminded of as I was reading. For this section, it was : Jamrach's Menagerie, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Unfamiliar Fishes (and how sad to note the evolution of Captain Cook from his empathetic treatment of the Tahitians to his brutality towards the Hawaiins), Parrot and Olivier in America, Moby Dick.I enjoyed the first section on William Herschel, but again, the biographical information was simply overwhelming -- I would have much preferred a general overview of his life in Hanover before emigrating to England and found no benefit at all in the biographies of his family members other than Caroline. When the book revisited the Herchels later -- more of the same and more of the same plus the details of his marriage and family -- I was seriously bored. I suppose the fact that his son, John, went on to become a leading figure in the Victorian Age of Science explains why we must follow William to the grave, but that wasn't what I wanted from this book (which I understand is a fault of my own, not the author). Since Caroline was profoundly affected by the Lisbon earthquake, I was put in mind of Candide and also of Frankenstein (not realising this book would be quoted at great length later).I was amused by the section on ballooning, and appreciate how at the time it must have seemed like the dawn of the Jetsons with their flying cars, but since in the end it was dismissed as a fad, more suited to carnivals than scientific study, I don't know that it belonged in this book. I did like this part: Benjamin Franklin, American Ambassador in Paris, watched the launch (of the first manned balloon flight) through a telescope from the window of his carriage. Afterwards he remarked: 'Someone asked me -- what's the use of a balloon? I replied - what's the use of a newborn baby?'Obvious choices, but I was reminded of Around the World in Eighty Days and The Wizard of Oz.Age of Wonder picked up (after another dull visit with the Herchels) when it told the thrilling story of Mongo Park and his two expeditions to find the source of the Niger in Africa. While the first trip was pure adventurism, the second smacked of imperialism, and it was probably due to his own self-important beliefs that he failed to pay due respect to the local tribes and was never seen again. Literary tie-ins: Heart of Darkness (for which Park was likely the inspiration for Kurtz), and because so much of this book takes place during the Napoleonic years and the war between France and Britain, A Tale of Two Cities.Humphrey Davy was a Poet and Chemist who experimented on himself with Nitrous Oxide, like a Timothy Leary for his time, without making the leap to its use in surgery. (A later section on the mastectomy that Fanny Burney endured without benefit of anesthetic made for a harrowing reading experience, but it was one more event that I wasn't certain belonged in what I thought this book was meant to be). Davy then made the leap to the study of Galvinism, and this sparked the great debates about Vitalism and ""is there an animating principle"" -- a soul? -- in humans, the great parlour discussion topic of the time, and that led to the first inklings of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This was interesting, but the very lengthy quoting from the book and its reception by the public and the stage play that came later -- all of this seemed beside the point to me. As was Davy's disintegrating marriage and political dealings with the Royal Academy of Science and his ""little nurse in Illyria"" -- so much biography, so little actual science. I did, however, appreciate when Davy put his mind to creating a safety-lamp for miners -- his great effort to demonstrate that science was for the benefit of mankind; theory that may be put into practise. The literary tie-ins at this point were all poetry: Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Prometheus Unbound.  (hide spoiler)]Okay, so after that long stretch of what was interesting and not so interesting to me, I return to Richard Holme's quote that I started with, the bit he actually ended with, and specifically:  Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. How many of us have this hope and wonder? I don't know that I believe the scientists of today are imbued with hope and wonder; that they are philosophical about their work; that they have the creative souls of artists. But perhaps I'm wrong and I thank Age of Wonder for forcing me to think of Science in this way.I wanted to love this book, but it was ultimately brought down by the immensity of the information it contained -- had it left out the society news and letters from home, I might have enjoyed it much more. "
107,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23672960-brian-willis,5,"Conventional wisdom places the scientific and rational achievements of the Age of Enlightenment in direct opposition to the fundamental values of the age of Romanticism in the arts. Poetry and art exuberantly shifted from an emphasis on cold rationality and collective achievement as well as logical procedures of the calculating mind towards exploration of the sentimentality of the human spirit, the individual within the natural world, and the subconscious. In other words, the movement was from the visible (or that which could be explained through rational observation) towards explaining the invisible (the interior subjective human self, the passions, the drives, and impulses that cannot be explained through science, at least in that era).Richard Holmes, perhaps the great living biographer of the Romantic era presents us with a multi-part biography of the scientists that influenced the Romantics, but instead of playing the party line of this dialectic, he demonstrates that the Romantic Era existed INFUSED with the spirit of exploration of the science of the age. Beginning with Sir Joseph Banks, he explains the foundation of the Royal Society. Then he divides a large part of the book following and documenting the life and achievements of Sir William Herschel and Sir Humphrey Davy. Herschel made his fame discovering Uranus, but Holmes argues effectively that his development of advanced telescopes as well as a method towards cataloguing the night sky were influential for future generations. One of the unsung heroes of the book is Caroline Herschel, his sister, who actually become the first patronized and influential female astronomer. Davy expanded our knowledge of natural gases and their containment, most effectively with his staggering safety lamp for miners. Other topics discussed are the passion for tales of the exploits of explorer Mungo Park and the origination of aerial flight through hot air ballooning. Holmes ties these achievements into the ongoing saga of the leading Romantics, particularly their encounters with Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley, and Keats (with Wordsworth gliding in the background and occasionally making an appearance). He points out moments in their compositions that reference the achievements of Banks, the Herschels, Davy, Park, Sadler, and many others. As the Romantics ascended, the reputation of science seems to have retroactively been placed into competition with the values of the age of Romanticism and later Victorianism. The Romantics grappled with the same issues that the scientists did however; the revelations of the cosmos and the sanctity of particles in observation of tiny objects were revealing the same troubling conclusions for both scientists and poets. If there are uncountable galaxies, is it ludicrous to think that Christ was crucified millions of times to redeem the universe? Surprisingly, this hint at atheism backfired on scientists and their reputation for years to come while Romantics with their celebration of pagan values and occasionally an atheist or two, somehow escaped the judgement of posterity though facing criticism in their time. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, inspired by the electrical current experimentation of Galvani, was interpreted as a condemnation of the limits of science (though that was not Shelley's intent).In the end, Holmes writes an incredibly enlightening and informative group biography, argues for the art of biography as a window into the discovery process of science, and demonstrates that these scientists not only created the profession of scientist but also the groundwork for the scientific method, as eventually perfected by Charles Darwin (who also makes an appearance). Another triumph from one of my favorite writers."
108,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16010931-douglass-gaking,5,"The Age of Wonder is a solid history of British scientists in the Romantic era. It focuses on the individual scientists' lives, their experiments, their writings–both personal and published–and their connections to each other.Scientists in focus include Joseph Banks, William Herschel, Michael Faraday, and even the fictional Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Each chapter is as in-depth as a biography.I especially like the chapter on William Herschel. I had not realized how close he came to our current understanding of the construction of the universe, despite being formally trained as a musician, and self-taught as a scientist.My main takeaway from this book is how imaginative these scientists were. Whether it is believing in the chemical nature of the soul or the existence of life on the moon, they had wild theories that certainly fit in with the sentiment of the Romantic era. While so many of these hypothesis proved to be false, whether in their lifetimes or later, it is the pursuit of proving them through experimentation that advanced human knowledge into the modern age."
109,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8355999-betsy,4,"This is an engrossing book about the development of science during the late 18th and early 19th century. It focuses on four individuals, Joseph Banks, (explorer and driving force behind the Royal Society for many years) Caroline and William Herschel (sister and brother astronomers) and Humphry Davy (chemist). Two things stand out from the rest for me. First, the author discussed women's roles in science and the role of Caroline Herschel in particular. She was the first woman awarded a stipend by the King for her astronomical work (albeit at half the rate a man would have received). Second, I was surprised by the strong overlap of science and poetry. Many of the scientists were published poets, including Herschel and Davy and many of the poets were also active in the sciences (Coleridge and Wordsworth among others).At almost 500 pages the book dragged in a few places, particularly when the author was describing societal trends rather than giving biographies of the various scientists and poets. But, all in all, well worth the time it took to read it."
110,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11684178-lauren-barr,5,"There is something about the age of exploration that I find fascinating and, yes, incredibly romantic. It makes me wish I lived in the Victorian ages just so I could go here these talks on nascent principles and ideas, no matter how off they were in the long run. In my Victorian fantasies I’m super rich and, apparently, male. But just reading about these explorers, these astronomers, these scientists developing these wonderful inventions and ideas that went on to better the world … it’s heady stuff. At times the book is a bit dry, but for the most part the subject matter is so rich you get entirely wrapped up in it."
111,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25211535-rachel,4,"This is a beautifully balanced book, which reflects the subject matter perfectly. Starting with Joseph Banks, it is ideal for anyone interested in the intellectual impact of James Cook's voyages, and takes the reader onwards into the marvellous scientific discoveries of the age, through the lives of some of the discoverers (known names, but not necessarily the ones we know most about). Very enjoyable and marvellously informative."

117,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24591006-april,4,"I enjoyed hearing the backstories of these famous men of science and discovery. It's enlightening to understand their motivation for their actions. The author was also very interested in literary pursuits of the scientists, analyzing and interpreting their poetry. I liked that philosophical men of science felt encouraged to write their own poetry. I don't believe that is the case very often nowadays.This was such a dense read. It took me a long time to get through it, not because it was poorly written or boring, but because there was so much information to absorb on each page. And each page was equally as interesting as it was dense.""To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling ... a soap bubble ... an apple ... a pebble ... He walks in the midst of wonders."" - John Herschel, A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1830). pg. xiii""But while Cook clung to the necessity of European forms and discipline, Banks was rather inclined to dwell on the superfluity of European needs. These were perhaps the reflections of a man who had always been used to wealth and comforts. 'From them appear how small are the real wants of human nature, which we Europeans have increasd to an excess which would certainly appear incredible to these people could they be told it. Nor shall we cease to increase them as long as Luxuries can be invented and riches found for the purchase of them; and how soon these Luxuries degenerate into necessaries may be sufficiently evincd by the universal use of strong liquors, Tobacco, spices, Tea &c. &c.'"" pg. 39""Riding between musical engagements, from one remote provincial northern town to another, often crossing over the moors alone at night, he found himself studying the panoply of stars overhead as he had done as a boy. He became well acquainted with the moon, and would later write that at this time he had intended 'to fix upon the moon for my habitation.' He also later told several tales about these lonely rides, one being how on one occasion he was reading so intently that when his horse stumbled and threw him, he somersaulted over its head and landed upright still holding his book in his hand, a perfect demonstration of the Newtonian law of 'circular motion.'"" pg. 74""Characteristically, Pilatre ignored these protests, and calmly went on telling d'Arlandes to work at feeding the brazier. He himself took off his bright green topcoat (put on for the crowd), rolled up his sleeves, and went on throwing on straw till his wooden fork broke. Once, when d'Arlandes was desperately shouting at him, 'We must go down! We must go down!,' Pilatre called back soothingly: 'Look d'Arlandes. Here we are above Paris. There's no possible danger for you. Are you taking this all in?' Many witnesses later said that they could hear the two men shouting excitedly to each other as they passed overhead. They assumed they were describing the glories of flight."" pg. 130""It was a glorious pink-and-yellow, candy-coloured balloon, thirty feet tall, and the crowd loved it. The wickerwork basket, a sort of chaise longue for two, was completely festooned with flags and bunting. Dr Charles had a full payload of scientific equipment aboard--mercury barometer (which was used as an early form of altimeter), thermometer, telescope, sand bags and several bottles of champagne."" pg. 131""Surprisingly, balloons did not appeal to the gothic novelist Horace Walpole, though perhaps at sixty-six he was a little old for such perilous novelties. He thought balloons might be sinister: 'Well! I hope these new mechanic meteors will prove only playthings for the learned and idle, and not be converted into new engines of destruction to the human race--as is so often the case of refinements or discoveries in Science. The wicked wit of man always studies to apply the results of talents to enslaving, destroying, or cheating his fellow creatures. Could we reach the moon, we should think of reducing it to a province of some European kingdom.' It was an ominous prophecy."" pg. 135To note: What we Americans call the Revolutionary War, the British call the American War of Independence. pg. 147""Ballooning added to this new awareness of the complexity and subtlety of clouds, a growing Romantic preoccupation which can be followed in the paintings of Turner and Constable, the notebooks of Coleridge and the poetry of Shelley. When Shelley refers to 'the locks of the approaching storm' in his 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819), he is using Howard's definition cirrus. 'The Cloud' (1820) demonstrates a remarkably accurate and scientific understanding of cloud formation and the convection cycle. Goethe wrote a number of essays on clouds, atmospheric pressures and weather, and translated passages of Howard, asking him to compose and send his Autobiography to Germany, and describing him as 'the first to define conceptually the airy and ever-changing forms of clouds, thus delimiting and fixing what had always been ephemeral and intangible, by accurate observation and naming.'"" pg. 160""Clouds became fascinating both as scientific phenomena--the generators of electricity, the mysterious indicators of winds and changing air pressure--and as aesthetic phenomena: the 'moods' of the sky reflecting those of the observer, alterations of light over landscape, symbols of change, destruction, regeneration. It could be argued that the Romantics actually invented the idea of 'the weather' itself, as it now preoccupies us; as well, of course, as 'inner weather.'"" pg. 160""Ballooning produced a new, and wholly unexpected, vision of the earth. It had been imagined that it would reveal the secrets of the heavens above, but in fact it showed the secrets of the world beneath. The early aeronauts suddenly saw the earth as a giant organism, mysteriously patterned and unfolding, like a living creature. For the first time the impact of man on nature was clearly revealed: the ever-expanding relationship of towns to countryside, roads to rivers, cultivated fields to forests, and the development of industry. It was comparable to the first views of the earth from space by the Apollo astronauts in the 1960s, producing a new concept of a 'single blue planet' with its delicate membrane of atmosphere. The famous photograph 'Earthrise' was taken from lunar orbit in December 1968."" pg. 161""As he grew older, Herschel was becoming a remoter figure in the household. His mind was ranging through the universe. His later papers for the Royal Society had begun to show an increasing awareness of the philosophical significance of astronomy. This was something urged upon him by his old supporter William Watson, who looked forward to conversations 'on Kant's metaphysics,' and wished to know how far Herschel agreed with the 'ground and sources' of Kant's philosophy of knowledge."" pg. 203""Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that 'deep space' must also imply 'deep time.' He wrote in his Preface: 'A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past ... [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand--that is--almost two million years on their way.' The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great deal of explanation to the layman."" pg. 203""Herschel continued to reach carefully towards the idea of an evolving universe, a concept as radical in its eventual implications as Erasmus Darwin's notion of evolution within plants and animals. In a late paper published in 1811, 'Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens,' Herschel further developed the idea . . . that all nebulae and large star clusters were at particular points in their sidereal life-cycles, which could be visually identified and catalogued almost in a Linnaean manner. Their characteristic shapes suggested distinct moments of youth, maturing and ageing."" pg. 204""It presented the universe as a living, growing, organic entity, with all nebulae belonging to one enormous extended family: 'There is not so much difference between them, if I may use the comparison, as there would be in an annual description of the human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a man in his prime.' This comparison is an intriguing premonition of 'time-lapse' photography, now one of the most powerful illustrative tools of modern natural history."" pg. 204-205""Physical vision--one might say scientific vision--brings about a metaphysical shift in the observer's view of reality as a whole. The geography of the earth, or the structure of the solar system, are in an instant utterly changed, and forever. The explorer, the scientific observer, the literary reader, experience the Sublime: a moment of revelation into the idea of the unbounded, the infinite."" pg. 207""At all events, it was clear that the Milky Way 'cannot last forever'; and equally that 'its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.' It followed that neither the earth, nor even the solar system, was a separate creation, but merely an infinitesimal part of a galactic evolution. Our galaxy had a physical beginning, and would have a physical conclusion. Our solar system, our planet, and hence our whole civilisation would have an ultimate and unavoidable end."" pg. 209""Campbell recalled that he felt he had been 'conversing with a supernatural intelligence.' Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably 'ceased to exist' millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. 'The light did travel after the body was gone.' After leaving Herschel, Campbell walked onto the shingle of Brighton beach, gazing out to sea, feeling 'evelvated and overcome.' He was reminded of Newton's observation that he was just a child picking up shells on the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay all before him."" pg. 210""It is evident that the death of his father, and all the subsequent emotional upheavals, profoundly shook the sixteen-year-old Davy, and started an intellectual ferment that never left him. Besides writing poetry, he also started his first diary, set himself reading lists and work timetables, and began a series of essays on religion versus materialism. During 1796 he wrote an essay 'On Mathematics,' and another 'On Consciousness,' which gleefully explored the implications of materialism. He described the body as 'a fine tuned Machine,' and wrote a syllogistic proof that the 'soul' could not exist, since it was said to be eternal and 'unchangeable,' while every known part of the human body, including the brain, was temporary and changed perpetually. 'QED the soul does not exist.'"" pg. 243""One of Burney's many extraordinary reflections was whether extreme physical pain could not only induce unconsciousness--'I have two total chasms in my memory of this transaction'--but actually force the soul out of the body. She also found that the act of recollection carried its own pain, and that she had taken three months to complete the account, as a letter of nearly 10,000 words to her sister Esther. She had severe headaches every time she tried to go on with it. Once finished, she could not look back over what she had written. 'I dare not revise, nor read, the recollection is still so painful.' It is an astonishing record of courage, not least in Fanny's determination to protect her husband from the trauma of the operation. But it also recalls what the real conditions of surgery were at this period."" pg. 306""But speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical ideas of Friedrich Schelling and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine, perhaps best translated as 'science mysticism,' defined the entire natural world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity as a series of 'polarities.' According to Schelling's doctrine, the whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical objects 'aspired' to become something higher. There was a 'world-soul' constantly 'evolving' higher life forms and 'levels of consciousness' in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards a higher state."" pg. 315""Davy's notebooks for this period also suggest a new pattern of philosophical speculation, almost approaching German Naturphilosophie. Some of his observations would have been recognised by Coleridge: 'The aspirations for immortality are movements of the mind similar to those which a bird makes with its wings before they are furnished with feathers.' Others were more closely tied to his laboratory work. On the subject of scientific 'analogy,' for instance, he wondered if there was a wider principle at work. 'Probably there is an analogy in all existence: the divided tail of the fish is linked in a long succession of like objects with the biped man. In the planetary system it is probable man will be found connected with a higher intellectual nature; and it is possible that the monad, or soul, is constantly undergoing a series of progressions.'"" pg. 357""In November 1827 Davy returned briefly to London to resign his presidency of the Royal Society. He later gave a moving glimpse of his disillusion with his own scientific career on this sad return: 'In my youth, and through the prime of manhood, I never entered London without feelings of pleasure and hope. It was to me as the grand theatre of intellectual activity, the field of every species of enterprise and exertion, the metropolis of the world of business, thought, and action ... I now entered the great city in a very different tone of mind, one of settled melancholy ... My health was gone, my ambition was satisfied, I was no longer excited by the desire of distinction; what I regarded most tenderly [my mother], was in the grave ... My cup of life was no longer sparkling, sweet, and effervescent ... it has become bitter.' In a wonderfully sardonic aside, Davy added that this metaphor of the 'cup of life' was scientifically derived from the chemical fermentation of 'the juice of the grape,' and then after a certain lapse of time, its oxidisation and acidification."" pg. 419""Babbage perhaps intended a sort of parable of science for the new generation. His story went as follows. When Babbage first peered carefully at the shimmering solar image projected through Herschel's prism, he could not see these dark Fraunhofer lines, though he knew they were there. Herschel then commented to him: 'An object is frequently not seen, from not knowing how to see it, rather than from any deficit in the organ of vision ... I will instruct you how to see them.' After some time spent re-examining and refocusing the image, Babbage could see them perfectly. The point was that science must always be more than the simple observation of phenomena or data. It was simultaneously a subjective training in observation skills, self-criticism and interpretation: a complete education. This was of course precisely what William Herschel had said forty years before, about learning to see with a telescope."" pg. 440Book: borrowed from the SSF Main Library."

124,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,5,"In writing this review, I am keeping in mind that an old and very dear friend of mine (who has read and liked this book) is highly interested in my evaluation. I mention this because it leads to an important point about the book: the background of the reader will strongly determine what he or she gets out of reading The Age of Wonder. For my part, I approach this work as a sociologist who is currently (fall 2013) preparing to take a doctoral exam in the sociology of science. Hence, I already have some grounding in this field and I will use this book as deep background for my own work in science and technology studies.To extract the maximum value from this work, the reader will need some knowledge of Romanticism and the history and philosophy of science – in particular the “two cultures” debate deriving from C.P. Snow’s famous work of that name. This is not to say that this book is entirely useless to the reader lacking such a background, but it will be more difficult for the reader to grasp the overall argument, as Holmes does not provide such contextualization. However, his skills as a biographer are so good that the reader can derive enormous value simply reading the book as a set of biographical vignettes and it would not be a waste of time.  However, the core of Holmes’ work involves an extended critique of the notion that art and science are invariably at odds. Holmes’ objective is to show that this tension is largely a product of Late Romanticism (early 19th Century) and in sociological terms is very much a cultural and political “project”. Indeed, Holmes provides compelling evidence not only that science and art are not inherently adversarial but that in Early Romanticism the two were deeply interconnected and (Holmes argues) drew strength from each other. Hence the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) was not only a Romantic author but worked with Humphry Davy (the chemist) and conducted experiments with prisms in Germany. Davy for his part wrote both early science fiction as well as poetry. And these are but two examples that Holmes provides. He builds a picture of how through Romantic philosophy both science and art were unified by the feature intrinsic to both: creative thought. In this way, Romantic science can be distinguished from the more purely rationalistic viewpoint of the Early Enlightenment (in the works of Descartes, Spinoza, and Hobbes for example). Spinoza forms a case in point (I get this from Steven Nadler’s study of Spinoza in A Book Forged in Hell). Spinoza asserted that there was no role for imagination in rational society (including science) and that knowledge was based on the accumulation of facts. However, scientists of the Romantic Age (and after, such as Richard Feynman) dismissed the adequacy of simply collecting facts. Scientific understanding required conceptual breakthroughs, and this was only available via creative thought and imagination. (The cultural meme of the creative scientific breakthrough – Archimedes’ “Eureka!” moment – remains strong in present day public understanding of science. Witness how nonscientists regard Einstein or Stephen Hawking.)All of this is a long way from the divided and acrimonious relation between art and science described by C.P. Snow in his landmark “The Two Cultures”. Holmes locates the inflection point at the “Immortal Dinner” held in December 1817 by the fundamentalist Christian painter Benjamin Haydon (see pages 318-321). Attending this event were the poets William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, and John Keats. However, Holmes notes that this dinner did not include Coleridge, Byron, or Shelley – persons whom Holmes asserts would have had no patience for either Haydon’s rhetorical aims or the acrimony towards science espoused by their fellow poets. In the long run, however, the constructed antipathy between art and science put forward at the “Immortal Dinner” have become part of the dogma about science and art.Holmes’ central objective in Age of Wonder, then, is to usefully refute the “Two Cultures” hypothesis and to provide biographical evidence of its inadequacy both past and present as well as to partly rehabilitate the role of Romantic art and sensibility in furthering the Scientific Revolution – a viewpoint joined by Lisa Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution) and others, including, interestingly, the arch-atheist Richard Dawkins. Within the limits of my knowledge, I feel that Holmes has successfully provided a rich source of materials for his case as well as vivid biographical portraits of the personalities involved in this second stage of the English Scientific Revolution – with Lisa Jardine having provided a very useful synopsis of the first stage of the English Scientific Revolution.However, Holmes does not provide a good overall contextualization of the issues at stake, making it difficult for those without existing specialist knowledge to either understand or to evaluate his thesis. This contextualization would not have to be large – a short chapter at the beginning of the book, or rather a reworking of his introduction – would suffice to ease general readers into the debate on “two cultures” (he never actually deals with C.P. Snow’s thesis in depth here – a significant omission. Another issue is that this work is almost entirely Anglo-centric, with some mention of Antoine Lavoisier, Alexandre Charles, the Mongolfiers, and other French and German scientists. This Anglo-centrism is merited to a degree because of the key role played by Britain in the early Industrial and Scientific Revolutions. But at the same time, the reader can wonder how well Holmes’ interpretation of Romantic science translates to the broader European context. So, in closing, while this is a great book, it is not a standalone work. To extract full value from it, I would recommend looking at the back of the book, where Holmes provides a highly welcome background reading list. For anyone interested in modern political and intellectual history, some knowledge of Romanticism is a must and well worth acquiring. By the same token, some knowledge of either the sociology of science or the history and philosophy of science (these can be somewhat adversarial fields) will provide context for why it is important to understand how scientists actually practice their craft as well as the greater social context in which science takes place (see for instance Bruno Latour, Laboratory Life.) So, while I would recommend this book for anyone interested in science and early modern history, it is a book that provides greater rewards for external study than most. "
125,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"This book took me an unusually long time to finish, which at first I was inclined to blame on my own deficiencies. But by the time I finished the book, I was otherwise inclined. Quite simply, this book seemed to strive mightily to connect the major Romantic poets to some major Romantic-era scientists, but ultimately the author’s thesis fell flat for me. Granted, I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book, which focused on Joseph Banks’ voyages to Tahiti, the brother and sister astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, the African odyssey of Mungo Park, and the escapades of daredevil balloonists. Holmes does an admirable job of writing juicy mini-biographies of these and other personages, but, dazzled as I was by his eye for detail and ability to enable the reader to peer beneath his subjects’ skin, early on I found myself a bit baffled at why these disparate people were sharing space in the same volume. Then, in subsequent chapters, particularly those devoted to chemist/poet Humphrey Davy, I hit a wall. Davy, to me, was not nearly as engaging a person, despite his obvious brilliance and importance, but more to the point, at this point in the book the author begins to strain very hard to bring in connections to the Romantic poets. Davy was friends with Coleridge and wrote a great deal of (alas, not very good) poetry himself. Holmes quotes reams of Davy’s poetry (which I immediately learned to skim), as well as poetry by Coleridge, Keats, Byron and Shelley. And it was at this point that I sincerely wished that the author were NOT a specialist and biographer of the Romantic poets, for he strained so often and so hard to work in any poetic reference, however tangential, to science that I became quite impatient. His thesis.... well, I’m not entirely sure what it was, to be honest. (And hence my initial impulse to feel it was my fault as a reader, for surely there is a thesis?) Something about how the divisions between science and poetry/philosophy are artificial and that, indeed, we should endeavor to unite the two fields, which are both grounded in wonder.  But, gee, that’s an awfully broad net to cast, don’t you think? I’m afraid the result was a great deal of bycatch. Then, too, during the second half of the book, the discussion of Davy et al. becomes quite bogged down in the discussion of Davy’s various relationships (romantic and otherwise), the political wranglings of the Royal Society, and the rise or fall of various scientists’ reputations. The narrative became dense and hard to follow. However, I persisted to the end of the book, feeling that, surely, the author would tie all these disparate strands together for me in some cohesive way.No such luck. "
126,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn,4,"Interest and Science TogetherThis book is meant to emphasize that research and art go together and are inseparable. Holmes discusses how leisure time gave way to thought,involvement and art caused the scientific revolution a a is could not exist without the other. He uses examples from all over Europe and pulls stories out quite well. "
127,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"“Science is truly a relay race, with each discovery handed on to the next generation. Even as one door is closing, another door is already being thrown open. So it is with this book. For this, I believe science needs to be presented and explored in a new way. We need not only a new history of science, but a more enlarged and imaginative biographical writing about individual scientists. The old, rigid debates and boundaries — science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics — are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.”I am abashed at how much of this book I did not know, and am grateful that I do now. Slightly dry and scattered, it was hard to get through, not full of wonder but details, but worth the time. I wish there was a timeline, as the narrative moves all over the place, ostensibly chronologically but confusingly.The revolution of the time was an explosion of astronomy, chemistry, geology, exploration of the world, and changes in society “to the point that the greatest astronomer of the age would turn out to be an immigrant German musician (William Herschel and his sister!), the greatest chemist was the son of a Welsh ne’er-do-well (Humphry Davy), and a whole new branch of study—electromagnetism—would be founded by the son of a blacksmith (Michael Faraday). All these figures appear as characters in Holmes’ fascinating work, along with poets, novelists, explorers, aristocrats and even balloonists.” The scientist was also philosopher, and the lines were blurred. The author includes poetry that was inspired by the science, by Coleridge, Byron, Keats, and Shelley, and that adds a layer to the Ancient Mariner and other famous poems of the time that might be my favorite part of the book. I am reading The Second Mountain by David Brooks, and he writes of times in history when the moral ecology was changing, and Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael would say when Mother Culture gets more strident, and the frog in the boiling water doesn’t feel the heat yet. I can see the arc of time in this age of wonder, and how scientists of the time had an intense drive to be an individual, to achieve grand and stupendous things (telescopes to discover Uranus, mapping Africa, discovering potassium, etc) with recklessness and fearlessness. “Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration. These were Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world expedition aboard the Endeavour, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage to the Galapagos islands aboard the Beagle, begun in 1831. This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder, and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”I had always revered the Enlightenment Age so may have glossed over anything called Romantic, hence the ignorance. The author focuses on three Romantic themes: ballooning, global exploration and soul hunting along with the science. The author writes that far back in antiquity, “Plato argued that the notion of ‘wonder’ was central to all philosophical thought: ‘In Wonder all Philosophy began: in Wonder it ends…But the first Wonder is the Offspring of Ignorance; the last is the Parent of Adoration.’” This was quite lost during the rational Enlightenment and the Romantic poets put the wonder back into the science, and drew the lay people in to experience it. Can you imagine scads of modern poetry written about Carl Sagan or Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Like Wordsworth:Romantic traveller amidst the stars: And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The Antechapel where the Statue stood Of Newton, with his prism and his silent face, The marble index of a Mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.Wordsworth again:My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky; So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man...Epigraphs:He thought about himself, and the whole Earth, Of Man the wonderful, and of the Stars, And how the deuce they ever could have birth; And then he thought of Earthquakes, and of Wars, How many miles the Moon might have in girth, Of Air-balloons, and of the many bars To perfect Knowledge of the boundless Skies; And then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes. BYRON, Don Juan (1819)Those to whom the harmonious doors Of Science have unbarred celestial stores … WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ‘Lines Additional to an Evening Walk’ (1794)Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific … JOHN KEATS, ms of sonnet (1816)“Their minutely recorded telescope observations, published in over a hundred papers by the Royal Society, would change not only the public conception of the solar system, but of the whole Milky Way galaxy and the structure and meaning of the universe itself. It was immediately apparent that Herschel had created an instrument of unparalleled light-gathering power and clarity. He saw, for example, what very few astronomers even suspected: that the Pole Star — which had been the key to navigation, and the poet’s traditional emblem of steadiness and singularity, for centuries — was not in fact one star at all, but two stars.”“Surrounded by infinite space, and swallowed up in an immensity of being, man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean, mixed and confounded with the general mass. But from this situation, perplexing as it is, he endeavours to extricate himself; and by looking abroad into Nature, employs the powers she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.”“An unfathomably larger universe was steadily opening up, and this gradually transformed popular notions of the size and mystery of the world ‘beyond the heavens’Indeed, the very terms ‘world’, ‘heaven’ and ‘universe’ began to changetheir meanings. It was the psychological breakthrough that Kant had predicted in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens back in 1755: ‘We may cherish the hope that new plane is being uncovered.”Poetry from Erasmus Darwin celebrating the astronomical discoveries of Herschel:When Love Divine, with brooding wings unfurl’d, Call’d from the rude abyss the living World, ‘Let there be Light!’, proclaimed the Almighty Lord, Astonish’d Chaos heard the potent word; Through all his realms the kindling ether runs And the mass starts into a million Suns. Earths round each Sun with quick explosions burst, And second Planets issue from the first; Bend as they journey with projectile force, In bright ellipses their reluctant course; Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll, And form, self-balanced, one revolving whole. – Onward they move, amid their bright abode, Space.David Bourgeois both published handbooks to the science of flight in 1784. Bourgeois opened ecstatically: ‘The idea of taking to the air, of flying through sky, and navigating through the ether, has always appealed so strongly to mankind, that it has appeared in numerous classical legends and folktales from the remotest antiquity. The wings of Saturn, the eagle of Jupiter, the peacocks of Juno, the doves of Venus, the winged horses of the Sun all bear witness …’ By the end of 1784, the second year of the great balloon craze, no fewer than 181 manned ascents had been recorded, mostly in France and England.Jeffries also gave the first truly vivid account of the changing appearance of the ground as seen ‘from a bird’s eye view, as it is called’. This too was constantly surprising. As they took off, there was the white sea of upturned faces in the city squares, swiftly reduced to tiny, unrecognisable points. There was the unearthly silence, the sense of their own motionlessness as the earth seemed to revolve below the basket. Though they did not appear to move, their compass needle steadily turned. Below them, the earth appeared transformed. There was the strange flattening out of hills and buildings, the emergence of previously unsuspected patterns in the foliage of woods, or the cultivation marks in fields, or the branching streets of a town. There was the constantly delusive appearance of clouds, and sudden showers of rain or even snowflakes. (No electrical charges were recorded, much to Jeffries’ relief.) The whole world became ‘like a beautifully coloured map or carpet’Wordsworth began his poem Peter Bell (1798) with a playful image of flying in a sort of dirigible airship, or balloon boat. There’s something in a flying Horse, There’s something in a huge Balloon: But through the Clouds I’ll never float Until I have a little Boat Shaped like the crescent-Moon … Away we go! — and what care we For treason, tumults, and for wars? We are as calm in our Delight As is the crescent-Moon so bright Among the scattered Stars.Perhaps Shelley put it best:‘The balloon has not yet received the perfection of which it is surely capable; the art of navigating the air is in its first and most helpless infancy; the aerial mariner still swims on bladders, and has not yet mounted the rude raft … It would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned. It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa? — Why do we not despatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction, and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon, which a vertical sun would project precisely underneath it, as it glided over that hitherto unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.’This method of viewing the galaxies (‘to continue the simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom’) presented the entire universe in a new kind of light, with the most radical implications. ‘The heavens are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions, in different flourishing beds … and we can extend the range of our experience [of them] to an immense duration.’Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that ‘deep space’ must also imply ‘deep time’. He wrote in his Preface: A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past … [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand — that is — almost two million years on their way.’ The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great dealof explanation to the layman.Keats likens his own discovery of Homer’s poetry to the experience of the great astronomer and the great explorer finding new worlds. … Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific — and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise – Silent upon a peak in Darien.Herschel also mentioned applying Newton’s theories for measuring the speed of solar light to ‘inconceivably distant bodies’ in the stellar system, with unimaginable results. ‘Then speaking of himself, he said with a modesty of manner that quite overcame me, when taken with the greatness of the assertion: “I have looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars of which the light, it can be proved, must have taken millions of years to reach the earth.”’Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably ‘ceased to exist’ millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. ‘The light did travel after the body was gone.’Banks was soon sponsoring small but highly adventurous expeditions into Egypt and the horn of Africa. Its motives at this stage were scientific and commercial, with no missionary or colonial intentions. Its primary aim was discovery, not conquest. This would change once Banks was appointed to the Privy Council in 1797, and became ever more closely involved in prosecuting the war against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then all exploration took on a more political and frankly imperial significance. Yet Africa and Australia always fascinated Banks for their own sake.Explorer Mungo Park: “At this moment, painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small moss in fructification, irresistibly caught my eye. I mention this to show from what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive consolation; for though the whole plant was not larger than the top of one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves, and capsula, without admiration.’ In that moment of pure scientific wonder, Park’s thoughts and outlook were transformed: ‘Can the Being (thought I) who planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed?”Shelley’s wilderness, while it includes ‘dark Aethiopia in her desert hills’, is geographically vague, though it moves more towards India and an imaginary East. But he catches something of Mungo Park’s enigmatic wanderlust, and transforms it into an unearthly Miltonic quest for the strange and magnificent limits of the known world: The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, And o’er the aerial mountains which pour down Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, In joy and exultation held his way; Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched His languid limbs.I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air …To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling … A mind that has once imbibed a taste for scientific enquiry has within itself an inexhaustible source of pure and exciting contemplations. One would think that Shakespeare had such a mind in view when he describes a contemplative man finding Tongues in trees — books in the running brooks Sermons in stones — and good in everything Where the uninformed and unenquiring eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he walks in the midst of wonders. It is intriguing that Herschel was quoting from Shakespeare’s As You Like .."
128,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This is a fascinating account of the growth of science in Romantic Age of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Holmes looks at the period through the lives of ground-breaking scientists, and illuminates the intersections between science, literature, and art during the period.Among the scientists discussed in detail are Joseph Banks, William and Caroline Herschel, Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday, and a collection of truly nutty but ground-breaking (or is that, and ground-breaking) balloonists.One of the most engaging aspects of science in this period is that it was all new enough that any smart, interested person with some (not necessarily large) resources could potentially make an important contribution. Joseph Banks was educated as a botanist, and made one of his greatest contributions with detailed and insightful anthropological observations of the Tahitians. William Herschel was trained as a musician, and his sister Caroline barely educated at all; they became prominent astronomers who made major contributions to the study of the heavens. Michael Faraday was a bookseller who was hired by Humphrey Davy as a lab assistant. Some of these men were born wealthy; some were not. None started out on the path where they made their greatest contributions.Joseph Banks accompanied James Cook on the first of his voyages to the south Pacific, as a naturalist, the same role in which Charles Darwin later sailed on the HMS Beagle. A major purpose of that voyage was to observe an eclipse of the sun that would be visible in Tahiti. While Banks did a great deal of botany while he was in Tahiti, he also made extensive and detailed observations of the Tahitians, differing from most of his fellow British by being open to--indeed, becoming deeply involved in, the Tahitian culture. Initially friendly relations with the Tahitians soured as Cook and others, unable or unwilling to let go of their own preconceptions, repeatedly offended them. After they left Tahiti, the voyage deteriorated further, with conflicts, epidemic illness, and death. The survivors, including Cook and Banks, arrived back in Britain devastated and took months to recover. Still a young man at this point, Banks was at the beginning of his career, and remained a major force in British science for decades to come--but less as a scientist himself, rather as the president of the Royal Society, guiding and encouraging the scientific careers of others.With Banks' story setting the framework, we see the Herschels start out as a musician and his singer/housekeeper sister and become two of the most important astronomers of the age, Davy beginning as a medical student and transforming into a chemist and engineer, and then into a mystical, visionary writer. We see the beginnings of true specialization in science, and the founding of the first subject-specialized science professional associations, separate from the Royal Society, which had, and still sought, to encompass them all. We see, also, the connections and interactions between the scientists and the writers and artists of the age, including Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats.It's a fascinating story, and I promise I have not even scratched the surface of it. Holmes seeks to reveal character as well as accomplishments, and show the ways in which the romantic sensibility, which we generally thing of as antithetical to science, in fact inspired and encouraged the Romantic Age scientists.Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from the local library."

He falls head over heels in love with William Herschel’s sister Caroline, so essential to Hershel’s exploration of the heavens through a series of homemade telescopes, the only kind of telescope to be had at the time. The story of Humphrey Davy inventing the safety lamp that saved so many coal miners’ lives is so real he might have been an eyewitness, including all the times Davy blows up at Michael Faraday, not to mention all the times he blows up his lab. 	Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats were fascinated and inspired by these new scientific explorations and discoveries, and employed many of them as images in their work. There is a whole chapter on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, where Holmes traces the Monster’s beginnings to lectures given at the Royal Society in London, which Shelley attended and which included the attempt by one philosopher to use a primitive form of electricity to shock a corpse back to life. Eeew. 	Holmes writes of what may have been our most polymathic age in deft and witty prose. Of Herschel, an accomplished musician as well as an astronomer, he writes, “He moved from earthly music to the music of the spheres.” He writes demurely of the balloon ascension of a Mr. Biggin and a Mrs. Sage, which may or may not have given birth to the Mile High Club. He quotes a contemporary critic as saying, somewhat apologetically, “Poetical descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid principles of the Science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple unadorned language.” 	And then Holmes lets Keats underline the point,  …Then felt I like some watcher of the skies	When a new planet swims into his ken...	That watcher of the skies was Herschel. And the new planet? Uranus."
130,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027264-monika,5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. What strikes me most about Holmes is his ability to weave together what modern man has learned to compartmentalize- the sciences and the humanities. Before science was ""science,"" it was natural philosophy. Before scientists were ""scientists,"" they were natural philosophers and poets. Richard Holmes brings science and art back together in order to tell the story of how the late eighteenth century produced the foundation of what would become modern science. Framing the book with the story of Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who took part in Captain Cook's expedition to Tahiti later becoming the president of the Royal Society, Holmes moves to William Herschel, the musician and amateur astronomer who would discover Uranus with a telescope of his own making, and his sister, Caroline, who herself was responsible for discovering several comets. From the Herschel's the story moves to Mungo Parks and his travels to Africa and mapping of the Congo, followed by Sir Humphry Davy, who many believe is the founder of modern chemistry.What makes this book a wonder, however, is the pervasive spirit of inquiry of the age. Whereas now we seem to accept platitudes like ""I'm good at English, so I must not be good at math,"" this age embraced the idea that the only way to express the wonder of science is through poetry, literature, and the arts. Poets like Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley attended lectures from the great thinkers of the age, then expressed the same concerns about man's place in the world as the men who gave the lectures. What a time it must have been... human curiosity leading to unimaginable discoveries, discoveries that would forever alter the way we view our place in the universe... and such is the terror. To borrow from Carl Jung, this period marked the dawning of our self-awareness as a species in a universe that very quickly became immeasurably large and unimaginably old. Suddenly, we became ants in an ant farm instead of products of some intelligent design... Richard Holmes captures the complexities of the period in a most poetic way. I will be coming back to this book many times."

I enjoyed learning about the various people, scientists as well as non-scientists. I like that Holmes gives so much detail about, for instance, the grinding of the mirror for the telescope. And how it was paid for. For me, the book would be just as enjoyable if it was a collection of anecdotes and free of any speculation as to whether or how the literature and paintings of the time may or may not have influenced the scientists of that time. Holmes undertakes the great challenge of finding connections between Romantic notions and the scientific pursuits of those times. I really don't see how such connections can be made without knowing the biographies of the scientists well enough to know the extent of their interest in Romantic notions. That can be hard to know for anyone. I did enjoy learning that S.T. Coleridge was solicited to join a convention of people doing science, at least partly for the purpose of helping to choose a word to apply to the people who do science. As a result of this convention, the word scientist came into general use. It seemed to me that, of all the regard these scientists had for Romantic notions, Holmes related more about Humphry Davies' than any other. "
132,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/392337-sarah,5,"This is an amazing book. It doesn't have as much to do with literary Romanticism as I had originally hoped, but by the end of the first chapter I didn't care. Holmes is an excellent writer, and he makes the excitement and amazement of the scientists and explorers he profiles live. I think my favorite sections are the ones that deal with Joseph Banks, who went on a scientific voyage to Tahiti as a young man and, despite a successful career as a botanist in England, mentor to many younger scientists, and long-time president of the Royal Society, never seems to have found anything that moved him in the same way as Tahiti. To some extent, this book is a series of linked biographies: Banks, astronomer William Herschel and his sister Caroline, Sir Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday. Holmes is also very good at drawing out the political (whether national competition over who should be credited with discoveries or in-fighting over who should lead the various scientific societies) and philosophical (German Romantic writers and Coleridge make appearances here) implications of the scientific discoveries involved. It's not often a book is so informative, gripping, and well written all at once. "
133,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,4,"This was the first book assigned for my new semester, which means I'm going back to reading school stuff round the clock again, but luckily this first one was a great one. It's really a combined biography of Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Science, explorer of Tahiti), William Herschel (discovered Uranus), and Humphrey Davy (experimented with nitrous oxide, and also became President of Royal Society), along with a couple of other secondary stories. The best is probably the history behind Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, tracing it to the debates about the existence of a cosmic ""vitalist"" force, a debate that originated in the circle of German ""nature philosopher"" Frederich Schelling.The book was probably too long though, and plodded through parts of Herschel's and Davy's biographies (especially Davy's atrocious poetry), but it does do a great job showing how the worlds of Romantic literature and early modern science interacted. One takeaway, they all loved Coleridge."
134,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43247-emi-bevacqua,3,"This book is kind of the ultimate departure from my personal comfort zone: nearly 500 pages on the history of western science juxtaposed with poetry. Richard Holmes is an amazing researcher and writer, he really brings the age to life and I loved the beautiful color art inserts. The first section was very straightforward, about the young explorer Joseph Banks and his discoveries in Tahiti; in the next we meet a young astronomist that Banks discovered, named William Herschel and also his sister-assistant Caroline. Then with each chapter and introduction to subsequent scientists the reader is keeping track of more and more complexity, collegial scientists and poets, their discoveries and published work, their travels, and family relations! Throughout it all - anthropology, cosmology, flight, mesmerism, chemistry - the unifying thread is the history of the Royal Society of London scientists, led for the most part by Joseph Banks. My favorite quote is when somebody asks ""What's the use of a (hot air) balloon?"" and Benjamin Franklin responds, ""What's the use of a newborn baby?"" "
135,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,0,"There is obviously something wrong with me. Everyone raves about this book - so far I am finding it choppy, hard to read, all over the map and not particularly well-written. Holmes's penchant for including every detail of everything he ever read about his subjects is exhausting - a better writer would take the trouble to pare things down in the service of a more readable narrative. Part of my disappointment so far is that I didn't find Joseph Banks, the subject of the first 70 pages, a particularly engaging or interesting character. His major contribution to scientific progress appears to have been to bring back a bunch of specimens from Tahiti, a fundamentally pedestrian activity. Darwin's voyage on The Beagle was interesting because of how he subsequently synthesized his observations - Banks is a far duller character, no matter how many natives he slept with.Maybe things will pick up with Herschel and Davy."

We need to understand how science is actually made; how scientists themselves think and feel and speculate. We need to explore what makes scientists creative, as well as poets or painters, or musicians. That is how this book began. The old, rigid debates and boundaries -- science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics -- are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.
The Age of Wonder isn't quite the book I expected it to be: I was looking forward to a lot of science, which I find intriguing, but I found this work to be laden down with a lot of biographical information, which I find to be less so. The Romantic Period must have been an astonishing time to be alive, indeed an Age of Wonder; a time when any amateur, even a foreign musician like William Herschel, with enough curiosity and funds could literally point out new discoveries in the self-same night sky humans had been regarding for millennia. A privileged young man, like Joseph Banks, could buy himself passage on a voyage of discovery under Captain Cook and, in the process of collecting botanical specimens from Tahiti, invent the new field of Anthropology. Science, at the beginning of this period, was accessible and democratic: a barely educated young man, like Humphrey Davy, was able to wrest the study of the elements from the grip of the Alchemists and properly begin the discipline of Chemistry -- no longer searching for how to transmute the impossible, Davy (et al) did simple experiments to discover what does happen. Imagine a time when that was revolutionary thinking. Imagine if there were still basic discoveries to be made in nature; discoveries waiting to be plucked like low hanging fruit.I was delighted by the intersections between Science and Literature and Philosophy; how each informed the others; how so many of these early Scientists not only rubbed elbows with the likes of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Byron, but also expressed their own amazement in well-regarded verse. This also worked in reverse, with the great poets of the age attending scientific lectures in order to learn the terminology, the great metaphors of the day -- could this possibly be happening today?This book is exhaustive, and ultimately, I found that to be…exhausting. The following is more for my own memory than part of a proper review (and as I would probably advise anyone reading this review to just end here, I'm going to hide it all as a spoiler).(view spoiler)[I was charmed by Banks in Tahiti, and appreciated all of the primary source materials that were provided (the personal letters and journals and articles that filled in the big picture, that made the age come alive), but in some later sections these additions felt gossipy and a bit pointless. My favourite part from Tahiti: On their last day they discovered an enormous stone 'marai' or funeral monument, shaped like a pyramid, some forty-four feet high and nearly 300 feet wide, with steps of superbly polished white coral down both sides. This, the 'masterpiece' of Tahitian architecture on the island, was unsettling to Banks because its construction seemed technically inexplicable. 'It is beyond belief that Indians could raise so large a structure without the assistance of Iron tools to shape their stones or mortar to join them.'Not far away was another mystery: a huge wicker man constructed of basketwork, evidently for some obscure sacrificial rite. 'The whole was neatly covered with feathers, white to represent skin and black to represent hair and tattow.' I love stuff like that, and yes, I watch Ancient Aliens: not because I believe extraterrestrials built this curious 'marai', but because I revel in the mystery of these sorts of ancient structures and monuments and that show has a new one for me every week. Because of the noted intersections with literature, I was jotting down the books I was reminded of as I was reading. For this section, it was : Jamrach's Menagerie, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Unfamiliar Fishes (and how sad to note the evolution of Captain Cook from his empathetic treatment of the Tahitians to his brutality towards the Hawaiins), Parrot and Olivier in America, Moby Dick.I enjoyed the first section on William Herschel, but again, the biographical information was simply overwhelming -- I would have much preferred a general overview of his life in Hanover before emigrating to England and found no benefit at all in the biographies of his family members other than Caroline. When the book revisited the Herchels later -- more of the same and more of the same plus the details of his marriage and family -- I was seriously bored. I suppose the fact that his son, John, went on to become a leading figure in the Victorian Age of Science explains why we must follow William to the grave, but that wasn't what I wanted from this book (which I understand is a fault of my own, not the author). Since Caroline was profoundly affected by the Lisbon earthquake, I was put in mind of Candide and also of Frankenstein (not realising this book would be quoted at great length later).I was amused by the section on ballooning, and appreciate how at the time it must have seemed like the dawn of the Jetsons with their flying cars, but since in the end it was dismissed as a fad, more suited to carnivals than scientific study, I don't know that it belonged in this book. I did like this part: Benjamin Franklin, American Ambassador in Paris, watched the launch (of the first manned balloon flight) through a telescope from the window of his carriage. Afterwards he remarked: 'Someone asked me -- what's the use of a balloon? I replied - what's the use of a newborn baby?'Obvious choices, but I was reminded of Around the World in Eighty Days and The Wizard of Oz.Age of Wonder picked up (after another dull visit with the Herchels) when it told the thrilling story of Mongo Park and his two expeditions to find the source of the Niger in Africa. While the first trip was pure adventurism, the second smacked of imperialism, and it was probably due to his own self-important beliefs that he failed to pay due respect to the local tribes and was never seen again. Literary tie-ins: Heart of Darkness (for which Park was likely the inspiration for Kurtz), and because so much of this book takes place during the Napoleonic years and the war between France and Britain, A Tale of Two Cities.Humphrey Davy was a Poet and Chemist who experimented on himself with Nitrous Oxide, like a Timothy Leary for his time, without making the leap to its use in surgery. (A later section on the mastectomy that Fanny Burney endured without benefit of anesthetic made for a harrowing reading experience, but it was one more event that I wasn't certain belonged in what I thought this book was meant to be). Davy then made the leap to the study of Galvinism, and this sparked the great debates about Vitalism and ""is there an animating principle"" -- a soul? -- in humans, the great parlour discussion topic of the time, and that led to the first inklings of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This was interesting, but the very lengthy quoting from the book and its reception by the public and the stage play that came later -- all of this seemed beside the point to me. As was Davy's disintegrating marriage and political dealings with the Royal Academy of Science and his ""little nurse in Illyria"" -- so much biography, so little actual science. I did, however, appreciate when Davy put his mind to creating a safety-lamp for miners -- his great effort to demonstrate that science was for the benefit of mankind; theory that may be put into practise. The literary tie-ins at this point were all poetry: Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Prometheus Unbound.  (hide spoiler)]Okay, so after that long stretch of what was interesting and not so interesting to me, I return to Richard Holme's quote that I started with, the bit he actually ended with, and specifically:  Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. How many of us have this hope and wonder? I don't know that I believe the scientists of today are imbued with hope and wonder; that they are philosophical about their work; that they have the creative souls of artists. But perhaps I'm wrong and I thank Age of Wonder for forcing me to think of Science in this way.I wanted to love this book, but it was ultimately brought down by the immensity of the information it contained -- had it left out the society news and letters from home, I might have enjoyed it much more. "
137,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23672960-brian-willis,5,"Conventional wisdom places the scientific and rational achievements of the Age of Enlightenment in direct opposition to the fundamental values of the age of Romanticism in the arts. Poetry and art exuberantly shifted from an emphasis on cold rationality and collective achievement as well as logical procedures of the calculating mind towards exploration of the sentimentality of the human spirit, the individual within the natural world, and the subconscious. In other words, the movement was from the visible (or that which could be explained through rational observation) towards explaining the invisible (the interior subjective human self, the passions, the drives, and impulses that cannot be explained through science, at least in that era).Richard Holmes, perhaps the great living biographer of the Romantic era presents us with a multi-part biography of the scientists that influenced the Romantics, but instead of playing the party line of this dialectic, he demonstrates that the Romantic Era existed INFUSED with the spirit of exploration of the science of the age. Beginning with Sir Joseph Banks, he explains the foundation of the Royal Society. Then he divides a large part of the book following and documenting the life and achievements of Sir William Herschel and Sir Humphrey Davy. Herschel made his fame discovering Uranus, but Holmes argues effectively that his development of advanced telescopes as well as a method towards cataloguing the night sky were influential for future generations. One of the unsung heroes of the book is Caroline Herschel, his sister, who actually become the first patronized and influential female astronomer. Davy expanded our knowledge of natural gases and their containment, most effectively with his staggering safety lamp for miners. Other topics discussed are the passion for tales of the exploits of explorer Mungo Park and the origination of aerial flight through hot air ballooning. Holmes ties these achievements into the ongoing saga of the leading Romantics, particularly their encounters with Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley, and Keats (with Wordsworth gliding in the background and occasionally making an appearance). He points out moments in their compositions that reference the achievements of Banks, the Herschels, Davy, Park, Sadler, and many others. As the Romantics ascended, the reputation of science seems to have retroactively been placed into competition with the values of the age of Romanticism and later Victorianism. The Romantics grappled with the same issues that the scientists did however; the revelations of the cosmos and the sanctity of particles in observation of tiny objects were revealing the same troubling conclusions for both scientists and poets. If there are uncountable galaxies, is it ludicrous to think that Christ was crucified millions of times to redeem the universe? Surprisingly, this hint at atheism backfired on scientists and their reputation for years to come while Romantics with their celebration of pagan values and occasionally an atheist or two, somehow escaped the judgement of posterity though facing criticism in their time. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, inspired by the electrical current experimentation of Galvani, was interpreted as a condemnation of the limits of science (though that was not Shelley's intent).In the end, Holmes writes an incredibly enlightening and informative group biography, argues for the art of biography as a window into the discovery process of science, and demonstrates that these scientists not only created the profession of scientist but also the groundwork for the scientific method, as eventually perfected by Charles Darwin (who also makes an appearance). Another triumph from one of my favorite writers."
138,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16010931-douglass-gaking,5,"The Age of Wonder is a solid history of British scientists in the Romantic era. It focuses on the individual scientists' lives, their experiments, their writings–both personal and published–and their connections to each other.Scientists in focus include Joseph Banks, William Herschel, Michael Faraday, and even the fictional Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Each chapter is as in-depth as a biography.I especially like the chapter on William Herschel. I had not realized how close he came to our current understanding of the construction of the universe, despite being formally trained as a musician, and self-taught as a scientist.My main takeaway from this book is how imaginative these scientists were. Whether it is believing in the chemical nature of the soul or the existence of life on the moon, they had wild theories that certainly fit in with the sentiment of the Romantic era. While so many of these hypothesis proved to be false, whether in their lifetimes or later, it is the pursuit of proving them through experimentation that advanced human knowledge into the modern age."
139,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8355999-betsy,4,"This is an engrossing book about the development of science during the late 18th and early 19th century. It focuses on four individuals, Joseph Banks, (explorer and driving force behind the Royal Society for many years) Caroline and William Herschel (sister and brother astronomers) and Humphry Davy (chemist). Two things stand out from the rest for me. First, the author discussed women's roles in science and the role of Caroline Herschel in particular. She was the first woman awarded a stipend by the King for her astronomical work (albeit at half the rate a man would have received). Second, I was surprised by the strong overlap of science and poetry. Many of the scientists were published poets, including Herschel and Davy and many of the poets were also active in the sciences (Coleridge and Wordsworth among others).At almost 500 pages the book dragged in a few places, particularly when the author was describing societal trends rather than giving biographies of the various scientists and poets. But, all in all, well worth the time it took to read it."
140,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11684178-lauren-barr,5,"There is something about the age of exploration that I find fascinating and, yes, incredibly romantic. It makes me wish I lived in the Victorian ages just so I could go here these talks on nascent principles and ideas, no matter how off they were in the long run. In my Victorian fantasies I’m super rich and, apparently, male. But just reading about these explorers, these astronomers, these scientists developing these wonderful inventions and ideas that went on to better the world … it’s heady stuff. At times the book is a bit dry, but for the most part the subject matter is so rich you get entirely wrapped up in it."
141,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25211535-rachel,4,"This is a beautifully balanced book, which reflects the subject matter perfectly. Starting with Joseph Banks, it is ideal for anyone interested in the intellectual impact of James Cook's voyages, and takes the reader onwards into the marvellous scientific discoveries of the age, through the lives of some of the discoverers (known names, but not necessarily the ones we know most about). Very enjoyable and marvellously informative."

147,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24591006-april,4,"I enjoyed hearing the backstories of these famous men of science and discovery. It's enlightening to understand their motivation for their actions. The author was also very interested in literary pursuits of the scientists, analyzing and interpreting their poetry. I liked that philosophical men of science felt encouraged to write their own poetry. I don't believe that is the case very often nowadays.This was such a dense read. It took me a long time to get through it, not because it was poorly written or boring, but because there was so much information to absorb on each page. And each page was equally as interesting as it was dense.""To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling ... a soap bubble ... an apple ... a pebble ... He walks in the midst of wonders."" - John Herschel, A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1830). pg. xiii""But while Cook clung to the necessity of European forms and discipline, Banks was rather inclined to dwell on the superfluity of European needs. These were perhaps the reflections of a man who had always been used to wealth and comforts. 'From them appear how small are the real wants of human nature, which we Europeans have increasd to an excess which would certainly appear incredible to these people could they be told it. Nor shall we cease to increase them as long as Luxuries can be invented and riches found for the purchase of them; and how soon these Luxuries degenerate into necessaries may be sufficiently evincd by the universal use of strong liquors, Tobacco, spices, Tea &c. &c.'"" pg. 39""Riding between musical engagements, from one remote provincial northern town to another, often crossing over the moors alone at night, he found himself studying the panoply of stars overhead as he had done as a boy. He became well acquainted with the moon, and would later write that at this time he had intended 'to fix upon the moon for my habitation.' He also later told several tales about these lonely rides, one being how on one occasion he was reading so intently that when his horse stumbled and threw him, he somersaulted over its head and landed upright still holding his book in his hand, a perfect demonstration of the Newtonian law of 'circular motion.'"" pg. 74""Characteristically, Pilatre ignored these protests, and calmly went on telling d'Arlandes to work at feeding the brazier. He himself took off his bright green topcoat (put on for the crowd), rolled up his sleeves, and went on throwing on straw till his wooden fork broke. Once, when d'Arlandes was desperately shouting at him, 'We must go down! We must go down!,' Pilatre called back soothingly: 'Look d'Arlandes. Here we are above Paris. There's no possible danger for you. Are you taking this all in?' Many witnesses later said that they could hear the two men shouting excitedly to each other as they passed overhead. They assumed they were describing the glories of flight."" pg. 130""It was a glorious pink-and-yellow, candy-coloured balloon, thirty feet tall, and the crowd loved it. The wickerwork basket, a sort of chaise longue for two, was completely festooned with flags and bunting. Dr Charles had a full payload of scientific equipment aboard--mercury barometer (which was used as an early form of altimeter), thermometer, telescope, sand bags and several bottles of champagne."" pg. 131""Surprisingly, balloons did not appeal to the gothic novelist Horace Walpole, though perhaps at sixty-six he was a little old for such perilous novelties. He thought balloons might be sinister: 'Well! I hope these new mechanic meteors will prove only playthings for the learned and idle, and not be converted into new engines of destruction to the human race--as is so often the case of refinements or discoveries in Science. The wicked wit of man always studies to apply the results of talents to enslaving, destroying, or cheating his fellow creatures. Could we reach the moon, we should think of reducing it to a province of some European kingdom.' It was an ominous prophecy."" pg. 135To note: What we Americans call the Revolutionary War, the British call the American War of Independence. pg. 147""Ballooning added to this new awareness of the complexity and subtlety of clouds, a growing Romantic preoccupation which can be followed in the paintings of Turner and Constable, the notebooks of Coleridge and the poetry of Shelley. When Shelley refers to 'the locks of the approaching storm' in his 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819), he is using Howard's definition cirrus. 'The Cloud' (1820) demonstrates a remarkably accurate and scientific understanding of cloud formation and the convection cycle. Goethe wrote a number of essays on clouds, atmospheric pressures and weather, and translated passages of Howard, asking him to compose and send his Autobiography to Germany, and describing him as 'the first to define conceptually the airy and ever-changing forms of clouds, thus delimiting and fixing what had always been ephemeral and intangible, by accurate observation and naming.'"" pg. 160""Clouds became fascinating both as scientific phenomena--the generators of electricity, the mysterious indicators of winds and changing air pressure--and as aesthetic phenomena: the 'moods' of the sky reflecting those of the observer, alterations of light over landscape, symbols of change, destruction, regeneration. It could be argued that the Romantics actually invented the idea of 'the weather' itself, as it now preoccupies us; as well, of course, as 'inner weather.'"" pg. 160""Ballooning produced a new, and wholly unexpected, vision of the earth. It had been imagined that it would reveal the secrets of the heavens above, but in fact it showed the secrets of the world beneath. The early aeronauts suddenly saw the earth as a giant organism, mysteriously patterned and unfolding, like a living creature. For the first time the impact of man on nature was clearly revealed: the ever-expanding relationship of towns to countryside, roads to rivers, cultivated fields to forests, and the development of industry. It was comparable to the first views of the earth from space by the Apollo astronauts in the 1960s, producing a new concept of a 'single blue planet' with its delicate membrane of atmosphere. The famous photograph 'Earthrise' was taken from lunar orbit in December 1968."" pg. 161""As he grew older, Herschel was becoming a remoter figure in the household. His mind was ranging through the universe. His later papers for the Royal Society had begun to show an increasing awareness of the philosophical significance of astronomy. This was something urged upon him by his old supporter William Watson, who looked forward to conversations 'on Kant's metaphysics,' and wished to know how far Herschel agreed with the 'ground and sources' of Kant's philosophy of knowledge."" pg. 203""Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that 'deep space' must also imply 'deep time.' He wrote in his Preface: 'A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past ... [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand--that is--almost two million years on their way.' The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great deal of explanation to the layman."" pg. 203""Herschel continued to reach carefully towards the idea of an evolving universe, a concept as radical in its eventual implications as Erasmus Darwin's notion of evolution within plants and animals. In a late paper published in 1811, 'Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens,' Herschel further developed the idea . . . that all nebulae and large star clusters were at particular points in their sidereal life-cycles, which could be visually identified and catalogued almost in a Linnaean manner. Their characteristic shapes suggested distinct moments of youth, maturing and ageing."" pg. 204""It presented the universe as a living, growing, organic entity, with all nebulae belonging to one enormous extended family: 'There is not so much difference between them, if I may use the comparison, as there would be in an annual description of the human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a man in his prime.' This comparison is an intriguing premonition of 'time-lapse' photography, now one of the most powerful illustrative tools of modern natural history."" pg. 204-205""Physical vision--one might say scientific vision--brings about a metaphysical shift in the observer's view of reality as a whole. The geography of the earth, or the structure of the solar system, are in an instant utterly changed, and forever. The explorer, the scientific observer, the literary reader, experience the Sublime: a moment of revelation into the idea of the unbounded, the infinite."" pg. 207""At all events, it was clear that the Milky Way 'cannot last forever'; and equally that 'its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.' It followed that neither the earth, nor even the solar system, was a separate creation, but merely an infinitesimal part of a galactic evolution. Our galaxy had a physical beginning, and would have a physical conclusion. Our solar system, our planet, and hence our whole civilisation would have an ultimate and unavoidable end."" pg. 209""Campbell recalled that he felt he had been 'conversing with a supernatural intelligence.' Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably 'ceased to exist' millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. 'The light did travel after the body was gone.' After leaving Herschel, Campbell walked onto the shingle of Brighton beach, gazing out to sea, feeling 'evelvated and overcome.' He was reminded of Newton's observation that he was just a child picking up shells on the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay all before him."" pg. 210""It is evident that the death of his father, and all the subsequent emotional upheavals, profoundly shook the sixteen-year-old Davy, and started an intellectual ferment that never left him. Besides writing poetry, he also started his first diary, set himself reading lists and work timetables, and began a series of essays on religion versus materialism. During 1796 he wrote an essay 'On Mathematics,' and another 'On Consciousness,' which gleefully explored the implications of materialism. He described the body as 'a fine tuned Machine,' and wrote a syllogistic proof that the 'soul' could not exist, since it was said to be eternal and 'unchangeable,' while every known part of the human body, including the brain, was temporary and changed perpetually. 'QED the soul does not exist.'"" pg. 243""One of Burney's many extraordinary reflections was whether extreme physical pain could not only induce unconsciousness--'I have two total chasms in my memory of this transaction'--but actually force the soul out of the body. She also found that the act of recollection carried its own pain, and that she had taken three months to complete the account, as a letter of nearly 10,000 words to her sister Esther. She had severe headaches every time she tried to go on with it. Once finished, she could not look back over what she had written. 'I dare not revise, nor read, the recollection is still so painful.' It is an astonishing record of courage, not least in Fanny's determination to protect her husband from the trauma of the operation. But it also recalls what the real conditions of surgery were at this period."" pg. 306""But speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical ideas of Friedrich Schelling and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine, perhaps best translated as 'science mysticism,' defined the entire natural world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity as a series of 'polarities.' According to Schelling's doctrine, the whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical objects 'aspired' to become something higher. There was a 'world-soul' constantly 'evolving' higher life forms and 'levels of consciousness' in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards a higher state."" pg. 315""Davy's notebooks for this period also suggest a new pattern of philosophical speculation, almost approaching German Naturphilosophie. Some of his observations would have been recognised by Coleridge: 'The aspirations for immortality are movements of the mind similar to those which a bird makes with its wings before they are furnished with feathers.' Others were more closely tied to his laboratory work. On the subject of scientific 'analogy,' for instance, he wondered if there was a wider principle at work. 'Probably there is an analogy in all existence: the divided tail of the fish is linked in a long succession of like objects with the biped man. In the planetary system it is probable man will be found connected with a higher intellectual nature; and it is possible that the monad, or soul, is constantly undergoing a series of progressions.'"" pg. 357""In November 1827 Davy returned briefly to London to resign his presidency of the Royal Society. He later gave a moving glimpse of his disillusion with his own scientific career on this sad return: 'In my youth, and through the prime of manhood, I never entered London without feelings of pleasure and hope. It was to me as the grand theatre of intellectual activity, the field of every species of enterprise and exertion, the metropolis of the world of business, thought, and action ... I now entered the great city in a very different tone of mind, one of settled melancholy ... My health was gone, my ambition was satisfied, I was no longer excited by the desire of distinction; what I regarded most tenderly [my mother], was in the grave ... My cup of life was no longer sparkling, sweet, and effervescent ... it has become bitter.' In a wonderfully sardonic aside, Davy added that this metaphor of the 'cup of life' was scientifically derived from the chemical fermentation of 'the juice of the grape,' and then after a certain lapse of time, its oxidisation and acidification."" pg. 419""Babbage perhaps intended a sort of parable of science for the new generation. His story went as follows. When Babbage first peered carefully at the shimmering solar image projected through Herschel's prism, he could not see these dark Fraunhofer lines, though he knew they were there. Herschel then commented to him: 'An object is frequently not seen, from not knowing how to see it, rather than from any deficit in the organ of vision ... I will instruct you how to see them.' After some time spent re-examining and refocusing the image, Babbage could see them perfectly. The point was that science must always be more than the simple observation of phenomena or data. It was simultaneously a subjective training in observation skills, self-criticism and interpretation: a complete education. This was of course precisely what William Herschel had said forty years before, about learning to see with a telescope."" pg. 440Book: borrowed from the SSF Main Library."

154,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,5,"In writing this review, I am keeping in mind that an old and very dear friend of mine (who has read and liked this book) is highly interested in my evaluation. I mention this because it leads to an important point about the book: the background of the reader will strongly determine what he or she gets out of reading The Age of Wonder. For my part, I approach this work as a sociologist who is currently (fall 2013) preparing to take a doctoral exam in the sociology of science. Hence, I already have some grounding in this field and I will use this book as deep background for my own work in science and technology studies.To extract the maximum value from this work, the reader will need some knowledge of Romanticism and the history and philosophy of science – in particular the “two cultures” debate deriving from C.P. Snow’s famous work of that name. This is not to say that this book is entirely useless to the reader lacking such a background, but it will be more difficult for the reader to grasp the overall argument, as Holmes does not provide such contextualization. However, his skills as a biographer are so good that the reader can derive enormous value simply reading the book as a set of biographical vignettes and it would not be a waste of time.  However, the core of Holmes’ work involves an extended critique of the notion that art and science are invariably at odds. Holmes’ objective is to show that this tension is largely a product of Late Romanticism (early 19th Century) and in sociological terms is very much a cultural and political “project”. Indeed, Holmes provides compelling evidence not only that science and art are not inherently adversarial but that in Early Romanticism the two were deeply interconnected and (Holmes argues) drew strength from each other. Hence the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) was not only a Romantic author but worked with Humphry Davy (the chemist) and conducted experiments with prisms in Germany. Davy for his part wrote both early science fiction as well as poetry. And these are but two examples that Holmes provides. He builds a picture of how through Romantic philosophy both science and art were unified by the feature intrinsic to both: creative thought. In this way, Romantic science can be distinguished from the more purely rationalistic viewpoint of the Early Enlightenment (in the works of Descartes, Spinoza, and Hobbes for example). Spinoza forms a case in point (I get this from Steven Nadler’s study of Spinoza in A Book Forged in Hell). Spinoza asserted that there was no role for imagination in rational society (including science) and that knowledge was based on the accumulation of facts. However, scientists of the Romantic Age (and after, such as Richard Feynman) dismissed the adequacy of simply collecting facts. Scientific understanding required conceptual breakthroughs, and this was only available via creative thought and imagination. (The cultural meme of the creative scientific breakthrough – Archimedes’ “Eureka!” moment – remains strong in present day public understanding of science. Witness how nonscientists regard Einstein or Stephen Hawking.)All of this is a long way from the divided and acrimonious relation between art and science described by C.P. Snow in his landmark “The Two Cultures”. Holmes locates the inflection point at the “Immortal Dinner” held in December 1817 by the fundamentalist Christian painter Benjamin Haydon (see pages 318-321). Attending this event were the poets William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, and John Keats. However, Holmes notes that this dinner did not include Coleridge, Byron, or Shelley – persons whom Holmes asserts would have had no patience for either Haydon’s rhetorical aims or the acrimony towards science espoused by their fellow poets. In the long run, however, the constructed antipathy between art and science put forward at the “Immortal Dinner” have become part of the dogma about science and art.Holmes’ central objective in Age of Wonder, then, is to usefully refute the “Two Cultures” hypothesis and to provide biographical evidence of its inadequacy both past and present as well as to partly rehabilitate the role of Romantic art and sensibility in furthering the Scientific Revolution – a viewpoint joined by Lisa Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution) and others, including, interestingly, the arch-atheist Richard Dawkins. Within the limits of my knowledge, I feel that Holmes has successfully provided a rich source of materials for his case as well as vivid biographical portraits of the personalities involved in this second stage of the English Scientific Revolution – with Lisa Jardine having provided a very useful synopsis of the first stage of the English Scientific Revolution.However, Holmes does not provide a good overall contextualization of the issues at stake, making it difficult for those without existing specialist knowledge to either understand or to evaluate his thesis. This contextualization would not have to be large – a short chapter at the beginning of the book, or rather a reworking of his introduction – would suffice to ease general readers into the debate on “two cultures” (he never actually deals with C.P. Snow’s thesis in depth here – a significant omission. Another issue is that this work is almost entirely Anglo-centric, with some mention of Antoine Lavoisier, Alexandre Charles, the Mongolfiers, and other French and German scientists. This Anglo-centrism is merited to a degree because of the key role played by Britain in the early Industrial and Scientific Revolutions. But at the same time, the reader can wonder how well Holmes’ interpretation of Romantic science translates to the broader European context. So, in closing, while this is a great book, it is not a standalone work. To extract full value from it, I would recommend looking at the back of the book, where Holmes provides a highly welcome background reading list. For anyone interested in modern political and intellectual history, some knowledge of Romanticism is a must and well worth acquiring. By the same token, some knowledge of either the sociology of science or the history and philosophy of science (these can be somewhat adversarial fields) will provide context for why it is important to understand how scientists actually practice their craft as well as the greater social context in which science takes place (see for instance Bruno Latour, Laboratory Life.) So, while I would recommend this book for anyone interested in science and early modern history, it is a book that provides greater rewards for external study than most. "
155,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"This book took me an unusually long time to finish, which at first I was inclined to blame on my own deficiencies. But by the time I finished the book, I was otherwise inclined. Quite simply, this book seemed to strive mightily to connect the major Romantic poets to some major Romantic-era scientists, but ultimately the author’s thesis fell flat for me. Granted, I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book, which focused on Joseph Banks’ voyages to Tahiti, the brother and sister astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, the African odyssey of Mungo Park, and the escapades of daredevil balloonists. Holmes does an admirable job of writing juicy mini-biographies of these and other personages, but, dazzled as I was by his eye for detail and ability to enable the reader to peer beneath his subjects’ skin, early on I found myself a bit baffled at why these disparate people were sharing space in the same volume. Then, in subsequent chapters, particularly those devoted to chemist/poet Humphrey Davy, I hit a wall. Davy, to me, was not nearly as engaging a person, despite his obvious brilliance and importance, but more to the point, at this point in the book the author begins to strain very hard to bring in connections to the Romantic poets. Davy was friends with Coleridge and wrote a great deal of (alas, not very good) poetry himself. Holmes quotes reams of Davy’s poetry (which I immediately learned to skim), as well as poetry by Coleridge, Keats, Byron and Shelley. And it was at this point that I sincerely wished that the author were NOT a specialist and biographer of the Romantic poets, for he strained so often and so hard to work in any poetic reference, however tangential, to science that I became quite impatient. His thesis.... well, I’m not entirely sure what it was, to be honest. (And hence my initial impulse to feel it was my fault as a reader, for surely there is a thesis?) Something about how the divisions between science and poetry/philosophy are artificial and that, indeed, we should endeavor to unite the two fields, which are both grounded in wonder.  But, gee, that’s an awfully broad net to cast, don’t you think? I’m afraid the result was a great deal of bycatch. Then, too, during the second half of the book, the discussion of Davy et al. becomes quite bogged down in the discussion of Davy’s various relationships (romantic and otherwise), the political wranglings of the Royal Society, and the rise or fall of various scientists’ reputations. The narrative became dense and hard to follow. However, I persisted to the end of the book, feeling that, surely, the author would tie all these disparate strands together for me in some cohesive way.No such luck. "
156,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn,4,"Interest and Science TogetherThis book is meant to emphasize that research and art go together and are inseparable. Holmes discusses how leisure time gave way to thought,involvement and art caused the scientific revolution a a is could not exist without the other. He uses examples from all over Europe and pulls stories out quite well. "
157,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"“Science is truly a relay race, with each discovery handed on to the next generation. Even as one door is closing, another door is already being thrown open. So it is with this book. For this, I believe science needs to be presented and explored in a new way. We need not only a new history of science, but a more enlarged and imaginative biographical writing about individual scientists. The old, rigid debates and boundaries — science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics — are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.”I am abashed at how much of this book I did not know, and am grateful that I do now. Slightly dry and scattered, it was hard to get through, not full of wonder but details, but worth the time. I wish there was a timeline, as the narrative moves all over the place, ostensibly chronologically but confusingly.The revolution of the time was an explosion of astronomy, chemistry, geology, exploration of the world, and changes in society “to the point that the greatest astronomer of the age would turn out to be an immigrant German musician (William Herschel and his sister!), the greatest chemist was the son of a Welsh ne’er-do-well (Humphry Davy), and a whole new branch of study—electromagnetism—would be founded by the son of a blacksmith (Michael Faraday). All these figures appear as characters in Holmes’ fascinating work, along with poets, novelists, explorers, aristocrats and even balloonists.” The scientist was also philosopher, and the lines were blurred. The author includes poetry that was inspired by the science, by Coleridge, Byron, Keats, and Shelley, and that adds a layer to the Ancient Mariner and other famous poems of the time that might be my favorite part of the book. I am reading The Second Mountain by David Brooks, and he writes of times in history when the moral ecology was changing, and Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael would say when Mother Culture gets more strident, and the frog in the boiling water doesn’t feel the heat yet. I can see the arc of time in this age of wonder, and how scientists of the time had an intense drive to be an individual, to achieve grand and stupendous things (telescopes to discover Uranus, mapping Africa, discovering potassium, etc) with recklessness and fearlessness. “Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration. These were Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world expedition aboard the Endeavour, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage to the Galapagos islands aboard the Beagle, begun in 1831. This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder, and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”I had always revered the Enlightenment Age so may have glossed over anything called Romantic, hence the ignorance. The author focuses on three Romantic themes: ballooning, global exploration and soul hunting along with the science. The author writes that far back in antiquity, “Plato argued that the notion of ‘wonder’ was central to all philosophical thought: ‘In Wonder all Philosophy began: in Wonder it ends…But the first Wonder is the Offspring of Ignorance; the last is the Parent of Adoration.’” This was quite lost during the rational Enlightenment and the Romantic poets put the wonder back into the science, and drew the lay people in to experience it. Can you imagine scads of modern poetry written about Carl Sagan or Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Like Wordsworth:Romantic traveller amidst the stars: And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The Antechapel where the Statue stood Of Newton, with his prism and his silent face, The marble index of a Mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.Wordsworth again:My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky; So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man...Epigraphs:He thought about himself, and the whole Earth, Of Man the wonderful, and of the Stars, And how the deuce they ever could have birth; And then he thought of Earthquakes, and of Wars, How many miles the Moon might have in girth, Of Air-balloons, and of the many bars To perfect Knowledge of the boundless Skies; And then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes. BYRON, Don Juan (1819)Those to whom the harmonious doors Of Science have unbarred celestial stores … WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ‘Lines Additional to an Evening Walk’ (1794)Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific … JOHN KEATS, ms of sonnet (1816)“Their minutely recorded telescope observations, published in over a hundred papers by the Royal Society, would change not only the public conception of the solar system, but of the whole Milky Way galaxy and the structure and meaning of the universe itself. It was immediately apparent that Herschel had created an instrument of unparalleled light-gathering power and clarity. He saw, for example, what very few astronomers even suspected: that the Pole Star — which had been the key to navigation, and the poet’s traditional emblem of steadiness and singularity, for centuries — was not in fact one star at all, but two stars.”“Surrounded by infinite space, and swallowed up in an immensity of being, man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean, mixed and confounded with the general mass. But from this situation, perplexing as it is, he endeavours to extricate himself; and by looking abroad into Nature, employs the powers she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.”“An unfathomably larger universe was steadily opening up, and this gradually transformed popular notions of the size and mystery of the world ‘beyond the heavens’Indeed, the very terms ‘world’, ‘heaven’ and ‘universe’ began to changetheir meanings. It was the psychological breakthrough that Kant had predicted in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens back in 1755: ‘We may cherish the hope that new plane is being uncovered.”Poetry from Erasmus Darwin celebrating the astronomical discoveries of Herschel:When Love Divine, with brooding wings unfurl’d, Call’d from the rude abyss the living World, ‘Let there be Light!’, proclaimed the Almighty Lord, Astonish’d Chaos heard the potent word; Through all his realms the kindling ether runs And the mass starts into a million Suns. Earths round each Sun with quick explosions burst, And second Planets issue from the first; Bend as they journey with projectile force, In bright ellipses their reluctant course; Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll, And form, self-balanced, one revolving whole. – Onward they move, amid their bright abode, Space.David Bourgeois both published handbooks to the science of flight in 1784. Bourgeois opened ecstatically: ‘The idea of taking to the air, of flying through sky, and navigating through the ether, has always appealed so strongly to mankind, that it has appeared in numerous classical legends and folktales from the remotest antiquity. The wings of Saturn, the eagle of Jupiter, the peacocks of Juno, the doves of Venus, the winged horses of the Sun all bear witness …’ By the end of 1784, the second year of the great balloon craze, no fewer than 181 manned ascents had been recorded, mostly in France and England.Jeffries also gave the first truly vivid account of the changing appearance of the ground as seen ‘from a bird’s eye view, as it is called’. This too was constantly surprising. As they took off, there was the white sea of upturned faces in the city squares, swiftly reduced to tiny, unrecognisable points. There was the unearthly silence, the sense of their own motionlessness as the earth seemed to revolve below the basket. Though they did not appear to move, their compass needle steadily turned. Below them, the earth appeared transformed. There was the strange flattening out of hills and buildings, the emergence of previously unsuspected patterns in the foliage of woods, or the cultivation marks in fields, or the branching streets of a town. There was the constantly delusive appearance of clouds, and sudden showers of rain or even snowflakes. (No electrical charges were recorded, much to Jeffries’ relief.) The whole world became ‘like a beautifully coloured map or carpet’Wordsworth began his poem Peter Bell (1798) with a playful image of flying in a sort of dirigible airship, or balloon boat. There’s something in a flying Horse, There’s something in a huge Balloon: But through the Clouds I’ll never float Until I have a little Boat Shaped like the crescent-Moon … Away we go! — and what care we For treason, tumults, and for wars? We are as calm in our Delight As is the crescent-Moon so bright Among the scattered Stars.Perhaps Shelley put it best:‘The balloon has not yet received the perfection of which it is surely capable; the art of navigating the air is in its first and most helpless infancy; the aerial mariner still swims on bladders, and has not yet mounted the rude raft … It would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned. It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa? — Why do we not despatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction, and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon, which a vertical sun would project precisely underneath it, as it glided over that hitherto unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.’This method of viewing the galaxies (‘to continue the simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom’) presented the entire universe in a new kind of light, with the most radical implications. ‘The heavens are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions, in different flourishing beds … and we can extend the range of our experience [of them] to an immense duration.’Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that ‘deep space’ must also imply ‘deep time’. He wrote in his Preface: A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past … [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand — that is — almost two million years on their way.’ The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great dealof explanation to the layman.Keats likens his own discovery of Homer’s poetry to the experience of the great astronomer and the great explorer finding new worlds. … Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific — and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise – Silent upon a peak in Darien.Herschel also mentioned applying Newton’s theories for measuring the speed of solar light to ‘inconceivably distant bodies’ in the stellar system, with unimaginable results. ‘Then speaking of himself, he said with a modesty of manner that quite overcame me, when taken with the greatness of the assertion: “I have looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars of which the light, it can be proved, must have taken millions of years to reach the earth.”’Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably ‘ceased to exist’ millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. ‘The light did travel after the body was gone.’Banks was soon sponsoring small but highly adventurous expeditions into Egypt and the horn of Africa. Its motives at this stage were scientific and commercial, with no missionary or colonial intentions. Its primary aim was discovery, not conquest. This would change once Banks was appointed to the Privy Council in 1797, and became ever more closely involved in prosecuting the war against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then all exploration took on a more political and frankly imperial significance. Yet Africa and Australia always fascinated Banks for their own sake.Explorer Mungo Park: “At this moment, painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small moss in fructification, irresistibly caught my eye. I mention this to show from what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive consolation; for though the whole plant was not larger than the top of one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves, and capsula, without admiration.’ In that moment of pure scientific wonder, Park’s thoughts and outlook were transformed: ‘Can the Being (thought I) who planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed?”Shelley’s wilderness, while it includes ‘dark Aethiopia in her desert hills’, is geographically vague, though it moves more towards India and an imaginary East. But he catches something of Mungo Park’s enigmatic wanderlust, and transforms it into an unearthly Miltonic quest for the strange and magnificent limits of the known world: The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, And o’er the aerial mountains which pour down Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, In joy and exultation held his way; Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched His languid limbs.I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air …To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling … A mind that has once imbibed a taste for scientific enquiry has within itself an inexhaustible source of pure and exciting contemplations. One would think that Shakespeare had such a mind in view when he describes a contemplative man finding Tongues in trees — books in the running brooks Sermons in stones — and good in everything Where the uninformed and unenquiring eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he walks in the midst of wonders. It is intriguing that Herschel was quoting from Shakespeare’s As You Like .."
158,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This is a fascinating account of the growth of science in Romantic Age of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Holmes looks at the period through the lives of ground-breaking scientists, and illuminates the intersections between science, literature, and art during the period.Among the scientists discussed in detail are Joseph Banks, William and Caroline Herschel, Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday, and a collection of truly nutty but ground-breaking (or is that, and ground-breaking) balloonists.One of the most engaging aspects of science in this period is that it was all new enough that any smart, interested person with some (not necessarily large) resources could potentially make an important contribution. Joseph Banks was educated as a botanist, and made one of his greatest contributions with detailed and insightful anthropological observations of the Tahitians. William Herschel was trained as a musician, and his sister Caroline barely educated at all; they became prominent astronomers who made major contributions to the study of the heavens. Michael Faraday was a bookseller who was hired by Humphrey Davy as a lab assistant. Some of these men were born wealthy; some were not. None started out on the path where they made their greatest contributions.Joseph Banks accompanied James Cook on the first of his voyages to the south Pacific, as a naturalist, the same role in which Charles Darwin later sailed on the HMS Beagle. A major purpose of that voyage was to observe an eclipse of the sun that would be visible in Tahiti. While Banks did a great deal of botany while he was in Tahiti, he also made extensive and detailed observations of the Tahitians, differing from most of his fellow British by being open to--indeed, becoming deeply involved in, the Tahitian culture. Initially friendly relations with the Tahitians soured as Cook and others, unable or unwilling to let go of their own preconceptions, repeatedly offended them. After they left Tahiti, the voyage deteriorated further, with conflicts, epidemic illness, and death. The survivors, including Cook and Banks, arrived back in Britain devastated and took months to recover. Still a young man at this point, Banks was at the beginning of his career, and remained a major force in British science for decades to come--but less as a scientist himself, rather as the president of the Royal Society, guiding and encouraging the scientific careers of others.With Banks' story setting the framework, we see the Herschels start out as a musician and his singer/housekeeper sister and become two of the most important astronomers of the age, Davy beginning as a medical student and transforming into a chemist and engineer, and then into a mystical, visionary writer. We see the beginnings of true specialization in science, and the founding of the first subject-specialized science professional associations, separate from the Royal Society, which had, and still sought, to encompass them all. We see, also, the connections and interactions between the scientists and the writers and artists of the age, including Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats.It's a fascinating story, and I promise I have not even scratched the surface of it. Holmes seeks to reveal character as well as accomplishments, and show the ways in which the romantic sensibility, which we generally thing of as antithetical to science, in fact inspired and encouraged the Romantic Age scientists.Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from the local library."

He falls head over heels in love with William Herschel’s sister Caroline, so essential to Hershel’s exploration of the heavens through a series of homemade telescopes, the only kind of telescope to be had at the time. The story of Humphrey Davy inventing the safety lamp that saved so many coal miners’ lives is so real he might have been an eyewitness, including all the times Davy blows up at Michael Faraday, not to mention all the times he blows up his lab. 	Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats were fascinated and inspired by these new scientific explorations and discoveries, and employed many of them as images in their work. There is a whole chapter on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, where Holmes traces the Monster’s beginnings to lectures given at the Royal Society in London, which Shelley attended and which included the attempt by one philosopher to use a primitive form of electricity to shock a corpse back to life. Eeew. 	Holmes writes of what may have been our most polymathic age in deft and witty prose. Of Herschel, an accomplished musician as well as an astronomer, he writes, “He moved from earthly music to the music of the spheres.” He writes demurely of the balloon ascension of a Mr. Biggin and a Mrs. Sage, which may or may not have given birth to the Mile High Club. He quotes a contemporary critic as saying, somewhat apologetically, “Poetical descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid principles of the Science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple unadorned language.” 	And then Holmes lets Keats underline the point,  …Then felt I like some watcher of the skies	When a new planet swims into his ken...	That watcher of the skies was Herschel. And the new planet? Uranus."
160,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027264-monika,5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. What strikes me most about Holmes is his ability to weave together what modern man has learned to compartmentalize- the sciences and the humanities. Before science was ""science,"" it was natural philosophy. Before scientists were ""scientists,"" they were natural philosophers and poets. Richard Holmes brings science and art back together in order to tell the story of how the late eighteenth century produced the foundation of what would become modern science. Framing the book with the story of Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who took part in Captain Cook's expedition to Tahiti later becoming the president of the Royal Society, Holmes moves to William Herschel, the musician and amateur astronomer who would discover Uranus with a telescope of his own making, and his sister, Caroline, who herself was responsible for discovering several comets. From the Herschel's the story moves to Mungo Parks and his travels to Africa and mapping of the Congo, followed by Sir Humphry Davy, who many believe is the founder of modern chemistry.What makes this book a wonder, however, is the pervasive spirit of inquiry of the age. Whereas now we seem to accept platitudes like ""I'm good at English, so I must not be good at math,"" this age embraced the idea that the only way to express the wonder of science is through poetry, literature, and the arts. Poets like Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley attended lectures from the great thinkers of the age, then expressed the same concerns about man's place in the world as the men who gave the lectures. What a time it must have been... human curiosity leading to unimaginable discoveries, discoveries that would forever alter the way we view our place in the universe... and such is the terror. To borrow from Carl Jung, this period marked the dawning of our self-awareness as a species in a universe that very quickly became immeasurably large and unimaginably old. Suddenly, we became ants in an ant farm instead of products of some intelligent design... Richard Holmes captures the complexities of the period in a most poetic way. I will be coming back to this book many times."
161,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779830-andrew,3,"I forgot about this book until I saw it again here. My father sent this book to me a few years ago. I enjoyed learning about the various people, scientists as well as non-scientists. I like that Holmes gives so much detail about, for instance, the grinding of the mirror for the telescope. And how it was paid for. For me, the book would be just as enjoyable if it was a collection of anecdotes and free of any speculation as to whether or how the literature and paintings of the time may or may not have influenced the scientists of that time. Holmes undertakes the great challenge of finding connections between Romantic notions and the scientific pursuits of those times. I really don't see how such connections can be made without knowing the biographies of the scientists well enough to know the extent of their interest in Romantic notions. That can be hard to know for anyone. I did enjoy learning that S.T. Coleridge was solicited to join a convention of people doing science, at least partly for the purpose of helping to choose a word to apply to the people who do science. As a result of this convention, the word scientist came into general use. It seemed to me that, of all the regard these scientists had for Romantic notions, Holmes related more about Humphry Davies' than any other. "
162,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/392337-sarah,5,"This is an amazing book. It doesn't have as much to do with literary Romanticism as I had originally hoped, but by the end of the first chapter I didn't care. Holmes is an excellent writer, and he makes the excitement and amazement of the scientists and explorers he profiles live. I think my favorite sections are the ones that deal with Joseph Banks, who went on a scientific voyage to Tahiti as a young man and, despite a successful career as a botanist in England, mentor to many younger scientists, and long-time president of the Royal Society, never seems to have found anything that moved him in the same way as Tahiti. To some extent, this book is a series of linked biographies: Banks, astronomer William Herschel and his sister Caroline, Sir Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday. Holmes is also very good at drawing out the political (whether national competition over who should be credited with discoveries or in-fighting over who should lead the various scientific societies) and philosophical (German Romantic writers and Coleridge make appearances here) implications of the scientific discoveries involved. It's not often a book is so informative, gripping, and well written all at once. "
163,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,4,"This was the first book assigned for my new semester, which means I'm going back to reading school stuff round the clock again, but luckily this first one was a great one. It's really a combined biography of Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Science, explorer of Tahiti), William Herschel (discovered Uranus), and Humphrey Davy (experimented with nitrous oxide, and also became President of Royal Society), along with a couple of other secondary stories. The best is probably the history behind Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, tracing it to the debates about the existence of a cosmic ""vitalist"" force, a debate that originated in the circle of German ""nature philosopher"" Frederich Schelling.The book was probably too long though, and plodded through parts of Herschel's and Davy's biographies (especially Davy's atrocious poetry), but it does do a great job showing how the worlds of Romantic literature and early modern science interacted. One takeaway, they all loved Coleridge."
164,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43247-emi-bevacqua,3,"This book is kind of the ultimate departure from my personal comfort zone: nearly 500 pages on the history of western science juxtaposed with poetry. Richard Holmes is an amazing researcher and writer, he really brings the age to life and I loved the beautiful color art inserts. The first section was very straightforward, about the young explorer Joseph Banks and his discoveries in Tahiti; in the next we meet a young astronomist that Banks discovered, named William Herschel and also his sister-assistant Caroline. Then with each chapter and introduction to subsequent scientists the reader is keeping track of more and more complexity, collegial scientists and poets, their discoveries and published work, their travels, and family relations! Throughout it all - anthropology, cosmology, flight, mesmerism, chemistry - the unifying thread is the history of the Royal Society of London scientists, led for the most part by Joseph Banks. My favorite quote is when somebody asks ""What's the use of a (hot air) balloon?"" and Benjamin Franklin responds, ""What's the use of a newborn baby?"" "
165,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,0,"There is obviously something wrong with me. Everyone raves about this book - so far I am finding it choppy, hard to read, all over the map and not particularly well-written. Holmes's penchant for including every detail of everything he ever read about his subjects is exhausting - a better writer would take the trouble to pare things down in the service of a more readable narrative. Part of my disappointment so far is that I didn't find Joseph Banks, the subject of the first 70 pages, a particularly engaging or interesting character. His major contribution to scientific progress appears to have been to bring back a bunch of specimens from Tahiti, a fundamentally pedestrian activity. Darwin's voyage on The Beagle was interesting because of how he subsequently synthesized his observations - Banks is a far duller character, no matter how many natives he slept with.Maybe things will pick up with Herschel and Davy."

We need to understand how science is actually made; how scientists themselves think and feel and speculate. We need to explore what makes scientists creative, as well as poets or painters, or musicians. That is how this book began. The old, rigid debates and boundaries -- science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics -- are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.
The Age of Wonder isn't quite the book I expected it to be: I was looking forward to a lot of science, which I find intriguing, but I found this work to be laden down with a lot of biographical information, which I find to be less so. The Romantic Period must have been an astonishing time to be alive, indeed an Age of Wonder; a time when any amateur, even a foreign musician like William Herschel, with enough curiosity and funds could literally point out new discoveries in the self-same night sky humans had been regarding for millennia. A privileged young man, like Joseph Banks, could buy himself passage on a voyage of discovery under Captain Cook and, in the process of collecting botanical specimens from Tahiti, invent the new field of Anthropology. Science, at the beginning of this period, was accessible and democratic: a barely educated young man, like Humphrey Davy, was able to wrest the study of the elements from the grip of the Alchemists and properly begin the discipline of Chemistry -- no longer searching for how to transmute the impossible, Davy (et al) did simple experiments to discover what does happen. Imagine a time when that was revolutionary thinking. Imagine if there were still basic discoveries to be made in nature; discoveries waiting to be plucked like low hanging fruit.I was delighted by the intersections between Science and Literature and Philosophy; how each informed the others; how so many of these early Scientists not only rubbed elbows with the likes of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Byron, but also expressed their own amazement in well-regarded verse. This also worked in reverse, with the great poets of the age attending scientific lectures in order to learn the terminology, the great metaphors of the day -- could this possibly be happening today?This book is exhaustive, and ultimately, I found that to be…exhausting. The following is more for my own memory than part of a proper review (and as I would probably advise anyone reading this review to just end here, I'm going to hide it all as a spoiler).(view spoiler)[I was charmed by Banks in Tahiti, and appreciated all of the primary source materials that were provided (the personal letters and journals and articles that filled in the big picture, that made the age come alive), but in some later sections these additions felt gossipy and a bit pointless. My favourite part from Tahiti: On their last day they discovered an enormous stone 'marai' or funeral monument, shaped like a pyramid, some forty-four feet high and nearly 300 feet wide, with steps of superbly polished white coral down both sides. This, the 'masterpiece' of Tahitian architecture on the island, was unsettling to Banks because its construction seemed technically inexplicable. 'It is beyond belief that Indians could raise so large a structure without the assistance of Iron tools to shape their stones or mortar to join them.'Not far away was another mystery: a huge wicker man constructed of basketwork, evidently for some obscure sacrificial rite. 'The whole was neatly covered with feathers, white to represent skin and black to represent hair and tattow.' I love stuff like that, and yes, I watch Ancient Aliens: not because I believe extraterrestrials built this curious 'marai', but because I revel in the mystery of these sorts of ancient structures and monuments and that show has a new one for me every week. Because of the noted intersections with literature, I was jotting down the books I was reminded of as I was reading. For this section, it was : Jamrach's Menagerie, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Unfamiliar Fishes (and how sad to note the evolution of Captain Cook from his empathetic treatment of the Tahitians to his brutality towards the Hawaiins), Parrot and Olivier in America, Moby Dick.I enjoyed the first section on William Herschel, but again, the biographical information was simply overwhelming -- I would have much preferred a general overview of his life in Hanover before emigrating to England and found no benefit at all in the biographies of his family members other than Caroline. When the book revisited the Herchels later -- more of the same and more of the same plus the details of his marriage and family -- I was seriously bored. I suppose the fact that his son, John, went on to become a leading figure in the Victorian Age of Science explains why we must follow William to the grave, but that wasn't what I wanted from this book (which I understand is a fault of my own, not the author). Since Caroline was profoundly affected by the Lisbon earthquake, I was put in mind of Candide and also of Frankenstein (not realising this book would be quoted at great length later).I was amused by the section on ballooning, and appreciate how at the time it must have seemed like the dawn of the Jetsons with their flying cars, but since in the end it was dismissed as a fad, more suited to carnivals than scientific study, I don't know that it belonged in this book. I did like this part: Benjamin Franklin, American Ambassador in Paris, watched the launch (of the first manned balloon flight) through a telescope from the window of his carriage. Afterwards he remarked: 'Someone asked me -- what's the use of a balloon? I replied - what's the use of a newborn baby?'Obvious choices, but I was reminded of Around the World in Eighty Days and The Wizard of Oz.Age of Wonder picked up (after another dull visit with the Herchels) when it told the thrilling story of Mongo Park and his two expeditions to find the source of the Niger in Africa. While the first trip was pure adventurism, the second smacked of imperialism, and it was probably due to his own self-important beliefs that he failed to pay due respect to the local tribes and was never seen again. Literary tie-ins: Heart of Darkness (for which Park was likely the inspiration for Kurtz), and because so much of this book takes place during the Napoleonic years and the war between France and Britain, A Tale of Two Cities.Humphrey Davy was a Poet and Chemist who experimented on himself with Nitrous Oxide, like a Timothy Leary for his time, without making the leap to its use in surgery. (A later section on the mastectomy that Fanny Burney endured without benefit of anesthetic made for a harrowing reading experience, but it was one more event that I wasn't certain belonged in what I thought this book was meant to be). Davy then made the leap to the study of Galvinism, and this sparked the great debates about Vitalism and ""is there an animating principle"" -- a soul? -- in humans, the great parlour discussion topic of the time, and that led to the first inklings of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This was interesting, but the very lengthy quoting from the book and its reception by the public and the stage play that came later -- all of this seemed beside the point to me. As was Davy's disintegrating marriage and political dealings with the Royal Academy of Science and his ""little nurse in Illyria"" -- so much biography, so little actual science. I did, however, appreciate when Davy put his mind to creating a safety-lamp for miners -- his great effort to demonstrate that science was for the benefit of mankind; theory that may be put into practise. The literary tie-ins at this point were all poetry: Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Prometheus Unbound.  (hide spoiler)]Okay, so after that long stretch of what was interesting and not so interesting to me, I return to Richard Holme's quote that I started with, the bit he actually ended with, and specifically:  Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. How many of us have this hope and wonder? I don't know that I believe the scientists of today are imbued with hope and wonder; that they are philosophical about their work; that they have the creative souls of artists. But perhaps I'm wrong and I thank Age of Wonder for forcing me to think of Science in this way.I wanted to love this book, but it was ultimately brought down by the immensity of the information it contained -- had it left out the society news and letters from home, I might have enjoyed it much more. "
167,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23672960-brian-willis,5,"Conventional wisdom places the scientific and rational achievements of the Age of Enlightenment in direct opposition to the fundamental values of the age of Romanticism in the arts. Poetry and art exuberantly shifted from an emphasis on cold rationality and collective achievement as well as logical procedures of the calculating mind towards exploration of the sentimentality of the human spirit, the individual within the natural world, and the subconscious. In other words, the movement was from the visible (or that which could be explained through rational observation) towards explaining the invisible (the interior subjective human self, the passions, the drives, and impulses that cannot be explained through science, at least in that era).Richard Holmes, perhaps the great living biographer of the Romantic era presents us with a multi-part biography of the scientists that influenced the Romantics, but instead of playing the party line of this dialectic, he demonstrates that the Romantic Era existed INFUSED with the spirit of exploration of the science of the age. Beginning with Sir Joseph Banks, he explains the foundation of the Royal Society. Then he divides a large part of the book following and documenting the life and achievements of Sir William Herschel and Sir Humphrey Davy. Herschel made his fame discovering Uranus, but Holmes argues effectively that his development of advanced telescopes as well as a method towards cataloguing the night sky were influential for future generations. One of the unsung heroes of the book is Caroline Herschel, his sister, who actually become the first patronized and influential female astronomer. Davy expanded our knowledge of natural gases and their containment, most effectively with his staggering safety lamp for miners. Other topics discussed are the passion for tales of the exploits of explorer Mungo Park and the origination of aerial flight through hot air ballooning. Holmes ties these achievements into the ongoing saga of the leading Romantics, particularly their encounters with Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley, and Keats (with Wordsworth gliding in the background and occasionally making an appearance). He points out moments in their compositions that reference the achievements of Banks, the Herschels, Davy, Park, Sadler, and many others. As the Romantics ascended, the reputation of science seems to have retroactively been placed into competition with the values of the age of Romanticism and later Victorianism. The Romantics grappled with the same issues that the scientists did however; the revelations of the cosmos and the sanctity of particles in observation of tiny objects were revealing the same troubling conclusions for both scientists and poets. If there are uncountable galaxies, is it ludicrous to think that Christ was crucified millions of times to redeem the universe? Surprisingly, this hint at atheism backfired on scientists and their reputation for years to come while Romantics with their celebration of pagan values and occasionally an atheist or two, somehow escaped the judgement of posterity though facing criticism in their time. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, inspired by the electrical current experimentation of Galvani, was interpreted as a condemnation of the limits of science (though that was not Shelley's intent).In the end, Holmes writes an incredibly enlightening and informative group biography, argues for the art of biography as a window into the discovery process of science, and demonstrates that these scientists not only created the profession of scientist but also the groundwork for the scientific method, as eventually perfected by Charles Darwin (who also makes an appearance). Another triumph from one of my favorite writers."
168,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16010931-douglass-gaking,5,"The Age of Wonder is a solid history of British scientists in the Romantic era. It focuses on the individual scientists' lives, their experiments, their writings–both personal and published–and their connections to each other.Scientists in focus include Joseph Banks, William Herschel, Michael Faraday, and even the fictional Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Each chapter is as in-depth as a biography.I especially like the chapter on William Herschel. I had not realized how close he came to our current understanding of the construction of the universe, despite being formally trained as a musician, and self-taught as a scientist.My main takeaway from this book is how imaginative these scientists were. Whether it is believing in the chemical nature of the soul or the existence of life on the moon, they had wild theories that certainly fit in with the sentiment of the Romantic era. While so many of these hypothesis proved to be false, whether in their lifetimes or later, it is the pursuit of proving them through experimentation that advanced human knowledge into the modern age."
169,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8355999-betsy,4,"This is an engrossing book about the development of science during the late 18th and early 19th century. It focuses on four individuals, Joseph Banks, (explorer and driving force behind the Royal Society for many years) Caroline and William Herschel (sister and brother astronomers) and Humphry Davy (chemist). Two things stand out from the rest for me. First, the author discussed women's roles in science and the role of Caroline Herschel in particular. She was the first woman awarded a stipend by the King for her astronomical work (albeit at half the rate a man would have received). Second, I was surprised by the strong overlap of science and poetry. Many of the scientists were published poets, including Herschel and Davy and many of the poets were also active in the sciences (Coleridge and Wordsworth among others).At almost 500 pages the book dragged in a few places, particularly when the author was describing societal trends rather than giving biographies of the various scientists and poets. But, all in all, well worth the time it took to read it."
170,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11684178-lauren-barr,5,"There is something about the age of exploration that I find fascinating and, yes, incredibly romantic. It makes me wish I lived in the Victorian ages just so I could go here these talks on nascent principles and ideas, no matter how off they were in the long run. In my Victorian fantasies I’m super rich and, apparently, male. But just reading about these explorers, these astronomers, these scientists developing these wonderful inventions and ideas that went on to better the world … it’s heady stuff. At times the book is a bit dry, but for the most part the subject matter is so rich you get entirely wrapped up in it."

Starting with Joseph Banks, it is ideal for anyone interested in the intellectual impact of James Cook's voyages, and takes the reader onwards into the marvellous scientific discoveries of the age, through the lives of some of the discoverers (known names, but not necessarily the ones we know most about). Very enjoyable and marvellously informative."

It's enlightening to understand their motivation for their actions. The author was also very interested in literary pursuits of the scientists, analyzing and interpreting their poetry. I liked that philosophical men of science felt encouraged to write their own poetry. I don't believe that is the case very often nowadays.This was such a dense read. It took me a long time to get through it, not because it was poorly written or boring, but because there was so much information to absorb on each page. And each page was equally as interesting as it was dense.""To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling ... a soap bubble ... an apple ... a pebble ... He walks in the midst of wonders."" - John Herschel, A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1830). pg. xiii""But while Cook clung to the necessity of European forms and discipline, Banks was rather inclined to dwell on the superfluity of European needs. These were perhaps the reflections of a man who had always been used to wealth and comforts. 'From them appear how small are the real wants of human nature, which we Europeans have increasd to an excess which would certainly appear incredible to these people could they be told it. Nor shall we cease to increase them as long as Luxuries can be invented and riches found for the purchase of them; and how soon these Luxuries degenerate into necessaries may be sufficiently evincd by the universal use of strong liquors, Tobacco, spices, Tea &c. &c.'"" pg. 39""Riding between musical engagements, from one remote provincial northern town to another, often crossing over the moors alone at night, he found himself studying the panoply of stars overhead as he had done as a boy. He became well acquainted with the moon, and would later write that at this time he had intended 'to fix upon the moon for my habitation.' He also later told several tales about these lonely rides, one being how on one occasion he was reading so intently that when his horse stumbled and threw him, he somersaulted over its head and landed upright still holding his book in his hand, a perfect demonstration of the Newtonian law of 'circular motion.'"" pg. 74""Characteristically, Pilatre ignored these protests, and calmly went on telling d'Arlandes to work at feeding the brazier. He himself took off his bright green topcoat (put on for the crowd), rolled up his sleeves, and went on throwing on straw till his wooden fork broke. Once, when d'Arlandes was desperately shouting at him, 'We must go down! We must go down!,' Pilatre called back soothingly: 'Look d'Arlandes. Here we are above Paris. There's no possible danger for you. Are you taking this all in?' Many witnesses later said that they could hear the two men shouting excitedly to each other as they passed overhead. They assumed they were describing the glories of flight."" pg. 130""It was a glorious pink-and-yellow, candy-coloured balloon, thirty feet tall, and the crowd loved it. The wickerwork basket, a sort of chaise longue for two, was completely festooned with flags and bunting. Dr Charles had a full payload of scientific equipment aboard--mercury barometer (which was used as an early form of altimeter), thermometer, telescope, sand bags and several bottles of champagne."" pg. 131""Surprisingly, balloons did not appeal to the gothic novelist Horace Walpole, though perhaps at sixty-six he was a little old for such perilous novelties. He thought balloons might be sinister: 'Well! I hope these new mechanic meteors will prove only playthings for the learned and idle, and not be converted into new engines of destruction to the human race--as is so often the case of refinements or discoveries in Science. The wicked wit of man always studies to apply the results of talents to enslaving, destroying, or cheating his fellow creatures. Could we reach the moon, we should think of reducing it to a province of some European kingdom.' It was an ominous prophecy."" pg. 135To note: What we Americans call the Revolutionary War, the British call the American War of Independence. pg. 147""Ballooning added to this new awareness of the complexity and subtlety of clouds, a growing Romantic preoccupation which can be followed in the paintings of Turner and Constable, the notebooks of Coleridge and the poetry of Shelley. When Shelley refers to 'the locks of the approaching storm' in his 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819), he is using Howard's definition cirrus. 'The Cloud' (1820) demonstrates a remarkably accurate and scientific understanding of cloud formation and the convection cycle. Goethe wrote a number of essays on clouds, atmospheric pressures and weather, and translated passages of Howard, asking him to compose and send his Autobiography to Germany, and describing him as 'the first to define conceptually the airy and ever-changing forms of clouds, thus delimiting and fixing what had always been ephemeral and intangible, by accurate observation and naming.'"" pg. 160""Clouds became fascinating both as scientific phenomena--the generators of electricity, the mysterious indicators of winds and changing air pressure--and as aesthetic phenomena: the 'moods' of the sky reflecting those of the observer, alterations of light over landscape, symbols of change, destruction, regeneration. It could be argued that the Romantics actually invented the idea of 'the weather' itself, as it now preoccupies us; as well, of course, as 'inner weather.'"" pg. 160""Ballooning produced a new, and wholly unexpected, vision of the earth. It had been imagined that it would reveal the secrets of the heavens above, but in fact it showed the secrets of the world beneath. The early aeronauts suddenly saw the earth as a giant organism, mysteriously patterned and unfolding, like a living creature. For the first time the impact of man on nature was clearly revealed: the ever-expanding relationship of towns to countryside, roads to rivers, cultivated fields to forests, and the development of industry. It was comparable to the first views of the earth from space by the Apollo astronauts in the 1960s, producing a new concept of a 'single blue planet' with its delicate membrane of atmosphere. The famous photograph 'Earthrise' was taken from lunar orbit in December 1968."" pg. 161""As he grew older, Herschel was becoming a remoter figure in the household. His mind was ranging through the universe. His later papers for the Royal Society had begun to show an increasing awareness of the philosophical significance of astronomy. This was something urged upon him by his old supporter William Watson, who looked forward to conversations 'on Kant's metaphysics,' and wished to know how far Herschel agreed with the 'ground and sources' of Kant's philosophy of knowledge."" pg. 203""Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that 'deep space' must also imply 'deep time.' He wrote in his Preface: 'A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past ... [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand--that is--almost two million years on their way.' The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great deal of explanation to the layman."" pg. 203""Herschel continued to reach carefully towards the idea of an evolving universe, a concept as radical in its eventual implications as Erasmus Darwin's notion of evolution within plants and animals. In a late paper published in 1811, 'Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens,' Herschel further developed the idea . . . that all nebulae and large star clusters were at particular points in their sidereal life-cycles, which could be visually identified and catalogued almost in a Linnaean manner. Their characteristic shapes suggested distinct moments of youth, maturing and ageing."" pg. 204""It presented the universe as a living, growing, organic entity, with all nebulae belonging to one enormous extended family: 'There is not so much difference between them, if I may use the comparison, as there would be in an annual description of the human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a man in his prime.' This comparison is an intriguing premonition of 'time-lapse' photography, now one of the most powerful illustrative tools of modern natural history."" pg. 204-205""Physical vision--one might say scientific vision--brings about a metaphysical shift in the observer's view of reality as a whole. The geography of the earth, or the structure of the solar system, are in an instant utterly changed, and forever. The explorer, the scientific observer, the literary reader, experience the Sublime: a moment of revelation into the idea of the unbounded, the infinite."" pg. 207""At all events, it was clear that the Milky Way 'cannot last forever'; and equally that 'its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.' It followed that neither the earth, nor even the solar system, was a separate creation, but merely an infinitesimal part of a galactic evolution. Our galaxy had a physical beginning, and would have a physical conclusion. Our solar system, our planet, and hence our whole civilisation would have an ultimate and unavoidable end."" pg. 209""Campbell recalled that he felt he had been 'conversing with a supernatural intelligence.' Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably 'ceased to exist' millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. 'The light did travel after the body was gone.' After leaving Herschel, Campbell walked onto the shingle of Brighton beach, gazing out to sea, feeling 'evelvated and overcome.' He was reminded of Newton's observation that he was just a child picking up shells on the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay all before him."" pg. 210""It is evident that the death of his father, and all the subsequent emotional upheavals, profoundly shook the sixteen-year-old Davy, and started an intellectual ferment that never left him. Besides writing poetry, he also started his first diary, set himself reading lists and work timetables, and began a series of essays on religion versus materialism. During 1796 he wrote an essay 'On Mathematics,' and another 'On Consciousness,' which gleefully explored the implications of materialism. He described the body as 'a fine tuned Machine,' and wrote a syllogistic proof that the 'soul' could not exist, since it was said to be eternal and 'unchangeable,' while every known part of the human body, including the brain, was temporary and changed perpetually. 'QED the soul does not exist.'"" pg. 243""One of Burney's many extraordinary reflections was whether extreme physical pain could not only induce unconsciousness--'I have two total chasms in my memory of this transaction'--but actually force the soul out of the body. She also found that the act of recollection carried its own pain, and that she had taken three months to complete the account, as a letter of nearly 10,000 words to her sister Esther. She had severe headaches every time she tried to go on with it. Once finished, she could not look back over what she had written. 'I dare not revise, nor read, the recollection is still so painful.' It is an astonishing record of courage, not least in Fanny's determination to protect her husband from the trauma of the operation. But it also recalls what the real conditions of surgery were at this period."" pg. 306""But speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical ideas of Friedrich Schelling and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine, perhaps best translated as 'science mysticism,' defined the entire natural world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity as a series of 'polarities.' According to Schelling's doctrine, the whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical objects 'aspired' to become something higher. There was a 'world-soul' constantly 'evolving' higher life forms and 'levels of consciousness' in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards a higher state."" pg. 315""Davy's notebooks for this period also suggest a new pattern of philosophical speculation, almost approaching German Naturphilosophie. Some of his observations would have been recognised by Coleridge: 'The aspirations for immortality are movements of the mind similar to those which a bird makes with its wings before they are furnished with feathers.' Others were more closely tied to his laboratory work. On the subject of scientific 'analogy,' for instance, he wondered if there was a wider principle at work. 'Probably there is an analogy in all existence: the divided tail of the fish is linked in a long succession of like objects with the biped man. In the planetary system it is probable man will be found connected with a higher intellectual nature; and it is possible that the monad, or soul, is constantly undergoing a series of progressions.'"" pg. 357""In November 1827 Davy returned briefly to London to resign his presidency of the Royal Society. He later gave a moving glimpse of his disillusion with his own scientific career on this sad return: 'In my youth, and through the prime of manhood, I never entered London without feelings of pleasure and hope. It was to me as the grand theatre of intellectual activity, the field of every species of enterprise and exertion, the metropolis of the world of business, thought, and action ... I now entered the great city in a very different tone of mind, one of settled melancholy ... My health was gone, my ambition was satisfied, I was no longer excited by the desire of distinction; what I regarded most tenderly [my mother], was in the grave ... My cup of life was no longer sparkling, sweet, and effervescent ... it has become bitter.' In a wonderfully sardonic aside, Davy added that this metaphor of the 'cup of life' was scientifically derived from the chemical fermentation of 'the juice of the grape,' and then after a certain lapse of time, its oxidisation and acidification."" pg. 419""Babbage perhaps intended a sort of parable of science for the new generation. His story went as follows. When Babbage first peered carefully at the shimmering solar image projected through Herschel's prism, he could not see these dark Fraunhofer lines, though he knew they were there. Herschel then commented to him: 'An object is frequently not seen, from not knowing how to see it, rather than from any deficit in the organ of vision ... I will instruct you how to see them.' After some time spent re-examining and refocusing the image, Babbage could see them perfectly. The point was that science must always be more than the simple observation of phenomena or data. It was simultaneously a subjective training in observation skills, self-criticism and interpretation: a complete education. This was of course precisely what William Herschel had said forty years before, about learning to see with a telescope."" pg. 440Book: borrowed from the SSF Main Library."

His deft handling the scientific discoveries that made these men and women - the Herschels (William, Caroline, and John), Joseph Banks, Michael Farady, Humphry Davy, et al - so important is admirable, of course, but more impressive is his ability to marshal an enormous amount of research into a coherent, pleasurable narrative.

184,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,5,"In writing this review, I am keeping in mind that an old and very dear friend of mine (who has read and liked this book) is highly interested in my evaluation. I mention this because it leads to an important point about the book: the background of the reader will strongly determine what he or she gets out of reading The Age of Wonder. For my part, I approach this work as a sociologist who is currently (fall 2013) preparing to take a doctoral exam in the sociology of science. Hence, I already have some grounding in this field and I will use this book as deep background for my own work in science and technology studies.To extract the maximum value from this work, the reader will need some knowledge of Romanticism and the history and philosophy of science – in particular the “two cultures” debate deriving from C.P. Snow’s famous work of that name. This is not to say that this book is entirely useless to the reader lacking such a background, but it will be more difficult for the reader to grasp the overall argument, as Holmes does not provide such contextualization. However, his skills as a biographer are so good that the reader can derive enormous value simply reading the book as a set of biographical vignettes and it would not be a waste of time.  However, the core of Holmes’ work involves an extended critique of the notion that art and science are invariably at odds. Holmes’ objective is to show that this tension is largely a product of Late Romanticism (early 19th Century) and in sociological terms is very much a cultural and political “project”. Indeed, Holmes provides compelling evidence not only that science and art are not inherently adversarial but that in Early Romanticism the two were deeply interconnected and (Holmes argues) drew strength from each other. Hence the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) was not only a Romantic author but worked with Humphry Davy (the chemist) and conducted experiments with prisms in Germany. Davy for his part wrote both early science fiction as well as poetry. And these are but two examples that Holmes provides. He builds a picture of how through Romantic philosophy both science and art were unified by the feature intrinsic to both: creative thought. In this way, Romantic science can be distinguished from the more purely rationalistic viewpoint of the Early Enlightenment (in the works of Descartes, Spinoza, and Hobbes for example). Spinoza forms a case in point (I get this from Steven Nadler’s study of Spinoza in A Book Forged in Hell). Spinoza asserted that there was no role for imagination in rational society (including science) and that knowledge was based on the accumulation of facts. However, scientists of the Romantic Age (and after, such as Richard Feynman) dismissed the adequacy of simply collecting facts. Scientific understanding required conceptual breakthroughs, and this was only available via creative thought and imagination. (The cultural meme of the creative scientific breakthrough – Archimedes’ “Eureka!” moment – remains strong in present day public understanding of science. Witness how nonscientists regard Einstein or Stephen Hawking.)All of this is a long way from the divided and acrimonious relation between art and science described by C.P. Snow in his landmark “The Two Cultures”. Holmes locates the inflection point at the “Immortal Dinner” held in December 1817 by the fundamentalist Christian painter Benjamin Haydon (see pages 318-321). Attending this event were the poets William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, and John Keats. However, Holmes notes that this dinner did not include Coleridge, Byron, or Shelley – persons whom Holmes asserts would have had no patience for either Haydon’s rhetorical aims or the acrimony towards science espoused by their fellow poets. In the long run, however, the constructed antipathy between art and science put forward at the “Immortal Dinner” have become part of the dogma about science and art.Holmes’ central objective in Age of Wonder, then, is to usefully refute the “Two Cultures” hypothesis and to provide biographical evidence of its inadequacy both past and present as well as to partly rehabilitate the role of Romantic art and sensibility in furthering the Scientific Revolution – a viewpoint joined by Lisa Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution) and others, including, interestingly, the arch-atheist Richard Dawkins. Within the limits of my knowledge, I feel that Holmes has successfully provided a rich source of materials for his case as well as vivid biographical portraits of the personalities involved in this second stage of the English Scientific Revolution – with Lisa Jardine having provided a very useful synopsis of the first stage of the English Scientific Revolution.However, Holmes does not provide a good overall contextualization of the issues at stake, making it difficult for those without existing specialist knowledge to either understand or to evaluate his thesis. This contextualization would not have to be large – a short chapter at the beginning of the book, or rather a reworking of his introduction – would suffice to ease general readers into the debate on “two cultures” (he never actually deals with C.P. Snow’s thesis in depth here – a significant omission. Another issue is that this work is almost entirely Anglo-centric, with some mention of Antoine Lavoisier, Alexandre Charles, the Mongolfiers, and other French and German scientists. This Anglo-centrism is merited to a degree because of the key role played by Britain in the early Industrial and Scientific Revolutions. But at the same time, the reader can wonder how well Holmes’ interpretation of Romantic science translates to the broader European context. So, in closing, while this is a great book, it is not a standalone work. To extract full value from it, I would recommend looking at the back of the book, where Holmes provides a highly welcome background reading list. For anyone interested in modern political and intellectual history, some knowledge of Romanticism is a must and well worth acquiring. By the same token, some knowledge of either the sociology of science or the history and philosophy of science (these can be somewhat adversarial fields) will provide context for why it is important to understand how scientists actually practice their craft as well as the greater social context in which science takes place (see for instance Bruno Latour, Laboratory Life.) So, while I would recommend this book for anyone interested in science and early modern history, it is a book that provides greater rewards for external study than most. "
185,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"This book took me an unusually long time to finish, which at first I was inclined to blame on my own deficiencies. But by the time I finished the book, I was otherwise inclined. Quite simply, this book seemed to strive mightily to connect the major Romantic poets to some major Romantic-era scientists, but ultimately the author’s thesis fell flat for me. Granted, I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book, which focused on Joseph Banks’ voyages to Tahiti, the brother and sister astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, the African odyssey of Mungo Park, and the escapades of daredevil balloonists. Holmes does an admirable job of writing juicy mini-biographies of these and other personages, but, dazzled as I was by his eye for detail and ability to enable the reader to peer beneath his subjects’ skin, early on I found myself a bit baffled at why these disparate people were sharing space in the same volume. Then, in subsequent chapters, particularly those devoted to chemist/poet Humphrey Davy, I hit a wall. Davy, to me, was not nearly as engaging a person, despite his obvious brilliance and importance, but more to the point, at this point in the book the author begins to strain very hard to bring in connections to the Romantic poets. Davy was friends with Coleridge and wrote a great deal of (alas, not very good) poetry himself. Holmes quotes reams of Davy’s poetry (which I immediately learned to skim), as well as poetry by Coleridge, Keats, Byron and Shelley. And it was at this point that I sincerely wished that the author were NOT a specialist and biographer of the Romantic poets, for he strained so often and so hard to work in any poetic reference, however tangential, to science that I became quite impatient. His thesis.... well, I’m not entirely sure what it was, to be honest. (And hence my initial impulse to feel it was my fault as a reader, for surely there is a thesis?) Something about how the divisions between science and poetry/philosophy are artificial and that, indeed, we should endeavor to unite the two fields, which are both grounded in wonder.  But, gee, that’s an awfully broad net to cast, don’t you think? I’m afraid the result was a great deal of bycatch. Then, too, during the second half of the book, the discussion of Davy et al. becomes quite bogged down in the discussion of Davy’s various relationships (romantic and otherwise), the political wranglings of the Royal Society, and the rise or fall of various scientists’ reputations. The narrative became dense and hard to follow. However, I persisted to the end of the book, feeling that, surely, the author would tie all these disparate strands together for me in some cohesive way.No such luck. "
186,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn,4,"Interest and Science TogetherThis book is meant to emphasize that research and art go together and are inseparable. Holmes discusses how leisure time gave way to thought,involvement and art caused the scientific revolution a a is could not exist without the other. He uses examples from all over Europe and pulls stories out quite well. "
187,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"“Science is truly a relay race, with each discovery handed on to the next generation. Even as one door is closing, another door is already being thrown open. So it is with this book. For this, I believe science needs to be presented and explored in a new way. We need not only a new history of science, but a more enlarged and imaginative biographical writing about individual scientists. The old, rigid debates and boundaries — science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics — are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.”I am abashed at how much of this book I did not know, and am grateful that I do now. Slightly dry and scattered, it was hard to get through, not full of wonder but details, but worth the time. I wish there was a timeline, as the narrative moves all over the place, ostensibly chronologically but confusingly.The revolution of the time was an explosion of astronomy, chemistry, geology, exploration of the world, and changes in society “to the point that the greatest astronomer of the age would turn out to be an immigrant German musician (William Herschel and his sister!), the greatest chemist was the son of a Welsh ne’er-do-well (Humphry Davy), and a whole new branch of study—electromagnetism—would be founded by the son of a blacksmith (Michael Faraday). All these figures appear as characters in Holmes’ fascinating work, along with poets, novelists, explorers, aristocrats and even balloonists.” The scientist was also philosopher, and the lines were blurred. The author includes poetry that was inspired by the science, by Coleridge, Byron, Keats, and Shelley, and that adds a layer to the Ancient Mariner and other famous poems of the time that might be my favorite part of the book. I am reading The Second Mountain by David Brooks, and he writes of times in history when the moral ecology was changing, and Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael would say when Mother Culture gets more strident, and the frog in the boiling water doesn’t feel the heat yet. I can see the arc of time in this age of wonder, and how scientists of the time had an intense drive to be an individual, to achieve grand and stupendous things (telescopes to discover Uranus, mapping Africa, discovering potassium, etc) with recklessness and fearlessness. “Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration. These were Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world expedition aboard the Endeavour, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage to the Galapagos islands aboard the Beagle, begun in 1831. This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder, and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”I had always revered the Enlightenment Age so may have glossed over anything called Romantic, hence the ignorance. The author focuses on three Romantic themes: ballooning, global exploration and soul hunting along with the science. The author writes that far back in antiquity, “Plato argued that the notion of ‘wonder’ was central to all philosophical thought: ‘In Wonder all Philosophy began: in Wonder it ends…But the first Wonder is the Offspring of Ignorance; the last is the Parent of Adoration.’” This was quite lost during the rational Enlightenment and the Romantic poets put the wonder back into the science, and drew the lay people in to experience it. Can you imagine scads of modern poetry written about Carl Sagan or Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Like Wordsworth:Romantic traveller amidst the stars: And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The Antechapel where the Statue stood Of Newton, with his prism and his silent face, The marble index of a Mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.Wordsworth again:My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky; So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man...Epigraphs:He thought about himself, and the whole Earth, Of Man the wonderful, and of the Stars, And how the deuce they ever could have birth; And then he thought of Earthquakes, and of Wars, How many miles the Moon might have in girth, Of Air-balloons, and of the many bars To perfect Knowledge of the boundless Skies; And then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes. BYRON, Don Juan (1819)Those to whom the harmonious doors Of Science have unbarred celestial stores … WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ‘Lines Additional to an Evening Walk’ (1794)Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific … JOHN KEATS, ms of sonnet (1816)“Their minutely recorded telescope observations, published in over a hundred papers by the Royal Society, would change not only the public conception of the solar system, but of the whole Milky Way galaxy and the structure and meaning of the universe itself. It was immediately apparent that Herschel had created an instrument of unparalleled light-gathering power and clarity. He saw, for example, what very few astronomers even suspected: that the Pole Star — which had been the key to navigation, and the poet’s traditional emblem of steadiness and singularity, for centuries — was not in fact one star at all, but two stars.”“Surrounded by infinite space, and swallowed up in an immensity of being, man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean, mixed and confounded with the general mass. But from this situation, perplexing as it is, he endeavours to extricate himself; and by looking abroad into Nature, employs the powers she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.”“An unfathomably larger universe was steadily opening up, and this gradually transformed popular notions of the size and mystery of the world ‘beyond the heavens’Indeed, the very terms ‘world’, ‘heaven’ and ‘universe’ began to changetheir meanings. It was the psychological breakthrough that Kant had predicted in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens back in 1755: ‘We may cherish the hope that new plane is being uncovered.”Poetry from Erasmus Darwin celebrating the astronomical discoveries of Herschel:When Love Divine, with brooding wings unfurl’d, Call’d from the rude abyss the living World, ‘Let there be Light!’, proclaimed the Almighty Lord, Astonish’d Chaos heard the potent word; Through all his realms the kindling ether runs And the mass starts into a million Suns. Earths round each Sun with quick explosions burst, And second Planets issue from the first; Bend as they journey with projectile force, In bright ellipses their reluctant course; Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll, And form, self-balanced, one revolving whole. – Onward they move, amid their bright abode, Space.David Bourgeois both published handbooks to the science of flight in 1784. Bourgeois opened ecstatically: ‘The idea of taking to the air, of flying through sky, and navigating through the ether, has always appealed so strongly to mankind, that it has appeared in numerous classical legends and folktales from the remotest antiquity. The wings of Saturn, the eagle of Jupiter, the peacocks of Juno, the doves of Venus, the winged horses of the Sun all bear witness …’ By the end of 1784, the second year of the great balloon craze, no fewer than 181 manned ascents had been recorded, mostly in France and England.Jeffries also gave the first truly vivid account of the changing appearance of the ground as seen ‘from a bird’s eye view, as it is called’. This too was constantly surprising. As they took off, there was the white sea of upturned faces in the city squares, swiftly reduced to tiny, unrecognisable points. There was the unearthly silence, the sense of their own motionlessness as the earth seemed to revolve below the basket. Though they did not appear to move, their compass needle steadily turned. Below them, the earth appeared transformed. There was the strange flattening out of hills and buildings, the emergence of previously unsuspected patterns in the foliage of woods, or the cultivation marks in fields, or the branching streets of a town. There was the constantly delusive appearance of clouds, and sudden showers of rain or even snowflakes. (No electrical charges were recorded, much to Jeffries’ relief.) The whole world became ‘like a beautifully coloured map or carpet’Wordsworth began his poem Peter Bell (1798) with a playful image of flying in a sort of dirigible airship, or balloon boat. There’s something in a flying Horse, There’s something in a huge Balloon: But through the Clouds I’ll never float Until I have a little Boat Shaped like the crescent-Moon … Away we go! — and what care we For treason, tumults, and for wars? We are as calm in our Delight As is the crescent-Moon so bright Among the scattered Stars.Perhaps Shelley put it best:‘The balloon has not yet received the perfection of which it is surely capable; the art of navigating the air is in its first and most helpless infancy; the aerial mariner still swims on bladders, and has not yet mounted the rude raft … It would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned. It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa? — Why do we not despatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction, and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon, which a vertical sun would project precisely underneath it, as it glided over that hitherto unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.’This method of viewing the galaxies (‘to continue the simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom’) presented the entire universe in a new kind of light, with the most radical implications. ‘The heavens are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions, in different flourishing beds … and we can extend the range of our experience [of them] to an immense duration.’Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that ‘deep space’ must also imply ‘deep time’. He wrote in his Preface: A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past … [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand — that is — almost two million years on their way.’ The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great dealof explanation to the layman.Keats likens his own discovery of Homer’s poetry to the experience of the great astronomer and the great explorer finding new worlds. … Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific — and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise – Silent upon a peak in Darien.Herschel also mentioned applying Newton’s theories for measuring the speed of solar light to ‘inconceivably distant bodies’ in the stellar system, with unimaginable results. ‘Then speaking of himself, he said with a modesty of manner that quite overcame me, when taken with the greatness of the assertion: “I have looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars of which the light, it can be proved, must have taken millions of years to reach the earth.”’Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably ‘ceased to exist’ millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. ‘The light did travel after the body was gone.’Banks was soon sponsoring small but highly adventurous expeditions into Egypt and the horn of Africa. Its motives at this stage were scientific and commercial, with no missionary or colonial intentions. Its primary aim was discovery, not conquest. This would change once Banks was appointed to the Privy Council in 1797, and became ever more closely involved in prosecuting the war against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then all exploration took on a more political and frankly imperial significance. Yet Africa and Australia always fascinated Banks for their own sake.Explorer Mungo Park: “At this moment, painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small moss in fructification, irresistibly caught my eye. I mention this to show from what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive consolation; for though the whole plant was not larger than the top of one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves, and capsula, without admiration.’ In that moment of pure scientific wonder, Park’s thoughts and outlook were transformed: ‘Can the Being (thought I) who planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed?”Shelley’s wilderness, while it includes ‘dark Aethiopia in her desert hills’, is geographically vague, though it moves more towards India and an imaginary East. But he catches something of Mungo Park’s enigmatic wanderlust, and transforms it into an unearthly Miltonic quest for the strange and magnificent limits of the known world: The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, And o’er the aerial mountains which pour down Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, In joy and exultation held his way; Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched His languid limbs.I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air …To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling … A mind that has once imbibed a taste for scientific enquiry has within itself an inexhaustible source of pure and exciting contemplations. One would think that Shakespeare had such a mind in view when he describes a contemplative man finding Tongues in trees — books in the running brooks Sermons in stones — and good in everything Where the uninformed and unenquiring eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he walks in the midst of wonders. It is intriguing that Herschel was quoting from Shakespeare’s As You Like .."
188,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This is a fascinating account of the growth of science in Romantic Age of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Holmes looks at the period through the lives of ground-breaking scientists, and illuminates the intersections between science, literature, and art during the period.Among the scientists discussed in detail are Joseph Banks, William and Caroline Herschel, Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday, and a collection of truly nutty but ground-breaking (or is that, and ground-breaking) balloonists.One of the most engaging aspects of science in this period is that it was all new enough that any smart, interested person with some (not necessarily large) resources could potentially make an important contribution. Joseph Banks was educated as a botanist, and made one of his greatest contributions with detailed and insightful anthropological observations of the Tahitians. William Herschel was trained as a musician, and his sister Caroline barely educated at all; they became prominent astronomers who made major contributions to the study of the heavens. Michael Faraday was a bookseller who was hired by Humphrey Davy as a lab assistant. Some of these men were born wealthy; some were not. None started out on the path where they made their greatest contributions.Joseph Banks accompanied James Cook on the first of his voyages to the south Pacific, as a naturalist, the same role in which Charles Darwin later sailed on the HMS Beagle. A major purpose of that voyage was to observe an eclipse of the sun that would be visible in Tahiti. While Banks did a great deal of botany while he was in Tahiti, he also made extensive and detailed observations of the Tahitians, differing from most of his fellow British by being open to--indeed, becoming deeply involved in, the Tahitian culture. Initially friendly relations with the Tahitians soured as Cook and others, unable or unwilling to let go of their own preconceptions, repeatedly offended them. After they left Tahiti, the voyage deteriorated further, with conflicts, epidemic illness, and death. The survivors, including Cook and Banks, arrived back in Britain devastated and took months to recover. Still a young man at this point, Banks was at the beginning of his career, and remained a major force in British science for decades to come--but less as a scientist himself, rather as the president of the Royal Society, guiding and encouraging the scientific careers of others.With Banks' story setting the framework, we see the Herschels start out as a musician and his singer/housekeeper sister and become two of the most important astronomers of the age, Davy beginning as a medical student and transforming into a chemist and engineer, and then into a mystical, visionary writer. We see the beginnings of true specialization in science, and the founding of the first subject-specialized science professional associations, separate from the Royal Society, which had, and still sought, to encompass them all. We see, also, the connections and interactions between the scientists and the writers and artists of the age, including Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats.It's a fascinating story, and I promise I have not even scratched the surface of it. Holmes seeks to reveal character as well as accomplishments, and show the ways in which the romantic sensibility, which we generally thing of as antithetical to science, in fact inspired and encouraged the Romantic Age scientists.Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from the local library."

He falls head over heels in love with William Herschel’s sister Caroline, so essential to Hershel’s exploration of the heavens through a series of homemade telescopes, the only kind of telescope to be had at the time. The story of Humphrey Davy inventing the safety lamp that saved so many coal miners’ lives is so real he might have been an eyewitness, including all the times Davy blows up at Michael Faraday, not to mention all the times he blows up his lab. 	Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats were fascinated and inspired by these new scientific explorations and discoveries, and employed many of them as images in their work. There is a whole chapter on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, where Holmes traces the Monster’s beginnings to lectures given at the Royal Society in London, which Shelley attended and which included the attempt by one philosopher to use a primitive form of electricity to shock a corpse back to life. Eeew. 	Holmes writes of what may have been our most polymathic age in deft and witty prose. Of Herschel, an accomplished musician as well as an astronomer, he writes, “He moved from earthly music to the music of the spheres.” He writes demurely of the balloon ascension of a Mr. Biggin and a Mrs. Sage, which may or may not have given birth to the Mile High Club. He quotes a contemporary critic as saying, somewhat apologetically, “Poetical descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid principles of the Science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple unadorned language.” 	And then Holmes lets Keats underline the point,  …Then felt I like some watcher of the skies	When a new planet swims into his ken...	That watcher of the skies was Herschel. And the new planet? Uranus."
190,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027264-monika,5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. What strikes me most about Holmes is his ability to weave together what modern man has learned to compartmentalize- the sciences and the humanities. Before science was ""science,"" it was natural philosophy. Before scientists were ""scientists,"" they were natural philosophers and poets. Richard Holmes brings science and art back together in order to tell the story of how the late eighteenth century produced the foundation of what would become modern science. Framing the book with the story of Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who took part in Captain Cook's expedition to Tahiti later becoming the president of the Royal Society, Holmes moves to William Herschel, the musician and amateur astronomer who would discover Uranus with a telescope of his own making, and his sister, Caroline, who herself was responsible for discovering several comets. From the Herschel's the story moves to Mungo Parks and his travels to Africa and mapping of the Congo, followed by Sir Humphry Davy, who many believe is the founder of modern chemistry.What makes this book a wonder, however, is the pervasive spirit of inquiry of the age. Whereas now we seem to accept platitudes like ""I'm good at English, so I must not be good at math,"" this age embraced the idea that the only way to express the wonder of science is through poetry, literature, and the arts. Poets like Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley attended lectures from the great thinkers of the age, then expressed the same concerns about man's place in the world as the men who gave the lectures. What a time it must have been... human curiosity leading to unimaginable discoveries, discoveries that would forever alter the way we view our place in the universe... and such is the terror. To borrow from Carl Jung, this period marked the dawning of our self-awareness as a species in a universe that very quickly became immeasurably large and unimaginably old. Suddenly, we became ants in an ant farm instead of products of some intelligent design... Richard Holmes captures the complexities of the period in a most poetic way. I will be coming back to this book many times."
191,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779830-andrew,3,"I forgot about this book until I saw it again here. My father sent this book to me a few years ago. I enjoyed learning about the various people, scientists as well as non-scientists. I like that Holmes gives so much detail about, for instance, the grinding of the mirror for the telescope. And how it was paid for. For me, the book would be just as enjoyable if it was a collection of anecdotes and free of any speculation as to whether or how the literature and paintings of the time may or may not have influenced the scientists of that time. Holmes undertakes the great challenge of finding connections between Romantic notions and the scientific pursuits of those times. I really don't see how such connections can be made without knowing the biographies of the scientists well enough to know the extent of their interest in Romantic notions. That can be hard to know for anyone. I did enjoy learning that S.T. Coleridge was solicited to join a convention of people doing science, at least partly for the purpose of helping to choose a word to apply to the people who do science. As a result of this convention, the word scientist came into general use. It seemed to me that, of all the regard these scientists had for Romantic notions, Holmes related more about Humphry Davies' than any other. "
192,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/392337-sarah,5,"This is an amazing book. It doesn't have as much to do with literary Romanticism as I had originally hoped, but by the end of the first chapter I didn't care. Holmes is an excellent writer, and he makes the excitement and amazement of the scientists and explorers he profiles live. I think my favorite sections are the ones that deal with Joseph Banks, who went on a scientific voyage to Tahiti as a young man and, despite a successful career as a botanist in England, mentor to many younger scientists, and long-time president of the Royal Society, never seems to have found anything that moved him in the same way as Tahiti. To some extent, this book is a series of linked biographies: Banks, astronomer William Herschel and his sister Caroline, Sir Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday. Holmes is also very good at drawing out the political (whether national competition over who should be credited with discoveries or in-fighting over who should lead the various scientific societies) and philosophical (German Romantic writers and Coleridge make appearances here) implications of the scientific discoveries involved. It's not often a book is so informative, gripping, and well written all at once. "
193,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,4,"This was the first book assigned for my new semester, which means I'm going back to reading school stuff round the clock again, but luckily this first one was a great one. It's really a combined biography of Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Science, explorer of Tahiti), William Herschel (discovered Uranus), and Humphrey Davy (experimented with nitrous oxide, and also became President of Royal Society), along with a couple of other secondary stories. The best is probably the history behind Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, tracing it to the debates about the existence of a cosmic ""vitalist"" force, a debate that originated in the circle of German ""nature philosopher"" Frederich Schelling.The book was probably too long though, and plodded through parts of Herschel's and Davy's biographies (especially Davy's atrocious poetry), but it does do a great job showing how the worlds of Romantic literature and early modern science interacted. One takeaway, they all loved Coleridge."
194,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43247-emi-bevacqua,3,"This book is kind of the ultimate departure from my personal comfort zone: nearly 500 pages on the history of western science juxtaposed with poetry. Richard Holmes is an amazing researcher and writer, he really brings the age to life and I loved the beautiful color art inserts. The first section was very straightforward, about the young explorer Joseph Banks and his discoveries in Tahiti; in the next we meet a young astronomist that Banks discovered, named William Herschel and also his sister-assistant Caroline. Then with each chapter and introduction to subsequent scientists the reader is keeping track of more and more complexity, collegial scientists and poets, their discoveries and published work, their travels, and family relations! Throughout it all - anthropology, cosmology, flight, mesmerism, chemistry - the unifying thread is the history of the Royal Society of London scientists, led for the most part by Joseph Banks. My favorite quote is when somebody asks ""What's the use of a (hot air) balloon?"" and Benjamin Franklin responds, ""What's the use of a newborn baby?"" "
195,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,0,"There is obviously something wrong with me. Everyone raves about this book - so far I am finding it choppy, hard to read, all over the map and not particularly well-written. Holmes's penchant for including every detail of everything he ever read about his subjects is exhausting - a better writer would take the trouble to pare things down in the service of a more readable narrative. Part of my disappointment so far is that I didn't find Joseph Banks, the subject of the first 70 pages, a particularly engaging or interesting character. His major contribution to scientific progress appears to have been to bring back a bunch of specimens from Tahiti, a fundamentally pedestrian activity. Darwin's voyage on The Beagle was interesting because of how he subsequently synthesized his observations - Banks is a far duller character, no matter how many natives he slept with.Maybe things will pick up with Herschel and Davy."

We need to understand how science is actually made; how scientists themselves think and feel and speculate. We need to explore what makes scientists creative, as well as poets or painters, or musicians. That is how this book began. The old, rigid debates and boundaries -- science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics -- are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.
The Age of Wonder isn't quite the book I expected it to be: I was looking forward to a lot of science, which I find intriguing, but I found this work to be laden down with a lot of biographical information, which I find to be less so. The Romantic Period must have been an astonishing time to be alive, indeed an Age of Wonder; a time when any amateur, even a foreign musician like William Herschel, with enough curiosity and funds could literally point out new discoveries in the self-same night sky humans had been regarding for millennia. A privileged young man, like Joseph Banks, could buy himself passage on a voyage of discovery under Captain Cook and, in the process of collecting botanical specimens from Tahiti, invent the new field of Anthropology. Science, at the beginning of this period, was accessible and democratic: a barely educated young man, like Humphrey Davy, was able to wrest the study of the elements from the grip of the Alchemists and properly begin the discipline of Chemistry -- no longer searching for how to transmute the impossible, Davy (et al) did simple experiments to discover what does happen. Imagine a time when that was revolutionary thinking. Imagine if there were still basic discoveries to be made in nature; discoveries waiting to be plucked like low hanging fruit.I was delighted by the intersections between Science and Literature and Philosophy; how each informed the others; how so many of these early Scientists not only rubbed elbows with the likes of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Byron, but also expressed their own amazement in well-regarded verse. This also worked in reverse, with the great poets of the age attending scientific lectures in order to learn the terminology, the great metaphors of the day -- could this possibly be happening today?This book is exhaustive, and ultimately, I found that to be…exhausting. The following is more for my own memory than part of a proper review (and as I would probably advise anyone reading this review to just end here, I'm going to hide it all as a spoiler).(view spoiler)[I was charmed by Banks in Tahiti, and appreciated all of the primary source materials that were provided (the personal letters and journals and articles that filled in the big picture, that made the age come alive), but in some later sections these additions felt gossipy and a bit pointless. My favourite part from Tahiti: On their last day they discovered an enormous stone 'marai' or funeral monument, shaped like a pyramid, some forty-four feet high and nearly 300 feet wide, with steps of superbly polished white coral down both sides. This, the 'masterpiece' of Tahitian architecture on the island, was unsettling to Banks because its construction seemed technically inexplicable. 'It is beyond belief that Indians could raise so large a structure without the assistance of Iron tools to shape their stones or mortar to join them.'Not far away was another mystery: a huge wicker man constructed of basketwork, evidently for some obscure sacrificial rite. 'The whole was neatly covered with feathers, white to represent skin and black to represent hair and tattow.' I love stuff like that, and yes, I watch Ancient Aliens: not because I believe extraterrestrials built this curious 'marai', but because I revel in the mystery of these sorts of ancient structures and monuments and that show has a new one for me every week. Because of the noted intersections with literature, I was jotting down the books I was reminded of as I was reading. For this section, it was : Jamrach's Menagerie, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Unfamiliar Fishes (and how sad to note the evolution of Captain Cook from his empathetic treatment of the Tahitians to his brutality towards the Hawaiins), Parrot and Olivier in America, Moby Dick.I enjoyed the first section on William Herschel, but again, the biographical information was simply overwhelming -- I would have much preferred a general overview of his life in Hanover before emigrating to England and found no benefit at all in the biographies of his family members other than Caroline. When the book revisited the Herchels later -- more of the same and more of the same plus the details of his marriage and family -- I was seriously bored. I suppose the fact that his son, John, went on to become a leading figure in the Victorian Age of Science explains why we must follow William to the grave, but that wasn't what I wanted from this book (which I understand is a fault of my own, not the author). Since Caroline was profoundly affected by the Lisbon earthquake, I was put in mind of Candide and also of Frankenstein (not realising this book would be quoted at great length later).I was amused by the section on ballooning, and appreciate how at the time it must have seemed like the dawn of the Jetsons with their flying cars, but since in the end it was dismissed as a fad, more suited to carnivals than scientific study, I don't know that it belonged in this book. I did like this part: Benjamin Franklin, American Ambassador in Paris, watched the launch (of the first manned balloon flight) through a telescope from the window of his carriage. Afterwards he remarked: 'Someone asked me -- what's the use of a balloon? I replied - what's the use of a newborn baby?'Obvious choices, but I was reminded of Around the World in Eighty Days and The Wizard of Oz.Age of Wonder picked up (after another dull visit with the Herchels) when it told the thrilling story of Mongo Park and his two expeditions to find the source of the Niger in Africa. While the first trip was pure adventurism, the second smacked of imperialism, and it was probably due to his own self-important beliefs that he failed to pay due respect to the local tribes and was never seen again. Literary tie-ins: Heart of Darkness (for which Park was likely the inspiration for Kurtz), and because so much of this book takes place during the Napoleonic years and the war between France and Britain, A Tale of Two Cities.Humphrey Davy was a Poet and Chemist who experimented on himself with Nitrous Oxide, like a Timothy Leary for his time, without making the leap to its use in surgery. (A later section on the mastectomy that Fanny Burney endured without benefit of anesthetic made for a harrowing reading experience, but it was one more event that I wasn't certain belonged in what I thought this book was meant to be). Davy then made the leap to the study of Galvinism, and this sparked the great debates about Vitalism and ""is there an animating principle"" -- a soul? -- in humans, the great parlour discussion topic of the time, and that led to the first inklings of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This was interesting, but the very lengthy quoting from the book and its reception by the public and the stage play that came later -- all of this seemed beside the point to me. As was Davy's disintegrating marriage and political dealings with the Royal Academy of Science and his ""little nurse in Illyria"" -- so much biography, so little actual science. I did, however, appreciate when Davy put his mind to creating a safety-lamp for miners -- his great effort to demonstrate that science was for the benefit of mankind; theory that may be put into practise. The literary tie-ins at this point were all poetry: Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Prometheus Unbound.  (hide spoiler)]Okay, so after that long stretch of what was interesting and not so interesting to me, I return to Richard Holme's quote that I started with, the bit he actually ended with, and specifically:  Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. How many of us have this hope and wonder? I don't know that I believe the scientists of today are imbued with hope and wonder; that they are philosophical about their work; that they have the creative souls of artists. But perhaps I'm wrong and I thank Age of Wonder for forcing me to think of Science in this way.I wanted to love this book, but it was ultimately brought down by the immensity of the information it contained -- had it left out the society news and letters from home, I might have enjoyed it much more. "
197,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23672960-brian-willis,5,"Conventional wisdom places the scientific and rational achievements of the Age of Enlightenment in direct opposition to the fundamental values of the age of Romanticism in the arts. Poetry and art exuberantly shifted from an emphasis on cold rationality and collective achievement as well as logical procedures of the calculating mind towards exploration of the sentimentality of the human spirit, the individual within the natural world, and the subconscious. In other words, the movement was from the visible (or that which could be explained through rational observation) towards explaining the invisible (the interior subjective human self, the passions, the drives, and impulses that cannot be explained through science, at least in that era).Richard Holmes, perhaps the great living biographer of the Romantic era presents us with a multi-part biography of the scientists that influenced the Romantics, but instead of playing the party line of this dialectic, he demonstrates that the Romantic Era existed INFUSED with the spirit of exploration of the science of the age. Beginning with Sir Joseph Banks, he explains the foundation of the Royal Society. Then he divides a large part of the book following and documenting the life and achievements of Sir William Herschel and Sir Humphrey Davy. Herschel made his fame discovering Uranus, but Holmes argues effectively that his development of advanced telescopes as well as a method towards cataloguing the night sky were influential for future generations. One of the unsung heroes of the book is Caroline Herschel, his sister, who actually become the first patronized and influential female astronomer. Davy expanded our knowledge of natural gases and their containment, most effectively with his staggering safety lamp for miners. Other topics discussed are the passion for tales of the exploits of explorer Mungo Park and the origination of aerial flight through hot air ballooning. Holmes ties these achievements into the ongoing saga of the leading Romantics, particularly their encounters with Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley, and Keats (with Wordsworth gliding in the background and occasionally making an appearance). He points out moments in their compositions that reference the achievements of Banks, the Herschels, Davy, Park, Sadler, and many others. As the Romantics ascended, the reputation of science seems to have retroactively been placed into competition with the values of the age of Romanticism and later Victorianism. The Romantics grappled with the same issues that the scientists did however; the revelations of the cosmos and the sanctity of particles in observation of tiny objects were revealing the same troubling conclusions for both scientists and poets. If there are uncountable galaxies, is it ludicrous to think that Christ was crucified millions of times to redeem the universe? Surprisingly, this hint at atheism backfired on scientists and their reputation for years to come while Romantics with their celebration of pagan values and occasionally an atheist or two, somehow escaped the judgement of posterity though facing criticism in their time. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, inspired by the electrical current experimentation of Galvani, was interpreted as a condemnation of the limits of science (though that was not Shelley's intent).In the end, Holmes writes an incredibly enlightening and informative group biography, argues for the art of biography as a window into the discovery process of science, and demonstrates that these scientists not only created the profession of scientist but also the groundwork for the scientific method, as eventually perfected by Charles Darwin (who also makes an appearance). Another triumph from one of my favorite writers."
198,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16010931-douglass-gaking,5,"The Age of Wonder is a solid history of British scientists in the Romantic era. It focuses on the individual scientists' lives, their experiments, their writings–both personal and published–and their connections to each other.Scientists in focus include Joseph Banks, William Herschel, Michael Faraday, and even the fictional Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Each chapter is as in-depth as a biography.I especially like the chapter on William Herschel. I had not realized how close he came to our current understanding of the construction of the universe, despite being formally trained as a musician, and self-taught as a scientist.My main takeaway from this book is how imaginative these scientists were. Whether it is believing in the chemical nature of the soul or the existence of life on the moon, they had wild theories that certainly fit in with the sentiment of the Romantic era. While so many of these hypothesis proved to be false, whether in their lifetimes or later, it is the pursuit of proving them through experimentation that advanced human knowledge into the modern age."

It focuses on four individuals, Joseph Banks, (explorer and driving force behind the Royal Society for many years) Caroline and William Herschel (sister and brother astronomers) and Humphry Davy (chemist). Two things stand out from the rest for me. First, the author discussed women's roles in science and the role of Caroline Herschel in particular. She was the first woman awarded a stipend by the King for her astronomical work (albeit at half the rate a man would have received). Second, I was surprised by the strong overlap of science and poetry. Many of the scientists were published poets, including Herschel and Davy and many of the poets were also active in the sciences (Coleridge and Wordsworth among others).At almost 500 pages the book dragged in a few places, particularly when the author was describing societal trends rather than giving biographies of the various scientists and poets. But, all in all, well worth the time it took to read it."

It makes me wish I lived in the Victorian ages just so I could go here these talks on nascent principles and ideas, no matter how off they were in the long run. In my Victorian fantasies I’m super rich and, apparently, male. But just reading about these explorers, these astronomers, these scientists developing these wonderful inventions and ideas that went on to better the world … it’s heady stuff. At times the book is a bit dry, but for the most part the subject matter is so rich you get entirely wrapped up in it."

It's enlightening to understand their motivation for their actions. The author was also very interested in literary pursuits of the scientists, analyzing and interpreting their poetry. I liked that philosophical men of science felt encouraged to write their own poetry. I don't believe that is the case very often nowadays.This was such a dense read. It took me a long time to get through it, not because it was poorly written or boring, but because there was so much information to absorb on each page. And each page was equally as interesting as it was dense.""To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling ... a soap bubble ... an apple ... a pebble ... He walks in the midst of wonders."" - John Herschel, A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1830). pg. xiii""But while Cook clung to the necessity of European forms and discipline, Banks was rather inclined to dwell on the superfluity of European needs. These were perhaps the reflections of a man who had always been used to wealth and comforts. 'From them appear how small are the real wants of human nature, which we Europeans have increasd to an excess which would certainly appear incredible to these people could they be told it. Nor shall we cease to increase them as long as Luxuries can be invented and riches found for the purchase of them; and how soon these Luxuries degenerate into necessaries may be sufficiently evincd by the universal use of strong liquors, Tobacco, spices, Tea &c. &c.'"" pg. 39""Riding between musical engagements, from one remote provincial northern town to another, often crossing over the moors alone at night, he found himself studying the panoply of stars overhead as he had done as a boy. He became well acquainted with the moon, and would later write that at this time he had intended 'to fix upon the moon for my habitation.' He also later told several tales about these lonely rides, one being how on one occasion he was reading so intently that when his horse stumbled and threw him, he somersaulted over its head and landed upright still holding his book in his hand, a perfect demonstration of the Newtonian law of 'circular motion.'"" pg. 74""Characteristically, Pilatre ignored these protests, and calmly went on telling d'Arlandes to work at feeding the brazier. He himself took off his bright green topcoat (put on for the crowd), rolled up his sleeves, and went on throwing on straw till his wooden fork broke. Once, when d'Arlandes was desperately shouting at him, 'We must go down! We must go down!,' Pilatre called back soothingly: 'Look d'Arlandes. Here we are above Paris. There's no possible danger for you. Are you taking this all in?' Many witnesses later said that they could hear the two men shouting excitedly to each other as they passed overhead. They assumed they were describing the glories of flight."" pg. 130""It was a glorious pink-and-yellow, candy-coloured balloon, thirty feet tall, and the crowd loved it. The wickerwork basket, a sort of chaise longue for two, was completely festooned with flags and bunting. Dr Charles had a full payload of scientific equipment aboard--mercury barometer (which was used as an early form of altimeter), thermometer, telescope, sand bags and several bottles of champagne."" pg. 131""Surprisingly, balloons did not appeal to the gothic novelist Horace Walpole, though perhaps at sixty-six he was a little old for such perilous novelties. He thought balloons might be sinister: 'Well! I hope these new mechanic meteors will prove only playthings for the learned and idle, and not be converted into new engines of destruction to the human race--as is so often the case of refinements or discoveries in Science. The wicked wit of man always studies to apply the results of talents to enslaving, destroying, or cheating his fellow creatures. Could we reach the moon, we should think of reducing it to a province of some European kingdom.' It was an ominous prophecy."" pg. 135To note: What we Americans call the Revolutionary War, the British call the American War of Independence. pg. 147""Ballooning added to this new awareness of the complexity and subtlety of clouds, a growing Romantic preoccupation which can be followed in the paintings of Turner and Constable, the notebooks of Coleridge and the poetry of Shelley. When Shelley refers to 'the locks of the approaching storm' in his 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819), he is using Howard's definition cirrus. 'The Cloud' (1820) demonstrates a remarkably accurate and scientific understanding of cloud formation and the convection cycle. Goethe wrote a number of essays on clouds, atmospheric pressures and weather, and translated passages of Howard, asking him to compose and send his Autobiography to Germany, and describing him as 'the first to define conceptually the airy and ever-changing forms of clouds, thus delimiting and fixing what had always been ephemeral and intangible, by accurate observation and naming.'"" pg. 160""Clouds became fascinating both as scientific phenomena--the generators of electricity, the mysterious indicators of winds and changing air pressure--and as aesthetic phenomena: the 'moods' of the sky reflecting those of the observer, alterations of light over landscape, symbols of change, destruction, regeneration. It could be argued that the Romantics actually invented the idea of 'the weather' itself, as it now preoccupies us; as well, of course, as 'inner weather.'"" pg. 160""Ballooning produced a new, and wholly unexpected, vision of the earth. It had been imagined that it would reveal the secrets of the heavens above, but in fact it showed the secrets of the world beneath. The early aeronauts suddenly saw the earth as a giant organism, mysteriously patterned and unfolding, like a living creature. For the first time the impact of man on nature was clearly revealed: the ever-expanding relationship of towns to countryside, roads to rivers, cultivated fields to forests, and the development of industry. It was comparable to the first views of the earth from space by the Apollo astronauts in the 1960s, producing a new concept of a 'single blue planet' with its delicate membrane of atmosphere. The famous photograph 'Earthrise' was taken from lunar orbit in December 1968."" pg. 161""As he grew older, Herschel was becoming a remoter figure in the household. His mind was ranging through the universe. His later papers for the Royal Society had begun to show an increasing awareness of the philosophical significance of astronomy. This was something urged upon him by his old supporter William Watson, who looked forward to conversations 'on Kant's metaphysics,' and wished to know how far Herschel agreed with the 'ground and sources' of Kant's philosophy of knowledge."" pg. 203""Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that 'deep space' must also imply 'deep time.' He wrote in his Preface: 'A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past ... [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand--that is--almost two million years on their way.' The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great deal of explanation to the layman."" pg. 203""Herschel continued to reach carefully towards the idea of an evolving universe, a concept as radical in its eventual implications as Erasmus Darwin's notion of evolution within plants and animals. In a late paper published in 1811, 'Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens,' Herschel further developed the idea . . . that all nebulae and large star clusters were at particular points in their sidereal life-cycles, which could be visually identified and catalogued almost in a Linnaean manner. Their characteristic shapes suggested distinct moments of youth, maturing and ageing."" pg. 204""It presented the universe as a living, growing, organic entity, with all nebulae belonging to one enormous extended family: 'There is not so much difference between them, if I may use the comparison, as there would be in an annual description of the human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a man in his prime.' This comparison is an intriguing premonition of 'time-lapse' photography, now one of the most powerful illustrative tools of modern natural history."" pg. 204-205""Physical vision--one might say scientific vision--brings about a metaphysical shift in the observer's view of reality as a whole. The geography of the earth, or the structure of the solar system, are in an instant utterly changed, and forever. The explorer, the scientific observer, the literary reader, experience the Sublime: a moment of revelation into the idea of the unbounded, the infinite."" pg. 207""At all events, it was clear that the Milky Way 'cannot last forever'; and equally that 'its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.' It followed that neither the earth, nor even the solar system, was a separate creation, but merely an infinitesimal part of a galactic evolution. Our galaxy had a physical beginning, and would have a physical conclusion. Our solar system, our planet, and hence our whole civilisation would have an ultimate and unavoidable end."" pg. 209""Campbell recalled that he felt he had been 'conversing with a supernatural intelligence.' Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably 'ceased to exist' millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. 'The light did travel after the body was gone.' After leaving Herschel, Campbell walked onto the shingle of Brighton beach, gazing out to sea, feeling 'evelvated and overcome.' He was reminded of Newton's observation that he was just a child picking up shells on the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay all before him."" pg. 210""It is evident that the death of his father, and all the subsequent emotional upheavals, profoundly shook the sixteen-year-old Davy, and started an intellectual ferment that never left him. Besides writing poetry, he also started his first diary, set himself reading lists and work timetables, and began a series of essays on religion versus materialism. During 1796 he wrote an essay 'On Mathematics,' and another 'On Consciousness,' which gleefully explored the implications of materialism. He described the body as 'a fine tuned Machine,' and wrote a syllogistic proof that the 'soul' could not exist, since it was said to be eternal and 'unchangeable,' while every known part of the human body, including the brain, was temporary and changed perpetually. 'QED the soul does not exist.'"" pg. 243""One of Burney's many extraordinary reflections was whether extreme physical pain could not only induce unconsciousness--'I have two total chasms in my memory of this transaction'--but actually force the soul out of the body. She also found that the act of recollection carried its own pain, and that she had taken three months to complete the account, as a letter of nearly 10,000 words to her sister Esther. She had severe headaches every time she tried to go on with it. Once finished, she could not look back over what she had written. 'I dare not revise, nor read, the recollection is still so painful.' It is an astonishing record of courage, not least in Fanny's determination to protect her husband from the trauma of the operation. But it also recalls what the real conditions of surgery were at this period."" pg. 306""But speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical ideas of Friedrich Schelling and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine, perhaps best translated as 'science mysticism,' defined the entire natural world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity as a series of 'polarities.' According to Schelling's doctrine, the whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical objects 'aspired' to become something higher. There was a 'world-soul' constantly 'evolving' higher life forms and 'levels of consciousness' in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards a higher state."" pg. 315""Davy's notebooks for this period also suggest a new pattern of philosophical speculation, almost approaching German Naturphilosophie. Some of his observations would have been recognised by Coleridge: 'The aspirations for immortality are movements of the mind similar to those which a bird makes with its wings before they are furnished with feathers.' Others were more closely tied to his laboratory work. On the subject of scientific 'analogy,' for instance, he wondered if there was a wider principle at work. 'Probably there is an analogy in all existence: the divided tail of the fish is linked in a long succession of like objects with the biped man. In the planetary system it is probable man will be found connected with a higher intellectual nature; and it is possible that the monad, or soul, is constantly undergoing a series of progressions.'"" pg. 357""In November 1827 Davy returned briefly to London to resign his presidency of the Royal Society. He later gave a moving glimpse of his disillusion with his own scientific career on this sad return: 'In my youth, and through the prime of manhood, I never entered London without feelings of pleasure and hope. It was to me as the grand theatre of intellectual activity, the field of every species of enterprise and exertion, the metropolis of the world of business, thought, and action ... I now entered the great city in a very different tone of mind, one of settled melancholy ... My health was gone, my ambition was satisfied, I was no longer excited by the desire of distinction; what I regarded most tenderly [my mother], was in the grave ... My cup of life was no longer sparkling, sweet, and effervescent ... it has become bitter.' In a wonderfully sardonic aside, Davy added that this metaphor of the 'cup of life' was scientifically derived from the chemical fermentation of 'the juice of the grape,' and then after a certain lapse of time, its oxidisation and acidification."" pg. 419""Babbage perhaps intended a sort of parable of science for the new generation. His story went as follows. When Babbage first peered carefully at the shimmering solar image projected through Herschel's prism, he could not see these dark Fraunhofer lines, though he knew they were there. Herschel then commented to him: 'An object is frequently not seen, from not knowing how to see it, rather than from any deficit in the organ of vision ... I will instruct you how to see them.' After some time spent re-examining and refocusing the image, Babbage could see them perfectly. The point was that science must always be more than the simple observation of phenomena or data. It was simultaneously a subjective training in observation skills, self-criticism and interpretation: a complete education. This was of course precisely what William Herschel had said forty years before, about learning to see with a telescope."" pg. 440Book: borrowed from the SSF Main Library."

His deft handling the scientific discoveries that made these men and women - the Herschels (William, Caroline, and John), Joseph Banks, Michael Farady, Humphry Davy, et al - so important is admirable, of course, but more impressive is his ability to marshal an enormous amount of research into a coherent, pleasurable narrative.

214,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,5,"In writing this review, I am keeping in mind that an old and very dear friend of mine (who has read and liked this book) is highly interested in my evaluation. I mention this because it leads to an important point about the book: the background of the reader will strongly determine what he or she gets out of reading The Age of Wonder. For my part, I approach this work as a sociologist who is currently (fall 2013) preparing to take a doctoral exam in the sociology of science. Hence, I already have some grounding in this field and I will use this book as deep background for my own work in science and technology studies.To extract the maximum value from this work, the reader will need some knowledge of Romanticism and the history and philosophy of science – in particular the “two cultures” debate deriving from C.P. Snow’s famous work of that name. This is not to say that this book is entirely useless to the reader lacking such a background, but it will be more difficult for the reader to grasp the overall argument, as Holmes does not provide such contextualization. However, his skills as a biographer are so good that the reader can derive enormous value simply reading the book as a set of biographical vignettes and it would not be a waste of time.  However, the core of Holmes’ work involves an extended critique of the notion that art and science are invariably at odds. Holmes’ objective is to show that this tension is largely a product of Late Romanticism (early 19th Century) and in sociological terms is very much a cultural and political “project”. Indeed, Holmes provides compelling evidence not only that science and art are not inherently adversarial but that in Early Romanticism the two were deeply interconnected and (Holmes argues) drew strength from each other. Hence the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) was not only a Romantic author but worked with Humphry Davy (the chemist) and conducted experiments with prisms in Germany. Davy for his part wrote both early science fiction as well as poetry. And these are but two examples that Holmes provides. He builds a picture of how through Romantic philosophy both science and art were unified by the feature intrinsic to both: creative thought. In this way, Romantic science can be distinguished from the more purely rationalistic viewpoint of the Early Enlightenment (in the works of Descartes, Spinoza, and Hobbes for example). Spinoza forms a case in point (I get this from Steven Nadler’s study of Spinoza in A Book Forged in Hell). Spinoza asserted that there was no role for imagination in rational society (including science) and that knowledge was based on the accumulation of facts. However, scientists of the Romantic Age (and after, such as Richard Feynman) dismissed the adequacy of simply collecting facts. Scientific understanding required conceptual breakthroughs, and this was only available via creative thought and imagination. (The cultural meme of the creative scientific breakthrough – Archimedes’ “Eureka!” moment – remains strong in present day public understanding of science. Witness how nonscientists regard Einstein or Stephen Hawking.)All of this is a long way from the divided and acrimonious relation between art and science described by C.P. Snow in his landmark “The Two Cultures”. Holmes locates the inflection point at the “Immortal Dinner” held in December 1817 by the fundamentalist Christian painter Benjamin Haydon (see pages 318-321). Attending this event were the poets William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, and John Keats. However, Holmes notes that this dinner did not include Coleridge, Byron, or Shelley – persons whom Holmes asserts would have had no patience for either Haydon’s rhetorical aims or the acrimony towards science espoused by their fellow poets. In the long run, however, the constructed antipathy between art and science put forward at the “Immortal Dinner” have become part of the dogma about science and art.Holmes’ central objective in Age of Wonder, then, is to usefully refute the “Two Cultures” hypothesis and to provide biographical evidence of its inadequacy both past and present as well as to partly rehabilitate the role of Romantic art and sensibility in furthering the Scientific Revolution – a viewpoint joined by Lisa Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution) and others, including, interestingly, the arch-atheist Richard Dawkins. Within the limits of my knowledge, I feel that Holmes has successfully provided a rich source of materials for his case as well as vivid biographical portraits of the personalities involved in this second stage of the English Scientific Revolution – with Lisa Jardine having provided a very useful synopsis of the first stage of the English Scientific Revolution.However, Holmes does not provide a good overall contextualization of the issues at stake, making it difficult for those without existing specialist knowledge to either understand or to evaluate his thesis. This contextualization would not have to be large – a short chapter at the beginning of the book, or rather a reworking of his introduction – would suffice to ease general readers into the debate on “two cultures” (he never actually deals with C.P. Snow’s thesis in depth here – a significant omission. Another issue is that this work is almost entirely Anglo-centric, with some mention of Antoine Lavoisier, Alexandre Charles, the Mongolfiers, and other French and German scientists. This Anglo-centrism is merited to a degree because of the key role played by Britain in the early Industrial and Scientific Revolutions. But at the same time, the reader can wonder how well Holmes’ interpretation of Romantic science translates to the broader European context. So, in closing, while this is a great book, it is not a standalone work. To extract full value from it, I would recommend looking at the back of the book, where Holmes provides a highly welcome background reading list. For anyone interested in modern political and intellectual history, some knowledge of Romanticism is a must and well worth acquiring. By the same token, some knowledge of either the sociology of science or the history and philosophy of science (these can be somewhat adversarial fields) will provide context for why it is important to understand how scientists actually practice their craft as well as the greater social context in which science takes place (see for instance Bruno Latour, Laboratory Life.) So, while I would recommend this book for anyone interested in science and early modern history, it is a book that provides greater rewards for external study than most. "
215,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"This book took me an unusually long time to finish, which at first I was inclined to blame on my own deficiencies. But by the time I finished the book, I was otherwise inclined. Quite simply, this book seemed to strive mightily to connect the major Romantic poets to some major Romantic-era scientists, but ultimately the author’s thesis fell flat for me. Granted, I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book, which focused on Joseph Banks’ voyages to Tahiti, the brother and sister astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, the African odyssey of Mungo Park, and the escapades of daredevil balloonists. Holmes does an admirable job of writing juicy mini-biographies of these and other personages, but, dazzled as I was by his eye for detail and ability to enable the reader to peer beneath his subjects’ skin, early on I found myself a bit baffled at why these disparate people were sharing space in the same volume. Then, in subsequent chapters, particularly those devoted to chemist/poet Humphrey Davy, I hit a wall. Davy, to me, was not nearly as engaging a person, despite his obvious brilliance and importance, but more to the point, at this point in the book the author begins to strain very hard to bring in connections to the Romantic poets. Davy was friends with Coleridge and wrote a great deal of (alas, not very good) poetry himself. Holmes quotes reams of Davy’s poetry (which I immediately learned to skim), as well as poetry by Coleridge, Keats, Byron and Shelley. And it was at this point that I sincerely wished that the author were NOT a specialist and biographer of the Romantic poets, for he strained so often and so hard to work in any poetic reference, however tangential, to science that I became quite impatient. His thesis.... well, I’m not entirely sure what it was, to be honest. (And hence my initial impulse to feel it was my fault as a reader, for surely there is a thesis?) Something about how the divisions between science and poetry/philosophy are artificial and that, indeed, we should endeavor to unite the two fields, which are both grounded in wonder.  But, gee, that’s an awfully broad net to cast, don’t you think? I’m afraid the result was a great deal of bycatch. Then, too, during the second half of the book, the discussion of Davy et al. becomes quite bogged down in the discussion of Davy’s various relationships (romantic and otherwise), the political wranglings of the Royal Society, and the rise or fall of various scientists’ reputations. The narrative became dense and hard to follow. However, I persisted to the end of the book, feeling that, surely, the author would tie all these disparate strands together for me in some cohesive way.No such luck. "
216,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn,4,"Interest and Science TogetherThis book is meant to emphasize that research and art go together and are inseparable. Holmes discusses how leisure time gave way to thought,involvement and art caused the scientific revolution a a is could not exist without the other. He uses examples from all over Europe and pulls stories out quite well. "
217,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"“Science is truly a relay race, with each discovery handed on to the next generation. Even as one door is closing, another door is already being thrown open. So it is with this book. For this, I believe science needs to be presented and explored in a new way. We need not only a new history of science, but a more enlarged and imaginative biographical writing about individual scientists. The old, rigid debates and boundaries — science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics — are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.”I am abashed at how much of this book I did not know, and am grateful that I do now. Slightly dry and scattered, it was hard to get through, not full of wonder but details, but worth the time. I wish there was a timeline, as the narrative moves all over the place, ostensibly chronologically but confusingly.The revolution of the time was an explosion of astronomy, chemistry, geology, exploration of the world, and changes in society “to the point that the greatest astronomer of the age would turn out to be an immigrant German musician (William Herschel and his sister!), the greatest chemist was the son of a Welsh ne’er-do-well (Humphry Davy), and a whole new branch of study—electromagnetism—would be founded by the son of a blacksmith (Michael Faraday). All these figures appear as characters in Holmes’ fascinating work, along with poets, novelists, explorers, aristocrats and even balloonists.” The scientist was also philosopher, and the lines were blurred. The author includes poetry that was inspired by the science, by Coleridge, Byron, Keats, and Shelley, and that adds a layer to the Ancient Mariner and other famous poems of the time that might be my favorite part of the book. I am reading The Second Mountain by David Brooks, and he writes of times in history when the moral ecology was changing, and Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael would say when Mother Culture gets more strident, and the frog in the boiling water doesn’t feel the heat yet. I can see the arc of time in this age of wonder, and how scientists of the time had an intense drive to be an individual, to achieve grand and stupendous things (telescopes to discover Uranus, mapping Africa, discovering potassium, etc) with recklessness and fearlessness. “Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration. These were Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world expedition aboard the Endeavour, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage to the Galapagos islands aboard the Beagle, begun in 1831. This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder, and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”I had always revered the Enlightenment Age so may have glossed over anything called Romantic, hence the ignorance. The author focuses on three Romantic themes: ballooning, global exploration and soul hunting along with the science. The author writes that far back in antiquity, “Plato argued that the notion of ‘wonder’ was central to all philosophical thought: ‘In Wonder all Philosophy began: in Wonder it ends…But the first Wonder is the Offspring of Ignorance; the last is the Parent of Adoration.’” This was quite lost during the rational Enlightenment and the Romantic poets put the wonder back into the science, and drew the lay people in to experience it. Can you imagine scads of modern poetry written about Carl Sagan or Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Like Wordsworth:Romantic traveller amidst the stars: And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The Antechapel where the Statue stood Of Newton, with his prism and his silent face, The marble index of a Mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.Wordsworth again:My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky; So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man...Epigraphs:He thought about himself, and the whole Earth, Of Man the wonderful, and of the Stars, And how the deuce they ever could have birth; And then he thought of Earthquakes, and of Wars, How many miles the Moon might have in girth, Of Air-balloons, and of the many bars To perfect Knowledge of the boundless Skies; And then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes. BYRON, Don Juan (1819)Those to whom the harmonious doors Of Science have unbarred celestial stores … WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ‘Lines Additional to an Evening Walk’ (1794)Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific … JOHN KEATS, ms of sonnet (1816)“Their minutely recorded telescope observations, published in over a hundred papers by the Royal Society, would change not only the public conception of the solar system, but of the whole Milky Way galaxy and the structure and meaning of the universe itself. It was immediately apparent that Herschel had created an instrument of unparalleled light-gathering power and clarity. He saw, for example, what very few astronomers even suspected: that the Pole Star — which had been the key to navigation, and the poet’s traditional emblem of steadiness and singularity, for centuries — was not in fact one star at all, but two stars.”“Surrounded by infinite space, and swallowed up in an immensity of being, man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean, mixed and confounded with the general mass. But from this situation, perplexing as it is, he endeavours to extricate himself; and by looking abroad into Nature, employs the powers she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.”“An unfathomably larger universe was steadily opening up, and this gradually transformed popular notions of the size and mystery of the world ‘beyond the heavens’Indeed, the very terms ‘world’, ‘heaven’ and ‘universe’ began to changetheir meanings. It was the psychological breakthrough that Kant had predicted in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens back in 1755: ‘We may cherish the hope that new plane is being uncovered.”Poetry from Erasmus Darwin celebrating the astronomical discoveries of Herschel:When Love Divine, with brooding wings unfurl’d, Call’d from the rude abyss the living World, ‘Let there be Light!’, proclaimed the Almighty Lord, Astonish’d Chaos heard the potent word; Through all his realms the kindling ether runs And the mass starts into a million Suns. Earths round each Sun with quick explosions burst, And second Planets issue from the first; Bend as they journey with projectile force, In bright ellipses their reluctant course; Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll, And form, self-balanced, one revolving whole. – Onward they move, amid their bright abode, Space.David Bourgeois both published handbooks to the science of flight in 1784. Bourgeois opened ecstatically: ‘The idea of taking to the air, of flying through sky, and navigating through the ether, has always appealed so strongly to mankind, that it has appeared in numerous classical legends and folktales from the remotest antiquity. The wings of Saturn, the eagle of Jupiter, the peacocks of Juno, the doves of Venus, the winged horses of the Sun all bear witness …’ By the end of 1784, the second year of the great balloon craze, no fewer than 181 manned ascents had been recorded, mostly in France and England.Jeffries also gave the first truly vivid account of the changing appearance of the ground as seen ‘from a bird’s eye view, as it is called’. This too was constantly surprising. As they took off, there was the white sea of upturned faces in the city squares, swiftly reduced to tiny, unrecognisable points. There was the unearthly silence, the sense of their own motionlessness as the earth seemed to revolve below the basket. Though they did not appear to move, their compass needle steadily turned. Below them, the earth appeared transformed. There was the strange flattening out of hills and buildings, the emergence of previously unsuspected patterns in the foliage of woods, or the cultivation marks in fields, or the branching streets of a town. There was the constantly delusive appearance of clouds, and sudden showers of rain or even snowflakes. (No electrical charges were recorded, much to Jeffries’ relief.) The whole world became ‘like a beautifully coloured map or carpet’Wordsworth began his poem Peter Bell (1798) with a playful image of flying in a sort of dirigible airship, or balloon boat. There’s something in a flying Horse, There’s something in a huge Balloon: But through the Clouds I’ll never float Until I have a little Boat Shaped like the crescent-Moon … Away we go! — and what care we For treason, tumults, and for wars? We are as calm in our Delight As is the crescent-Moon so bright Among the scattered Stars.Perhaps Shelley put it best:‘The balloon has not yet received the perfection of which it is surely capable; the art of navigating the air is in its first and most helpless infancy; the aerial mariner still swims on bladders, and has not yet mounted the rude raft … It would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned. It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa? — Why do we not despatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction, and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon, which a vertical sun would project precisely underneath it, as it glided over that hitherto unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.’This method of viewing the galaxies (‘to continue the simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom’) presented the entire universe in a new kind of light, with the most radical implications. ‘The heavens are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions, in different flourishing beds … and we can extend the range of our experience [of them] to an immense duration.’Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that ‘deep space’ must also imply ‘deep time’. He wrote in his Preface: A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past … [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand — that is — almost two million years on their way.’ The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great dealof explanation to the layman.Keats likens his own discovery of Homer’s poetry to the experience of the great astronomer and the great explorer finding new worlds. … Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific — and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise – Silent upon a peak in Darien.Herschel also mentioned applying Newton’s theories for measuring the speed of solar light to ‘inconceivably distant bodies’ in the stellar system, with unimaginable results. ‘Then speaking of himself, he said with a modesty of manner that quite overcame me, when taken with the greatness of the assertion: “I have looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars of which the light, it can be proved, must have taken millions of years to reach the earth.”’Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably ‘ceased to exist’ millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. ‘The light did travel after the body was gone.’Banks was soon sponsoring small but highly adventurous expeditions into Egypt and the horn of Africa. Its motives at this stage were scientific and commercial, with no missionary or colonial intentions. Its primary aim was discovery, not conquest. This would change once Banks was appointed to the Privy Council in 1797, and became ever more closely involved in prosecuting the war against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then all exploration took on a more political and frankly imperial significance. Yet Africa and Australia always fascinated Banks for their own sake.Explorer Mungo Park: “At this moment, painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small moss in fructification, irresistibly caught my eye. I mention this to show from what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive consolation; for though the whole plant was not larger than the top of one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves, and capsula, without admiration.’ In that moment of pure scientific wonder, Park’s thoughts and outlook were transformed: ‘Can the Being (thought I) who planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed?”Shelley’s wilderness, while it includes ‘dark Aethiopia in her desert hills’, is geographically vague, though it moves more towards India and an imaginary East. But he catches something of Mungo Park’s enigmatic wanderlust, and transforms it into an unearthly Miltonic quest for the strange and magnificent limits of the known world: The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, And o’er the aerial mountains which pour down Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, In joy and exultation held his way; Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched His languid limbs.I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air …To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling … A mind that has once imbibed a taste for scientific enquiry has within itself an inexhaustible source of pure and exciting contemplations. One would think that Shakespeare had such a mind in view when he describes a contemplative man finding Tongues in trees — books in the running brooks Sermons in stones — and good in everything Where the uninformed and unenquiring eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he walks in the midst of wonders. It is intriguing that Herschel was quoting from Shakespeare’s As You Like .."
218,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This is a fascinating account of the growth of science in Romantic Age of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Holmes looks at the period through the lives of ground-breaking scientists, and illuminates the intersections between science, literature, and art during the period.Among the scientists discussed in detail are Joseph Banks, William and Caroline Herschel, Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday, and a collection of truly nutty but ground-breaking (or is that, and ground-breaking) balloonists.One of the most engaging aspects of science in this period is that it was all new enough that any smart, interested person with some (not necessarily large) resources could potentially make an important contribution. Joseph Banks was educated as a botanist, and made one of his greatest contributions with detailed and insightful anthropological observations of the Tahitians. William Herschel was trained as a musician, and his sister Caroline barely educated at all; they became prominent astronomers who made major contributions to the study of the heavens. Michael Faraday was a bookseller who was hired by Humphrey Davy as a lab assistant. Some of these men were born wealthy; some were not. None started out on the path where they made their greatest contributions.Joseph Banks accompanied James Cook on the first of his voyages to the south Pacific, as a naturalist, the same role in which Charles Darwin later sailed on the HMS Beagle. A major purpose of that voyage was to observe an eclipse of the sun that would be visible in Tahiti. While Banks did a great deal of botany while he was in Tahiti, he also made extensive and detailed observations of the Tahitians, differing from most of his fellow British by being open to--indeed, becoming deeply involved in, the Tahitian culture. Initially friendly relations with the Tahitians soured as Cook and others, unable or unwilling to let go of their own preconceptions, repeatedly offended them. After they left Tahiti, the voyage deteriorated further, with conflicts, epidemic illness, and death. The survivors, including Cook and Banks, arrived back in Britain devastated and took months to recover. Still a young man at this point, Banks was at the beginning of his career, and remained a major force in British science for decades to come--but less as a scientist himself, rather as the president of the Royal Society, guiding and encouraging the scientific careers of others.With Banks' story setting the framework, we see the Herschels start out as a musician and his singer/housekeeper sister and become two of the most important astronomers of the age, Davy beginning as a medical student and transforming into a chemist and engineer, and then into a mystical, visionary writer. We see the beginnings of true specialization in science, and the founding of the first subject-specialized science professional associations, separate from the Royal Society, which had, and still sought, to encompass them all. We see, also, the connections and interactions between the scientists and the writers and artists of the age, including Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats.It's a fascinating story, and I promise I have not even scratched the surface of it. Holmes seeks to reveal character as well as accomplishments, and show the ways in which the romantic sensibility, which we generally thing of as antithetical to science, in fact inspired and encouraged the Romantic Age scientists.Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from the local library."
219,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,4,"	“Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration…” As in Captain Cook’s first expedition, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage begun in 1831. “This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder,” Richard Holmes writes in his book of the same name, “and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”	Holmes hasn’t, he is positively giddy with delight over Joseph Banks discovering surfing in Tahiti. He falls head over heels in love with William Herschel’s sister Caroline, so essential to Hershel’s exploration of the heavens through a series of homemade telescopes, the only kind of telescope to be had at the time. The story of Humphrey Davy inventing the safety lamp that saved so many coal miners’ lives is so real he might have been an eyewitness, including all the times Davy blows up at Michael Faraday, not to mention all the times he blows up his lab. 	Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats were fascinated and inspired by these new scientific explorations and discoveries, and employed many of them as images in their work. There is a whole chapter on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, where Holmes traces the Monster’s beginnings to lectures given at the Royal Society in London, which Shelley attended and which included the attempt by one philosopher to use a primitive form of electricity to shock a corpse back to life. Eeew. 	Holmes writes of what may have been our most polymathic age in deft and witty prose. Of Herschel, an accomplished musician as well as an astronomer, he writes, “He moved from earthly music to the music of the spheres.” He writes demurely of the balloon ascension of a Mr. Biggin and a Mrs. Sage, which may or may not have given birth to the Mile High Club. He quotes a contemporary critic as saying, somewhat apologetically, “Poetical descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid principles of the Science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple unadorned language.” 	And then Holmes lets Keats underline the point,  …Then felt I like some watcher of the skies	When a new planet swims into his ken...	That watcher of the skies was Herschel. And the new planet? Uranus."
220,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027264-monika,5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. What strikes me most about Holmes is his ability to weave together what modern man has learned to compartmentalize- the sciences and the humanities. Before science was ""science,"" it was natural philosophy. Before scientists were ""scientists,"" they were natural philosophers and poets. Richard Holmes brings science and art back together in order to tell the story of how the late eighteenth century produced the foundation of what would become modern science. Framing the book with the story of Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who took part in Captain Cook's expedition to Tahiti later becoming the president of the Royal Society, Holmes moves to William Herschel, the musician and amateur astronomer who would discover Uranus with a telescope of his own making, and his sister, Caroline, who herself was responsible for discovering several comets. From the Herschel's the story moves to Mungo Parks and his travels to Africa and mapping of the Congo, followed by Sir Humphry Davy, who many believe is the founder of modern chemistry.What makes this book a wonder, however, is the pervasive spirit of inquiry of the age. Whereas now we seem to accept platitudes like ""I'm good at English, so I must not be good at math,"" this age embraced the idea that the only way to express the wonder of science is through poetry, literature, and the arts. Poets like Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley attended lectures from the great thinkers of the age, then expressed the same concerns about man's place in the world as the men who gave the lectures. What a time it must have been... human curiosity leading to unimaginable discoveries, discoveries that would forever alter the way we view our place in the universe... and such is the terror. To borrow from Carl Jung, this period marked the dawning of our self-awareness as a species in a universe that very quickly became immeasurably large and unimaginably old. Suddenly, we became ants in an ant farm instead of products of some intelligent design... Richard Holmes captures the complexities of the period in a most poetic way. I will be coming back to this book many times."
221,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779830-andrew,3,"I forgot about this book until I saw it again here. My father sent this book to me a few years ago. I enjoyed learning about the various people, scientists as well as non-scientists. I like that Holmes gives so much detail about, for instance, the grinding of the mirror for the telescope. And how it was paid for. For me, the book would be just as enjoyable if it was a collection of anecdotes and free of any speculation as to whether or how the literature and paintings of the time may or may not have influenced the scientists of that time. Holmes undertakes the great challenge of finding connections between Romantic notions and the scientific pursuits of those times. I really don't see how such connections can be made without knowing the biographies of the scientists well enough to know the extent of their interest in Romantic notions. That can be hard to know for anyone. I did enjoy learning that S.T. Coleridge was solicited to join a convention of people doing science, at least partly for the purpose of helping to choose a word to apply to the people who do science. As a result of this convention, the word scientist came into general use. It seemed to me that, of all the regard these scientists had for Romantic notions, Holmes related more about Humphry Davies' than any other. "
222,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/392337-sarah,5,"This is an amazing book. It doesn't have as much to do with literary Romanticism as I had originally hoped, but by the end of the first chapter I didn't care. Holmes is an excellent writer, and he makes the excitement and amazement of the scientists and explorers he profiles live. I think my favorite sections are the ones that deal with Joseph Banks, who went on a scientific voyage to Tahiti as a young man and, despite a successful career as a botanist in England, mentor to many younger scientists, and long-time president of the Royal Society, never seems to have found anything that moved him in the same way as Tahiti. To some extent, this book is a series of linked biographies: Banks, astronomer William Herschel and his sister Caroline, Sir Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday. Holmes is also very good at drawing out the political (whether national competition over who should be credited with discoveries or in-fighting over who should lead the various scientific societies) and philosophical (German Romantic writers and Coleridge make appearances here) implications of the scientific discoveries involved. It's not often a book is so informative, gripping, and well written all at once. "
223,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,4,"This was the first book assigned for my new semester, which means I'm going back to reading school stuff round the clock again, but luckily this first one was a great one. It's really a combined biography of Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Science, explorer of Tahiti), William Herschel (discovered Uranus), and Humphrey Davy (experimented with nitrous oxide, and also became President of Royal Society), along with a couple of other secondary stories. The best is probably the history behind Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, tracing it to the debates about the existence of a cosmic ""vitalist"" force, a debate that originated in the circle of German ""nature philosopher"" Frederich Schelling.The book was probably too long though, and plodded through parts of Herschel's and Davy's biographies (especially Davy's atrocious poetry), but it does do a great job showing how the worlds of Romantic literature and early modern science interacted. One takeaway, they all loved Coleridge."
224,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43247-emi-bevacqua,3,"This book is kind of the ultimate departure from my personal comfort zone: nearly 500 pages on the history of western science juxtaposed with poetry. Richard Holmes is an amazing researcher and writer, he really brings the age to life and I loved the beautiful color art inserts. The first section was very straightforward, about the young explorer Joseph Banks and his discoveries in Tahiti; in the next we meet a young astronomist that Banks discovered, named William Herschel and also his sister-assistant Caroline. Then with each chapter and introduction to subsequent scientists the reader is keeping track of more and more complexity, collegial scientists and poets, their discoveries and published work, their travels, and family relations! Throughout it all - anthropology, cosmology, flight, mesmerism, chemistry - the unifying thread is the history of the Royal Society of London scientists, led for the most part by Joseph Banks. My favorite quote is when somebody asks ""What's the use of a (hot air) balloon?"" and Benjamin Franklin responds, ""What's the use of a newborn baby?"" "
225,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,0,"There is obviously something wrong with me. Everyone raves about this book - so far I am finding it choppy, hard to read, all over the map and not particularly well-written. Holmes's penchant for including every detail of everything he ever read about his subjects is exhausting - a better writer would take the trouble to pare things down in the service of a more readable narrative. Part of my disappointment so far is that I didn't find Joseph Banks, the subject of the first 70 pages, a particularly engaging or interesting character. His major contribution to scientific progress appears to have been to bring back a bunch of specimens from Tahiti, a fundamentally pedestrian activity. Darwin's voyage on The Beagle was interesting because of how he subsequently synthesized his observations - Banks is a far duller character, no matter how many natives he slept with.Maybe things will pick up with Herschel and Davy."

We need to understand how science is actually made; how scientists themselves think and feel and speculate. We need to explore what makes scientists creative, as well as poets or painters, or musicians. That is how this book began. The old, rigid debates and boundaries -- science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics -- are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.
The Age of Wonder isn't quite the book I expected it to be: I was looking forward to a lot of science, which I find intriguing, but I found this work to be laden down with a lot of biographical information, which I find to be less so. The Romantic Period must have been an astonishing time to be alive, indeed an Age of Wonder; a time when any amateur, even a foreign musician like William Herschel, with enough curiosity and funds could literally point out new discoveries in the self-same night sky humans had been regarding for millennia. A privileged young man, like Joseph Banks, could buy himself passage on a voyage of discovery under Captain Cook and, in the process of collecting botanical specimens from Tahiti, invent the new field of Anthropology. Science, at the beginning of this period, was accessible and democratic: a barely educated young man, like Humphrey Davy, was able to wrest the study of the elements from the grip of the Alchemists and properly begin the discipline of Chemistry -- no longer searching for how to transmute the impossible, Davy (et al) did simple experiments to discover what does happen. Imagine a time when that was revolutionary thinking. Imagine if there were still basic discoveries to be made in nature; discoveries waiting to be plucked like low hanging fruit.I was delighted by the intersections between Science and Literature and Philosophy; how each informed the others; how so many of these early Scientists not only rubbed elbows with the likes of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Byron, but also expressed their own amazement in well-regarded verse. This also worked in reverse, with the great poets of the age attending scientific lectures in order to learn the terminology, the great metaphors of the day -- could this possibly be happening today?This book is exhaustive, and ultimately, I found that to be…exhausting. The following is more for my own memory than part of a proper review (and as I would probably advise anyone reading this review to just end here, I'm going to hide it all as a spoiler).(view spoiler)[I was charmed by Banks in Tahiti, and appreciated all of the primary source materials that were provided (the personal letters and journals and articles that filled in the big picture, that made the age come alive), but in some later sections these additions felt gossipy and a bit pointless. My favourite part from Tahiti: On their last day they discovered an enormous stone 'marai' or funeral monument, shaped like a pyramid, some forty-four feet high and nearly 300 feet wide, with steps of superbly polished white coral down both sides. This, the 'masterpiece' of Tahitian architecture on the island, was unsettling to Banks because its construction seemed technically inexplicable. 'It is beyond belief that Indians could raise so large a structure without the assistance of Iron tools to shape their stones or mortar to join them.'Not far away was another mystery: a huge wicker man constructed of basketwork, evidently for some obscure sacrificial rite. 'The whole was neatly covered with feathers, white to represent skin and black to represent hair and tattow.' I love stuff like that, and yes, I watch Ancient Aliens: not because I believe extraterrestrials built this curious 'marai', but because I revel in the mystery of these sorts of ancient structures and monuments and that show has a new one for me every week. Because of the noted intersections with literature, I was jotting down the books I was reminded of as I was reading. For this section, it was : Jamrach's Menagerie, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Unfamiliar Fishes (and how sad to note the evolution of Captain Cook from his empathetic treatment of the Tahitians to his brutality towards the Hawaiins), Parrot and Olivier in America, Moby Dick.I enjoyed the first section on William Herschel, but again, the biographical information was simply overwhelming -- I would have much preferred a general overview of his life in Hanover before emigrating to England and found no benefit at all in the biographies of his family members other than Caroline. When the book revisited the Herchels later -- more of the same and more of the same plus the details of his marriage and family -- I was seriously bored. I suppose the fact that his son, John, went on to become a leading figure in the Victorian Age of Science explains why we must follow William to the grave, but that wasn't what I wanted from this book (which I understand is a fault of my own, not the author). Since Caroline was profoundly affected by the Lisbon earthquake, I was put in mind of Candide and also of Frankenstein (not realising this book would be quoted at great length later).I was amused by the section on ballooning, and appreciate how at the time it must have seemed like the dawn of the Jetsons with their flying cars, but since in the end it was dismissed as a fad, more suited to carnivals than scientific study, I don't know that it belonged in this book. I did like this part: Benjamin Franklin, American Ambassador in Paris, watched the launch (of the first manned balloon flight) through a telescope from the window of his carriage. Afterwards he remarked: 'Someone asked me -- what's the use of a balloon? I replied - what's the use of a newborn baby?'Obvious choices, but I was reminded of Around the World in Eighty Days and The Wizard of Oz.Age of Wonder picked up (after another dull visit with the Herchels) when it told the thrilling story of Mongo Park and his two expeditions to find the source of the Niger in Africa. While the first trip was pure adventurism, the second smacked of imperialism, and it was probably due to his own self-important beliefs that he failed to pay due respect to the local tribes and was never seen again. Literary tie-ins: Heart of Darkness (for which Park was likely the inspiration for Kurtz), and because so much of this book takes place during the Napoleonic years and the war between France and Britain, A Tale of Two Cities.Humphrey Davy was a Poet and Chemist who experimented on himself with Nitrous Oxide, like a Timothy Leary for his time, without making the leap to its use in surgery. (A later section on the mastectomy that Fanny Burney endured without benefit of anesthetic made for a harrowing reading experience, but it was one more event that I wasn't certain belonged in what I thought this book was meant to be). Davy then made the leap to the study of Galvinism, and this sparked the great debates about Vitalism and ""is there an animating principle"" -- a soul? -- in humans, the great parlour discussion topic of the time, and that led to the first inklings of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This was interesting, but the very lengthy quoting from the book and its reception by the public and the stage play that came later -- all of this seemed beside the point to me. As was Davy's disintegrating marriage and political dealings with the Royal Academy of Science and his ""little nurse in Illyria"" -- so much biography, so little actual science. I did, however, appreciate when Davy put his mind to creating a safety-lamp for miners -- his great effort to demonstrate that science was for the benefit of mankind; theory that may be put into practise. The literary tie-ins at this point were all poetry: Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Prometheus Unbound.  (hide spoiler)]Okay, so after that long stretch of what was interesting and not so interesting to me, I return to Richard Holme's quote that I started with, the bit he actually ended with, and specifically:  Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. How many of us have this hope and wonder? I don't know that I believe the scientists of today are imbued with hope and wonder; that they are philosophical about their work; that they have the creative souls of artists. But perhaps I'm wrong and I thank Age of Wonder for forcing me to think of Science in this way.I wanted to love this book, but it was ultimately brought down by the immensity of the information it contained -- had it left out the society news and letters from home, I might have enjoyed it much more. "
227,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23672960-brian-willis,5,"Conventional wisdom places the scientific and rational achievements of the Age of Enlightenment in direct opposition to the fundamental values of the age of Romanticism in the arts. Poetry and art exuberantly shifted from an emphasis on cold rationality and collective achievement as well as logical procedures of the calculating mind towards exploration of the sentimentality of the human spirit, the individual within the natural world, and the subconscious. In other words, the movement was from the visible (or that which could be explained through rational observation) towards explaining the invisible (the interior subjective human self, the passions, the drives, and impulses that cannot be explained through science, at least in that era).Richard Holmes, perhaps the great living biographer of the Romantic era presents us with a multi-part biography of the scientists that influenced the Romantics, but instead of playing the party line of this dialectic, he demonstrates that the Romantic Era existed INFUSED with the spirit of exploration of the science of the age. Beginning with Sir Joseph Banks, he explains the foundation of the Royal Society. Then he divides a large part of the book following and documenting the life and achievements of Sir William Herschel and Sir Humphrey Davy. Herschel made his fame discovering Uranus, but Holmes argues effectively that his development of advanced telescopes as well as a method towards cataloguing the night sky were influential for future generations. One of the unsung heroes of the book is Caroline Herschel, his sister, who actually become the first patronized and influential female astronomer. Davy expanded our knowledge of natural gases and their containment, most effectively with his staggering safety lamp for miners. Other topics discussed are the passion for tales of the exploits of explorer Mungo Park and the origination of aerial flight through hot air ballooning. Holmes ties these achievements into the ongoing saga of the leading Romantics, particularly their encounters with Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley, and Keats (with Wordsworth gliding in the background and occasionally making an appearance). He points out moments in their compositions that reference the achievements of Banks, the Herschels, Davy, Park, Sadler, and many others. As the Romantics ascended, the reputation of science seems to have retroactively been placed into competition with the values of the age of Romanticism and later Victorianism. The Romantics grappled with the same issues that the scientists did however; the revelations of the cosmos and the sanctity of particles in observation of tiny objects were revealing the same troubling conclusions for both scientists and poets. If there are uncountable galaxies, is it ludicrous to think that Christ was crucified millions of times to redeem the universe? Surprisingly, this hint at atheism backfired on scientists and their reputation for years to come while Romantics with their celebration of pagan values and occasionally an atheist or two, somehow escaped the judgement of posterity though facing criticism in their time. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, inspired by the electrical current experimentation of Galvani, was interpreted as a condemnation of the limits of science (though that was not Shelley's intent).In the end, Holmes writes an incredibly enlightening and informative group biography, argues for the art of biography as a window into the discovery process of science, and demonstrates that these scientists not only created the profession of scientist but also the groundwork for the scientific method, as eventually perfected by Charles Darwin (who also makes an appearance). Another triumph from one of my favorite writers."
228,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16010931-douglass-gaking,5,"The Age of Wonder is a solid history of British scientists in the Romantic era. It focuses on the individual scientists' lives, their experiments, their writings–both personal and published–and their connections to each other.Scientists in focus include Joseph Banks, William Herschel, Michael Faraday, and even the fictional Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Each chapter is as in-depth as a biography.I especially like the chapter on William Herschel. I had not realized how close he came to our current understanding of the construction of the universe, despite being formally trained as a musician, and self-taught as a scientist.My main takeaway from this book is how imaginative these scientists were. Whether it is believing in the chemical nature of the soul or the existence of life on the moon, they had wild theories that certainly fit in with the sentiment of the Romantic era. While so many of these hypothesis proved to be false, whether in their lifetimes or later, it is the pursuit of proving them through experimentation that advanced human knowledge into the modern age."

It focuses on four individuals, Joseph Banks, (explorer and driving force behind the Royal Society for many years) Caroline and William Herschel (sister and brother astronomers) and Humphry Davy (chemist). Two things stand out from the rest for me. First, the author discussed women's roles in science and the role of Caroline Herschel in particular. She was the first woman awarded a stipend by the King for her astronomical work (albeit at half the rate a man would have received). Second, I was surprised by the strong overlap of science and poetry. Many of the scientists were published poets, including Herschel and Davy and many of the poets were also active in the sciences (Coleridge and Wordsworth among others).At almost 500 pages the book dragged in a few places, particularly when the author was describing societal trends rather than giving biographies of the various scientists and poets. But, all in all, well worth the time it took to read it."

It makes me wish I lived in the Victorian ages just so I could go here these talks on nascent principles and ideas, no matter how off they were in the long run. In my Victorian fantasies I’m super rich and, apparently, male. But just reading about these explorers, these astronomers, these scientists developing these wonderful inventions and ideas that went on to better the world … it’s heady stuff. At times the book is a bit dry, but for the most part the subject matter is so rich you get entirely wrapped up in it."

It's enlightening to understand their motivation for their actions. The author was also very interested in literary pursuits of the scientists, analyzing and interpreting their poetry. I liked that philosophical men of science felt encouraged to write their own poetry. I don't believe that is the case very often nowadays.This was such a dense read. It took me a long time to get through it, not because it was poorly written or boring, but because there was so much information to absorb on each page. And each page was equally as interesting as it was dense.""To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling ... a soap bubble ... an apple ... a pebble ... He walks in the midst of wonders."" - John Herschel, A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1830). pg. xiii""But while Cook clung to the necessity of European forms and discipline, Banks was rather inclined to dwell on the superfluity of European needs. These were perhaps the reflections of a man who had always been used to wealth and comforts. 'From them appear how small are the real wants of human nature, which we Europeans have increasd to an excess which would certainly appear incredible to these people could they be told it. Nor shall we cease to increase them as long as Luxuries can be invented and riches found for the purchase of them; and how soon these Luxuries degenerate into necessaries may be sufficiently evincd by the universal use of strong liquors, Tobacco, spices, Tea &c. &c.'"" pg. 39""Riding between musical engagements, from one remote provincial northern town to another, often crossing over the moors alone at night, he found himself studying the panoply of stars overhead as he had done as a boy.

Once, when d'Arlandes was desperately shouting at him, 'We must go down! We must go down!,' Pilatre called back soothingly: 'Look d'Arlandes. Here we are above Paris. There's no possible danger for you. Are you taking this all in?' Many witnesses later said that they could hear the two men shouting excitedly to each other as they passed overhead. They assumed they were describing the glories of flight."" pg. 130""It was a glorious pink-and-yellow, candy-coloured balloon, thirty feet tall, and the crowd loved it. The wickerwork basket, a sort of chaise longue for two, was completely festooned with flags and bunting. Dr Charles had a full payload of scientific equipment aboard--mercury barometer (which was used as an early form of altimeter), thermometer, telescope, sand bags and several bottles of champagne."" pg. 131""Surprisingly, balloons did not appeal to the gothic novelist Horace Walpole, though perhaps at sixty-six he was a little old for such perilous novelties. He thought balloons might be sinister: 'Well! I hope these new mechanic meteors will prove only playthings for the learned and idle, and not be converted into new engines of destruction to the human race--as is so often the case of refinements or discoveries in Science. The wicked wit of man always studies to apply the results of talents to enslaving, destroying, or cheating his fellow creatures. Could we reach the moon, we should think of reducing it to a province of some European kingdom.' It was an ominous prophecy."" pg. 135To note: What we Americans call the Revolutionary War, the British call the American War of Independence. pg. 147""Ballooning added to this new awareness of the complexity and subtlety of clouds, a growing Romantic preoccupation which can be followed in the paintings of Turner and Constable, the notebooks of Coleridge and the poetry of Shelley. When Shelley refers to 'the locks of the approaching storm' in his 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819), he is using Howard's definition cirrus. 'The Cloud' (1820) demonstrates a remarkably accurate and scientific understanding of cloud formation and the convection cycle. Goethe wrote a number of essays on clouds, atmospheric pressures and weather, and translated passages of Howard, asking him to compose and send his Autobiography to Germany, and describing him as 'the first to define conceptually the airy and ever-changing forms of clouds, thus delimiting and fixing what had always been ephemeral and intangible, by accurate observation and naming.'"" pg. 160""Clouds became fascinating both as scientific phenomena--the generators of electricity, the mysterious indicators of winds and changing air pressure--and as aesthetic phenomena: the 'moods' of the sky reflecting those of the observer, alterations of light over landscape, symbols of change, destruction, regeneration. It could be argued that the Romantics actually invented the idea of 'the weather' itself, as it now preoccupies us; as well, of course, as 'inner weather.'"" pg. 160""Ballooning produced a new, and wholly unexpected, vision of the earth. It had been imagined that it would reveal the secrets of the heavens above, but in fact it showed the secrets of the world beneath. The early aeronauts suddenly saw the earth as a giant organism, mysteriously patterned and unfolding, like a living creature. For the first time the impact of man on nature was clearly revealed: the ever-expanding relationship of towns to countryside, roads to rivers, cultivated fields to forests, and the development of industry. It was comparable to the first views of the earth from space by the Apollo astronauts in the 1960s, producing a new concept of a 'single blue planet' with its delicate membrane of atmosphere. The famous photograph 'Earthrise' was taken from lunar orbit in December 1968."" pg. 161""As he grew older, Herschel was becoming a remoter figure in the household. His mind was ranging through the universe. His later papers for the Royal Society had begun to show an increasing awareness of the philosophical significance of astronomy. This was something urged upon him by his old supporter William Watson, who looked forward to conversations 'on Kant's metaphysics,' and wished to know how far Herschel agreed with the 'ground and sources' of Kant's philosophy of knowledge."" pg. 203""Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that 'deep space' must also imply 'deep time.' He wrote in his Preface: 'A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past ... [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand--that is--almost two million years on their way.' The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great deal of explanation to the layman."" pg. 203""Herschel continued to reach carefully towards the idea of an evolving universe, a concept as radical in its eventual implications as Erasmus Darwin's notion of evolution within plants and animals. In a late paper published in 1811, 'Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens,' Herschel further developed the idea . . . that all nebulae and large star clusters were at particular points in their sidereal life-cycles, which could be visually identified and catalogued almost in a Linnaean manner. Their characteristic shapes suggested distinct moments of youth, maturing and ageing."" pg. 204""It presented the universe as a living, growing, organic entity, with all nebulae belonging to one enormous extended family: 'There is not so much difference between them, if I may use the comparison, as there would be in an annual description of the human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a man in his prime.' This comparison is an intriguing premonition of 'time-lapse' photography, now one of the most powerful illustrative tools of modern natural history."" pg. 204-205""Physical vision--one might say scientific vision--brings about a metaphysical shift in the observer's view of reality as a whole. The geography of the earth, or the structure of the solar system, are in an instant utterly changed, and forever. The explorer, the scientific observer, the literary reader, experience the Sublime: a moment of revelation into the idea of the unbounded, the infinite."" pg. 207""At all events, it was clear that the Milky Way 'cannot last forever'; and equally that 'its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.' It followed that neither the earth, nor even the solar system, was a separate creation, but merely an infinitesimal part of a galactic evolution. Our galaxy had a physical beginning, and would have a physical conclusion. Our solar system, our planet, and hence our whole civilisation would have an ultimate and unavoidable end."" pg. 209""Campbell recalled that he felt he had been 'conversing with a supernatural intelligence.' Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably 'ceased to exist' millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. 'The light did travel after the body was gone.' After leaving Herschel, Campbell walked onto the shingle of Brighton beach, gazing out to sea, feeling 'evelvated and overcome.' He was reminded of Newton's observation that he was just a child picking up shells on the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay all before him."" pg. 210""It is evident that the death of his father, and all the subsequent emotional upheavals, profoundly shook the sixteen-year-old Davy, and started an intellectual ferment that never left him. Besides writing poetry, he also started his first diary, set himself reading lists and work timetables, and began a series of essays on religion versus materialism. During 1796 he wrote an essay 'On Mathematics,' and another 'On Consciousness,' which gleefully explored the implications of materialism. He described the body as 'a fine tuned Machine,' and wrote a syllogistic proof that the 'soul' could not exist, since it was said to be eternal and 'unchangeable,' while every known part of the human body, including the brain, was temporary and changed perpetually. 'QED the soul does not exist.'"" pg. 243""One of Burney's many extraordinary reflections was whether extreme physical pain could not only induce unconsciousness--'I have two total chasms in my memory of this transaction'--but actually force the soul out of the body. She also found that the act of recollection carried its own pain, and that she had taken three months to complete the account, as a letter of nearly 10,000 words to her sister Esther. She had severe headaches every time she tried to go on with it. Once finished, she could not look back over what she had written. 'I dare not revise, nor read, the recollection is still so painful.' It is an astonishing record of courage, not least in Fanny's determination to protect her husband from the trauma of the operation. But it also recalls what the real conditions of surgery were at this period."" pg. 306""But speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical ideas of Friedrich Schelling and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine, perhaps best translated as 'science mysticism,' defined the entire natural world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity as a series of 'polarities.' According to Schelling's doctrine, the whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical objects 'aspired' to become something higher. There was a 'world-soul' constantly 'evolving' higher life forms and 'levels of consciousness' in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards a higher state."" pg. 315""Davy's notebooks for this period also suggest a new pattern of philosophical speculation, almost approaching German Naturphilosophie. Some of his observations would have been recognised by Coleridge: 'The aspirations for immortality are movements of the mind similar to those which a bird makes with its wings before they are furnished with feathers.' Others were more closely tied to his laboratory work. On the subject of scientific 'analogy,' for instance, he wondered if there was a wider principle at work. 'Probably there is an analogy in all existence: the divided tail of the fish is linked in a long succession of like objects with the biped man. In the planetary system it is probable man will be found connected with a higher intellectual nature; and it is possible that the monad, or soul, is constantly undergoing a series of progressions.'"" pg. 357""In November 1827 Davy returned briefly to London to resign his presidency of the Royal Society. He later gave a moving glimpse of his disillusion with his own scientific career on this sad return: 'In my youth, and through the prime of manhood, I never entered London without feelings of pleasure and hope. It was to me as the grand theatre of intellectual activity, the field of every species of enterprise and exertion, the metropolis of the world of business, thought, and action ... I now entered the great city in a very different tone of mind, one of settled melancholy ... My health was gone, my ambition was satisfied, I was no longer excited by the desire of distinction; what I regarded most tenderly [my mother], was in the grave ... My cup of life was no longer sparkling, sweet, and effervescent ... it has become bitter.' In a wonderfully sardonic aside, Davy added that this metaphor of the 'cup of life' was scientifically derived from the chemical fermentation of 'the juice of the grape,' and then after a certain lapse of time, its oxidisation and acidification."" pg. 419""Babbage perhaps intended a sort of parable of science for the new generation. His story went as follows. When Babbage first peered carefully at the shimmering solar image projected through Herschel's prism, he could not see these dark Fraunhofer lines, though he knew they were there. Herschel then commented to him: 'An object is frequently not seen, from not knowing how to see it, rather than from any deficit in the organ of vision ... I will instruct you how to see them.' After some time spent re-examining and refocusing the image, Babbage could see them perfectly. The point was that science must always be more than the simple observation of phenomena or data. It was simultaneously a subjective training in observation skills, self-criticism and interpretation: a complete education. This was of course precisely what William Herschel had said forty years before, about learning to see with a telescope."" pg. 440Book: borrowed from the SSF Main Library."

His deft handling the scientific discoveries that made these men and women - the Herschels (William, Caroline, and John), Joseph Banks, Michael Farady, Humphry Davy, et al - so important is admirable, of course, but more impressive is his ability to marshal an enormous amount of research into a coherent, pleasurable narrative.

244,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,5,"In writing this review, I am keeping in mind that an old and very dear friend of mine (who has read and liked this book) is highly interested in my evaluation. I mention this because it leads to an important point about the book: the background of the reader will strongly determine what he or she gets out of reading The Age of Wonder. For my part, I approach this work as a sociologist who is currently (fall 2013) preparing to take a doctoral exam in the sociology of science. Hence, I already have some grounding in this field and I will use this book as deep background for my own work in science and technology studies.To extract the maximum value from this work, the reader will need some knowledge of Romanticism and the history and philosophy of science – in particular the “two cultures” debate deriving from C.P. Snow’s famous work of that name. This is not to say that this book is entirely useless to the reader lacking such a background, but it will be more difficult for the reader to grasp the overall argument, as Holmes does not provide such contextualization. However, his skills as a biographer are so good that the reader can derive enormous value simply reading the book as a set of biographical vignettes and it would not be a waste of time.  However, the core of Holmes’ work involves an extended critique of the notion that art and science are invariably at odds. Holmes’ objective is to show that this tension is largely a product of Late Romanticism (early 19th Century) and in sociological terms is very much a cultural and political “project”. Indeed, Holmes provides compelling evidence not only that science and art are not inherently adversarial but that in Early Romanticism the two were deeply interconnected and (Holmes argues) drew strength from each other. Hence the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) was not only a Romantic author but worked with Humphry Davy (the chemist) and conducted experiments with prisms in Germany. Davy for his part wrote both early science fiction as well as poetry. And these are but two examples that Holmes provides. He builds a picture of how through Romantic philosophy both science and art were unified by the feature intrinsic to both: creative thought. In this way, Romantic science can be distinguished from the more purely rationalistic viewpoint of the Early Enlightenment (in the works of Descartes, Spinoza, and Hobbes for example). Spinoza forms a case in point (I get this from Steven Nadler’s study of Spinoza in A Book Forged in Hell). Spinoza asserted that there was no role for imagination in rational society (including science) and that knowledge was based on the accumulation of facts. However, scientists of the Romantic Age (and after, such as Richard Feynman) dismissed the adequacy of simply collecting facts. Scientific understanding required conceptual breakthroughs, and this was only available via creative thought and imagination. (The cultural meme of the creative scientific breakthrough – Archimedes’ “Eureka!” moment – remains strong in present day public understanding of science. Witness how nonscientists regard Einstein or Stephen Hawking.)All of this is a long way from the divided and acrimonious relation between art and science described by C.P. Snow in his landmark “The Two Cultures”. Holmes locates the inflection point at the “Immortal Dinner” held in December 1817 by the fundamentalist Christian painter Benjamin Haydon (see pages 318-321). Attending this event were the poets William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, and John Keats. However, Holmes notes that this dinner did not include Coleridge, Byron, or Shelley – persons whom Holmes asserts would have had no patience for either Haydon’s rhetorical aims or the acrimony towards science espoused by their fellow poets. In the long run, however, the constructed antipathy between art and science put forward at the “Immortal Dinner” have become part of the dogma about science and art.Holmes’ central objective in Age of Wonder, then, is to usefully refute the “Two Cultures” hypothesis and to provide biographical evidence of its inadequacy both past and present as well as to partly rehabilitate the role of Romantic art and sensibility in furthering the Scientific Revolution – a viewpoint joined by Lisa Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution) and others, including, interestingly, the arch-atheist Richard Dawkins. Within the limits of my knowledge, I feel that Holmes has successfully provided a rich source of materials for his case as well as vivid biographical portraits of the personalities involved in this second stage of the English Scientific Revolution – with Lisa Jardine having provided a very useful synopsis of the first stage of the English Scientific Revolution.However, Holmes does not provide a good overall contextualization of the issues at stake, making it difficult for those without existing specialist knowledge to either understand or to evaluate his thesis. This contextualization would not have to be large – a short chapter at the beginning of the book, or rather a reworking of his introduction – would suffice to ease general readers into the debate on “two cultures” (he never actually deals with C.P. Snow’s thesis in depth here – a significant omission. Another issue is that this work is almost entirely Anglo-centric, with some mention of Antoine Lavoisier, Alexandre Charles, the Mongolfiers, and other French and German scientists. This Anglo-centrism is merited to a degree because of the key role played by Britain in the early Industrial and Scientific Revolutions. But at the same time, the reader can wonder how well Holmes’ interpretation of Romantic science translates to the broader European context. So, in closing, while this is a great book, it is not a standalone work. To extract full value from it, I would recommend looking at the back of the book, where Holmes provides a highly welcome background reading list. For anyone interested in modern political and intellectual history, some knowledge of Romanticism is a must and well worth acquiring. By the same token, some knowledge of either the sociology of science or the history and philosophy of science (these can be somewhat adversarial fields) will provide context for why it is important to understand how scientists actually practice their craft as well as the greater social context in which science takes place (see for instance Bruno Latour, Laboratory Life.) So, while I would recommend this book for anyone interested in science and early modern history, it is a book that provides greater rewards for external study than most. "
245,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"This book took me an unusually long time to finish, which at first I was inclined to blame on my own deficiencies. But by the time I finished the book, I was otherwise inclined. Quite simply, this book seemed to strive mightily to connect the major Romantic poets to some major Romantic-era scientists, but ultimately the author’s thesis fell flat for me. Granted, I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book, which focused on Joseph Banks’ voyages to Tahiti, the brother and sister astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, the African odyssey of Mungo Park, and the escapades of daredevil balloonists. Holmes does an admirable job of writing juicy mini-biographies of these and other personages, but, dazzled as I was by his eye for detail and ability to enable the reader to peer beneath his subjects’ skin, early on I found myself a bit baffled at why these disparate people were sharing space in the same volume. Then, in subsequent chapters, particularly those devoted to chemist/poet Humphrey Davy, I hit a wall. Davy, to me, was not nearly as engaging a person, despite his obvious brilliance and importance, but more to the point, at this point in the book the author begins to strain very hard to bring in connections to the Romantic poets. Davy was friends with Coleridge and wrote a great deal of (alas, not very good) poetry himself. Holmes quotes reams of Davy’s poetry (which I immediately learned to skim), as well as poetry by Coleridge, Keats, Byron and Shelley. And it was at this point that I sincerely wished that the author were NOT a specialist and biographer of the Romantic poets, for he strained so often and so hard to work in any poetic reference, however tangential, to science that I became quite impatient. His thesis.... well, I’m not entirely sure what it was, to be honest. (And hence my initial impulse to feel it was my fault as a reader, for surely there is a thesis?) Something about how the divisions between science and poetry/philosophy are artificial and that, indeed, we should endeavor to unite the two fields, which are both grounded in wonder.  But, gee, that’s an awfully broad net to cast, don’t you think? I’m afraid the result was a great deal of bycatch. Then, too, during the second half of the book, the discussion of Davy et al. becomes quite bogged down in the discussion of Davy’s various relationships (romantic and otherwise), the political wranglings of the Royal Society, and the rise or fall of various scientists’ reputations. The narrative became dense and hard to follow. However, I persisted to the end of the book, feeling that, surely, the author would tie all these disparate strands together for me in some cohesive way.No such luck. "
246,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn,4,"Interest and Science TogetherThis book is meant to emphasize that research and art go together and are inseparable. Holmes discusses how leisure time gave way to thought,involvement and art caused the scientific revolution a a is could not exist without the other. He uses examples from all over Europe and pulls stories out quite well. "
247,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"“Science is truly a relay race, with each discovery handed on to the next generation. Even as one door is closing, another door is already being thrown open. So it is with this book. For this, I believe science needs to be presented and explored in a new way. We need not only a new history of science, but a more enlarged and imaginative biographical writing about individual scientists. The old, rigid debates and boundaries — science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics — are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.”I am abashed at how much of this book I did not know, and am grateful that I do now. Slightly dry and scattered, it was hard to get through, not full of wonder but details, but worth the time. I wish there was a timeline, as the narrative moves all over the place, ostensibly chronologically but confusingly.The revolution of the time was an explosion of astronomy, chemistry, geology, exploration of the world, and changes in society “to the point that the greatest astronomer of the age would turn out to be an immigrant German musician (William Herschel and his sister!), the greatest chemist was the son of a Welsh ne’er-do-well (Humphry Davy), and a whole new branch of study—electromagnetism—would be founded by the son of a blacksmith (Michael Faraday). All these figures appear as characters in Holmes’ fascinating work, along with poets, novelists, explorers, aristocrats and even balloonists.” The scientist was also philosopher, and the lines were blurred. The author includes poetry that was inspired by the science, by Coleridge, Byron, Keats, and Shelley, and that adds a layer to the Ancient Mariner and other famous poems of the time that might be my favorite part of the book. I am reading The Second Mountain by David Brooks, and he writes of times in history when the moral ecology was changing, and Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael would say when Mother Culture gets more strident, and the frog in the boiling water doesn’t feel the heat yet. I can see the arc of time in this age of wonder, and how scientists of the time had an intense drive to be an individual, to achieve grand and stupendous things (telescopes to discover Uranus, mapping Africa, discovering potassium, etc) with recklessness and fearlessness. “Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration. These were Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world expedition aboard the Endeavour, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage to the Galapagos islands aboard the Beagle, begun in 1831. This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder, and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”I had always revered the Enlightenment Age so may have glossed over anything called Romantic, hence the ignorance. The author focuses on three Romantic themes: ballooning, global exploration and soul hunting along with the science. The author writes that far back in antiquity, “Plato argued that the notion of ‘wonder’ was central to all philosophical thought: ‘In Wonder all Philosophy began: in Wonder it ends…But the first Wonder is the Offspring of Ignorance; the last is the Parent of Adoration.’” This was quite lost during the rational Enlightenment and the Romantic poets put the wonder back into the science, and drew the lay people in to experience it. Can you imagine scads of modern poetry written about Carl Sagan or Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Like Wordsworth:Romantic traveller amidst the stars: And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The Antechapel where the Statue stood Of Newton, with his prism and his silent face, The marble index of a Mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.Wordsworth again:My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky; So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man...Epigraphs:He thought about himself, and the whole Earth, Of Man the wonderful, and of the Stars, And how the deuce they ever could have birth; And then he thought of Earthquakes, and of Wars, How many miles the Moon might have in girth, Of Air-balloons, and of the many bars To perfect Knowledge of the boundless Skies; And then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes. BYRON, Don Juan (1819)Those to whom the harmonious doors Of Science have unbarred celestial stores … WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ‘Lines Additional to an Evening Walk’ (1794)Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific … JOHN KEATS, ms of sonnet (1816)“Their minutely recorded telescope observations, published in over a hundred papers by the Royal Society, would change not only the public conception of the solar system, but of the whole Milky Way galaxy and the structure and meaning of the universe itself. It was immediately apparent that Herschel had created an instrument of unparalleled light-gathering power and clarity. He saw, for example, what very few astronomers even suspected: that the Pole Star — which had been the key to navigation, and the poet’s traditional emblem of steadiness and singularity, for centuries — was not in fact one star at all, but two stars.”“Surrounded by infinite space, and swallowed up in an immensity of being, man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean, mixed and confounded with the general mass. But from this situation, perplexing as it is, he endeavours to extricate himself; and by looking abroad into Nature, employs the powers she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.”“An unfathomably larger universe was steadily opening up, and this gradually transformed popular notions of the size and mystery of the world ‘beyond the heavens’Indeed, the very terms ‘world’, ‘heaven’ and ‘universe’ began to changetheir meanings. It was the psychological breakthrough that Kant had predicted in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens back in 1755: ‘We may cherish the hope that new plane is being uncovered.”Poetry from Erasmus Darwin celebrating the astronomical discoveries of Herschel:When Love Divine, with brooding wings unfurl’d, Call’d from the rude abyss the living World, ‘Let there be Light!’, proclaimed the Almighty Lord, Astonish’d Chaos heard the potent word; Through all his realms the kindling ether runs And the mass starts into a million Suns. Earths round each Sun with quick explosions burst, And second Planets issue from the first; Bend as they journey with projectile force, In bright ellipses their reluctant course; Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll, And form, self-balanced, one revolving whole. – Onward they move, amid their bright abode, Space.David Bourgeois both published handbooks to the science of flight in 1784. Bourgeois opened ecstatically: ‘The idea of taking to the air, of flying through sky, and navigating through the ether, has always appealed so strongly to mankind, that it has appeared in numerous classical legends and folktales from the remotest antiquity. The wings of Saturn, the eagle of Jupiter, the peacocks of Juno, the doves of Venus, the winged horses of the Sun all bear witness …’ By the end of 1784, the second year of the great balloon craze, no fewer than 181 manned ascents had been recorded, mostly in France and England.Jeffries also gave the first truly vivid account of the changing appearance of the ground as seen ‘from a bird’s eye view, as it is called’. This too was constantly surprising. As they took off, there was the white sea of upturned faces in the city squares, swiftly reduced to tiny, unrecognisable points. There was the unearthly silence, the sense of their own motionlessness as the earth seemed to revolve below the basket. Though they did not appear to move, their compass needle steadily turned. Below them, the earth appeared transformed. There was the strange flattening out of hills and buildings, the emergence of previously unsuspected patterns in the foliage of woods, or the cultivation marks in fields, or the branching streets of a town. There was the constantly delusive appearance of clouds, and sudden showers of rain or even snowflakes. (No electrical charges were recorded, much to Jeffries’ relief.) The whole world became ‘like a beautifully coloured map or carpet’Wordsworth began his poem Peter Bell (1798) with a playful image of flying in a sort of dirigible airship, or balloon boat. There’s something in a flying Horse, There’s something in a huge Balloon: But through the Clouds I’ll never float Until I have a little Boat Shaped like the crescent-Moon … Away we go! — and what care we For treason, tumults, and for wars? We are as calm in our Delight As is the crescent-Moon so bright Among the scattered Stars.Perhaps Shelley put it best:‘The balloon has not yet received the perfection of which it is surely capable; the art of navigating the air is in its first and most helpless infancy; the aerial mariner still swims on bladders, and has not yet mounted the rude raft … It would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned. It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa? — Why do we not despatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction, and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon, which a vertical sun would project precisely underneath it, as it glided over that hitherto unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.’This method of viewing the galaxies (‘to continue the simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom’) presented the entire universe in a new kind of light, with the most radical implications. ‘The heavens are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions, in different flourishing beds … and we can extend the range of our experience [of them] to an immense duration.’Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that ‘deep space’ must also imply ‘deep time’. He wrote in his Preface: A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past … [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand — that is — almost two million years on their way.’ The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great dealof explanation to the layman.Keats likens his own discovery of Homer’s poetry to the experience of the great astronomer and the great explorer finding new worlds. … Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific — and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise – Silent upon a peak in Darien.Herschel also mentioned applying Newton’s theories for measuring the speed of solar light to ‘inconceivably distant bodies’ in the stellar system, with unimaginable results. ‘Then speaking of himself, he said with a modesty of manner that quite overcame me, when taken with the greatness of the assertion: “I have looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars of which the light, it can be proved, must have taken millions of years to reach the earth.”’Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably ‘ceased to exist’ millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. ‘The light did travel after the body was gone.’Banks was soon sponsoring small but highly adventurous expeditions into Egypt and the horn of Africa. Its motives at this stage were scientific and commercial, with no missionary or colonial intentions. Its primary aim was discovery, not conquest. This would change once Banks was appointed to the Privy Council in 1797, and became ever more closely involved in prosecuting the war against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then all exploration took on a more political and frankly imperial significance. Yet Africa and Australia always fascinated Banks for their own sake.Explorer Mungo Park: “At this moment, painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small moss in fructification, irresistibly caught my eye. I mention this to show from what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive consolation; for though the whole plant was not larger than the top of one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves, and capsula, without admiration.’ In that moment of pure scientific wonder, Park’s thoughts and outlook were transformed: ‘Can the Being (thought I) who planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed?”Shelley’s wilderness, while it includes ‘dark Aethiopia in her desert hills’, is geographically vague, though it moves more towards India and an imaginary East. But he catches something of Mungo Park’s enigmatic wanderlust, and transforms it into an unearthly Miltonic quest for the strange and magnificent limits of the known world: The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, And o’er the aerial mountains which pour down Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, In joy and exultation held his way; Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched His languid limbs.I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air …To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling … A mind that has once imbibed a taste for scientific enquiry has within itself an inexhaustible source of pure and exciting contemplations. One would think that Shakespeare had such a mind in view when he describes a contemplative man finding Tongues in trees — books in the running brooks Sermons in stones — and good in everything Where the uninformed and unenquiring eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he walks in the midst of wonders. It is intriguing that Herschel was quoting from Shakespeare’s As You Like .."
248,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This is a fascinating account of the growth of science in Romantic Age of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Holmes looks at the period through the lives of ground-breaking scientists, and illuminates the intersections between science, literature, and art during the period.Among the scientists discussed in detail are Joseph Banks, William and Caroline Herschel, Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday, and a collection of truly nutty but ground-breaking (or is that, and ground-breaking) balloonists.One of the most engaging aspects of science in this period is that it was all new enough that any smart, interested person with some (not necessarily large) resources could potentially make an important contribution. Joseph Banks was educated as a botanist, and made one of his greatest contributions with detailed and insightful anthropological observations of the Tahitians. William Herschel was trained as a musician, and his sister Caroline barely educated at all; they became prominent astronomers who made major contributions to the study of the heavens. Michael Faraday was a bookseller who was hired by Humphrey Davy as a lab assistant. Some of these men were born wealthy; some were not. None started out on the path where they made their greatest contributions.Joseph Banks accompanied James Cook on the first of his voyages to the south Pacific, as a naturalist, the same role in which Charles Darwin later sailed on the HMS Beagle. A major purpose of that voyage was to observe an eclipse of the sun that would be visible in Tahiti. While Banks did a great deal of botany while he was in Tahiti, he also made extensive and detailed observations of the Tahitians, differing from most of his fellow British by being open to--indeed, becoming deeply involved in, the Tahitian culture. Initially friendly relations with the Tahitians soured as Cook and others, unable or unwilling to let go of their own preconceptions, repeatedly offended them. After they left Tahiti, the voyage deteriorated further, with conflicts, epidemic illness, and death. The survivors, including Cook and Banks, arrived back in Britain devastated and took months to recover. Still a young man at this point, Banks was at the beginning of his career, and remained a major force in British science for decades to come--but less as a scientist himself, rather as the president of the Royal Society, guiding and encouraging the scientific careers of others.With Banks' story setting the framework, we see the Herschels start out as a musician and his singer/housekeeper sister and become two of the most important astronomers of the age, Davy beginning as a medical student and transforming into a chemist and engineer, and then into a mystical, visionary writer. We see the beginnings of true specialization in science, and the founding of the first subject-specialized science professional associations, separate from the Royal Society, which had, and still sought, to encompass them all. We see, also, the connections and interactions between the scientists and the writers and artists of the age, including Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats.It's a fascinating story, and I promise I have not even scratched the surface of it. Holmes seeks to reveal character as well as accomplishments, and show the ways in which the romantic sensibility, which we generally thing of as antithetical to science, in fact inspired and encouraged the Romantic Age scientists.Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from the local library."
249,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,4,"	“Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration…” As in Captain Cook’s first expedition, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage begun in 1831. “This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder,” Richard Holmes writes in his book of the same name, “and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”	Holmes hasn’t, he is positively giddy with delight over Joseph Banks discovering surfing in Tahiti. He falls head over heels in love with William Herschel’s sister Caroline, so essential to Hershel’s exploration of the heavens through a series of homemade telescopes, the only kind of telescope to be had at the time. The story of Humphrey Davy inventing the safety lamp that saved so many coal miners’ lives is so real he might have been an eyewitness, including all the times Davy blows up at Michael Faraday, not to mention all the times he blows up his lab. 	Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats were fascinated and inspired by these new scientific explorations and discoveries, and employed many of them as images in their work. There is a whole chapter on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, where Holmes traces the Monster’s beginnings to lectures given at the Royal Society in London, which Shelley attended and which included the attempt by one philosopher to use a primitive form of electricity to shock a corpse back to life. Eeew. 	Holmes writes of what may have been our most polymathic age in deft and witty prose. Of Herschel, an accomplished musician as well as an astronomer, he writes, “He moved from earthly music to the music of the spheres.” He writes demurely of the balloon ascension of a Mr. Biggin and a Mrs. Sage, which may or may not have given birth to the Mile High Club. He quotes a contemporary critic as saying, somewhat apologetically, “Poetical descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid principles of the Science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple unadorned language.” 	And then Holmes lets Keats underline the point,  …Then felt I like some watcher of the skies	When a new planet swims into his ken...	That watcher of the skies was Herschel. And the new planet? Uranus."
250,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027264-monika,5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. What strikes me most about Holmes is his ability to weave together what modern man has learned to compartmentalize- the sciences and the humanities. Before science was ""science,"" it was natural philosophy. Before scientists were ""scientists,"" they were natural philosophers and poets. Richard Holmes brings science and art back together in order to tell the story of how the late eighteenth century produced the foundation of what would become modern science. Framing the book with the story of Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who took part in Captain Cook's expedition to Tahiti later becoming the president of the Royal Society, Holmes moves to William Herschel, the musician and amateur astronomer who would discover Uranus with a telescope of his own making, and his sister, Caroline, who herself was responsible for discovering several comets. From the Herschel's the story moves to Mungo Parks and his travels to Africa and mapping of the Congo, followed by Sir Humphry Davy, who many believe is the founder of modern chemistry.What makes this book a wonder, however, is the pervasive spirit of inquiry of the age. Whereas now we seem to accept platitudes like ""I'm good at English, so I must not be good at math,"" this age embraced the idea that the only way to express the wonder of science is through poetry, literature, and the arts. Poets like Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley attended lectures from the great thinkers of the age, then expressed the same concerns about man's place in the world as the men who gave the lectures. What a time it must have been... human curiosity leading to unimaginable discoveries, discoveries that would forever alter the way we view our place in the universe... and such is the terror. To borrow from Carl Jung, this period marked the dawning of our self-awareness as a species in a universe that very quickly became immeasurably large and unimaginably old. Suddenly, we became ants in an ant farm instead of products of some intelligent design... Richard Holmes captures the complexities of the period in a most poetic way. I will be coming back to this book many times."
251,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779830-andrew,3,"I forgot about this book until I saw it again here. My father sent this book to me a few years ago. I enjoyed learning about the various people, scientists as well as non-scientists. I like that Holmes gives so much detail about, for instance, the grinding of the mirror for the telescope. And how it was paid for. For me, the book would be just as enjoyable if it was a collection of anecdotes and free of any speculation as to whether or how the literature and paintings of the time may or may not have influenced the scientists of that time. Holmes undertakes the great challenge of finding connections between Romantic notions and the scientific pursuits of those times. I really don't see how such connections can be made without knowing the biographies of the scientists well enough to know the extent of their interest in Romantic notions. That can be hard to know for anyone. I did enjoy learning that S.T. Coleridge was solicited to join a convention of people doing science, at least partly for the purpose of helping to choose a word to apply to the people who do science. As a result of this convention, the word scientist came into general use. It seemed to me that, of all the regard these scientists had for Romantic notions, Holmes related more about Humphry Davies' than any other. "
252,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/392337-sarah,5,"This is an amazing book. It doesn't have as much to do with literary Romanticism as I had originally hoped, but by the end of the first chapter I didn't care. Holmes is an excellent writer, and he makes the excitement and amazement of the scientists and explorers he profiles live. I think my favorite sections are the ones that deal with Joseph Banks, who went on a scientific voyage to Tahiti as a young man and, despite a successful career as a botanist in England, mentor to many younger scientists, and long-time president of the Royal Society, never seems to have found anything that moved him in the same way as Tahiti. To some extent, this book is a series of linked biographies: Banks, astronomer William Herschel and his sister Caroline, Sir Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday. Holmes is also very good at drawing out the political (whether national competition over who should be credited with discoveries or in-fighting over who should lead the various scientific societies) and philosophical (German Romantic writers and Coleridge make appearances here) implications of the scientific discoveries involved. It's not often a book is so informative, gripping, and well written all at once. "
253,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,4,"This was the first book assigned for my new semester, which means I'm going back to reading school stuff round the clock again, but luckily this first one was a great one. It's really a combined biography of Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Science, explorer of Tahiti), William Herschel (discovered Uranus), and Humphrey Davy (experimented with nitrous oxide, and also became President of Royal Society), along with a couple of other secondary stories. The best is probably the history behind Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, tracing it to the debates about the existence of a cosmic ""vitalist"" force, a debate that originated in the circle of German ""nature philosopher"" Frederich Schelling.The book was probably too long though, and plodded through parts of Herschel's and Davy's biographies (especially Davy's atrocious poetry), but it does do a great job showing how the worlds of Romantic literature and early modern science interacted. One takeaway, they all loved Coleridge."
254,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43247-emi-bevacqua,3,"This book is kind of the ultimate departure from my personal comfort zone: nearly 500 pages on the history of western science juxtaposed with poetry. Richard Holmes is an amazing researcher and writer, he really brings the age to life and I loved the beautiful color art inserts. The first section was very straightforward, about the young explorer Joseph Banks and his discoveries in Tahiti; in the next we meet a young astronomist that Banks discovered, named William Herschel and also his sister-assistant Caroline. Then with each chapter and introduction to subsequent scientists the reader is keeping track of more and more complexity, collegial scientists and poets, their discoveries and published work, their travels, and family relations! Throughout it all - anthropology, cosmology, flight, mesmerism, chemistry - the unifying thread is the history of the Royal Society of London scientists, led for the most part by Joseph Banks. My favorite quote is when somebody asks ""What's the use of a (hot air) balloon?"" and Benjamin Franklin responds, ""What's the use of a newborn baby?"" "
255,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,0,"There is obviously something wrong with me. Everyone raves about this book - so far I am finding it choppy, hard to read, all over the map and not particularly well-written. Holmes's penchant for including every detail of everything he ever read about his subjects is exhausting - a better writer would take the trouble to pare things down in the service of a more readable narrative. Part of my disappointment so far is that I didn't find Joseph Banks, the subject of the first 70 pages, a particularly engaging or interesting character. His major contribution to scientific progress appears to have been to bring back a bunch of specimens from Tahiti, a fundamentally pedestrian activity. Darwin's voyage on The Beagle was interesting because of how he subsequently synthesized his observations - Banks is a far duller character, no matter how many natives he slept with.Maybe things will pick up with Herschel and Davy."

We need to understand how science is actually made; how scientists themselves think and feel and speculate. We need to explore what makes scientists creative, as well as poets or painters, or musicians. That is how this book began. The old, rigid debates and boundaries -- science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics -- are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.
The Age of Wonder isn't quite the book I expected it to be: I was looking forward to a lot of science, which I find intriguing, but I found this work to be laden down with a lot of biographical information, which I find to be less so. The Romantic Period must have been an astonishing time to be alive, indeed an Age of Wonder; a time when any amateur, even a foreign musician like William Herschel, with enough curiosity and funds could literally point out new discoveries in the self-same night sky humans had been regarding for millennia. A privileged young man, like Joseph Banks, could buy himself passage on a voyage of discovery under Captain Cook and, in the process of collecting botanical specimens from Tahiti, invent the new field of Anthropology. Science, at the beginning of this period, was accessible and democratic: a barely educated young man, like Humphrey Davy, was able to wrest the study of the elements from the grip of the Alchemists and properly begin the discipline of Chemistry -- no longer searching for how to transmute the impossible, Davy (et al) did simple experiments to discover what does happen. Imagine a time when that was revolutionary thinking. Imagine if there were still basic discoveries to be made in nature; discoveries waiting to be plucked like low hanging fruit.I was delighted by the intersections between Science and Literature and Philosophy; how each informed the others; how so many of these early Scientists not only rubbed elbows with the likes of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Byron, but also expressed their own amazement in well-regarded verse. This also worked in reverse, with the great poets of the age attending scientific lectures in order to learn the terminology, the great metaphors of the day -- could this possibly be happening today?This book is exhaustive, and ultimately, I found that to be…exhausting. The following is more for my own memory than part of a proper review (and as I would probably advise anyone reading this review to just end here, I'm going to hide it all as a spoiler).(view spoiler)[I was charmed by Banks in Tahiti, and appreciated all of the primary source materials that were provided (the personal letters and journals and articles that filled in the big picture, that made the age come alive), but in some later sections these additions felt gossipy and a bit pointless. My favourite part from Tahiti: On their last day they discovered an enormous stone 'marai' or funeral monument, shaped like a pyramid, some forty-four feet high and nearly 300 feet wide, with steps of superbly polished white coral down both sides. This, the 'masterpiece' of Tahitian architecture on the island, was unsettling to Banks because its construction seemed technically inexplicable. 'It is beyond belief that Indians could raise so large a structure without the assistance of Iron tools to shape their stones or mortar to join them.'Not far away was another mystery: a huge wicker man constructed of basketwork, evidently for some obscure sacrificial rite. 'The whole was neatly covered with feathers, white to represent skin and black to represent hair and tattow.' I love stuff like that, and yes, I watch Ancient Aliens: not because I believe extraterrestrials built this curious 'marai', but because I revel in the mystery of these sorts of ancient structures and monuments and that show has a new one for me every week. Because of the noted intersections with literature, I was jotting down the books I was reminded of as I was reading. For this section, it was : Jamrach's Menagerie, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Unfamiliar Fishes (and how sad to note the evolution of Captain Cook from his empathetic treatment of the Tahitians to his brutality towards the Hawaiins), Parrot and Olivier in America, Moby Dick.I enjoyed the first section on William Herschel, but again, the biographical information was simply overwhelming -- I would have much preferred a general overview of his life in Hanover before emigrating to England and found no benefit at all in the biographies of his family members other than Caroline. When the book revisited the Herchels later -- more of the same and more of the same plus the details of his marriage and family -- I was seriously bored. I suppose the fact that his son, John, went on to become a leading figure in the Victorian Age of Science explains why we must follow William to the grave, but that wasn't what I wanted from this book (which I understand is a fault of my own, not the author). Since Caroline was profoundly affected by the Lisbon earthquake, I was put in mind of Candide and also of Frankenstein (not realising this book would be quoted at great length later).I was amused by the section on ballooning, and appreciate how at the time it must have seemed like the dawn of the Jetsons with their flying cars, but since in the end it was dismissed as a fad, more suited to carnivals than scientific study, I don't know that it belonged in this book. I did like this part: Benjamin Franklin, American Ambassador in Paris, watched the launch (of the first manned balloon flight) through a telescope from the window of his carriage. Afterwards he remarked: 'Someone asked me -- what's the use of a balloon? I replied - what's the use of a newborn baby?'Obvious choices, but I was reminded of Around the World in Eighty Days and The Wizard of Oz.Age of Wonder picked up (after another dull visit with the Herchels) when it told the thrilling story of Mongo Park and his two expeditions to find the source of the Niger in Africa. While the first trip was pure adventurism, the second smacked of imperialism, and it was probably due to his own self-important beliefs that he failed to pay due respect to the local tribes and was never seen again. Literary tie-ins: Heart of Darkness (for which Park was likely the inspiration for Kurtz), and because so much of this book takes place during the Napoleonic years and the war between France and Britain, A Tale of Two Cities.Humphrey Davy was a Poet and Chemist who experimented on himself with Nitrous Oxide, like a Timothy Leary for his time, without making the leap to its use in surgery. (A later section on the mastectomy that Fanny Burney endured without benefit of anesthetic made for a harrowing reading experience, but it was one more event that I wasn't certain belonged in what I thought this book was meant to be). Davy then made the leap to the study of Galvinism, and this sparked the great debates about Vitalism and ""is there an animating principle"" -- a soul? -- in humans, the great parlour discussion topic of the time, and that led to the first inklings of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This was interesting, but the very lengthy quoting from the book and its reception by the public and the stage play that came later -- all of this seemed beside the point to me. As was Davy's disintegrating marriage and political dealings with the Royal Academy of Science and his ""little nurse in Illyria"" -- so much biography, so little actual science. I did, however, appreciate when Davy put his mind to creating a safety-lamp for miners -- his great effort to demonstrate that science was for the benefit of mankind; theory that may be put into practise. The literary tie-ins at this point were all poetry: Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Prometheus Unbound.  (hide spoiler)]Okay, so after that long stretch of what was interesting and not so interesting to me, I return to Richard Holme's quote that I started with, the bit he actually ended with, and specifically:  Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. How many of us have this hope and wonder? I don't know that I believe the scientists of today are imbued with hope and wonder; that they are philosophical about their work; that they have the creative souls of artists. But perhaps I'm wrong and I thank Age of Wonder for forcing me to think of Science in this way.I wanted to love this book, but it was ultimately brought down by the immensity of the information it contained -- had it left out the society news and letters from home, I might have enjoyed it much more. "
257,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23672960-brian-willis,5,"Conventional wisdom places the scientific and rational achievements of the Age of Enlightenment in direct opposition to the fundamental values of the age of Romanticism in the arts. Poetry and art exuberantly shifted from an emphasis on cold rationality and collective achievement as well as logical procedures of the calculating mind towards exploration of the sentimentality of the human spirit, the individual within the natural world, and the subconscious. In other words, the movement was from the visible (or that which could be explained through rational observation) towards explaining the invisible (the interior subjective human self, the passions, the drives, and impulses that cannot be explained through science, at least in that era).Richard Holmes, perhaps the great living biographer of the Romantic era presents us with a multi-part biography of the scientists that influenced the Romantics, but instead of playing the party line of this dialectic, he demonstrates that the Romantic Era existed INFUSED with the spirit of exploration of the science of the age. Beginning with Sir Joseph Banks, he explains the foundation of the Royal Society. Then he divides a large part of the book following and documenting the life and achievements of Sir William Herschel and Sir Humphrey Davy. Herschel made his fame discovering Uranus, but Holmes argues effectively that his development of advanced telescopes as well as a method towards cataloguing the night sky were influential for future generations. One of the unsung heroes of the book is Caroline Herschel, his sister, who actually become the first patronized and influential female astronomer. Davy expanded our knowledge of natural gases and their containment, most effectively with his staggering safety lamp for miners. Other topics discussed are the passion for tales of the exploits of explorer Mungo Park and the origination of aerial flight through hot air ballooning. Holmes ties these achievements into the ongoing saga of the leading Romantics, particularly their encounters with Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley, and Keats (with Wordsworth gliding in the background and occasionally making an appearance). He points out moments in their compositions that reference the achievements of Banks, the Herschels, Davy, Park, Sadler, and many others. As the Romantics ascended, the reputation of science seems to have retroactively been placed into competition with the values of the age of Romanticism and later Victorianism. The Romantics grappled with the same issues that the scientists did however; the revelations of the cosmos and the sanctity of particles in observation of tiny objects were revealing the same troubling conclusions for both scientists and poets. If there are uncountable galaxies, is it ludicrous to think that Christ was crucified millions of times to redeem the universe? Surprisingly, this hint at atheism backfired on scientists and their reputation for years to come while Romantics with their celebration of pagan values and occasionally an atheist or two, somehow escaped the judgement of posterity though facing criticism in their time. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, inspired by the electrical current experimentation of Galvani, was interpreted as a condemnation of the limits of science (though that was not Shelley's intent).In the end, Holmes writes an incredibly enlightening and informative group biography, argues for the art of biography as a window into the discovery process of science, and demonstrates that these scientists not only created the profession of scientist but also the groundwork for the scientific method, as eventually perfected by Charles Darwin (who also makes an appearance). Another triumph from one of my favorite writers."
258,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16010931-douglass-gaking,5,"The Age of Wonder is a solid history of British scientists in the Romantic era. It focuses on the individual scientists' lives, their experiments, their writings–both personal and published–and their connections to each other.Scientists in focus include Joseph Banks, William Herschel, Michael Faraday, and even the fictional Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Each chapter is as in-depth as a biography.I especially like the chapter on William Herschel. I had not realized how close he came to our current understanding of the construction of the universe, despite being formally trained as a musician, and self-taught as a scientist.My main takeaway from this book is how imaginative these scientists were. Whether it is believing in the chemical nature of the soul or the existence of life on the moon, they had wild theories that certainly fit in with the sentiment of the Romantic era. While so many of these hypothesis proved to be false, whether in their lifetimes or later, it is the pursuit of proving them through experimentation that advanced human knowledge into the modern age."
259,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8355999-betsy,4,"This is an engrossing book about the development of science during the late 18th and early 19th century. It focuses on four individuals, Joseph Banks, (explorer and driving force behind the Royal Society for many years) Caroline and William Herschel (sister and brother astronomers) and Humphry Davy (chemist). Two things stand out from the rest for me. First, the author discussed women's roles in science and the role of Caroline Herschel in particular. She was the first woman awarded a stipend by the King for her astronomical work (albeit at half the rate a man would have received). Second, I was surprised by the strong overlap of science and poetry. Many of the scientists were published poets, including Herschel and Davy and many of the poets were also active in the sciences (Coleridge and Wordsworth among others).At almost 500 pages the book dragged in a few places, particularly when the author was describing societal trends rather than giving biographies of the various scientists and poets. But, all in all, well worth the time it took to read it."

It makes me wish I lived in the Victorian ages just so I could go here these talks on nascent principles and ideas, no matter how off they were in the long run. In my Victorian fantasies I’m super rich and, apparently, male. But just reading about these explorers, these astronomers, these scientists developing these wonderful inventions and ideas that went on to better the world … it’s heady stuff. At times the book is a bit dry, but for the most part the subject matter is so rich you get entirely wrapped up in it."

267,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24591006-april,4,"I enjoyed hearing the backstories of these famous men of science and discovery. It's enlightening to understand their motivation for their actions. The author was also very interested in literary pursuits of the scientists, analyzing and interpreting their poetry. I liked that philosophical men of science felt encouraged to write their own poetry. I don't believe that is the case very often nowadays.This was such a dense read. It took me a long time to get through it, not because it was poorly written or boring, but because there was so much information to absorb on each page. And each page was equally as interesting as it was dense.""To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling ... a soap bubble ... an apple ... a pebble ... He walks in the midst of wonders."" - John Herschel, A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1830). pg. xiii""But while Cook clung to the necessity of European forms and discipline, Banks was rather inclined to dwell on the superfluity of European needs. These were perhaps the reflections of a man who had always been used to wealth and comforts. 'From them appear how small are the real wants of human nature, which we Europeans have increasd to an excess which would certainly appear incredible to these people could they be told it. Nor shall we cease to increase them as long as Luxuries can be invented and riches found for the purchase of them; and how soon these Luxuries degenerate into necessaries may be sufficiently evincd by the universal use of strong liquors, Tobacco, spices, Tea &c. &c.'"" pg. 39""Riding between musical engagements, from one remote provincial northern town to another, often crossing over the moors alone at night, he found himself studying the panoply of stars overhead as he had done as a boy. He became well acquainted with the moon, and would later write that at this time he had intended 'to fix upon the moon for my habitation.' He also later told several tales about these lonely rides, one being how on one occasion he was reading so intently that when his horse stumbled and threw him, he somersaulted over its head and landed upright still holding his book in his hand, a perfect demonstration of the Newtonian law of 'circular motion.'"" pg. 74""Characteristically, Pilatre ignored these protests, and calmly went on telling d'Arlandes to work at feeding the brazier. He himself took off his bright green topcoat (put on for the crowd), rolled up his sleeves, and went on throwing on straw till his wooden fork broke. Once, when d'Arlandes was desperately shouting at him, 'We must go down! We must go down!,' Pilatre called back soothingly: 'Look d'Arlandes. Here we are above Paris. There's no possible danger for you. Are you taking this all in?' Many witnesses later said that they could hear the two men shouting excitedly to each other as they passed overhead. They assumed they were describing the glories of flight."" pg. 130""It was a glorious pink-and-yellow, candy-coloured balloon, thirty feet tall, and the crowd loved it. The wickerwork basket, a sort of chaise longue for two, was completely festooned with flags and bunting. Dr Charles had a full payload of scientific equipment aboard--mercury barometer (which was used as an early form of altimeter), thermometer, telescope, sand bags and several bottles of champagne."" pg. 131""Surprisingly, balloons did not appeal to the gothic novelist Horace Walpole, though perhaps at sixty-six he was a little old for such perilous novelties. He thought balloons might be sinister: 'Well! I hope these new mechanic meteors will prove only playthings for the learned and idle, and not be converted into new engines of destruction to the human race--as is so often the case of refinements or discoveries in Science. The wicked wit of man always studies to apply the results of talents to enslaving, destroying, or cheating his fellow creatures. Could we reach the moon, we should think of reducing it to a province of some European kingdom.' It was an ominous prophecy."" pg. 135To note: What we Americans call the Revolutionary War, the British call the American War of Independence. pg. 147""Ballooning added to this new awareness of the complexity and subtlety of clouds, a growing Romantic preoccupation which can be followed in the paintings of Turner and Constable, the notebooks of Coleridge and the poetry of Shelley. When Shelley refers to 'the locks of the approaching storm' in his 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819), he is using Howard's definition cirrus. 'The Cloud' (1820) demonstrates a remarkably accurate and scientific understanding of cloud formation and the convection cycle. Goethe wrote a number of essays on clouds, atmospheric pressures and weather, and translated passages of Howard, asking him to compose and send his Autobiography to Germany, and describing him as 'the first to define conceptually the airy and ever-changing forms of clouds, thus delimiting and fixing what had always been ephemeral and intangible, by accurate observation and naming.'"" pg. 160""Clouds became fascinating both as scientific phenomena--the generators of electricity, the mysterious indicators of winds and changing air pressure--and as aesthetic phenomena: the 'moods' of the sky reflecting those of the observer, alterations of light over landscape, symbols of change, destruction, regeneration. It could be argued that the Romantics actually invented the idea of 'the weather' itself, as it now preoccupies us; as well, of course, as 'inner weather.'"" pg. 160""Ballooning produced a new, and wholly unexpected, vision of the earth. It had been imagined that it would reveal the secrets of the heavens above, but in fact it showed the secrets of the world beneath. The early aeronauts suddenly saw the earth as a giant organism, mysteriously patterned and unfolding, like a living creature. For the first time the impact of man on nature was clearly revealed: the ever-expanding relationship of towns to countryside, roads to rivers, cultivated fields to forests, and the development of industry. It was comparable to the first views of the earth from space by the Apollo astronauts in the 1960s, producing a new concept of a 'single blue planet' with its delicate membrane of atmosphere. The famous photograph 'Earthrise' was taken from lunar orbit in December 1968."" pg. 161""As he grew older, Herschel was becoming a remoter figure in the household. His mind was ranging through the universe. His later papers for the Royal Society had begun to show an increasing awareness of the philosophical significance of astronomy. This was something urged upon him by his old supporter William Watson, who looked forward to conversations 'on Kant's metaphysics,' and wished to know how far Herschel agreed with the 'ground and sources' of Kant's philosophy of knowledge."" pg. 203""Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that 'deep space' must also imply 'deep time.' He wrote in his Preface: 'A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past ... [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand--that is--almost two million years on their way.' The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great deal of explanation to the layman."" pg. 203""Herschel continued to reach carefully towards the idea of an evolving universe, a concept as radical in its eventual implications as Erasmus Darwin's notion of evolution within plants and animals. In a late paper published in 1811, 'Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens,' Herschel further developed the idea . . . that all nebulae and large star clusters were at particular points in their sidereal life-cycles, which could be visually identified and catalogued almost in a Linnaean manner. Their characteristic shapes suggested distinct moments of youth, maturing and ageing."" pg. 204""It presented the universe as a living, growing, organic entity, with all nebulae belonging to one enormous extended family: 'There is not so much difference between them, if I may use the comparison, as there would be in an annual description of the human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a man in his prime.' This comparison is an intriguing premonition of 'time-lapse' photography, now one of the most powerful illustrative tools of modern natural history."" pg. 204-205""Physical vision--one might say scientific vision--brings about a metaphysical shift in the observer's view of reality as a whole. The geography of the earth, or the structure of the solar system, are in an instant utterly changed, and forever. The explorer, the scientific observer, the literary reader, experience the Sublime: a moment of revelation into the idea of the unbounded, the infinite."" pg. 207""At all events, it was clear that the Milky Way 'cannot last forever'; and equally that 'its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.' It followed that neither the earth, nor even the solar system, was a separate creation, but merely an infinitesimal part of a galactic evolution. Our galaxy had a physical beginning, and would have a physical conclusion. Our solar system, our planet, and hence our whole civilisation would have an ultimate and unavoidable end."" pg. 209""Campbell recalled that he felt he had been 'conversing with a supernatural intelligence.' Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably 'ceased to exist' millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. 'The light did travel after the body was gone.' After leaving Herschel, Campbell walked onto the shingle of Brighton beach, gazing out to sea, feeling 'evelvated and overcome.' He was reminded of Newton's observation that he was just a child picking up shells on the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay all before him."" pg. 210""It is evident that the death of his father, and all the subsequent emotional upheavals, profoundly shook the sixteen-year-old Davy, and started an intellectual ferment that never left him. Besides writing poetry, he also started his first diary, set himself reading lists and work timetables, and began a series of essays on religion versus materialism. During 1796 he wrote an essay 'On Mathematics,' and another 'On Consciousness,' which gleefully explored the implications of materialism. He described the body as 'a fine tuned Machine,' and wrote a syllogistic proof that the 'soul' could not exist, since it was said to be eternal and 'unchangeable,' while every known part of the human body, including the brain, was temporary and changed perpetually. 'QED the soul does not exist.'"" pg. 243""One of Burney's many extraordinary reflections was whether extreme physical pain could not only induce unconsciousness--'I have two total chasms in my memory of this transaction'--but actually force the soul out of the body. She also found that the act of recollection carried its own pain, and that she had taken three months to complete the account, as a letter of nearly 10,000 words to her sister Esther. She had severe headaches every time she tried to go on with it. Once finished, she could not look back over what she had written. 'I dare not revise, nor read, the recollection is still so painful.' It is an astonishing record of courage, not least in Fanny's determination to protect her husband from the trauma of the operation. But it also recalls what the real conditions of surgery were at this period."" pg. 306""But speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical ideas of Friedrich Schelling and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine, perhaps best translated as 'science mysticism,' defined the entire natural world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity as a series of 'polarities.' According to Schelling's doctrine, the whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical objects 'aspired' to become something higher. There was a 'world-soul' constantly 'evolving' higher life forms and 'levels of consciousness' in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards a higher state."" pg. 315""Davy's notebooks for this period also suggest a new pattern of philosophical speculation, almost approaching German Naturphilosophie. Some of his observations would have been recognised by Coleridge: 'The aspirations for immortality are movements of the mind similar to those which a bird makes with its wings before they are furnished with feathers.' Others were more closely tied to his laboratory work. On the subject of scientific 'analogy,' for instance, he wondered if there was a wider principle at work. 'Probably there is an analogy in all existence: the divided tail of the fish is linked in a long succession of like objects with the biped man. In the planetary system it is probable man will be found connected with a higher intellectual nature; and it is possible that the monad, or soul, is constantly undergoing a series of progressions.'"" pg. 357""In November 1827 Davy returned briefly to London to resign his presidency of the Royal Society. He later gave a moving glimpse of his disillusion with his own scientific career on this sad return: 'In my youth, and through the prime of manhood, I never entered London without feelings of pleasure and hope. It was to me as the grand theatre of intellectual activity, the field of every species of enterprise and exertion, the metropolis of the world of business, thought, and action ... I now entered the great city in a very different tone of mind, one of settled melancholy ... My health was gone, my ambition was satisfied, I was no longer excited by the desire of distinction; what I regarded most tenderly [my mother], was in the grave ... My cup of life was no longer sparkling, sweet, and effervescent ... it has become bitter.' In a wonderfully sardonic aside, Davy added that this metaphor of the 'cup of life' was scientifically derived from the chemical fermentation of 'the juice of the grape,' and then after a certain lapse of time, its oxidisation and acidification."" pg. 419""Babbage perhaps intended a sort of parable of science for the new generation. His story went as follows. When Babbage first peered carefully at the shimmering solar image projected through Herschel's prism, he could not see these dark Fraunhofer lines, though he knew they were there. Herschel then commented to him: 'An object is frequently not seen, from not knowing how to see it, rather than from any deficit in the organ of vision ... I will instruct you how to see them.' After some time spent re-examining and refocusing the image, Babbage could see them perfectly. The point was that science must always be more than the simple observation of phenomena or data. It was simultaneously a subjective training in observation skills, self-criticism and interpretation: a complete education. This was of course precisely what William Herschel had said forty years before, about learning to see with a telescope."" pg. 440Book: borrowed from the SSF Main Library."

His deft handling the scientific discoveries that made these men and women - the Herschels (William, Caroline, and John), Joseph Banks, Michael Farady, Humphry Davy, et al - so important is admirable, of course, but more impressive is his ability to marshal an enormous amount of research into a coherent, pleasurable narrative.

274,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,5,"In writing this review, I am keeping in mind that an old and very dear friend of mine (who has read and liked this book) is highly interested in my evaluation. I mention this because it leads to an important point about the book: the background of the reader will strongly determine what he or she gets out of reading The Age of Wonder. For my part, I approach this work as a sociologist who is currently (fall 2013) preparing to take a doctoral exam in the sociology of science. Hence, I already have some grounding in this field and I will use this book as deep background for my own work in science and technology studies.To extract the maximum value from this work, the reader will need some knowledge of Romanticism and the history and philosophy of science – in particular the “two cultures” debate deriving from C.P. Snow’s famous work of that name. This is not to say that this book is entirely useless to the reader lacking such a background, but it will be more difficult for the reader to grasp the overall argument, as Holmes does not provide such contextualization. However, his skills as a biographer are so good that the reader can derive enormous value simply reading the book as a set of biographical vignettes and it would not be a waste of time.  However, the core of Holmes’ work involves an extended critique of the notion that art and science are invariably at odds. Holmes’ objective is to show that this tension is largely a product of Late Romanticism (early 19th Century) and in sociological terms is very much a cultural and political “project”. Indeed, Holmes provides compelling evidence not only that science and art are not inherently adversarial but that in Early Romanticism the two were deeply interconnected and (Holmes argues) drew strength from each other. Hence the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner) was not only a Romantic author but worked with Humphry Davy (the chemist) and conducted experiments with prisms in Germany. Davy for his part wrote both early science fiction as well as poetry. And these are but two examples that Holmes provides. He builds a picture of how through Romantic philosophy both science and art were unified by the feature intrinsic to both: creative thought. In this way, Romantic science can be distinguished from the more purely rationalistic viewpoint of the Early Enlightenment (in the works of Descartes, Spinoza, and Hobbes for example). Spinoza forms a case in point (I get this from Steven Nadler’s study of Spinoza in A Book Forged in Hell). Spinoza asserted that there was no role for imagination in rational society (including science) and that knowledge was based on the accumulation of facts. However, scientists of the Romantic Age (and after, such as Richard Feynman) dismissed the adequacy of simply collecting facts. Scientific understanding required conceptual breakthroughs, and this was only available via creative thought and imagination. (The cultural meme of the creative scientific breakthrough – Archimedes’ “Eureka!” moment – remains strong in present day public understanding of science. Witness how nonscientists regard Einstein or Stephen Hawking.)All of this is a long way from the divided and acrimonious relation between art and science described by C.P. Snow in his landmark “The Two Cultures”. Holmes locates the inflection point at the “Immortal Dinner” held in December 1817 by the fundamentalist Christian painter Benjamin Haydon (see pages 318-321). Attending this event were the poets William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, and John Keats. However, Holmes notes that this dinner did not include Coleridge, Byron, or Shelley – persons whom Holmes asserts would have had no patience for either Haydon’s rhetorical aims or the acrimony towards science espoused by their fellow poets. In the long run, however, the constructed antipathy between art and science put forward at the “Immortal Dinner” have become part of the dogma about science and art.Holmes’ central objective in Age of Wonder, then, is to usefully refute the “Two Cultures” hypothesis and to provide biographical evidence of its inadequacy both past and present as well as to partly rehabilitate the role of Romantic art and sensibility in furthering the Scientific Revolution – a viewpoint joined by Lisa Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution) and others, including, interestingly, the arch-atheist Richard Dawkins. Within the limits of my knowledge, I feel that Holmes has successfully provided a rich source of materials for his case as well as vivid biographical portraits of the personalities involved in this second stage of the English Scientific Revolution – with Lisa Jardine having provided a very useful synopsis of the first stage of the English Scientific Revolution.However, Holmes does not provide a good overall contextualization of the issues at stake, making it difficult for those without existing specialist knowledge to either understand or to evaluate his thesis. This contextualization would not have to be large – a short chapter at the beginning of the book, or rather a reworking of his introduction – would suffice to ease general readers into the debate on “two cultures” (he never actually deals with C.P. Snow’s thesis in depth here – a significant omission. Another issue is that this work is almost entirely Anglo-centric, with some mention of Antoine Lavoisier, Alexandre Charles, the Mongolfiers, and other French and German scientists. This Anglo-centrism is merited to a degree because of the key role played by Britain in the early Industrial and Scientific Revolutions. But at the same time, the reader can wonder how well Holmes’ interpretation of Romantic science translates to the broader European context. So, in closing, while this is a great book, it is not a standalone work. To extract full value from it, I would recommend looking at the back of the book, where Holmes provides a highly welcome background reading list. For anyone interested in modern political and intellectual history, some knowledge of Romanticism is a must and well worth acquiring. By the same token, some knowledge of either the sociology of science or the history and philosophy of science (these can be somewhat adversarial fields) will provide context for why it is important to understand how scientists actually practice their craft as well as the greater social context in which science takes place (see for instance Bruno Latour, Laboratory Life.) So, while I would recommend this book for anyone interested in science and early modern history, it is a book that provides greater rewards for external study than most. "
275,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"This book took me an unusually long time to finish, which at first I was inclined to blame on my own deficiencies. But by the time I finished the book, I was otherwise inclined. Quite simply, this book seemed to strive mightily to connect the major Romantic poets to some major Romantic-era scientists, but ultimately the author’s thesis fell flat for me. Granted, I very much enjoyed the first few chapters of the book, which focused on Joseph Banks’ voyages to Tahiti, the brother and sister astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, the African odyssey of Mungo Park, and the escapades of daredevil balloonists. Holmes does an admirable job of writing juicy mini-biographies of these and other personages, but, dazzled as I was by his eye for detail and ability to enable the reader to peer beneath his subjects’ skin, early on I found myself a bit baffled at why these disparate people were sharing space in the same volume. Then, in subsequent chapters, particularly those devoted to chemist/poet Humphrey Davy, I hit a wall. Davy, to me, was not nearly as engaging a person, despite his obvious brilliance and importance, but more to the point, at this point in the book the author begins to strain very hard to bring in connections to the Romantic poets. Davy was friends with Coleridge and wrote a great deal of (alas, not very good) poetry himself. Holmes quotes reams of Davy’s poetry (which I immediately learned to skim), as well as poetry by Coleridge, Keats, Byron and Shelley. And it was at this point that I sincerely wished that the author were NOT a specialist and biographer of the Romantic poets, for he strained so often and so hard to work in any poetic reference, however tangential, to science that I became quite impatient. His thesis.... well, I’m not entirely sure what it was, to be honest. (And hence my initial impulse to feel it was my fault as a reader, for surely there is a thesis?) Something about how the divisions between science and poetry/philosophy are artificial and that, indeed, we should endeavor to unite the two fields, which are both grounded in wonder.  But, gee, that’s an awfully broad net to cast, don’t you think? I’m afraid the result was a great deal of bycatch. Then, too, during the second half of the book, the discussion of Davy et al. becomes quite bogged down in the discussion of Davy’s various relationships (romantic and otherwise), the political wranglings of the Royal Society, and the rise or fall of various scientists’ reputations. The narrative became dense and hard to follow. However, I persisted to the end of the book, feeling that, surely, the author would tie all these disparate strands together for me in some cohesive way.No such luck. "
276,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn,4,"Interest and Science TogetherThis book is meant to emphasize that research and art go together and are inseparable. Holmes discusses how leisure time gave way to thought,involvement and art caused the scientific revolution a a is could not exist without the other. He uses examples from all over Europe and pulls stories out quite well. "
277,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"“Science is truly a relay race, with each discovery handed on to the next generation. Even as one door is closing, another door is already being thrown open. So it is with this book. For this, I believe science needs to be presented and explored in a new way. We need not only a new history of science, but a more enlarged and imaginative biographical writing about individual scientists. The old, rigid debates and boundaries — science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics — are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.”I am abashed at how much of this book I did not know, and am grateful that I do now. Slightly dry and scattered, it was hard to get through, not full of wonder but details, but worth the time. I wish there was a timeline, as the narrative moves all over the place, ostensibly chronologically but confusingly.The revolution of the time was an explosion of astronomy, chemistry, geology, exploration of the world, and changes in society “to the point that the greatest astronomer of the age would turn out to be an immigrant German musician (William Herschel and his sister!), the greatest chemist was the son of a Welsh ne’er-do-well (Humphry Davy), and a whole new branch of study—electromagnetism—would be founded by the son of a blacksmith (Michael Faraday). All these figures appear as characters in Holmes’ fascinating work, along with poets, novelists, explorers, aristocrats and even balloonists.” The scientist was also philosopher, and the lines were blurred. The author includes poetry that was inspired by the science, by Coleridge, Byron, Keats, and Shelley, and that adds a layer to the Ancient Mariner and other famous poems of the time that might be my favorite part of the book. I am reading The Second Mountain by David Brooks, and he writes of times in history when the moral ecology was changing, and Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael would say when Mother Culture gets more strident, and the frog in the boiling water doesn’t feel the heat yet. I can see the arc of time in this age of wonder, and how scientists of the time had an intense drive to be an individual, to achieve grand and stupendous things (telescopes to discover Uranus, mapping Africa, discovering potassium, etc) with recklessness and fearlessness. “Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration. These were Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world expedition aboard the Endeavour, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage to the Galapagos islands aboard the Beagle, begun in 1831. This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder, and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”I had always revered the Enlightenment Age so may have glossed over anything called Romantic, hence the ignorance. The author focuses on three Romantic themes: ballooning, global exploration and soul hunting along with the science. The author writes that far back in antiquity, “Plato argued that the notion of ‘wonder’ was central to all philosophical thought: ‘In Wonder all Philosophy began: in Wonder it ends…But the first Wonder is the Offspring of Ignorance; the last is the Parent of Adoration.’” This was quite lost during the rational Enlightenment and the Romantic poets put the wonder back into the science, and drew the lay people in to experience it. Can you imagine scads of modern poetry written about Carl Sagan or Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Like Wordsworth:Romantic traveller amidst the stars: And from my pillow, looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold The Antechapel where the Statue stood Of Newton, with his prism and his silent face, The marble index of a Mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.Wordsworth again:My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky; So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man...Epigraphs:He thought about himself, and the whole Earth, Of Man the wonderful, and of the Stars, And how the deuce they ever could have birth; And then he thought of Earthquakes, and of Wars, How many miles the Moon might have in girth, Of Air-balloons, and of the many bars To perfect Knowledge of the boundless Skies; And then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes. BYRON, Don Juan (1819)Those to whom the harmonious doors Of Science have unbarred celestial stores … WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ‘Lines Additional to an Evening Walk’ (1794)Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific … JOHN KEATS, ms of sonnet (1816)“Their minutely recorded telescope observations, published in over a hundred papers by the Royal Society, would change not only the public conception of the solar system, but of the whole Milky Way galaxy and the structure and meaning of the universe itself. It was immediately apparent that Herschel had created an instrument of unparalleled light-gathering power and clarity. He saw, for example, what very few astronomers even suspected: that the Pole Star — which had been the key to navigation, and the poet’s traditional emblem of steadiness and singularity, for centuries — was not in fact one star at all, but two stars.”“Surrounded by infinite space, and swallowed up in an immensity of being, man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean, mixed and confounded with the general mass. But from this situation, perplexing as it is, he endeavours to extricate himself; and by looking abroad into Nature, employs the powers she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.”“An unfathomably larger universe was steadily opening up, and this gradually transformed popular notions of the size and mystery of the world ‘beyond the heavens’Indeed, the very terms ‘world’, ‘heaven’ and ‘universe’ began to changetheir meanings. It was the psychological breakthrough that Kant had predicted in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens back in 1755: ‘We may cherish the hope that new plane is being uncovered.”Poetry from Erasmus Darwin celebrating the astronomical discoveries of Herschel:When Love Divine, with brooding wings unfurl’d, Call’d from the rude abyss the living World, ‘Let there be Light!’, proclaimed the Almighty Lord, Astonish’d Chaos heard the potent word; Through all his realms the kindling ether runs And the mass starts into a million Suns. Earths round each Sun with quick explosions burst, And second Planets issue from the first; Bend as they journey with projectile force, In bright ellipses their reluctant course; Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll, And form, self-balanced, one revolving whole. – Onward they move, amid their bright abode, Space.David Bourgeois both published handbooks to the science of flight in 1784. Bourgeois opened ecstatically: ‘The idea of taking to the air, of flying through sky, and navigating through the ether, has always appealed so strongly to mankind, that it has appeared in numerous classical legends and folktales from the remotest antiquity. The wings of Saturn, the eagle of Jupiter, the peacocks of Juno, the doves of Venus, the winged horses of the Sun all bear witness …’ By the end of 1784, the second year of the great balloon craze, no fewer than 181 manned ascents had been recorded, mostly in France and England.Jeffries also gave the first truly vivid account of the changing appearance of the ground as seen ‘from a bird’s eye view, as it is called’. This too was constantly surprising. As they took off, there was the white sea of upturned faces in the city squares, swiftly reduced to tiny, unrecognisable points. There was the unearthly silence, the sense of their own motionlessness as the earth seemed to revolve below the basket. Though they did not appear to move, their compass needle steadily turned. Below them, the earth appeared transformed. There was the strange flattening out of hills and buildings, the emergence of previously unsuspected patterns in the foliage of woods, or the cultivation marks in fields, or the branching streets of a town. There was the constantly delusive appearance of clouds, and sudden showers of rain or even snowflakes. (No electrical charges were recorded, much to Jeffries’ relief.) The whole world became ‘like a beautifully coloured map or carpet’Wordsworth began his poem Peter Bell (1798) with a playful image of flying in a sort of dirigible airship, or balloon boat. There’s something in a flying Horse, There’s something in a huge Balloon: But through the Clouds I’ll never float Until I have a little Boat Shaped like the crescent-Moon … Away we go! — and what care we For treason, tumults, and for wars? We are as calm in our Delight As is the crescent-Moon so bright Among the scattered Stars.Perhaps Shelley put it best:‘The balloon has not yet received the perfection of which it is surely capable; the art of navigating the air is in its first and most helpless infancy; the aerial mariner still swims on bladders, and has not yet mounted the rude raft … It would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned. It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa? — Why do we not despatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction, and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon, which a vertical sun would project precisely underneath it, as it glided over that hitherto unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.’This method of viewing the galaxies (‘to continue the simile I have borrowed from the vegetable kingdom’) presented the entire universe in a new kind of light, with the most radical implications. ‘The heavens are now seen to resemble a luxuriant garden which contains the greatest variety of productions, in different flourishing beds … and we can extend the range of our experience [of them] to an immense duration.’Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that ‘deep space’ must also imply ‘deep time’. He wrote in his Preface: A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past … [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand — that is — almost two million years on their way.’ The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great dealof explanation to the layman.Keats likens his own discovery of Homer’s poetry to the experience of the great astronomer and the great explorer finding new worlds. … Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with wond’ring eyes He stared at the Pacific — and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise – Silent upon a peak in Darien.Herschel also mentioned applying Newton’s theories for measuring the speed of solar light to ‘inconceivably distant bodies’ in the stellar system, with unimaginable results. ‘Then speaking of himself, he said with a modesty of manner that quite overcame me, when taken with the greatness of the assertion: “I have looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I have observed stars of which the light, it can be proved, must have taken millions of years to reach the earth.”’Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably ‘ceased to exist’ millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. ‘The light did travel after the body was gone.’Banks was soon sponsoring small but highly adventurous expeditions into Egypt and the horn of Africa. Its motives at this stage were scientific and commercial, with no missionary or colonial intentions. Its primary aim was discovery, not conquest. This would change once Banks was appointed to the Privy Council in 1797, and became ever more closely involved in prosecuting the war against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then all exploration took on a more political and frankly imperial significance. Yet Africa and Australia always fascinated Banks for their own sake.Explorer Mungo Park: “At this moment, painful as my reflections were, the extraordinary beauty of a small moss in fructification, irresistibly caught my eye. I mention this to show from what trifling circumstances the mind will sometimes derive consolation; for though the whole plant was not larger than the top of one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves, and capsula, without admiration.’ In that moment of pure scientific wonder, Park’s thoughts and outlook were transformed: ‘Can the Being (thought I) who planted, watered, and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed?”Shelley’s wilderness, while it includes ‘dark Aethiopia in her desert hills’, is geographically vague, though it moves more towards India and an imaginary East. But he catches something of Mungo Park’s enigmatic wanderlust, and transforms it into an unearthly Miltonic quest for the strange and magnificent limits of the known world: The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, And o’er the aerial mountains which pour down Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, In joy and exultation held his way; Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched His languid limbs.I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air …To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling … A mind that has once imbibed a taste for scientific enquiry has within itself an inexhaustible source of pure and exciting contemplations. One would think that Shakespeare had such a mind in view when he describes a contemplative man finding Tongues in trees — books in the running brooks Sermons in stones — and good in everything Where the uninformed and unenquiring eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he walks in the midst of wonders. It is intriguing that Herschel was quoting from Shakespeare’s As You Like .."
278,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This is a fascinating account of the growth of science in Romantic Age of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Holmes looks at the period through the lives of ground-breaking scientists, and illuminates the intersections between science, literature, and art during the period.Among the scientists discussed in detail are Joseph Banks, William and Caroline Herschel, Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday, and a collection of truly nutty but ground-breaking (or is that, and ground-breaking) balloonists.One of the most engaging aspects of science in this period is that it was all new enough that any smart, interested person with some (not necessarily large) resources could potentially make an important contribution. Joseph Banks was educated as a botanist, and made one of his greatest contributions with detailed and insightful anthropological observations of the Tahitians. William Herschel was trained as a musician, and his sister Caroline barely educated at all; they became prominent astronomers who made major contributions to the study of the heavens. Michael Faraday was a bookseller who was hired by Humphrey Davy as a lab assistant. Some of these men were born wealthy; some were not. None started out on the path where they made their greatest contributions.Joseph Banks accompanied James Cook on the first of his voyages to the south Pacific, as a naturalist, the same role in which Charles Darwin later sailed on the HMS Beagle. A major purpose of that voyage was to observe an eclipse of the sun that would be visible in Tahiti. While Banks did a great deal of botany while he was in Tahiti, he also made extensive and detailed observations of the Tahitians, differing from most of his fellow British by being open to--indeed, becoming deeply involved in, the Tahitian culture. Initially friendly relations with the Tahitians soured as Cook and others, unable or unwilling to let go of their own preconceptions, repeatedly offended them. After they left Tahiti, the voyage deteriorated further, with conflicts, epidemic illness, and death. The survivors, including Cook and Banks, arrived back in Britain devastated and took months to recover. Still a young man at this point, Banks was at the beginning of his career, and remained a major force in British science for decades to come--but less as a scientist himself, rather as the president of the Royal Society, guiding and encouraging the scientific careers of others.With Banks' story setting the framework, we see the Herschels start out as a musician and his singer/housekeeper sister and become two of the most important astronomers of the age, Davy beginning as a medical student and transforming into a chemist and engineer, and then into a mystical, visionary writer. We see the beginnings of true specialization in science, and the founding of the first subject-specialized science professional associations, separate from the Royal Society, which had, and still sought, to encompass them all. We see, also, the connections and interactions between the scientists and the writers and artists of the age, including Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats.It's a fascinating story, and I promise I have not even scratched the surface of it. Holmes seeks to reveal character as well as accomplishments, and show the ways in which the romantic sensibility, which we generally thing of as antithetical to science, in fact inspired and encouraged the Romantic Age scientists.Highly recommended.I borrowed this book from the local library."
279,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,4,"	“Romantic science can be dated roughly, and certainly symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of exploration…” As in Captain Cook’s first expedition, begun in 1768, and Charles Darwin’s voyage begun in 1831. “This is the time I have called the Age of Wonder,” Richard Holmes writes in his book of the same name, “and with any luck we have not yet quite outgrown it.”	Holmes hasn’t, he is positively giddy with delight over Joseph Banks discovering surfing in Tahiti. He falls head over heels in love with William Herschel’s sister Caroline, so essential to Hershel’s exploration of the heavens through a series of homemade telescopes, the only kind of telescope to be had at the time. The story of Humphrey Davy inventing the safety lamp that saved so many coal miners’ lives is so real he might have been an eyewitness, including all the times Davy blows up at Michael Faraday, not to mention all the times he blows up his lab. 	Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats were fascinated and inspired by these new scientific explorations and discoveries, and employed many of them as images in their work. There is a whole chapter on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, where Holmes traces the Monster’s beginnings to lectures given at the Royal Society in London, which Shelley attended and which included the attempt by one philosopher to use a primitive form of electricity to shock a corpse back to life. Eeew. 	Holmes writes of what may have been our most polymathic age in deft and witty prose. Of Herschel, an accomplished musician as well as an astronomer, he writes, “He moved from earthly music to the music of the spheres.” He writes demurely of the balloon ascension of a Mr. Biggin and a Mrs. Sage, which may or may not have given birth to the Mile High Club. He quotes a contemporary critic as saying, somewhat apologetically, “Poetical descriptions, though they may not be strictly conformable to the rigid principles of the Science they are meant to elucidate, generally leave a stronger impression on the mind, and are far more captivating than simple unadorned language.” 	And then Holmes lets Keats underline the point,  …Then felt I like some watcher of the skies	When a new planet swims into his ken...	That watcher of the skies was Herschel. And the new planet? Uranus."
280,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027264-monika,5,"I cannot recommend this book enough. What strikes me most about Holmes is his ability to weave together what modern man has learned to compartmentalize- the sciences and the humanities. Before science was ""science,"" it was natural philosophy. Before scientists were ""scientists,"" they were natural philosophers and poets. Richard Holmes brings science and art back together in order to tell the story of how the late eighteenth century produced the foundation of what would become modern science. Framing the book with the story of Sir Joseph Banks, the naturalist who took part in Captain Cook's expedition to Tahiti later becoming the president of the Royal Society, Holmes moves to William Herschel, the musician and amateur astronomer who would discover Uranus with a telescope of his own making, and his sister, Caroline, who herself was responsible for discovering several comets. From the Herschel's the story moves to Mungo Parks and his travels to Africa and mapping of the Congo, followed by Sir Humphry Davy, who many believe is the founder of modern chemistry.What makes this book a wonder, however, is the pervasive spirit of inquiry of the age. Whereas now we seem to accept platitudes like ""I'm good at English, so I must not be good at math,"" this age embraced the idea that the only way to express the wonder of science is through poetry, literature, and the arts. Poets like Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley attended lectures from the great thinkers of the age, then expressed the same concerns about man's place in the world as the men who gave the lectures. What a time it must have been... human curiosity leading to unimaginable discoveries, discoveries that would forever alter the way we view our place in the universe... and such is the terror. To borrow from Carl Jung, this period marked the dawning of our self-awareness as a species in a universe that very quickly became immeasurably large and unimaginably old. Suddenly, we became ants in an ant farm instead of products of some intelligent design... Richard Holmes captures the complexities of the period in a most poetic way. I will be coming back to this book many times."
281,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779830-andrew,3,"I forgot about this book until I saw it again here. My father sent this book to me a few years ago. I enjoyed learning about the various people, scientists as well as non-scientists. I like that Holmes gives so much detail about, for instance, the grinding of the mirror for the telescope. And how it was paid for. For me, the book would be just as enjoyable if it was a collection of anecdotes and free of any speculation as to whether or how the literature and paintings of the time may or may not have influenced the scientists of that time. Holmes undertakes the great challenge of finding connections between Romantic notions and the scientific pursuits of those times. I really don't see how such connections can be made without knowing the biographies of the scientists well enough to know the extent of their interest in Romantic notions. That can be hard to know for anyone. I did enjoy learning that S.T. Coleridge was solicited to join a convention of people doing science, at least partly for the purpose of helping to choose a word to apply to the people who do science. As a result of this convention, the word scientist came into general use. It seemed to me that, of all the regard these scientists had for Romantic notions, Holmes related more about Humphry Davies' than any other. "
282,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/392337-sarah,5,"This is an amazing book. It doesn't have as much to do with literary Romanticism as I had originally hoped, but by the end of the first chapter I didn't care. Holmes is an excellent writer, and he makes the excitement and amazement of the scientists and explorers he profiles live. I think my favorite sections are the ones that deal with Joseph Banks, who went on a scientific voyage to Tahiti as a young man and, despite a successful career as a botanist in England, mentor to many younger scientists, and long-time president of the Royal Society, never seems to have found anything that moved him in the same way as Tahiti. To some extent, this book is a series of linked biographies: Banks, astronomer William Herschel and his sister Caroline, Sir Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday. Holmes is also very good at drawing out the political (whether national competition over who should be credited with discoveries or in-fighting over who should lead the various scientific societies) and philosophical (German Romantic writers and Coleridge make appearances here) implications of the scientific discoveries involved. It's not often a book is so informative, gripping, and well written all at once. "
283,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,4,"This was the first book assigned for my new semester, which means I'm going back to reading school stuff round the clock again, but luckily this first one was a great one. It's really a combined biography of Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Science, explorer of Tahiti), William Herschel (discovered Uranus), and Humphrey Davy (experimented with nitrous oxide, and also became President of Royal Society), along with a couple of other secondary stories. The best is probably the history behind Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, tracing it to the debates about the existence of a cosmic ""vitalist"" force, a debate that originated in the circle of German ""nature philosopher"" Frederich Schelling.The book was probably too long though, and plodded through parts of Herschel's and Davy's biographies (especially Davy's atrocious poetry), but it does do a great job showing how the worlds of Romantic literature and early modern science interacted. One takeaway, they all loved Coleridge."
284,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43247-emi-bevacqua,3,"This book is kind of the ultimate departure from my personal comfort zone: nearly 500 pages on the history of western science juxtaposed with poetry. Richard Holmes is an amazing researcher and writer, he really brings the age to life and I loved the beautiful color art inserts. The first section was very straightforward, about the young explorer Joseph Banks and his discoveries in Tahiti; in the next we meet a young astronomist that Banks discovered, named William Herschel and also his sister-assistant Caroline. Then with each chapter and introduction to subsequent scientists the reader is keeping track of more and more complexity, collegial scientists and poets, their discoveries and published work, their travels, and family relations! Throughout it all - anthropology, cosmology, flight, mesmerism, chemistry - the unifying thread is the history of the Royal Society of London scientists, led for the most part by Joseph Banks. My favorite quote is when somebody asks ""What's the use of a (hot air) balloon?"" and Benjamin Franklin responds, ""What's the use of a newborn baby?"" "
285,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,0,"There is obviously something wrong with me. Everyone raves about this book - so far I am finding it choppy, hard to read, all over the map and not particularly well-written. Holmes's penchant for including every detail of everything he ever read about his subjects is exhausting - a better writer would take the trouble to pare things down in the service of a more readable narrative. Part of my disappointment so far is that I didn't find Joseph Banks, the subject of the first 70 pages, a particularly engaging or interesting character. His major contribution to scientific progress appears to have been to bring back a bunch of specimens from Tahiti, a fundamentally pedestrian activity. Darwin's voyage on The Beagle was interesting because of how he subsequently synthesized his observations - Banks is a far duller character, no matter how many natives he slept with.Maybe things will pick up with Herschel and Davy."

We need to understand how science is actually made; how scientists themselves think and feel and speculate. We need to explore what makes scientists creative, as well as poets or painters, or musicians. That is how this book began. The old, rigid debates and boundaries -- science versus religion, science versus the arts, science versus traditional ethics -- are no longer enough. We should be impatient with them. We need a wider, more generous, more imaginative perspective. Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. And that is how this book might possibly end.
The Age of Wonder isn't quite the book I expected it to be: I was looking forward to a lot of science, which I find intriguing, but I found this work to be laden down with a lot of biographical information, which I find to be less so. The Romantic Period must have been an astonishing time to be alive, indeed an Age of Wonder; a time when any amateur, even a foreign musician like William Herschel, with enough curiosity and funds could literally point out new discoveries in the self-same night sky humans had been regarding for millennia. A privileged young man, like Joseph Banks, could buy himself passage on a voyage of discovery under Captain Cook and, in the process of collecting botanical specimens from Tahiti, invent the new field of Anthropology. Science, at the beginning of this period, was accessible and democratic: a barely educated young man, like Humphrey Davy, was able to wrest the study of the elements from the grip of the Alchemists and properly begin the discipline of Chemistry -- no longer searching for how to transmute the impossible, Davy (et al) did simple experiments to discover what does happen. Imagine a time when that was revolutionary thinking. Imagine if there were still basic discoveries to be made in nature; discoveries waiting to be plucked like low hanging fruit.I was delighted by the intersections between Science and Literature and Philosophy; how each informed the others; how so many of these early Scientists not only rubbed elbows with the likes of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Byron, but also expressed their own amazement in well-regarded verse. This also worked in reverse, with the great poets of the age attending scientific lectures in order to learn the terminology, the great metaphors of the day -- could this possibly be happening today?This book is exhaustive, and ultimately, I found that to be…exhausting. The following is more for my own memory than part of a proper review (and as I would probably advise anyone reading this review to just end here, I'm going to hide it all as a spoiler).(view spoiler)[I was charmed by Banks in Tahiti, and appreciated all of the primary source materials that were provided (the personal letters and journals and articles that filled in the big picture, that made the age come alive), but in some later sections these additions felt gossipy and a bit pointless. My favourite part from Tahiti: On their last day they discovered an enormous stone 'marai' or funeral monument, shaped like a pyramid, some forty-four feet high and nearly 300 feet wide, with steps of superbly polished white coral down both sides. This, the 'masterpiece' of Tahitian architecture on the island, was unsettling to Banks because its construction seemed technically inexplicable. 'It is beyond belief that Indians could raise so large a structure without the assistance of Iron tools to shape their stones or mortar to join them.'Not far away was another mystery: a huge wicker man constructed of basketwork, evidently for some obscure sacrificial rite. 'The whole was neatly covered with feathers, white to represent skin and black to represent hair and tattow.' I love stuff like that, and yes, I watch Ancient Aliens: not because I believe extraterrestrials built this curious 'marai', but because I revel in the mystery of these sorts of ancient structures and monuments and that show has a new one for me every week. Because of the noted intersections with literature, I was jotting down the books I was reminded of as I was reading. For this section, it was : Jamrach's Menagerie, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Unfamiliar Fishes (and how sad to note the evolution of Captain Cook from his empathetic treatment of the Tahitians to his brutality towards the Hawaiins), Parrot and Olivier in America, Moby Dick.I enjoyed the first section on William Herschel, but again, the biographical information was simply overwhelming -- I would have much preferred a general overview of his life in Hanover before emigrating to England and found no benefit at all in the biographies of his family members other than Caroline. When the book revisited the Herchels later -- more of the same and more of the same plus the details of his marriage and family -- I was seriously bored. I suppose the fact that his son, John, went on to become a leading figure in the Victorian Age of Science explains why we must follow William to the grave, but that wasn't what I wanted from this book (which I understand is a fault of my own, not the author). Since Caroline was profoundly affected by the Lisbon earthquake, I was put in mind of Candide and also of Frankenstein (not realising this book would be quoted at great length later).I was amused by the section on ballooning, and appreciate how at the time it must have seemed like the dawn of the Jetsons with their flying cars, but since in the end it was dismissed as a fad, more suited to carnivals than scientific study, I don't know that it belonged in this book. I did like this part: Benjamin Franklin, American Ambassador in Paris, watched the launch (of the first manned balloon flight) through a telescope from the window of his carriage. Afterwards he remarked: 'Someone asked me -- what's the use of a balloon? I replied - what's the use of a newborn baby?'Obvious choices, but I was reminded of Around the World in Eighty Days and The Wizard of Oz.Age of Wonder picked up (after another dull visit with the Herchels) when it told the thrilling story of Mongo Park and his two expeditions to find the source of the Niger in Africa. While the first trip was pure adventurism, the second smacked of imperialism, and it was probably due to his own self-important beliefs that he failed to pay due respect to the local tribes and was never seen again. Literary tie-ins: Heart of Darkness (for which Park was likely the inspiration for Kurtz), and because so much of this book takes place during the Napoleonic years and the war between France and Britain, A Tale of Two Cities.Humphrey Davy was a Poet and Chemist who experimented on himself with Nitrous Oxide, like a Timothy Leary for his time, without making the leap to its use in surgery. (A later section on the mastectomy that Fanny Burney endured without benefit of anesthetic made for a harrowing reading experience, but it was one more event that I wasn't certain belonged in what I thought this book was meant to be). Davy then made the leap to the study of Galvinism, and this sparked the great debates about Vitalism and ""is there an animating principle"" -- a soul? -- in humans, the great parlour discussion topic of the time, and that led to the first inklings of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. This was interesting, but the very lengthy quoting from the book and its reception by the public and the stage play that came later -- all of this seemed beside the point to me. As was Davy's disintegrating marriage and political dealings with the Royal Academy of Science and his ""little nurse in Illyria"" -- so much biography, so little actual science. I did, however, appreciate when Davy put his mind to creating a safety-lamp for miners -- his great effort to demonstrate that science was for the benefit of mankind; theory that may be put into practise. The literary tie-ins at this point were all poetry: Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Prometheus Unbound.  (hide spoiler)]Okay, so after that long stretch of what was interesting and not so interesting to me, I return to Richard Holme's quote that I started with, the bit he actually ended with, and specifically:  Above all, perhaps, we need the three things that a scientific culture can sustain: the sense of individual wonder, the power of hope, and the vivid but questing belief in a future for the globe. How many of us have this hope and wonder? I don't know that I believe the scientists of today are imbued with hope and wonder; that they are philosophical about their work; that they have the creative souls of artists. But perhaps I'm wrong and I thank Age of Wonder for forcing me to think of Science in this way.I wanted to love this book, but it was ultimately brought down by the immensity of the information it contained -- had it left out the society news and letters from home, I might have enjoyed it much more. "
287,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23672960-brian-willis,5,"Conventional wisdom places the scientific and rational achievements of the Age of Enlightenment in direct opposition to the fundamental values of the age of Romanticism in the arts. Poetry and art exuberantly shifted from an emphasis on cold rationality and collective achievement as well as logical procedures of the calculating mind towards exploration of the sentimentality of the human spirit, the individual within the natural world, and the subconscious. In other words, the movement was from the visible (or that which could be explained through rational observation) towards explaining the invisible (the interior subjective human self, the passions, the drives, and impulses that cannot be explained through science, at least in that era).Richard Holmes, perhaps the great living biographer of the Romantic era presents us with a multi-part biography of the scientists that influenced the Romantics, but instead of playing the party line of this dialectic, he demonstrates that the Romantic Era existed INFUSED with the spirit of exploration of the science of the age. Beginning with Sir Joseph Banks, he explains the foundation of the Royal Society. Then he divides a large part of the book following and documenting the life and achievements of Sir William Herschel and Sir Humphrey Davy. Herschel made his fame discovering Uranus, but Holmes argues effectively that his development of advanced telescopes as well as a method towards cataloguing the night sky were influential for future generations. One of the unsung heroes of the book is Caroline Herschel, his sister, who actually become the first patronized and influential female astronomer. Davy expanded our knowledge of natural gases and their containment, most effectively with his staggering safety lamp for miners. Other topics discussed are the passion for tales of the exploits of explorer Mungo Park and the origination of aerial flight through hot air ballooning. Holmes ties these achievements into the ongoing saga of the leading Romantics, particularly their encounters with Coleridge, Southey, Byron, Shelley, and Keats (with Wordsworth gliding in the background and occasionally making an appearance). He points out moments in their compositions that reference the achievements of Banks, the Herschels, Davy, Park, Sadler, and many others. As the Romantics ascended, the reputation of science seems to have retroactively been placed into competition with the values of the age of Romanticism and later Victorianism. The Romantics grappled with the same issues that the scientists did however; the revelations of the cosmos and the sanctity of particles in observation of tiny objects were revealing the same troubling conclusions for both scientists and poets. If there are uncountable galaxies, is it ludicrous to think that Christ was crucified millions of times to redeem the universe? Surprisingly, this hint at atheism backfired on scientists and their reputation for years to come while Romantics with their celebration of pagan values and occasionally an atheist or two, somehow escaped the judgement of posterity though facing criticism in their time. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, inspired by the electrical current experimentation of Galvani, was interpreted as a condemnation of the limits of science (though that was not Shelley's intent).In the end, Holmes writes an incredibly enlightening and informative group biography, argues for the art of biography as a window into the discovery process of science, and demonstrates that these scientists not only created the profession of scientist but also the groundwork for the scientific method, as eventually perfected by Charles Darwin (who also makes an appearance). Another triumph from one of my favorite writers."
288,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16010931-douglass-gaking,5,"The Age of Wonder is a solid history of British scientists in the Romantic era. It focuses on the individual scientists' lives, their experiments, their writings–both personal and published–and their connections to each other.Scientists in focus include Joseph Banks, William Herschel, Michael Faraday, and even the fictional Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Each chapter is as in-depth as a biography.I especially like the chapter on William Herschel. I had not realized how close he came to our current understanding of the construction of the universe, despite being formally trained as a musician, and self-taught as a scientist.My main takeaway from this book is how imaginative these scientists were. Whether it is believing in the chemical nature of the soul or the existence of life on the moon, they had wild theories that certainly fit in with the sentiment of the Romantic era. While so many of these hypothesis proved to be false, whether in their lifetimes or later, it is the pursuit of proving them through experimentation that advanced human knowledge into the modern age."
289,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8355999-betsy,4,"This is an engrossing book about the development of science during the late 18th and early 19th century. It focuses on four individuals, Joseph Banks, (explorer and driving force behind the Royal Society for many years) Caroline and William Herschel (sister and brother astronomers) and Humphry Davy (chemist). Two things stand out from the rest for me. First, the author discussed women's roles in science and the role of Caroline Herschel in particular. She was the first woman awarded a stipend by the King for her astronomical work (albeit at half the rate a man would have received). Second, I was surprised by the strong overlap of science and poetry. Many of the scientists were published poets, including Herschel and Davy and many of the poets were also active in the sciences (Coleridge and Wordsworth among others).At almost 500 pages the book dragged in a few places, particularly when the author was describing societal trends rather than giving biographies of the various scientists and poets. But, all in all, well worth the time it took to read it."

It makes me wish I lived in the Victorian ages just so I could go here these talks on nascent principles and ideas, no matter how off they were in the long run. In my Victorian fantasies I’m super rich and, apparently, male. But just reading about these explorers, these astronomers, these scientists developing these wonderful inventions and ideas that went on to better the world … it’s heady stuff. At times the book is a bit dry, but for the most part the subject matter is so rich you get entirely wrapped up in it."
291,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25211535-rachel,4,"This is a beautifully balanced book, which reflects the subject matter perfectly. Starting with Joseph Banks, it is ideal for anyone interested in the intellectual impact of James Cook's voyages, and takes the reader onwards into the marvellous scientific discoveries of the age, through the lives of some of the discoverers (known names, but not necessarily the ones we know most about). Very enjoyable and marvellously informative."
292,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82236298-graham,5,A great book. I love the concise and highly readable way this book was written. It is a really enlightening work that brings to life such an amazing period in the history of science. I really enjoyed The Age of Wonder. The link between Science and Poetry is profound. I would recommend it to every one.

297,0007149522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24591006-april,4,"I enjoyed hearing the backstories of these famous men of science and discovery. It's enlightening to understand their motivation for their actions. The author was also very interested in literary pursuits of the scientists, analyzing and interpreting their poetry. I liked that philosophical men of science felt encouraged to write their own poetry. I don't believe that is the case very often nowadays.This was such a dense read. It took me a long time to get through it, not because it was poorly written or boring, but because there was so much information to absorb on each page. And each page was equally as interesting as it was dense.""To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling ... a soap bubble ... an apple ... a pebble ... He walks in the midst of wonders."" - John Herschel, A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1830). pg. xiii""But while Cook clung to the necessity of European forms and discipline, Banks was rather inclined to dwell on the superfluity of European needs. These were perhaps the reflections of a man who had always been used to wealth and comforts. 'From them appear how small are the real wants of human nature, which we Europeans have increasd to an excess which would certainly appear incredible to these people could they be told it. Nor shall we cease to increase them as long as Luxuries can be invented and riches found for the purchase of them; and how soon these Luxuries degenerate into necessaries may be sufficiently evincd by the universal use of strong liquors, Tobacco, spices, Tea &c. &c.'"" pg. 39""Riding between musical engagements, from one remote provincial northern town to another, often crossing over the moors alone at night, he found himself studying the panoply of stars overhead as he had done as a boy. He became well acquainted with the moon, and would later write that at this time he had intended 'to fix upon the moon for my habitation.' He also later told several tales about these lonely rides, one being how on one occasion he was reading so intently that when his horse stumbled and threw him, he somersaulted over its head and landed upright still holding his book in his hand, a perfect demonstration of the Newtonian law of 'circular motion.'"" pg. 74""Characteristically, Pilatre ignored these protests, and calmly went on telling d'Arlandes to work at feeding the brazier. He himself took off his bright green topcoat (put on for the crowd), rolled up his sleeves, and went on throwing on straw till his wooden fork broke. Once, when d'Arlandes was desperately shouting at him, 'We must go down! We must go down!,' Pilatre called back soothingly: 'Look d'Arlandes. Here we are above Paris. There's no possible danger for you. Are you taking this all in?' Many witnesses later said that they could hear the two men shouting excitedly to each other as they passed overhead. They assumed they were describing the glories of flight."" pg. 130""It was a glorious pink-and-yellow, candy-coloured balloon, thirty feet tall, and the crowd loved it. The wickerwork basket, a sort of chaise longue for two, was completely festooned with flags and bunting. Dr Charles had a full payload of scientific equipment aboard--mercury barometer (which was used as an early form of altimeter), thermometer, telescope, sand bags and several bottles of champagne."" pg. 131""Surprisingly, balloons did not appeal to the gothic novelist Horace Walpole, though perhaps at sixty-six he was a little old for such perilous novelties. He thought balloons might be sinister: 'Well! I hope these new mechanic meteors will prove only playthings for the learned and idle, and not be converted into new engines of destruction to the human race--as is so often the case of refinements or discoveries in Science. The wicked wit of man always studies to apply the results of talents to enslaving, destroying, or cheating his fellow creatures. Could we reach the moon, we should think of reducing it to a province of some European kingdom.' It was an ominous prophecy."" pg. 135To note: What we Americans call the Revolutionary War, the British call the American War of Independence. pg. 147""Ballooning added to this new awareness of the complexity and subtlety of clouds, a growing Romantic preoccupation which can be followed in the paintings of Turner and Constable, the notebooks of Coleridge and the poetry of Shelley. When Shelley refers to 'the locks of the approaching storm' in his 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819), he is using Howard's definition cirrus. 'The Cloud' (1820) demonstrates a remarkably accurate and scientific understanding of cloud formation and the convection cycle. Goethe wrote a number of essays on clouds, atmospheric pressures and weather, and translated passages of Howard, asking him to compose and send his Autobiography to Germany, and describing him as 'the first to define conceptually the airy and ever-changing forms of clouds, thus delimiting and fixing what had always been ephemeral and intangible, by accurate observation and naming.'"" pg. 160""Clouds became fascinating both as scientific phenomena--the generators of electricity, the mysterious indicators of winds and changing air pressure--and as aesthetic phenomena: the 'moods' of the sky reflecting those of the observer, alterations of light over landscape, symbols of change, destruction, regeneration. It could be argued that the Romantics actually invented the idea of 'the weather' itself, as it now preoccupies us; as well, of course, as 'inner weather.'"" pg. 160""Ballooning produced a new, and wholly unexpected, vision of the earth. It had been imagined that it would reveal the secrets of the heavens above, but in fact it showed the secrets of the world beneath. The early aeronauts suddenly saw the earth as a giant organism, mysteriously patterned and unfolding, like a living creature. For the first time the impact of man on nature was clearly revealed: the ever-expanding relationship of towns to countryside, roads to rivers, cultivated fields to forests, and the development of industry. It was comparable to the first views of the earth from space by the Apollo astronauts in the 1960s, producing a new concept of a 'single blue planet' with its delicate membrane of atmosphere. The famous photograph 'Earthrise' was taken from lunar orbit in December 1968."" pg. 161""As he grew older, Herschel was becoming a remoter figure in the household. His mind was ranging through the universe. His later papers for the Royal Society had begun to show an increasing awareness of the philosophical significance of astronomy. This was something urged upon him by his old supporter William Watson, who looked forward to conversations 'on Kant's metaphysics,' and wished to know how far Herschel agreed with the 'ground and sources' of Kant's philosophy of knowledge."" pg. 203""Already in a paper of 1802 Herschel considered the idea that 'deep space' must also imply 'deep time.' He wrote in his Preface: 'A telescope with a power of penetrating into space, like my 40 foot one, has also, as it may be called, a power of penetrating into time past ... [from a remote nebula] the rays of light which convey its image to the eye, must have been more than 19 hundred and 10 thousand--that is--almost two million years on their way.' The universe was therefore almost unimaginably older than people had previously thought. This idea of deep time was one which required a great deal of explanation to the layman."" pg. 203""Herschel continued to reach carefully towards the idea of an evolving universe, a concept as radical in its eventual implications as Erasmus Darwin's notion of evolution within plants and animals. In a late paper published in 1811, 'Astronomical Observations relating to the Construction of the Heavens,' Herschel further developed the idea . . . that all nebulae and large star clusters were at particular points in their sidereal life-cycles, which could be visually identified and catalogued almost in a Linnaean manner. Their characteristic shapes suggested distinct moments of youth, maturing and ageing."" pg. 204""It presented the universe as a living, growing, organic entity, with all nebulae belonging to one enormous extended family: 'There is not so much difference between them, if I may use the comparison, as there would be in an annual description of the human figure, were it given from the birth of a child till he comes to be a man in his prime.' This comparison is an intriguing premonition of 'time-lapse' photography, now one of the most powerful illustrative tools of modern natural history."" pg. 204-205""Physical vision--one might say scientific vision--brings about a metaphysical shift in the observer's view of reality as a whole. The geography of the earth, or the structure of the solar system, are in an instant utterly changed, and forever. The explorer, the scientific observer, the literary reader, experience the Sublime: a moment of revelation into the idea of the unbounded, the infinite."" pg. 207""At all events, it was clear that the Milky Way 'cannot last forever'; and equally that 'its past duration cannot be admitted to be infinite.' It followed that neither the earth, nor even the solar system, was a separate creation, but merely an infinitesimal part of a galactic evolution. Our galaxy had a physical beginning, and would have a physical conclusion. Our solar system, our planet, and hence our whole civilisation would have an ultimate and unavoidable end."" pg. 209""Campbell recalled that he felt he had been 'conversing with a supernatural intelligence.' Finally, Herschel completely perplexed the poet by remarking that many distant stars had probably 'ceased to exist' millions of years ago, and that looking up into the night sky we were seeing a stellar landscape that was not really there at all. The sky was full of ghosts. 'The light did travel after the body was gone.' After leaving Herschel, Campbell walked onto the shingle of Brighton beach, gazing out to sea, feeling 'evelvated and overcome.' He was reminded of Newton's observation that he was just a child picking up shells on the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay all before him."" pg. 210""It is evident that the death of his father, and all the subsequent emotional upheavals, profoundly shook the sixteen-year-old Davy, and started an intellectual ferment that never left him. Besides writing poetry, he also started his first diary, set himself reading lists and work timetables, and began a series of essays on religion versus materialism. During 1796 he wrote an essay 'On Mathematics,' and another 'On Consciousness,' which gleefully explored the implications of materialism. He described the body as 'a fine tuned Machine,' and wrote a syllogistic proof that the 'soul' could not exist, since it was said to be eternal and 'unchangeable,' while every known part of the human body, including the brain, was temporary and changed perpetually. 'QED the soul does not exist.'"" pg. 243""One of Burney's many extraordinary reflections was whether extreme physical pain could not only induce unconsciousness--'I have two total chasms in my memory of this transaction'--but actually force the soul out of the body. She also found that the act of recollection carried its own pain, and that she had taken three months to complete the account, as a letter of nearly 10,000 words to her sister Esther. She had severe headaches every time she tried to go on with it. Once finished, she could not look back over what she had written. 'I dare not revise, nor read, the recollection is still so painful.' It is an astonishing record of courage, not least in Fanny's determination to protect her husband from the trauma of the operation. But it also recalls what the real conditions of surgery were at this period."" pg. 306""But speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical ideas of Friedrich Schelling and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine, perhaps best translated as 'science mysticism,' defined the entire natural world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity as a series of 'polarities.' According to Schelling's doctrine, the whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical objects 'aspired' to become something higher. There was a 'world-soul' constantly 'evolving' higher life forms and 'levels of consciousness' in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards a higher state."" pg. 315""Davy's notebooks for this period also suggest a new pattern of philosophical speculation, almost approaching German Naturphilosophie. Some of his observations would have been recognised by Coleridge: 'The aspirations for immortality are movements of the mind similar to those which a bird makes with its wings before they are furnished with feathers.' Others were more closely tied to his laboratory work. On the subject of scientific 'analogy,' for instance, he wondered if there was a wider principle at work. 'Probably there is an analogy in all existence: the divided tail of the fish is linked in a long succession of like objects with the biped man. In the planetary system it is probable man will be found connected with a higher intellectual nature; and it is possible that the monad, or soul, is constantly undergoing a series of progressions.'"" pg. 357""In November 1827 Davy returned briefly to London to resign his presidency of the Royal Society. He later gave a moving glimpse of his disillusion with his own scientific career on this sad return: 'In my youth, and through the prime of manhood, I never entered London without feelings of pleasure and hope. It was to me as the grand theatre of intellectual activity, the field of every species of enterprise and exertion, the metropolis of the world of business, thought, and action ... I now entered the great city in a very different tone of mind, one of settled melancholy ... My health was gone, my ambition was satisfied, I was no longer excited by the desire of distinction; what I regarded most tenderly [my mother], was in the grave ... My cup of life was no longer sparkling, sweet, and effervescent ... it has become bitter.' In a wonderfully sardonic aside, Davy added that this metaphor of the 'cup of life' was scientifically derived from the chemical fermentation of 'the juice of the grape,' and then after a certain lapse of time, its oxidisation and acidification."" pg. 419""Babbage perhaps intended a sort of parable of science for the new generation. His story went as follows. When Babbage first peered carefully at the shimmering solar image projected through Herschel's prism, he could not see these dark Fraunhofer lines, though he knew they were there. Herschel then commented to him: 'An object is frequently not seen, from not knowing how to see it, rather than from any deficit in the organ of vision ... I will instruct you how to see them.' After some time spent re-examining and refocusing the image, Babbage could see them perfectly. The point was that science must always be more than the simple observation of phenomena or data. It was simultaneously a subjective training in observation skills, self-criticism and interpretation: a complete education. This was of course precisely what William Herschel had said forty years before, about learning to see with a telescope."" pg. 440Book: borrowed from the SSF Main Library."
