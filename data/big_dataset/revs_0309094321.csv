0,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is an engrossing book about how scientists are trying to answer the question, how did life begin? Robert Hazen is an active scientist in the fields of mineralogy and astrobiology. However, most of the book is about chemistry, both inorganic and organic.Emergence is a theme that extends throughout the book. Emergence is the development of complex patterns out of a simple background. Life is not just an emergent process--it is a hierarchy of multiple emergent processes that build one on top of another. Emergence is fundamental to the origin of life.The most enjoyable aspect of this book is the descriptions of detective work in the laboratory. Some of the author's laboratory experiments are described in detail, and are at times engrossing. The author's writing style is a very nice blend of casual and informative, and sometimes humorous. For example, he writes, Hat banged away at the unwieldy wrench, making a horrendous racket as he tightened the nut just a bit more for safety. ""It's always good to make a lot noise in the lab,"" he said. ""That way the director will know you're working."" There are lots of hypotheses and theories about the origin of life, and therefore lots of controversies. Many scientists have sorted themselves into various camps; those who believe in the ""primordial soup"" on the earth's surface, those who believe in life originating near super-heated vents on the ocean's bottom, or deep in the earth's interior, or even pre-biotic chemicals arriving on meteorites. There is also a lot of controversy among scientists concerning sort of a ""chicken and the egg"" problem; which came first, metabolism or genetics--or did they develop simultaneously?One of the fascinating theories described in the book is the idea first advanced by Thomas Gold in 1977. Hydrocarbons exist in the earth's mantle, and since they are lighter than the surrounding rocks, they slowly rise toward the surface. They constantly refill petroleum reservoirs. Thus, oil is a renewable source of energy! Obviously, this is a controversial theory, but it is testable. The test was to drill an oil well in solid granite, where geologists would least expect oil to be found. Such an oil well was drilled, and just barely enough oil was found to keep the theory alive, but still unproven.Another fascinating topic discussed in the book is the ""chirality"" of sugars and proteins in living organisms. Sugar molecules in living organisms are ""right-handed,"" and amino acids are ""left-handed"". Exactly why and how life developed this way is a mystery. Pre-biotic processes should develop sugars and amino acids with a 50-50 mixture of left and right handedness. Why did life select only one of these? Hazen describes some experiments that he performed, trying to solve this mystery.This is an enjoyable book to read--it has some technical jargon, but not too much. It is written authoritatively by a researcher who is deeply invested in the subject. The book contains a nice blend of theory, experiment, the stories of the scientists who are engaged in the field, and background on the many controversies that fill the topic. The field is still in its infancy--there is a long road ahead for understanding the origins of life."
1,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856764-kristen,5,"I suppose I should write a review for this book since I see one is desperately needed! Genesis is a very accessible introduction to the main theories of abiogenesis. Hazen's background is in geology, so needless to say the book tends to focus on minerals' role in the formation of life on Earth, but he provides a decent overview of all major emergence theories with very little bias. The books starts at the very beginning with the formation of complex molecules and ends with the RNA-world theory (which he doesn't really go into.) The bulk of the book focuses on the area in between, the emergence of metabolism and self-replicating systems from prebiotic chemicals and how these process possibly came together. Genesis is one of those rare popular science books that is understandable to even the most scientifically illiterate, without feeling dumbed down for those already familiar with the subject. Perhaps some of the sections describing his experiments are a bit dry but overall this was certainly the best science book I've read this year and answered many of my question regarding the origins of life. In fact this book was so accessible it made me mad because the people who would most benefit from this book won't read it. Like my evolution-denying friend (the one who once said ""if evolution is true why can't trees talk?) I've pimped this book relentlessly since it not only answers the bulk of the questions he's put to me during our drunken debates but does so in a manner far less hostile than I'm capable of. Of course he'll never read it but I'm sure all my GR buddies will love it."
2,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"""Minerals to the rescue...clay is the answer"" - now that is my kind of book. It is not very often that I read a book from someone as close to my professional field of expertise as this (he is a mineralogist which is close to whatever I am - I'm still working that out). We may have even met at one point. However, I don't think my enjoyment of this book was due to my familiarity with some of the author's science - I think it is written in a way that would enable a broad audience to engage with what is a fascinating question: how did life emerge from mere chemistry?The book covers three broad topics regarding emergence of pre-cellular life: how did bio molecules such as amino acids form; how did macromolecules form; how did replication begin. We have some clues, especially in the latter case, by working backwards from what we currently know about dna, etc. In the former cases though, a more bottom up approach is needed in order to work out how, and indeed whether plausible reactions could take place to generate the organic materials now so familiar in living organisms. Hazen has been personally involved in some of these experiments, looking in particular at the hydrothermal origins hypothesis, making the personal reflections a nice addition. Likewise, his descriptions of the experimental a methods and fancy equipment are authentic and do not suffer from the patronizing over-simplification many popular science writers employ to pamper their audience.Despite the huge advances made in organic geochemistry (I had the opportunity to visit a local lab while I was reading this to discuss their investigations as they relate to ore formation), I get the impression there are still many unsolved questions in this field. Hence, it makes good reading, as it allows me to ponder my own questions - such as whether DNA is the only option for replication and life. As with a recent read on mitochondria, the mere existence of advanced life, whether by accident or design, is remarkable and humbling. Further to the compelling topic, the book is written in a compelling style - if you've got this far in my review you should not hesitate to give the book a read also!"
3,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,5,"What a wonderful book. My only regret is that I only recently discovered it. Wish I'd read it when it first came out.An alternate subtitle could have been: ""War of the Worlds"" as the author takes the reader on a journey through the competing theories of the origin of life on Earth. There is the Iron-Sulfide World, The Lipid World, the Thiolester World, the RNA World, the PAH World; the ""Ventists"" vs. the ""Tide Poolists""; the Metabolizers vs. the Gene Machines, etc. Regardless, of which theory one favors, the comparisons are fascinating.In the last 50 years the number of origin of life researchers has exploded and the theories and discoveries are coming fast and furious. In some ways, they (including the author) must be having some of the same feelings that Darwin had as he came closer and closer to piecing together his Theory of Natural Selection to explain evolution. He was torn between wanting to make sure he had it right on one hand, and the fear of being beaten to the finish by someone else on the other, as was nearly the case with Alfred Russell Wallace.For anyone interested in fantastic overview of origins research, I highly recommend this book."

5,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15847575-marc-oliver,5,"Such a wonderful book! I love everything origin-of-life-related, but this one is truly exceptional. Hazen explains different theories on the origin of life with their strengths and weaknesses, It’s so interesting to learn about the different points of view and the underlying chemistry. I only regret that I didn’t find this gem earlier."
6,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875081-arvind-balasundaram,5,"While several books have been written on the topic of evolution, very few have dealt head-on with the issue of the origin of life on our planet, a necessary precursor to natural selection and of evolution itself. As Carl Sagan elegantly summarized in 1961: ""It is evident that once a self-replicating, mutating molecular aggregate arose, Darwinian natural selection became possible and the origin of life can be dated from this event. Unfortunately, it is this event about which we know the least.""In this splendid thesis, minerals expert and exobiologist, Robert Hazen, takes on this difficult task. Early in the book, he establishes the notion of ""emergence"" as a necessary corollary to ""entropy"". The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy (and consequently, the disorder in the universe) must increase. But how, Hazen asks, does the astonishing level of emergent complexity also arise amidst this constant state of flux?In addressing this question, Hazen brings to the fore the science of emergence - how do complex systems develop, and how do they display novel collective behaviors based on the interactions of fundamentally dissimilar components? He traces several lines of scientific investigation that attempt to explore how our planet may have progressed from non-life to the first living cell. How did basic chemical elements like hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen ultimately form complicated sugars, proteins, amino acids, and eventually complex nucleotides like RNA and DNA that ultimately established a human footprint in the evolution story? How did lipids and cell membranes form, thus enabling the first structures to regulate drastically different environments inside and outside a cell, thereby helping establish some semblance of order between wildly different acidic and alkaline states that dominated early earth? Did this happen spontaneously or was it dependent on the prebiotic soup of chemical elements that existed billions of years ago before life formed? Did life need the vast oxygen at the surface, or did it originate in the hydrothermal vents deep in the ocean's crust? What came first - genetics or metabolism, did molecules first learn to self-replicate and then generate energy for survival, or the other way around?This is a marvelous work of science, a dazzling account of a cadre of scientists tackling one of the most profound questions about our existence, and in a manner that is entirely Popperian (i.e. a theory must make testable predictions that might be proved false by empirical tests). Hazen uncovers the world of the primordial, and does it with a verve that almost makes the reader yearn to get into a submersible to go collect prehistoric Archea samples from a deep-ocean volcanic vent for some origin-of-life hypotheis testing of their own. One comes away wondering whether the simultaneous existence of entropy and emergence on our planet is the reason why so many religions like those of the Book as well as the Eastern faiths like Hinduism represent Godhead as simultaneously a Creator and Destroyer? Go figure, and while pondering, don't miss this wild excursion of 250-odd pages... "
7,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924813-dan,5,Very good overview. A little dated by now (2017).
8,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26573870-feisty-harriet,3,"I think I bit off a little more than I could chew with this one. There is a LOT of chemistry in this book, and my 10th grade non-honors, non-AP class was not nearly enough for me to easily follow most of the chemical reactions, processes, and names of derivatives of elements, atoms, etc. Honestly, lots of this went over my head. However, after skimming a few paragraphs that I just couldn't understand, I did come across some fantastic gems that seem to be written more for a lay audience. Hazen is arguing for what process generated the first living one-cell organisms...and/or the amino acids that those organisms require...and/or the process of metabolism that supports those acids, etc etc etc. Some of the experiments that Hazen describes are fascinating, and the stuff that scientists are able to determine in both a tiny test tube, and by studying millions and millions of years old fossils and samples is absolutely astounding. If you are a science nerd or an armchair chemist, I think you might actually really enjoy this book. (I liked it, but also felt like I needed to enroll in a basic Organic Chemistry course and then re-read.)"
9,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18664695-daniel,4,"Hazen is simply terrific. This is an engaging book about the process of scientific inquiry. His enthusiasm for discovery is palpable on every page. Incredibly, I can't wait to learn more about chemistry! And the Epilogue is a surprising treat, a brief heartfelt philosophical essay on the potency of human intention and kindness. Check this out this beautiful closing passage, in a book about SCIENCE, no less:""This dramatic contrast provides a metaphor for our own lives. Some people choose the paths of hate, war, intolerance, destruction, and chaos to hasten the triumph of entropy -- the dark side of the universe. By contrast, most people use their energies to foster emergence -- to build cities, feed the hungry, create art, heal the sick, promote peace, and add to human joy and well-being in countless other ways, both large and small. What awesome power each of us holds to do good or ill; a single cutting insult, a single winning smile. Perhaps therein lies life's meaning and value.""Read this book and winning smiles are bound to follow."
10,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33816676-lara,3,"Although this book is ten years old it has a lot of information that seems like it would still be valuable, and it's the only book about origins of life research that I have come across. I really like how this book includes a wide variety of theories, information about procedures in the lab, and personal stories about the scientists. It covers many different interesting topics such as emergence of complexity, chirality, and roles minerals may have played in the origins of life. It took me a while to get through this book, but the knowledge I gained from it was worth the effort. "
11,0309094321,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17447150-barry,4,"In the process of re-reading carefully.What i like is that Hazen is exploring Chemistry at the origins of life from all possible angles, under all possible conditions, not just the usual laboratory aqueous chemistry. He shot a bullet full of organic molecules at a wall to see what reactions would happen under those temperatures and pressures. Life like chemistry might have happened in all sorts of unlikely places.touching obituary for Stephen J. Gould also.We're getting there"

While the author, himself a noted astrobiologist, has his own inclinations, he is remarkably fair-minded towards all.
