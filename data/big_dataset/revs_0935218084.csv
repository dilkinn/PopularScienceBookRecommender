Post-graduation and I still feel the same way.It is a fun book full of practical yet out-of-the box physics MCQ type mini challenges. The humorous writing style makes it easy to comprehend different (and sometimes complex) physics concepts. It is suitable for anybody who is interested in physics, and does not require an aptitude in mathematics to understand the solutions - in fact, there was barely any math in it at all! I consider this book to be one of those essential and timeless “fun” physics books that should be on the shelf of physics students and teachers. Buy it! Trust me, you won’t regret it!"

This book is just an intuitive overview of various areas of physics, such as momentum, light, and particles, given through virtually math-free multiple-choice questions with thorough explanations of the answers. If you read it, I recommend you follow the author's advice and try to have both an answer in mind and an explanation for why you think it's right before reading the explanation. Otherwise, it's too easy to let hindsight bias tell you you already knew the answer when you really didn't.The parts I already had a firm grasp on were entertaining and made me think about them a little differently. The parts I didn't have a good intuitive understanding of, e.g. transfer of kinetic energy, the trade-off of time and speed, etc., it helped way more than the lists of equations you usually see. I wish I'd known about this book and read it when I was in high school. As good as it was, I admit there were some parts I read and reread and thought about and then reread again and still didn't get."
2,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4377693-pvw,5,"Without using mathematical formulas, Epstein and Hewitt explain fundamental concepts of physics. They do so in a question-answer structure and encourage the reader to ponder the problem intensely, before checking the solution. Generally, each page contains one question and the answer on the back once you flip it.Illustrated with simple but clarifying drawings, the book looks a lot simpler than it actually is. In fact, many solutions are surprisingly counter-intuitive and certainly not easy. But that is what the authors want to teach: to think rationally, like a physicist, instead of following false intuitions or common misconceptions.This is the book you would want to have read at fourteen. But believe me, even at a later age it is challenging and entertaining!"
3,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2049727-omar,3,"Had some fun reading this, although to the lay-minded person some of the answers will not make sense...Like the 3 bergs question...lol"
4,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35914958-reinhardt,4,"A great book to think through a high school physics course (or college course for that matter). It covers the same areas a physics textbook would cover in the same order, but in an entirely question-answer format, or I should say, question-explanation.The questions are carefully thought out to provide illuminating examples. The explanations aim to create a true understanding of the physics behind the math. There is no math in this book, are almost none.It is particularly good in the mechanics, kinematics, dynamics section - the 'real world' kind of physics that you can visualize. Once it gets into electromagnetics, and God help us, quantum mechanics and relativity, common sense is an impediment to understanding. It still offers illuminating explanations, but you really need some physics background to wade into that territory.It ends with a several page long ""Get-Off-My-Lawn"" rant that is both funny and mostly true, but out of place in a physics book. He seems to be under the impression that if physicists ran the world, all would be well. It's all those dang humanities majors. He makes a swack of valid complaints, but the solution is not to turn the world over to scientists."
5,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46773945-julia,5,"I have to say stright up that there were things I did not understand, probably the consequence of a poor education system or maybe I'm just not too bright. Nonetheless the book is amazing. It explains phenomena in physics in such a poignant and descriptive way that it all starts to make much more sense. I think I loved his comparisons most of all. His ELI5 technique is amazing. I felt like my inner child finally understood a lot of what I should have learned 10-15 years ago. I really do recommend reading it as early as possible because it can cultivate a love for science that will probably stick around for the rest of your life. I wish just one of my Physics teachers tried to explain with such care at least a portion of what Epstein talks about in the book. It was as if I was talking to a real person and this person was patient and well spoken. It feels like a child's book and at the same time it also feels like there needn't be an age limit at all. The main purpose is to deliver an understanding about our world and our universe. Can't recommend it enough."
6,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85142103-derek-schlenker,5,Great read for someone with a non-technical background looking for a way to understand how the world is working around them. Also a fun book for those with a physics background to apply theory to the real world - Something my education sometimes did a poor job of doing. Don't read it end to end. Just read up on topics you are interested in. 
7,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7927438-chris,5,This is an exceptional book for learning and teaching physics. It makes learning physics fun. The book introduces the material of a first year course in high-school but makes it accessible for self-learning in the form of questions with cartoons which stimulate thought followed by explanations.
8,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77163370-angelina,3,"Though, I rated it 3 stars I thought it was in between 3-4 because it was a great book however reading it took a long time. This book has a lot of information, and it includes the fundamentals of physics and different aspects of physics such as Quantum, Mechanics, Atomic, Astronomic etc."
9,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58409235-paul,3,"A question-and-answer introduction to physical phenomena: mechanics, fluids, electromagnetism, relativity, and light. Enjoyable but a bit uneven, too much time is spent on the earlier mechanics stuff."
10,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16663048-dominik,5,One of the most important books I've ever read.
11,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25277520-eryk-banatt,3,"A bunch of physics intuition building questions. Would be more effective to read through with an SRS open next to me, plan on rereading it soonish"
12,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61944986-kalman,5,Great for learning how to think about Physics intuitively.
13,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7389775-phillias,5,superb. good intro with material aplenty to grok any topic .
14,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103556335-darth-weider,0,Very good!
15,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69913881-nafie-sholihah,0,i think it reveals good example of physics reality
16,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,4,"A very good conceptual overview of elementary physics with many clear explanations of why, for example, a fluorescent light bulb is more efficient than an incandescent one (the same reason striking a bell produces a clear note, but striking a box packed with bells doesn't). My wife's son wanted some book about ""mechanics"", and I thought this is as good as anything. Like Paul Hewitt, the author of a much more expensive book on conceptual physics, Lew Epstein teaches at the City College of San Francisco; in the afterword he rants about politicians who waste taxpayers' money, tells who is and who is not a good Jew, and reproduces his letters to Mickey Kantor (whose name he misspells) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi about South Koreans pirating his book."
17,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1259661-alex-rajala,5,"My edition has a different subtitle, ""Practical Lessons in Critical Thinking"". Either way, Epstein has a gift to make the physical world understandable. Don't be scared off by the topic; each page is a little story of its own, and there are cartoons! The format presents an interesting fact situation and tests the reader's sense of what would happen. It reminds me of good mystery novels, where all the facts are in front of the reader yet the conclusion often remains for the ace detective to reveal. This is one of the best science books I have read."
18,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891132-jared,5,"Awesome book! Packed full of questions that intrigue the mind and are well-explained without the use of mathematics (or very little). Even for a physics grad, he explains things in ways that are very fundamental and poses questions that make you think about things from a different perspective on a very fundamental level. This book will sharpen your critical thinking skills and give you valuable physical insights into the world we live in. Everyone should own this book!"
19,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18877434-ur-salem,1,"WHAT AN IDIOT ""SCIENTIST"" !!!!!1. check page 81, jogging !! The author has no idea what he is talking about; and he answers falsely on the preposterous thought-experiment model he himself has introduced!!!!!!!!!!2. oh dear Lord! He cannot even differentiate between wave propagation direction and field polarization on p.469 !!!!!!!!"
20,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4319316-charlotte,4,I started reading this book in September 2010 and haven't got around to finishing it. I have a bad habit of doing that with books.
21,0935218084,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22200093-andreas-gkaston,3,Really good and helpful book . Helped me with my exams
