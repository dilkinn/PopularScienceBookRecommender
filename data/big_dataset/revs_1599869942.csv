Tesla has always seemed to me someone who existed in a space between our world and another unfathomable place, brought here by a glitch in dimensions or something. This loose memoir confirms my suspicions :). And not only because of passages like this: ""I had a brother who was gifted to an extraordinary degree; one of those rare phenomena of mentality which biological investigation has failed to explain. His premature death left my earth parents disconsolate."" No, it's also how differently he thought about inventing and engineering than everyone else. It's not particularly well-written in the standard sense (and my copy, at least, was ATROCIOUSLY edited). But that's not really what it's about anyway. It's about getting the chance to spend time with a quirky genius. "

He is very strange, intelligent, and someone far ahead of his time. In this book, Tesla tells all about what goes on in his head, which sometimes is very weird. He tells about his life, how his inventions came to him, and how his inventions helped save his life. He tells his encounters with famous people, his brush with death which was more than once, and future ideas.If he could only know how much his inventions have changed the world he would be so happy. He died poor and alone. We can do so much now because of him and few realize that. Good book.He also looks like what my grandfather looked like when he was young..:)The narrator sounds like what I would picture Telsa would sound like. He was wonderful!"

Sadly this book is ""too"" small and he just gives us a very brief glimpse of his inventions and ideas. I did not know many things about him before reading this book like: Tesla was involved in wireless research, Marconi actually stole the Radio idea from Tesla. I always related Tesla with alternating current and did not know that he was into wireless as well.I also liked that his main intention for inventing something was not to get applause or make money. He did all the hard work only for the betterment of the society. I admire him for his ideas to unite the world using wireless, using aerial machines as he calls them that revolve around the Earth.""Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races... There is in fact but one race, of many colors.""He was way ahead of his time and people did not encourage many of his brilliant ideas, which is really sad. They thought his ideas were too unpractical(he even mentions that people laughed at his ideas). But we now see those ideas were realistic since many of them have been implemented in real life.Even though he was a scientist, he strongly believed in God!I watched a movie sometime back about Tesla - ""The Secret of Nikola Tesla(Tajna Nikole Tesla)"". This movie went into the details about his life. I did not know about his involvement with Niagara project until I watched this video. Edison thought he was the ""father of electricity"" and couldn't tolerate another man coming up with a better form of electricity (Alternating current by Tesla). He never cared for money and he gave all his money to Westinghouse without thinking twice.Do watch it if you are interested in learning more about this man's inventions.Check this link for more details about his work:  Oatmeal's article about Tesla"

I cannot describe my extreme delight out of performing his experiments at home. And I am so delighted to read this book, because it surprisingly made me have a more profound understanding of his life and how he faced several breakdowns just because he was so ahead of his time. ""War can not be avoided until the physical cause for its recurrence is removed and this, in the last analysis, is the vast extent of the planet on which we live. Only through annihilation of distance in every respect, as the conveyance of intelligence, transport of passengers and supplies and transmission of energy will conditions be brought about some day, insuring permanency of friendly relations. What we now want most is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth, and the elimination of that fanatic devotion to exalted ideals of national egoism and pride which is always prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife. No league or parliamentary act of any kind will ever prevent such a calamity. These are only new devices for putting the weak at the mercy of the strong. """
4,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Read this on Graham's recommendation, and it was *fascinating* to hear it from the man himself. Tesla was famous for inventing alternating current (AC), which is used in every house and electric motor today. He was a famous scientist of his time, and supposedly there was some rift with him and Edison. It appears actually that Tesla sold his patents and the company that bought them sued everyone else, causing his name to be associated with the suits, even though he wasn't really involved. Tesla is also known for being a little too eccentric later in his career, trying to invent things that were impossible like wireless power.I found this book a really good read, because Tesla is a character, and not a bad writer! He tells a lot of stories of his childhood, which were a very interesting glimpse into a great mind.One part I liked was when Tesla was expounding on his personal philosophy of health, or 'focusing on himself'. He was frequently ill and overworked, and had to spend a lot of time working on his health. At one point he says of coffee and tea ""These delicious beverages superexcite and gradually exhaust the fine fibers of the brain. They also interfere seriously with arterial circulation and should be enjoyed all the more sparingly as their deleterious effects are slow and imperceptible."" He then goes on to say ""The truth about this is that we need stimulants to do our best work under present living conditions, and that we must exercise moderation and control our appetites and inclinations in every direction."" I think this is my new philosophy.Tesla was also a believer that he who works harder will be successful. As someone who is starting a company (Goodreads), I'm starting to have a big appreciation for those who can believe in an idea against all odds, when everyone else believes it can't be done. It takes a special kind of person - one driven by passion in their ideas. Tesla's work schedule from college is also inspiring - he would work in the lab from 10am until 5am the next day. I've often heard lots of genius's haven't needed much sleep - I wish I could do that!"
5,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2317195-jerry-travis,4,"This has been very, very interesting. A book written by an undisputed genius in his very own words.I must say this book was a surprise. I was expecting lots of technical detail, but instead the book was filled with lots of interesting stories and insightful social comment. Some of the stories were even hilarious, causing me to laugh out loud a number of times.The book also gives some insight into what it's like to be a genius, and some of the abilities such a person possesses. For instance, drawing on a blackboard bored Nikola because he could draw things in his mind that were as real to him as if they were written down in the physical world. Indeed, later in life he used this ability to design a number of his inventions, and once constructed in the real world they worked the very first time since he had already tested them out - in his mind!Tesla also suffered from frail health most of his life, having several near death experiences. After one of these, he chronologically recalled in full detail his entire life from the time he was a baby in his mother's arms up to his present over a period of years - as if he was reliving everything.There are a number of social observations towards the end of the book that are still relevant to our time. Written during the Prohibition (1920-1933), Tesla foresaw a time when entire cities would be destroyed in an instant, and our only hope for peace was a global communication and transport system.My only disappointment in the man is that he was quite a determinist, to such an extent that he would have made B.F. Skinner proud. Still, for someone who single-handed invented our entire AC power grid and succeeded in promoting it over the objections of Edison, he was a genius of the sort that the world seldom sees."
6,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20772420-afkham,4,"Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a genius inventor, engineer, physicist, and futurist best known for designing of AC electricity supply system. He first caught my attention (of course as an engineer I had studied about the IS unit of the strength of a magnetic field named after him) in Nolan’s movie “the prestige” in which he was pictured as a kind of magician who could easily duplicate a cat or magically light wireless lamps. I wanted to know more about him and now reading his autobiography I find him as a naturally talented genius with a bit of vanity but otherwise brilliant. In the book, he mostly talked about himself, his family and friends and generally more human topics than scientific ones. He manifested his early sparkles of innovation and described his incentives and aims. He also told us about some of his magnificent inventions in details. He had ideas about future, as well and predicted a good deal of occurrences meticulously.He predicted a great scientific advance in which some of his inventions will be the basis: The Tesla Transformer, The Magnifying Transmitter, The Tesla Wireless System, The Terrestrial Stationary Waves which will result in many things he predicted amongst which are internet, wireless phones, GPS and many other phenomena so usual for us. He described his works too far ahead of time and thought that the world wasn’t ready for them.He is the most important and effective inventor of the 20th century. He was also new-fashioned in many ways as he was anti-racist, vegetarian and …“Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races, and we are still far from this blissful realization, because few indeed, will admit the reality that God made man in His image in which case all earth men are alike. There is in fact but one race, of many colors. Christ is but one person, yet he is of all people, so why do some people think themselves better than some other people?”"

I wish he would have written a book earlier on and since this was written in his late sixties and is very short, readers are left wanting more. Among many other astounding inventions, including building an AC motor, he came up with the concept of wireless communication in the 1890's!!! I was heartbroken when I read he died alone in a hotel room in poverty due to crooks like Edison and Westinghouse. Great read! I recommend it to anyone. "

9,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891901-amanda,4,"I decided to flip through the pages of My Inventions after my dad enthusiastically described how engineers at McMaster university, following Tesla’s principles, had powered a fan using electricity that was transmitted wirelessly from one mini tower to another.Lacking a technical background, I didn’t think the book would capture my interest; but I was hooked from the very first page. Not only does Tesla share some unique observations of the world and his mind, such as his self-preserving device and his ideas on the automatism of life, (which I’m still trying to wrap my head around), but many of his anecdotes cracked me up—harnessing the energy of June-bugs, the 5 men it took to place a light bulb, posing as Steve Brodie...and so many more.I just wish he had elaborated on certain events!For instance, I thought it interesting that he suddenly recovered from cholera after his dad promised to allow him to study engineering, or was it the peculiar bean that did the trick? And what bean was that?I also wanted to know what led to his nervous breakdown. Was it the result of having the pursuit of his passion interrupted? And how did his friend assist him, I wondered, when Tesla wrote:“Can anyone believe that so hopeless a physical wreck could ever be transformed into a man of astonishing strength and tenacity, able to work thirty-eight years almost without a day’s interruption, and find himself strong and fresh in body and mind? Such is my case. A powerful desire to live and continue the work and the assistance of a devoted friend and athlete accomplished the wonder.” And why did he not provide more details on the never-completed “World System”? Did it simply not work? Was it too expensive? Or, as some sources suggest, did the financiers withhold their funds for the same reason they resisted his bladeless turbines? When they discovered that Tesla’s invention might not only transmit signals, sound, and images, but also electricity, did they not like the fact that it would render worthless the existing electrical infrastructure? And how would they meter electricity that was transmitted wirelessly?So I’m left with the question, could Nikola Tesla have “wirelessly electrified the entire earth”? From what I’ve heard, it’s only a matter of time (and completing the Maxwell equations) before his dream is finally realized.A fascinating read that leaves me wanting to know more."

He traveled to America to make the world a better place, but America always makes sure to grind down anyone that cares for the betterment of humanity. He wanted to make free wireless electricity for the whole world, designed a laser powerful enough to destroy anything (he destroyed his design because he didn't believe humans could use it wisely), he game up with a lot of war patents that belong to the US today, came up for the idea of a phone in the early 1900's, automaton, the X-ray, the radio, the remote control, the induction motor, the light bulb ...In 1884, Tesla was hired by Thomas Edison and was told that ""there was $50,000 in it for him"" if he could redesign Edison's inefficient motor and generators. When Tesla did so, Edison laughed and said, ""Tesla, you don't understand our American sense of humour"".so schools teaches us shit,Tesla was a great man deserves more praise than he gets.

12,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"I didn't think it was possible for me to love Tesla more than I already had. After reading his thoughts in his own words, I feel that, in some way, I know him now and certainly love him all the more for every page. My favorite part of the book was Tesla's ranting about the wireless. Its potential was so clear to him. Freeing ourselves from wires, and harnessing the waves in the air around us, would not only lead to advances in technology that were at that time unimaginable, but for Tesla, wireless meant that we could finally connect everyone in the world. According to Tesla, wires meant we could only connect to our small area (unless we went to great pains to bury wires under the ocean floor, which we did-- and still it had constraints), but wireless means we can connect to anyone, anywhere in the world. If we can connect so readily to other cultures, Tesla reasoned, then we can understand other cultures. Once we understand and stop subscribing to ingroup and outgroup thinking, we can finally attain peace. Tesla suggested, as do many people in our current day, that when anyone in any part of the country can connect to any other part of the country and gain knowledge from that, the weakest groups will gain power and not be dependent on the powerful as much as they are now. He saw not only an end to wires but an end to ignorance and war. In reading this, I felt as if I really understood the mind of Tesla. What it all boiled down to was always solving the distance problem. What I mean by that is that in figuring out AC (to replace DC) and in trying to figure out wireless, Tesla overcame the constraints caused by physical wires that are held in place, constrained to one physical area. In the case of DC (Edison, in his limited vision, was a fan of direct current) every house was required to have their own generator because DC will only travel so far. When AC came along, cities could have one generator that supplies the multitudes of houses (like we have now in our society). Wires, whether vertical or buried under ground, are limited to where the physical wires are. With wireless, the signal can be sent to far more tethering spots (towers or even smartphones and tablets in every home!). In each case, the signal can reach far beyond a wire, solving the distance problem. Sadly, Tesla could not develop the wireless in the way he wanted to. It was too new of an idea and even the experts, according to Tesla, could not see its value. This caused him great anguish. Other parts of the book were more amusing to me than profound. Early in the book I had to laugh hardily because I had just finished reading another author's take on his nervous breakdown and then I read Tesla's own take on it. It seems to me that inventing is similar to childbirth not only in that the inventor brings something new into the world, but also because there can be amnesia for the pain of the birthing process. It is often said, and I believe it to be true, that many women only have more than one child because they selectively forget the negative aspects of pregnancy and child birth and magnify their memories of the positive aspects.After reading Tesla's description of his life, I was dumbfounded. The reality is that Tesla had a mental breakdown following his work on attempting to invent the wireless telephone*, in the 1800s no less. The breakdown was so severe, Tesla was in bed for months and suffered complete amnesia for the entirety of his past, including the knowledge of how to invent anything at all. Yet looking back in his autobiography, Tesla wrote that even though many people who work have to sacrifice their life-energy, he had never had to make such sacrifices, stating, ""On the contrary, I have thrived on my thoughts.""It seems his amnesia was not just limited to those months in bed. He had selective amnesia for what seems to be the remainder of his life. He loved his inventions, and the inventing process, so much that he magnified the positive aspects, feeling a swelling of involuntary love, while seeming to completely forget the absolute torment it caused him at times.I had heard about Tesla's visions and delusions but hadn't appreciated them fully until hearing his own take. He said the people he imagined were as real to him as any real person. People portray him as non-social. It seems he was very social, with the envisioned people who visited him regularly. He made it extremely clear though, that he understood full well that the visions of people and things were not real. He held disdain for those who believed in the paranormal, which I found so interesting considering the fact that he had constant visions. I am still trying to understand how he could have such a firm grip on reality. One funny story he related about psychics goes as follows. Men in powerful positions from the ford company came to visit him. They told him how impressed they were that everything he had predicted had come true. He was elated and wondered if they were there to talk about his inventions, invest in them, or even use his turbine engines in their cars. Alas, when asked how he could be of assistance, they said they were starting a psychological society that focused on psychic phenomenon and said he would be an extremely valuable asset to them. He said, ""These gentlemen never knew how close they were to being fired out of my office!""It seems as though he spent his life trying to control his visions. He said he controlled most visions but could never control the bright light and fire visions he had. Those sounded like seizures to me. He also said he could simply visualize equations. It seems far more than merely possible that Tesla had synesthesia. The neurons in brain seems to have been not only hyper connected, as is the case in synesthesia, but connected in such a way that it caused high output but then short circuiting, causing a seizure. How I wish his brain were around to study. "

The early 20th century was not ready for his genius. His biggest inventions (The Tesla Transformer, The Magnifying Transmitter, The Terrestrial Stationary Waves, The Tesla Wireless System) were the basis of many huge phenomena we're familiar with like the Internet, AC current, Wi-Fi and GPS. He knew his works were way ahead of his time yet he kept working hard to pursue his visions towards a better life. He's lead a very strange life and survived many near-death experiences thanks to what he described as flashes of light helping him think his way out of death's claws. The unexplainable flashes of light also interfered with the peculiar way he conducted his experiments.  ""These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time, as when a new idea opening up possibilities strikes me, but they are no longer exciting, being of relatively small intensity. When I close my eyes I invariably observe first, a background of very dark and uniform blue, not unlike the sky on a clear but starless night. In a few seconds this field becomes animated with innumerable scintillating flakes of green, arranged in several layers and advancing towards me. Then there appears, to the right, a beautiful pattern of two systems of parallel and closely spaced lines, at right angles to one another, in all sorts of colors with yellow-green and gold predominating.""   Did Tesla have visions from the future? Because this is exactly what AutoCAD or any other Computer-Aided design software does. As I started reading this, I expected it to be riddled with technical descriptions of his works, but to my surprise, Tesla talked about his childhood, his family and friends and his adventures. In the beginning he mentioned having an extraordinarily gifted brother who died as a child, which got me thinking what would the world as we know it be like with two living Teslas instead of one. "

The introduction by Ben Johnston very helpfully dispels some of the common mythology about Tesla with very specific information about how it was created. ""The pressure of occupation and the incessant stream of impressions pouring into our consciousness thru all the gateways of knowledge make modern existence hazardous in many ways. Most persons are so absorbed in the contemplation of the outside world that they are wholly oblivious to what is passing on within themselves.""""When natural inclination develops into a passionate desire, one advances towards his goal in seven-league boots."""

As the title suggests, his inventions play a major part in every chapter, he works out the idea that existed in his mind as it came to fruition. Looking at how he saw through things, how he experienced situations was such an eye opener. Throughout his book, my respect for Mr. Tesla only went higher and higher. This is the sort of book one must read repeatedly.

26,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46327507-andix,3,"- the book is based on 5 articles Tesla published in a technical journal (Electrical Experimenter)- 1856-1943, born in Croatia, in a Serbian family. His father was an orthodox priest with a military education, he was also a man of vast reading and a spirited writer. His mother was a highly energetic woman and kept together the household (she used to plant seeds, grow the plants and turn them to fabric and clothes and had built the furniture in the house) and she used to invent tools to make her work easier.- as a kid, his father used to make him play mind exercises to improve his memory and reasoning- during childhood he was stricken by repeated episodes of hallucinations, which made him feel anxious. His self taught remedy consisted on intense focus on a close by object and in constructing a scenario about travelling to unknown places. This helped later his imagination in visualizing an object from every angle and in shaping mentally an idea into a device. When coming up with an idea, he first imagined the construct and made mentally the first calibrations and optimizations until the model was flawless and only then he would start building it. He concluded that this mechanism never failed to bring optimal results- his father had a vast library, but he would not let him read, he even confiscated the candles used for reading. This made young Tesla build fuses and cast his own candles- originally he was left handed, but later ambidextrous- after finishing highschool, he had contracted cholera and had to stay in bed for 9 months. The illness convinced his father to let him study engineering and not religion- after university, he moved to Budapest for his first job in a telegraphy company. He helped launching and improving the telephone main station. Later on he moved to Paris to work in an electrical company where he had come up and implemented multiple solutions - he moved to NY to work for Edison, but quits after a while- in 1886 he perfected the voltaic arc, to be used at street lighting- in 1887 he founded his own company, Electrical Company- biggest inventions: Tesla coil, AC distribution system, the fluorescent bulb, radio, remote control (proved in 1889 on a model boat), electric motor (1930), wireless communications and wireless electricty"

It boggles the mind.He seemed to have held no ill will towards J. P. Morgan, contrary to what the media propagated during his time and even now.And he wasn't much of a loner either. Well, not until the time of his writing this memoir.Did he just predict and invent drones in his mind nearly 100 years ago?He does go into some detail about his machines, including the infamous creation that could provide wireless energy around the globe.Tesla doesn't seem like anyone except a man fully intent on discovering and inveting ways to ensure a better future for the world.

I do wish he would describe his inventions on a deeper detail but nevertheless, this book is still rewarding."
31,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"One word come to mind when I think of this book, and that's: vain. This is the first book on Tesla that I've read. I've been interested in learning about him for some time, and figured reading his autobiography would be a good start. While it was interesting to read about the man from the man, he is by all account a very vain name. I'm not sure if this narcissistic attitude towards what his perceived talents is what made Tesla stand out from the others inventors of his time, but I was half expecting him to say he was infallible halfway through the book. Again, I am not criticizing the man or his inventions, just the style or writing he chose to represent himself to the public at large.There isn't much more I can add to this review. The book itself was pretty sparse, glancing over subjects with little elaboration. Even when he talks about his greatest accomplishments, there's little content provided on the topic itself, but instead focus was place on what Tesla perceived to be his unique talents and how that helped him achieve that particular goal."

Another interesting part is that sometimes you can see an antithesis, the man who was so ahead of his time, was also pretty much a man of his time when it came to some specific social issues. "

38,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92215311-lee-m-williams,0,More inventions were credited to him than he speaks of in his book. He spends most of the book's focus on his 'radiating' the world's atmosphere with free energy. I hoped for more from this book and got less. I did learn he loved to work from 10 am all day to 5 am the next day. And that he loved to keep this schedule until his body and mind crashed from exhaustion. What a surprise!
39,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90287556-lourens,4,"Fascinating, even 100 years after it was originally published. (1919) I'd divide this short read in three parts:1. Tesla's self-reflection, consisting of his development from an unusual child to an accomplished inventor. He is not humble, but that is not the point. He knows that he is 'a genius' and tries to find explanations why, and does so convincingly. 2. His career as an inventor. Sometimes difficult to see what statements are still valid today, and which have been nuanced or disproven. Don't expect a comprehensible guide through his discoveries, rather a summation of how he came to them and what their purposes are. Big part is about his never completed world system, which Tesla had immense expectations of. 3. The last few pages shine some light on his life philosophy. His deterministic world view and how to act with this knowledge. The nature of war and how it will be changed by technology, for better and for worse. Some eerily accurate predictions, even if they were eventually accomplished with different means than Tesla thought. It should be noted that this division into three parts is not that clear-cut, but it is the core subject-matter of this short but information-dense read. "

41,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,3,"Very short, and with its abrupt ending it feels unfinished. Parts of the book do not age well, for example Tesla's political digressions. Other parts age better. For example, over a century later, it is now easy to forgive Tesla's enormous ego. Tesla was eager to claim credit for everything, and found it impossible to admit that he could ever be wrong. This must have been annoying to his contemporaries. Now it comes across as cute and quirky. While it does give some insight to his personality, though, it also makes it harder to glean insight from his life and work; Tesla is not being honest with us. > This horse was responsible for my brother's injuries from which he died. I witnessed the tragic scene and although fifty-six years have elapsed since, my visual impression of it has lost none of its force. The recollection of his attainments made every effort of mine seem dull in comparison. Anything I did that was creditable merely caused my parents to feel their loss more keenly> When a word was spoken to me the image of the object it designated would present itself vividly to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whether what I saw was tangible or not. … I soon discovered that my best comfort was attained if I simply went on in my vision farther and farther, getting new impressions all the time, and so I began to travel—of course, in my mind. Every night (and sometimes during the day), when alone, I would start on my journeys—see new places, cities and countries—live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and, however unbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those in actual life and not a bit less intense in their manifestations.> In the course of time it became perfectly evident to me that I was merely an automaton endowed with power of movement, responding to the stimuli of the sense organs and thinking and acting accordingly. The practical result of this was the art of telautomatics which has been so far carried out only in an imperfect manner. Its latent possibilities will, however, be eventually shown. I have been since years planning self-controlled automata and believe that mechanisms can be produced which will act as if possessed of reason, to a limited degree, and will create a revolution in many commercial and industrial departments> Even now I am not insensible to some of these upsetting impulses. When I drop little squares of paper in a dish filled with liquid, I always sense a peculiar and awful taste in my mouth. I counted the steps in my walks and calculated the cubical contents of soup plates, coffee cups and pieces of food—otherwise my meal was unenjoyable. All repeated acts or operations I performed had to be divisible by three and if I mist I felt impelled to do it all over again, even if it took hours.> Another one of my projects was to construct a ring around the equator which would, of course, float freely and could be arrested in its spinning motion by reactionary forces, thus enabling travel at a rate of about one thousand miles an hour, impracticable by rail. The reader will smile> I had a veritable rnania for finishing whatever I began, which often got me into difficulties. On one occasion I started to read the works of Voltaire when I learned, to my dismay, that there were close on one hundred large volumes in small print which that monster had written while drinking seventy-two cups of black coffee per diem. It had to be done, but when I laid aside the last book I was very glad, and said, ""Never more!""> One of the administrators had promised me a liberal compensation in case I succeeded, as well as a fair consideration of the improvements I had made in their dynamos and I hoped to realize a substantial sum. There were three administrators whom I shall designate as A,B and C for convenience. When I called on A he told me that B had the say. This gentleman thought that only C could decide and the latter was quite sure that A alone had the power to act. After several laps of this circulus vivios it dawned upon me that my reward was a castle in Spain.> I managed to embark for New York with the remnants of my belongings, some poems and articles I had written, and a package of calculations relating to solutions of an unsolvable integral and to my flying machine. … in April, 1887, the Tesla Electric Company was organized, providing a laboratory and facilities. The motors I built there were exactly as I had imagined them. I made no attempt to improve the design, but merely reproduced the pictures as they appeared to my vision and the operation was always as I expected.> One day, as I was roaming in the mountains, I sought shelter from an approaching storm. The sky became overhung with heavy clouds but somehow the rain was delayed until, all of a sudden, there was a lightning flash and a few moments after a deluge. This observation set me thinking. It was manifest that the two phenomena were closely related, as cause and effect, and a little reflection led me to the conclusion that the electrical energy involved in the precipitation of the water was inconsiderable, the function of lightning being much like that of a sensitive trigger. … this mighty life-sustaining stream could be at will controlled. We could irrigate arid deserts, create lakes and rivers and provide motive power in unlimited amounts. This would be the most efficient way of harnessing the sun to the uses of man. The consummation depended on our ability to develop electric forces of the order of those in nature> Despite my rare physical endurance at that period the abused nerves finally rebelled and I suffered a complete collapse, just as the consummation of the long and difficult task was almost in sight.> So long as it operates I am safe from danger, due to overwork, which threatens other inventors and, incidentally, I need no vacations which are indispensable to most people. When I am all but used up I simply do as the darkies, who ""naturally fall asleep while white folks worry."" To venture a theory out of my sphere, the body probably accumulates little by little a definite quantity of some toxic agent and I sink into a nearly lethargic state which lasts half an hour to the minute. Upon awakening I have the sensation as though the events immediately preceding had occurred very long ago, and if I attempt to continue the interrupted train of thought I feel a veritable mental nausea. Involuntarily I then turn to other work and am surprised at the freshness of the mind and ease with which I overcome obstacles that had baffled me before.> While I have failed to obtain any evidence in support of the contentions of psychologists and spiritualists, I have proved to my complete satisfaction the automatism of life, not only through continuous observations of individual actions, but even more conclusively through certain generalizations. These amount to a discovery which I consider of the greatest moment to human society, and on which I shall briefly dwell. … whenever either myself or a person to whom I was attached, or a cause to which I was devoted, was hurt by others in a particular way, which might be best popularly characterized as the most unfair imaginable, I experienced a singular and undefinable pain which, for want of a better term, I have qualified as ""cosmic,"" and shortly thereafter, and invariably, those who had inflicted it came to grief … A very sensitive and observant being, with his highly developed mechanism all intact, and acting with precision in obedience to the changing conditions of the environment, is endowed with a transcending mechanical sense, enabling him to evade perils too subtle to be directly perceived. When he comes in contact with others whose controlling organs are radically faulty, that sense asserts itself and he feels the ""cosmic"" pain. The truth of this has been borne out in hundreds of instances and I am inviting other students of nature to devote attention to this subject, believing that through combined and systematic effort results of incalculable value to the world will be attained.> Telautomata will be ultimately produced, capable of acting as if possessed of their own intelligence, and their advent will create a revolution. As early as 1898 I proposed to representatives of a large manufacturing concern the construction and public exhibition of an automobile carriage which, left to itself, would perform a great variety of operations involving something akin to judgment. But my proposal was deemed chimerical at that time and nothing came from it."

It's as if a 9th grader rushed a research project about Tesla, copied and pasted everything into a book and slapped a price tag on it. It's a disgrace to the genius and his life.Apart from the atrocity of SoHo books. The writing itself, although jumbled-and I believe not at the fault of Tesla himself-was very pleasant to read. He lived an interesting life and I'm so happy that he had the chance to write about his experiences, which I think are 1 in a billion. I think it's a great read for an afternoon. My greatest admiration of Tesla comes from his openness to ideas and possibilities. Throughout the book he touches on spirituality and religion in a positive light, which was something that I didn't expect to hear from him someone so learned in the sciences. Any scientist that believes in God after so much reading and research are the ones you need to look out for, because they usually know something that most people never will."

My brother and father were both fascinating men, they were my idols. My ancestors were inventors. I had a passion for reading and my father supported me. I read while everyone in my family slept. I practiced self control. I have great discipline. Tesla exercised and ate little to stay healthy and to keep the mind sharp. My ingenious professor has sparked my interest in physics by his own inventions. While recovering from an ailment, I spent most of my time reading, spending time in nature and did some physical workouts to clear my mind and strengthen my desires. I picked up 8 languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. I started my work at 3 am in the morning and continued to 11 at night *** how did Nikola keep his attention keen for 19 hours?????*** - no Sundays off and I worked on holidays. My leisures were spent in the library. I read voltaire. I have a sensitive sensory towards energy 12 feet away from me. I recited poems by heart. Poems and my readings played clearly in my mind. We get soon bored of the shiny new object which was once wonderful and mysterious to see that there are more newer and even more shinier objects to awe at.

45,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4296614-wendell-jones,5,"A fascinating read. I knew very little about Tesla except for the public facts that most know. He was possessed of an idetic memory, like several geniuses. He was prone to long bouts of illnesses early that came close to ending his life several times. In his youth his mind would project images into the space around him so he had difficulty distinguishing the projections from reality. He later could visualize so well that he had no need to build working models for his inventions. Things always worked the way he saw them in his mind. He received 800 patents for his inventions. He really was the developer of radio. He invented neon light. When he was working for Edison in America he went to work at 10:00 A.M. and worked straight through until 5:00 A.M. the next day. He worked tirelessly his whole life and gained very little. He was taken advantage of by investors like J.P. Morgan. This didn't bother him because developing new things to benefit mankind was his passion. He died penniless in a hotel in New York. I do not see how anyone could rate this book less than five stars "
46,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38680638-jen-garner,5,"This man was absolutely brilliant, obviously, but what I didn't know was that he was also pretty funny! I laughed quite a few times while reading this, only at a few very subtle lines of humor. I loved being able to see how he views his own life. I love that he cared NOTHING whatsoever about his fame or fortune, and only cared about the betterment of society. He did it all for US, the future. He handed over his patents without hesitation, although there is no mention of the business side in these books. He didn't mention how he got TOTALLY SCREWED by Edison and Westinghouse, however he probably didn't see it that way. He changed the world. For those of you who care about typos, there are quite a few errors in this book. I don't think he had an editor. As for everyone complaining that it is too short, I also am disappointed that he didn't write more about his fantastic brain, but he was kind of busy changing the world with his inventions! He's not a writer! I highly recommend this book, if it is too heady (like it was for me) take the time to understand it. You will be grateful you did."
47,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1944905-happy-hedgehog,5,"The entire book was great, filled with amusing stories, and strange ideas, but out of all of it this is my favorite part: ""Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races, and we are still far from this blissful realization, because few indeed, will admit the reality that God made man in His image in which case all earth men are alike. There is in fact but one race, of many colors. Christ is but one person, yet he is of all people, so why do some people think themselves better than some other people?"" Towards the end of the book Tesla talks about ""aerial machines"" he was then planning that would be able to ""project a missile of this kind into the air and drop it almost on the very spot designated, which may be thousands of miles away."" He also mentions having proposed the idea of ""an automobile carriage which, left to itself, would perform something akin to judgement"" He suggested that idea back in 1898! It's an awesome book, and I would highly suggest it to anyone who wants an insight into the creative genius of Nikola Tesla."
48,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318344-matthewmartinmurray-murray,4,This book was very well written. You get a pretty good idea of the curiosities of how Tesla was. He goes into interesting detail of how he invented things and his methodology concerning his creative process. He even describes with great detail how he first started training his imagination as a child and ended up visualizing things with remarkable accuracy. This book doesn't really go into equations and complicated engineering but is more about how Tesla came to be the timeless inventor of his age. He also describes the possible uses and future technologies that could eventually evolve from his ideas and ends up describing our modern world quite well. Some of the things that were not very strongly mentioned was detail about his rivalry with Edison. It seemed that he treated the whole situation with class by just mentioning it. I definitely recommend this book to anyone that has any interest in Tesla. 
49,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8755528-siina,3,"I've waited forever for a biography of Nikola Tesla in Finnish! I'm so glad Oppian published this, since Tesla surely had an interesting life. The translator notes that he has tried to keep Tesla's style, even though the guy couldn't really write. The text is extremely sporadic and somehow makes me think he was autistic on some level and I'm not the only one who thinks like this. Now we surely need a biography by an actual writer to counterpart this! What made we slightly angry though is that the book has many misspellings and I kept thinking whether anyone actually read the outcome before it got published. Oppian is a new publisher, but still. Content-wise the book could've offered more info about Tesla's inventions, but considering it's his autobiography, I'm not going to complain about the choices he has made that much. Tesla wasn't a writer, but even more so this shows us a view to his personality, which in itself is the best part surely."

Indeed he said at one point ""This was perfectly self-evident, but came as a revelation to some simple-minded wireless folks"" which definitely made me feel stupid because I had no idea what he was talking about at this point. But, if you want an insight into a genius mind, or if you want to make yourself feel better about not being a genius (dude was seriously OCD, worked 19 hours a day and didn't even drink coffee because he thought it would kill him), then give this book a read"

Maybe we would have arrived here (or at a semblance of it) even earlier (1950, throwing out a random year). Maybe I'm succumbing to paranoia..."

I am more impressed than ever with this man who was no doubt far before his time.

Not really a biography, more a recollection of anecdotes and highlights from his prodigious career as an electrical inventor. He was truly one-of-a-kind, and this short book merely whets the appetite for a more thorough investigation into his life. "
59,1599869942,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316456-marc,5,"I didn't know this book existed two weeks ago, but sort of stumbled across an excerpt while doing a search on Amazon, and had to read it.It's a quick read for an autobiography, and filled with as many quirky observations as you might expect from a somewhat eccentric genius from the turn of the last century. Though Tesla claims to have very vivid memories from his entire life since infancy, he picks and chooses appropriate examples to illustrate the extraordinary powers of imagination, sensory perception and genius he claimed. These assertions may be intended to heighten his reputation more than relate factual history. I noticed at least one or two points on which his anecdotes disprove his narrative, for example, his numerous close calls from life-threatening illness or injury vs. his claim for perfect physical health, 'even to the age of 60'. These inconsistencies may give the piece a tongue-in-cheek feel, but it is hard to tell if this was intentional. I think more likely is that Tesla believed in his own almost super-human gifts and that he simply wrote in the superlative style of pulp authors from the period. For example, he relates that his hearing late in life was so acute he could hear thunder hundreds of miles away and that throughout his life he was troubled by humming and other background noises that others around him couldn't detect. His eyesight astonished doctors, and he wore the same clothes at 60 as he did in college because he hadn't gained any weight. This may very well be true, but it could also be that after many head injuries and after lingering on death's door through so many vicious periods of illness Nikola was simply very eccentric, and this is, no doubt, how he was perceived by those around him. According to Tesla, he was acknowledged as very gifted and impressive by his peers at the time, despite conflicts with corporate gatekeepers at every turn. He worked tirelessly and slept very little because he was constantly inspired to move forward. Also by his own account, 90% of his work happened in his mind, so it is unclear how much of his daily work actually involved building things. Tesla asserted that he could invent a machine, build it in his mind complete with every detail, run through test drives and notice faults such as noise, wear and other unforeseen problems, and solve those faults in the abstract. When he finally began fabrication of his device, it would be perfect in every detail because he had already worked out the kinks.This claim is rather extraordinary, and brings to mind other geniuses who made similar claims: Mozart heard symphonies in his mind and just wrote down the notes. Michelangelo saw figures in marble and just 'chipped away the excess'. Bernie Wrightson sees images on paper 'as if projected through his eyes' and just traces them onto paper. I think this work is a notable record of genius in his own words, and as such was a fascinating read. I forgave Tesla some vanity or exaggeration because it is a fact that he brought possibilities into the world that just might not have existed without him. His work specifically avoids discussing conflicts with peers of his time. For example, he doesn't speak to the very important conflicts he ran up against with G.E. or Marconi as he sought to perfect his high frequency transmitter. Likewise, though he makes clear that the fire which burned his laboratory on Long Island to the ground was not the fault of the US military or anyone suspicious of his foreign origins, he also omits the actual cause, instead stating something along the lines of 'not giving notice to inferior men by mentioning their names in print,' a somewhat suspicious and cryptic avoidance. This work may therefore be of sketchy use as a history, but very insightful as a study of psychological nature. I rated this five stars, and think anyone interested New York or American history of the time period leading up to and through WWI, anyone interested in the nature of genius or personal perfection, or anyone interested in engineering would benefit from the read. It isn't long, and could probably be finished in one sitting. Much of Tesla's writing is quotable, interesting, and makes for great discussion. On a personal note, I found myself wanting to discuss passages with my grandfather, a remarkable electrical engineer in his own right who passed away this year at the young age of 95. Like Tesla, he had an active mind that was very sharp to the last, and (aside from conflicting views on religion) he would have loved this book. Though I am no longer able to ask him, I would not be surprised to learn that he read the book in the course of his studies or the many years of learning thereafter. Tesla concludes the work with predictions for the technology of the future, many of which have already come to pass. The internet, mobile phones, GPS, weapons capable of destroying entire cities at once, wireless energy, and so on. He once thought technology would eliminate war, but after the world war broke out, amended himself. He then saw that war would never be abolished until there were no borders or races, and not until people and goods could be transported instantaneously anywhere in the world to make these things irrelevant."
