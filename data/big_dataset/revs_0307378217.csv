(c) yep, our subliminal is a tricky pal.Q:That’s why doctors instinctively “package” themselves in nice shirts and ties and it’s not advisable for attorneys to greet clients in Budweiser T-shirts. (c)Q:As the psychologist Jonathan Haidt put it, there are two ways to get at the truth: the way of the scientist and the way of the lawyer. Scientists gather evidence, look for regularities, form theories explaining their observations, and test them. Attorneys begin with a conclusion they want to convince others of and then seek evidence that supports it, while also attempting to discredit evidence that doesn’t.” (c)Q:Kant said, there is Das Ding an sich, a thing as it is, and there is Das Ding für uns, a thing as we know it. (c)Q:People have a basic desire to feel good about themselves, and we therefore have a tendency to be unconsciously biased in favor of traits similiar to our won, even such seemingly meaningless traits as our names. Scientists have even identified a discrete area of the brain, called the dorsal striatum, as the structure that mediates much of this bias.” (c)Q:Rosenthal went on to study precisely that – what expectation mean for our children. In one line of research he showed that teachers´ expectations greatly affect their students´ academic performance, even when the teachers try to treat them impartially. For example, he and a colleague asked schoolkids in eighteen classrooms to complete an IQ test. The teachers, but not students, were given results. The researchers told the teachers that the test would indicate which children had unusually high intellectual potential. What the teachers didn’t know was that the kids named as gifted did not really score higher than average on the IQ test – they actually had average scores. Shortly afterwards, the teachers rated those not labeled gifted as less curious and less interested than the gifted students – and the students´ subsequent grades reflected that.But what is really shocking – and sobering – is the result of another IQ test, given eight months later. When you administer IQ test a second time, you expect that each child´s score will vary some. In general, about half of the children´s scores should go up and half down, as a result of changes in the individual’s intellectual development in relation to his peers or simply random variations. When Rosenthal administered the second test, he indeed found that about half the kids labeled “normal” showed a gain in IQ. But among those who´d been singled out as brilliant, he obtained a different result; about 80 % had an increase of at least 10 points. What´s more, about 20 % of the “gifted” group gained 30 or more IQ points, while only 5 % of the other children gained that many. Labeling children as gifted had proved to be a powerful self-fulfilling prophecy. (c) Amen. The way you name a ship..."
1,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"Whilst this book covered some ground I had already covered elsewhere, it nevertheless painted a good picture of our unconscious minds and motivations, which I found useful.The unconscious is a slippery critter, sliding out of our grasp nearly every time we reach for it. Various researchers have designed myriad tests to try and monitor it - but it isn't easy. It's a bit depressing to think about it really. We aren't totally irrational, but my goodness we're a bit woolly around the edges, that is for sure. Herewith a few issues raised by the book....* We are biased in the way we access information, and usually we are unaware of our biases.We see what we want to see. We hear what we want to hear.* We do top-down thinking. We make up our minds and then think of arguments to justify our decisions. (I've experienced this, a 'gut feeling' that something is right or wrong...and my subsequent research will back up my initial viewpoint...)* We are drawn towards some things and repelled by others whilst often being totally unaware of the true factors motivating us.* Consciously we can be liberal, fair and just, but unconsciously, at the same time, we can be prejudiced ...... racist, or prejudiced against fat or old people for instance. (I wish this idea had been better explained.)* We operate largely on automatic pilot. It is likely that some of the things we do and say may seem to be clearly thought through, but sometimes we get hints that we are largely acting below the threshold of consciousness. (For instance I often apologise when someone bumps into me....this may well mean there is some sort of unconscious script telling me to apologise when things go wrong. Whose fault it is may be irrelevant to this script. )* Most of us have an unrealistically rosy view of ourselves (and the author thinks this is a very positive thing.)* We are strongly inclined to support the groups we belong to, however superficial our membership. We really have to guard against in-group, out-group prejudice.* Our memories are fragile, rehashed, and often just plain wrong.My one problem with the book is that I would have liked a description of the possible origins of the unconscious. Part of it must be physiology (the book mentions that we are buffeted around by the more primitive areas of our brains, and various hormones and so forth.) Plus there are idiosyncrasies in the way we see, hear, think and remember. Part of it must be upbringing (my urge to apologise at the drop of a pin must largely be due to years of parental insistence on please, thank you and I'm sorry.) And what about the rest? The unconscious is obviously a powerful factor in our lives. I'd like to know more about how it comes into being.I end with a huge cacophony of notes. I really don't recommend that anyone else bothers to read them.(view spoiler)[ * UNDERSTANDING OUR FEELINGSWhen it comes to understand our feelings, humans have A) Low ability B) High confidence.eg.You take a job because you think it presents a challenge, but really you are more interested in the greater prestige that it offers.You think you like a fellow because of his humour. You really like him because of his smile, which reminds you of your mother's.You think you trust your consultant because she's a great expert. You really trust her because she's a good listener.*WE ARE AFFECTED BY ALL SORTS OF THINGS WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUSLY AWARE OF.These factors can increase pleasure in the pleasure centres of the brain... In fact we even have a brand-appreciation part of the brain - the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex (VMPC). It gives us warm fuzzy feelings when we contemplate a familiar brand-name product.egFlowery and evocative descriptions sell food better than just generic names....and people say this tastily-described food tastes better, even if it's exactly the same food.If fonts are difficult to read people think instructions are more difficult.We are manipulated into buying things purely on the basis of the attractiveness of different packaging. Research shows we buy washing powder in colourful boxes rather than plainer boxes, even when the washing powder is identical.Beer described in different ways, or labelled as different brands, or with a different price, can taste very different.Pepsi frequently beats Coke on blind tests for taste, but when people can see what they're drinking they prefer Coke.*SEEINGA third of our brain is devoted to processing vision. There are gaps/blindspots in our vision, but our brain fills in these gaps and gives us an impression of continuity.*HEARINGThe same is true with regard to auditory data.*OUR MEMORIES ARE NOT REALISTICFor instance about 75,000 police line ups take place each year. Statistics show that 20% - 25% of the time witnesses make a choice that the police know for a fact is incorrect eg maybe they pick detectives, used as ""fillers"" in the line up, or they pick an inmate taken from the local jail.Hugo Munsterberg, a psychologist who died in 1917, did a lot of research into memory, and he summed up his ideas as follows.1) None of us can retain memory in the vast quantity of details we are confronted with at any given moment.2) Memory mistakes are due to the techniques our minds employ to fill in the inevitable gaps.3) These include....- Relying on our expectations.- Relying on our belief systems- Relying on our prior knowledge.So, when our expectations, beliefs and prior knowledge are at odds with actual events, our brains can be fooled.4) People have a good memory for the general gist of events, but a bad one for the details.5) When pressed for details, people will unknowingly fill in the gaps by making things up....and people will believe the memories they make up.Our memories are perfect for dealing with the vast amounts of information we receive. The challenge the mind faces is just to remember the things that are important to you.*WHEN WE ARE ASKED TO REPEATEDLY RECREATE A MEMORY, WE REINFORCE IT EACH TIME.In a way we are remembering the memory, not the original event.* FALSE MEMORIESThese are often easy to introduce, especially for memories that seemed to happen a long time ago.*FRONTAL LOBE OF THE NEOCORTEThe unconscious thought area in animals a very similar to that of humans, it's just that as a percentage of the brain, it is much bigger in animals. We have much to learn from unconscious animal behaviour.eg The hormone oxytocin.Ewes are unfriendly to most lambs in a flock. But during the birthing process, the stretching of the birth canal causes a simple protein called oxytocin to be released in the ewe's brain. This open a window of a couple of hour's duration in which the ewe is open to bonding. She will bond with any lamb - although because her own lamb is closest it is likely to be him or her.Then once the oxytocin window has closed, she will stop bonding with new lambs. After than, if she has bonded with a lamb she will continue to suckle it and bleat soothingly at it. But she will still be her usual nasty self to other lambs.In the brains of all mammals who are monogamous there are receptors of oxytocin and receptors for vasopressin. In promiscuous mammals who are not monogamous there are very few receptors for either oxytocin or vasopressin.These hormones are released during childbirth and sexual intimacy. For women, even when they hug another person. Sociable animals are much more likely to have these hormones. Loner animals have far fewer.Oxytocin also makes us trust other people.MENTAL SCRIPTS.It may be that our social behaviours may be influenced by some unconscious, predetermined mental 'scripts'.Psychologists did a test in a room with a photocopying machine.Scenario one:A tester butts in front of someone about to use the machine and says.""Excuse me, I have 5 pages, May I use the Xerox machine?""The tester made no justification for the intrusion, so why yield? Lots of people felt this way and 40% refused.Scenario two:The tester tried again, this time he said...""May I use the Xerox machine, because I'm in a rush?""The number of refusals fell radically, from 40% to 6%.BUT....The researchers suspected that something else might be going on - maybe people weren't consciously assessing the reason and deciding it was a worthy one. Maybe they were mindlessly - automatically - following a mental script?That script might go like this:Someone asks a small favour with zero justification = say no. Someone asks a small favour but offers a reason = say yes.This sounds like a robot or computer programme, but could it apply to people?Scenario 3:The tester approached someone again and said...""Excuse me, I have 5 pages, may I use the Xerox machine...because I have to make some copies.""Only 7% of the people refused!Conclusion of experimenters:While such mindlessness may at times be troublesome, this degree of selective attention, of tuning the external world out, may be an achievement. In evolutionary terms here is the unconscious performing its usual duty, automating tasks so as to free us to respond to other tasks in the environment.* FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (fMRI)This is a twist on the ordinary MRI scanner that doctors use. It measure oxygen consumption in different parts of the brain. It also provides a map of the structures of the brain.....it can therefore show us brain activity in different parts of the brain. Mental processes can now be associated with specific neural pathways and specific brain structures.*THE BRAIN HAS 3 REGIONS1) Reptilian2) Limbic (old mammalian)3) Neocortex (new mammalian)But there is overlap eg some primitive creatures have neocortex-like tissue. This mean their behaviour may not be purely instinct-driven.Also, whilst the three areas are described as distinct, in reality they are integrated and work in concert. They have numerous neural interconnections.* DOGS ARE FANTASTICALLY GOOD AT READING SOCIAL NON-VERBAL SIGNALS (HUMAN SOCIAL SIGNALS)They seem even better than primates at doing this, in spite of primates being better at things like problem-solving and cheating. This suggests that during the history of domestication, evolution favoured those dogs who were better companions to human beings.MESSAGES THAT CONDEMN YET HIGHLIGHT BAD SOCIAL NORMS CAN BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.eg a message that says ""Americans are dropping more litter than ever!"" can actually encourage bad behaviour..... Everyone is doing this, so why not me as well?*WE CHANGE ALL THE TIME. WE CAN EVEN BE DIFFERENT PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIMEThe conscious ""I"" who abhors prejudice, versus the unconscious ""I"" who holds negative feelings about people like blacks, the elderly, fat people gays or Muslims.*THE SHORTCOMINGS OF PSYCHOTHERAPYWe feel many things we are not aware of feeling, and because of this, psychotherapy may be useless, or of limited value.*WE MAKE UP STORIES TO EXPLAIN OUR ACTIONSResearchers instructed a patient, via the right hemisphere of his brain, to wave.The left hemisphere of his brain observed the waving, but was unaware of the instruction to wave.But the left hemisphere wouldn't admit ignorance. Instead the patient said he waved because he thought he'd seen someone he knew. Again and again, the left hemisphere responded as if it knew the answer as to why an action had taken place.In these, and in similar studies, the left hemisphere of the brain generated many false reports.The researchers concluded that the left hemisphere of the brain tries to understand our feelings. It's as if the left hemisphere has mounted a search for a sense of order and reason in the world in general.We all make up stories to fill in gaps in our knowledge about our feelings. Whilst we know what we are feeling, we often know neither the content nor the unconscious origins of that content. And so we come up with plausible explanations that are untrue, or only partly accurate...and we believe them.*WE FIGHT TO SEE OURSELVES IN A GOOD LIGHTeg. Criminal after criminal has justified their behaviour, however violent or anti-social.eg. Directors of companies that have lost millions of dollars, nevertheless justify the exit package they get from the company they have been working for.eg. One million high school seniors were interviewed re their ability to get along with others.100% rated themselves at least as average.60% rated themselves in the top 10%25% rated themselves in the top 1%eg. College professors were asked to rate the standard of their work.94% said they do above-average work.We are prejudiced about ourselves. We see ourselves as above average...and we slant our perspectives to bolster our attributes.eg if we are better at grammar than arithmetic we give linguistic knowledge more weight in our view of what is important...but if we're better at arithmetic, we think language skills aren't that critical.We put a positive slant on our history.eg a group of researchers asked 99 college students to recall their leaving/graduating grades from school exams. They were told their answers would be checked against their school records. The students' memories of 3,220 grades were checked.Correctly remembered.A grades 89%B grades 64%C grades 51%D grades 29%Thus these students skewed their memories to have a brighter picture of themselves.* SCIENTISTS WITH AN INVESTMENT IN A BAD THEORY WILL CLING TO IT.eg all those scientist who opposed the Big Bang theory. Scientists with an investment in an established theory sometimes stubbornly cling to their old beliefs. Sometimes, as an economist wrote, ""Science advances funeral by funeral.""*TRUTH IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDERResearchers interviewed the audience after a football game between Dartmouth and Princeton. (A game where Dartmouth had been told to play very roughly.) The Dartmouth supporters saw one game, the Princeton supporters saw another. Princeton supporters saw Dartmouth commit twice as many infractions as their team. Dartmouth saw both teams committing the same number of infractions.There is no such thing as a game existing 'out there' in its own right, which people merely 'observe'.*WHAT MOTIVATES US TO THINK A CERTAIN WAY IS UNCONSCIOUS.People therefore think they are unbiased.

2,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7004864-godlike,5,"Great book that outlines just how weak human minds are. Or more specifically, how weak the conscious mind really is after all and how overpowering our unconscious is in our everyday lives. We filter the world with our five senses and further reduce that filtered information through evolutionary cognitive biases to construct a mental artificial environment in which we call ""reality"". Few people ever get to realize this, especially in its entirety. This book is definitely worth reading if you want to gain a deeper understanding of how you work and why you make certain decisions in life."
3,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8220537-ken-montville,3,"Usually I love reading books in the genre. I love learning how people make decisions and how our subconscious mind directs our behavior. This book really tries to do a good job of explaining what our subconscious is and how it influences our behavior. Yet, for me it is a little heavy on the science and a little light on the application.To be fair, the author really tries to intertwine interesting analogies and folksy anecdotes with the science of how life is really a subjective experience. But, it seems, he can't help himself from proving his point through reference to numerous studies and minute description of the brain and it's physicality.Yes, it's interesting to know that out subconscious helps us function in life by filtering out a multitude of activities, sights and sounds. It's interesting that our memory isn't as accurate as we would like to believe. It's interesting that even our vision isn't as all encompassing as we think.It's when he gets wades into the weeds of highly scientific explanation of evolution and neuroscience that he loses me.Many of the later chapters also reveal what most of us know, if not factually, then intuitively. Women like deeper voiced men, tall men. Both sexes attribute positive characteristics to good looking people, in general. So, toward the end, I put it down. The books of Dan Ariely are more to my liking. I also thought that The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business was a lot more engaging and memorable.Read the book if you like a lot of scientific backup for the author's assertions of how your subconscious mind rules your behavior. If you're looking for ways to help change your own behavior or better understandand possibly influence the behavior of others, you may be disappointed."
4,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,4,"Plenty in this book can be found in others, like ""Strangers To Ourselves"" or ""Blink"". But yeah, there was some new stuff as well. What he shared on ""Blindsight"" was fascinating, and there was other findings in the book that I've found interesting and have been fun to share with others. In one section of the book Mlodinow covered cognitive biases--how we won't consider the evidence on the other-side and how experiments have proven that none of us are objective. The problem is we unconsciously filter what we don't agree with and uncritically confirm everything that fits our world-view. After sharing all of this Mlodinow just couldn't help but give some examples, like how stupid people are who just won't face that fact that ""man is causing global warming"" and those retards who won't acknowledge the fact that man evolved from lower animals. Which assumes (from Mlodinow's materialist perspective) that matter banged into existence from nothing, complex life formed from inanimate matter, information accidentally formed due to unintelligent forces and that consciousness evolved from unconscious matter. I would have been perfectly fine with him bringing up these examples, if he could have been humble enough to acknowledge that his own biases, just maybe hinder him from considering the evidence on the other-side which I find very convincing. Of course, I doubt Mlodinow ever could truly consider the evidence that clashes with his naturalistic worldview. Anything that doesn't coincide with materialism is a priori considered not to be evidence. Naturalist have so effectually stacked the deck and thus can confidently assert no other worldview has a spec of evidence, only blind faith and only they themselves hold truth.  Or maybe I am wrong, maybe the author is truly objective in these two controversial issues and only us who disagree with him are blinded by our biases. No doubt I am plagued by them as much as anyone else. "
5,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,4,"Thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening book. Among other things, it's interesting how our minds fool us into remembering things that never happened, and rationalizing evidence for what we wanted to believe to begin with."
6,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior by Leonard Mlodinow""Subliminal"" is the provocative and fascinating look at the unconscious part of our minds. One of my favorite authors and physicists, Leonard Mlodinow, takes the readers on a journey into the science of the unconscious. What a fun and enlightening book this was. Mlodinow is the master of making the difficult accessible and fun for the masses. How are mind works is one of the most interesting subjects and I was thrilled to see that the coauthor of both the Grand Design and the equally interesting book War of the Worldviews makes his latest venture into this intriguing science. This excellent 272-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. The New Unconscious, 2. Senses Plus Mind Equals Reality, 3. Remembering and Forgetting, 4. The Importance of Being Social, 5. Reading People, 6. Judging People by Their Covers, 7. Sorting People and Things, 8. In-Groups and Out-Groups, 9. Feelings, and 10. Self.Positives:1. A fascinating topic (science of the unconscious) in the hands of a master.2. Elegant, conversational tone that makes this book a treat to read.3. Mlodinow consistently produces great books and this one lived up to my expectations.4. As accessible a book as you will find. A difficult topic made easy and fun to read.5. The book is loaded with great and I mean great examples to help the reader grasp the latest in the science. One of the books strengths.6. Great use of science history.7. The pioneers of the science of the unconscious.8. Great use the latest scientific research in this fascinating topic to support well-stated positions.9. You will end up with a better grasp at how our brains work.10. A good use of illustrations.11. Great quotes and factoids abound, ""The truth is that our unconscious minds are active, purposeful, and independent.""12. Evolution...why our brains evolved to be what they are.13. A truly exceptional study that mirrors the subjects' sexual preferences.14. What modern neuroscience tells us about our brains and how we perceive the world.15. How our memory system works. Who does it change over time? Find out.16. Social interactions and the subliminal. Theory of mind. The three regions of the brain and the three basic types of nonverbal communication.17. An interesting look at stereotyping.18. Popular misconceptions analyzed.19. What do we know about our feelings our emotions? Find out.20. The ways to the truth...our worldviews.21. How our brain creates unconscious biases.22. Is unrealistic optimism good for you?23. Great links.Negatives:1. Notes are great but a formal bibliography never hurts.2. Nothing about supernatural beliefs and why they are so prevalent.3. Having to get multiple copies to share.In summary, I loved this book. It was an intellectual treat. The science of the unconscious is a fascinating topic and this book was loaded with a lot of great research. Mlodinow is a great author who is able to tackle complex topics and make it fun and interesting to read. If you want to learn about the science of the unconscious, make a conscious decision to get this one, I highly recommend it!!Further suggestions: ""The Grand Design"" and ""War of the Worldviews: Science Vs. Spirituality"" coauthored by this same author were excellent, ""Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time"" and ""The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies---How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths"" by Michael Shermer, ""The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature"" by Steven Pinker, Hardwired Behavior: What Neuroscience Reveals about Morality"" by Laurence Tancredi, ""Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain"" Michael S.

7,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4," Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior is good summary on the topic of the unconscious mind. The the author clarifies at the beginning that unconscious mind in modern psychology and neuroscience is a totally different concept than Freud's subconsciousness. I have read some of the topics elsewhere, but still find the book useful. The human mind constructs a picture of reality for the purpose of our survival, therefore accuracy is not a priority. Same is our memory. Our mind collects information that caught our attention, then constructs memory from the material available, and from time to time, the mind re-organizes and fills the missing details. One chapter is dedicated to our ability to categorize the world, which is a crucial talent that also gives rise to stereotypes. This talent, in combination with our tendency to form in-groups and to favor in-group members, becomes the psychological foundation of discrimination. There can be explicit and implicit biases. The book makes me thinking: is there a better way to fight discrimination?The chapter of motivated reasoning reminds me of Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life. Oxytocin research has been advanced since the publication of the book in 2012. Here is an article on the subject of  oxytocin and oxytocin nasal spray I find it odd that the author did not mention Daniel Kahneman when he talked about behavior economy. My final problem of the book is the title: to claim your unconscious mind rules your behavior is inaccurate. The author wants to convey the idea that the unconscious mind is underestimated, but to call it ""rule"" is over-simplification."
8,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6132231-owlseyes,0,"This is not really the Freud’s (or Jung's) notion of unconscious; rather, another level of processing information well beyond the conscious. Drawing heavily on studies of memory (including the Münsterberg theory of memory) the author leads us to believe the uncomfortable truth that our own memory is not that reliable; instead, it may deceive us, as sometimes we fill in the gaps through the unconscious use of certain “techniques” (mediated by beliefs, expectations, desires, context and prior knowledge). The understanding of these “techniques” may be paramount when we deal with witnesses reporting on crimes. To be more precise, this (new) notion of unconscious implies ""brain processes which are automatic, beyond awareness and control"".The author approaches also the expression of emotions in the human face (referring the work of Paul Ekman), as well as the notion of social unconscious."
9,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27613955-ashley-reid,1,"While there were some good points in this book, the writing wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention for long. It was too boring to get through and even though I got to ~80% I still couldn't force myself to finish it all."
10,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,4,"**edited 01/27/14When I first saw this book, I knew I had to read it. Not only is it written by an author I've already had a positive experience with (The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives), but the book had one of the funniest cover designs I've seen all year. In black text on a green background, it says, ""Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior."" In the spaces in between, in green only slightly lighter than the background, it says, ""Psst: Hey There, Yes: You, Sexy. Buy This Book Now. You Know You Want It."" I laughed when I saw it and obeyed--well, not to the point of buying it, but I did pick it up.I dove in eagerly, only to be brought to an abrupt and unpleasant halt in the first chapter. There's nothing that irritates me more than bad science, and the misapplication of statistics is on my permanent hit list. One of Mlodinow's examples of the importance of the subconscious is (according to him) that we are more attracted to people who share our last name. As ""evidence"", he provides a chart of raw counts of husband-wife surnames over three states which indicates that a Jones is more likely to marry a Jones even though Smiths are more common. My problem? Well, this is a perfect example of Bad Statistics: he grabs a convenient weak correlation over a ridiculously tiny sample, ignores all potential confounding variables (e.g. names aren't uniformly distributed: even though the overall population of Jones are smaller, a Jones may be more likely to meet another Jones than a Smith; last names indicate ethnicity and nationality and we know people have strong homophilous preferences that have nothing to do with melodious surnames, etc, etc.), and then extrapolates an outrageously broad and demonstrably inaccurate causal conclusion (this data indicates that we are subconsciously attracted to people who share our names). I put the book down in disgust. And so the story ends, until one day, I ran across a version of the book on audio, read by none other than Mlodinow himself. I decided to give the book one more chance. I'm glad I did....Due to my disapproval of GR's new and rather subjective review deletion policy, the rest of this review can be found on Booklikes."

12,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21068193-tony,5,"Marvelous read.The dynamic of this book, unlike that of ‘Thinking Fast and Slow', is so righteously tuned, keeping the reader thoroughly hooked. I was eating my way through the pages. The author is outright witty and happens to be a theoretical physicist who’s probing a psychological subject – neuroscience to be precise. Basically, a great mash up.The theory of mind, how it correlates with human behavior and social norms. The impact of our unconscious on everyday life. The biases and judgments we conjure. The stances we take, opinions we formulate and arguments we postulate. Objectivity, in the broad sense of the word, is put to question.How truly independent are we regarding to how truly independent we think we are?Experiment after experiment, social study after another the reader learns how fallible the brain process really is. Like the blind spot where the optic nerve links to the retina, most of our experiences suffer from incomplete sets of data, yet we manage to draw our conclusions by combining, filling and interpolating the available vertices, or those we judge apt to. Right down to scientists, we keep clinging to false theories we have invested in (e.g. pro-static universe theorists or anti-global climate change advocates.)And when the book seems to converge toward human impotence and overall inability to impartially judge events, Mlodinow states that,“studies show that people with the most accurate self-perceptions tend to be moderately depressed, suffer from low self-esteem, or both.” He adds,  “An overly positive self-evaluation, on the other hand, is normal and healthy.”So after all the critical analysis of the brain workings, after all the thought experiments are we to conclude that, whether or not we have power over our limbic system, we should leave it alone, that intuitive data be left alone, that a scrupulous conscious inspection is dismissible? Since an overly positive self-evaluation is normal, exclusively common might I add, are we to conclude that introspection aiming to subsume objectivity under the realm of the self should rather be discouraged, an end we should not strive for?
“Unlike phenomena in physics, in life, events can depend largely upon which theory we choose to believe. It is a gift of the human mind to be extraordinarily open to accepting the theory of ourselves that pushes us in the direction of survival, and even happiness.” 
Then I guess we have to choose our beliefs wisely."
13,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11985373-teo-mechea,4,"The ending felt rushed and somehow incomplete but it didn't matter so much due to the abundance of facts, explanations and (my favorite part) lots and lots of descriptions of studies conducted by research scientists along the decades, in different fields of interest. It's basically a 200-page collection of studies and experiments that prove various theories from neuroscience and social psychology. If you're into the way the brain works and like to hear weird and sometimes highly unexpected (and disturbing) facts about yourself and about how everything you actually perceive is most probably an illusion orchestrated by your unconscious, read on.I really enjoyed it."

It goes deep into self-fulfilling prophecies, group think, effects of optimism and how our brain chemistry is physically changing depending on our perception. This is a book you don't wanna miss out on, a lot of the studies mentioned in the book are also fairly new discoveries as the real-time brain-scanning technology wasn't even available for such studies in the past. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

“When you come up with an explanation for your feelings and behavior, your brain performs an action that would probably surprise you: it searches your mental database of cultural norms and picks something plausible.”
There is a touch of existential terror when thinking about the brain as physical. When you're not actively engaged in thinking about what is in your head, it feels natural to treat it like a magical repository of all your experiences and leave it at that. Subliminal took me longer than normal to finish, but it contains the same Mlodinow charm that filled The Drunkard's Walk and Euclid's Window; stories, delivered easily and frequently as examples or illustrations, retain all of their inherent complexity. Mlodinow conjures up the image of Aesop recounting a fable to a truculent child, explaining away complexity with patience, supported upon an ethereal balance of dry scientific treatises, personal stories, and detailed examples. Dense topics are made accessible without any hint of condescension, trusting the reader to follow along all while elegantly constructing a bridge between the gap of his considerable knowledge and skills and the infinitely complex hypothetical baseline understanding of the brain, or basic science, that a reader may bring. I will continue to read whatever he writes whenever I can. That said, I liked Subliminal less than the others, yet I wonder if I would have liked it less still had it not had the author's name attached. “The “causal arrow” in human thought processes consistently tends to point from belief to evidence, not vice versa.” [citation omitted] I wonder if came in expecting to be less impressed, less open to hearing about neuroscience from a physicist. “Motivated reasoning involves a network of brain regions that are not associated with “cold” reasoning, including the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex—parts of the limbic system—and the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, which are also activated when one makes emotionally laden moral judgments.” [citation omitted] That the general areas of the brain that act and interact can be quantifiably tracked, and that conclusions can be drawn that from where and what systems are engaged in different types of decisions and thoughts is an unbelievably amazing window into thoughts. It is terrifying to think of reductivist conclusions, but Subliminal avoids any sort of,“This neuron does this, and only this, so buy some fish oil and you'll be smarter,” reductio ad absurdum arguments. The ascension of fMRI in the last 20 years has changed the way psychology and psychiatry will move forward, and there is more upheaval now and more data that haven't yet entered the basic public lexicon than any time since Freud. That there is now supported science backing Emerson's view of personage thrills me. Subliminal: “We behave differently when we are in a good mood than when we are in a bad one. We behave differently having lunch with our boss than when having lunch with our subordinates...our character is not indelibly stamped on us but is dynamic and changing,” is well paired with Self-Reliance: “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblins of little minds. Speak what you think now in hard words, and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.” Talk of in-groups and out-groups might well have been torn straight out of the pages of C.S. Lewis' The Inner Ring, and Subliminal tends to back up with experimental data.“In one study, researchers asked subjects to rate the likability of doctors, lawyers, waiters, and hairdressers, on a scale from 1 to 100. [citation omitted] The twist was, every subject in this experiment was him- or herself either a doctor, a lawyer, a waiter, or a hairdresser. The results were very consistent: those in three of the four professions rated the members of the other professions as average, with a likeability around 50. But they rated those in their own professions significantly higher, around 70. There was only one exception: the lawyers, who rated both those in the other professions and other lawyers at around 50...of the four groups, lawyers form the only one whose members regularly oppose others in their own group.”After enough time with Subliminal, you would be remiss not to question whether the zeitgeist around the flexible persona in the neuroscience community is in response to a pre-built acculturated desire to bolster the pillars of great philosophers, social and literary theorists. Did Emerson and Lewis preempt the science that supported them, or did society find a way to conform to Emerson and Lewis? Be wary,lest motivated thinking find its way into the very theory that it supports. ""And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.""	It is interesting to see something you thought was peculiar to yourself is a physiological trait of your species. “Linguists recognize two types of language structure: surface structure and deep structure. Surface structure refers to the specific way an idea is expressed, such as the words used and their order. Deep structure refers to the gist of the idea. [citation omitted] Most of us avoid the problems of clutter by retaining the gist but freely discarding the details. As a result, we can retain deep structure—the meaning of what was said—for long periods of time, we can accurately remember surface structure—the words in which it was said—for just eight to ten seconds [citation omitted].” If you've ever had an argument with your significant other about the exact phrasing of some prior verbal exchange, I do not recommend pointing out that the brain is not meant to remember surface structure longer than ten seconds. Remembering the gist but jettisoning the fiddly details has biological advantages, which Subliminal covers, and then goes the extra step to include a vivid story of a man who could not shed those minute, typically pointless, bits of information and the problems that his unique brain created for him.  This is a fascinating book, and from the blue-pen underlining of the “Reading People” chapter that my public library copy came burdened with, someone else believed that they could pick up some subtle tips to help with upcoming job interviews. If you pick this up, be prepared to be fascinated, informed, and a little bit sad. “Studies show that the people with the most accurate self-perceptions tend to be moderately depressed, suffer from low self-esteem, or both.” [citation omitted] Perhaps I did not appreciate having the ""magical repository"" image I had constructed of my brain altered. Have we now found an answer to why I trudged so slowly through Subliminal, and why it got short shrift on my list of favorite Mlodinow books? ""Motivated reasoning enables our minds to defend us against unhappiness, and in the process it gives us the strength to overcome the many obstacles in life that might otherwise overwhelm us."" No, it was the book, not me."

Turns out, a whole lot. There’s an entire world of unconscious activity hidden just below the surface. If conscious thought is like a speedboat you pilot across the surface of the ocean(cue the Miami Vice theme), unconscious thought is the teeming, chaotic, beautiful mass of rainbow-colored tropical fish, graceful coral reefs, steely-eyed sharks and even a few grotesque bottom-dwellers hidden beneath. Once you dive in, you realize our subliminal thoughts are more powerful than the speedy, unreliable conscious thoughts we’re so proud of, skimming along the top. That’s because unconscious thought ultimately shapes our decisions, forges our world views and guides our relationships with others (and with ourselves), all without us even knowing or – equally important – without controlling or consenting.  Subliminal, by Leonard Mlodinow – a theoretical physicist – is a guided tour (blitzkrieg?) through the unconscious mind and shows that we are only loosely in control of our own consciousness, completely unaware of the things our brains take in when we aren't paying attention and at the mercy of filters we didn’t even know existed.  Study after study and weird example after weird example bring this to life: Folks who read a recipe in a difficult font rated it harder to prepare than the same recipe presented in an easy font (take note, designers), because our brains get us ready for tasks before we start them. Folks using exactly the same detergent in three differently-colored boxes consistently rated one in particular — the most colorful — the best of the three by far. Shoppers who heard French background music bought more French wine, and bought more German wine when German background music was playing even though none of them even remembered music playing. In another classic study, people consistently prefer Pepsi over Coke in a blind taste test, but they prefer Coke when the blindfold comes off. Can you actually taste “brand?” People with brain damage in a specific location can’t. When the VMC area — thought to be the generator of warm, fuzzy feelings — was damaged, they didn’t experience the “Pepsi paradox.” (Please, Pepsi, don’t start damaging our brains).  There’s so much more: Statistical analysis found investors were more likely to invest in the initial public offerings of companies with easy-to-pronounce names. There are naturally occurring dead spots in our vision that our brain compensates for without us even knowing. Oxytocin, released during sex and even during hugs, affects social bonding, which in turn is shaped by brain size and complexity across species.  When you read this book, you’ll realize that it's crazy town up in your brain, and there ain't no mayor. We think we are driving the machine, but we are actually just along for the ride. There’s power in knowing that, though. This book is breathless, geeky fun, well written and packed with insights and puzzles and hard science and so many “ah-ha” moments that I eventually had to consign myself to the notion that I would have to read it twice. An aside: This topic takes on even greater significance when you consider the recent Wired article that suggests consciousness continues for up to a few hours after death. The Meta isn’t sounding so crazy now, is it? "
17,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949697-thewestchestarian,3,"Maybe you secretly liked or dislike the book more than you think? Mlodinow presents a solid literature review on recent research that all seems to point to the rationale mind holding far less power in the direction of human behavior than we would like to think. This discounting of the power of human thought follows a long series of scientific discoveries taking our self-image from lesser god to higher animal. Galileo demonstrated the sun did not revolve around us. Darwin negated our notions of divine creation. Freud and Skinner should our behavior was influenced by forces outside our control. And now functional MRI machines demonstrate that the conscious mind learns of rather than makes decisions. The research on unconscious intentionality has yet to coalesce around one central figure as behaviorism found its Skinner but a number of authors have taken to writing about it. One of these is Mlodinow who does a solid job covering the field although many of the studies are covered more entertainingly in GLADWELL MALCOM, more authoritatively in Ariely Dan and more comprehensively inThinking, Fast and Slow from Dan Kaheman the ""giant of science"" in this field. If you don't want to pick up any of those authors, Mlodinow's review makes a good substitute. All of the head-scratching studies are here. Teachers told that randomly chosen children hold special genius find them far advanced compared to their equally talented control groups. This finding is intriguing enough but add to it a study concluding that students told their randomly chosen rat was bred to solve mazes more quickly actually find faster times from these compared to their genetically identical control group and you really have an intriguing result. Studies showing how much memory is a constructive process are fascinating particularly in a historical context such as a comparison of John Dean's testimony about what he said to President Richard Nixon during the Watergate coverup and the secret tapes later found of those conversations. Despite Dean having no reason to lie, the tapes and the testimony differ wildly. Add this to research demonstrating a 20-30% accuracy rate for eyewitnesses and you really begin to understand that your memoir could equally sit on the non-fiction and fiction library shelves. Mlodinow's straight-forward solid writing style never veers into story-telling but it is generally tight if a little plodding. To his credit, Dr. Mlodinow doesn't sound like a physics professor for the most part and the book is fairly readable if a little dull at times. In short, a good book for those who like psychological studies or just dislike feeling in control although other authors cover the same ground with better results."
18,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,4,"leonard mlodinow's new book, subliminal: how your unconscious mind rules your behavior, is an engaging, stimulating work exploring the relatively young field of social neuroscience. mlodinow, a theoretical physicist (and one time screenwriter for both macgyver and star trek: the next generation), offers an introduction to, and overview of, the current science relating to our understanding of the unconscious and its ever-present role in shaping our daily lives. subliminal considers the two-tier system of the brain and the ramifications it has on the ways sensory input data is filtered and processed. mlodinow focuses a good portion of the book on theory of mind, memory and forgetting, language and non-verbal communication, categorization, and motivated reasoning. incorporating into the narrative a large number of descriptive and illustrative studies and experiments, subliminal's main ideas are easy to conceptualize and their corresponding real-life corollaries amply explained. mlodinow is a lucid, descriptive writer; one adept at infusing his work with clever analogies and humorous one-liners. subliminal excels beyond many other popular science books in that it is consistently engrossing, never deigns to simplified or dumbed-down explanations, and encourages in its readers introspective ways of applying its insights.
 evolution designed the human brain not to accurately understand itself but to help us survive. we observe ourselves and the world and make enough sense of things to get along. some of us, interested in knowing ourselves more deeply- perhaps to make better life decisions, perhaps to live a richer life, perhaps out of curiosity- seek to get past our intuitive ideas of us. we can. we can use our conscious minds to study, to identify, and to pierce our cognitive illusions. by broadening our perspective to take into account how our minds operate, we can achieve a more enlightened view of who we are. but even as we grow to better understand ourselves, we should maintain our appreciation of the fact that, if our mind's natural view of the world is skewed, it is skewed for a reason.

“Research suggests when it comes to understanding our feelings, we humans have an odd mix of low ability and high confidence.”
 This book was more enlightening than I anticipated. In Subliminal, Leonard Mlodinow gives you certain facts about the human unconscious, simply put, and written in an interesting way through a clear structure. Each point is well supported with several examples that leave small room for doubt. The examples come from both this century and the past ones, giving in the process a general view to Psychology in general.It could be argued that the exemplification is over-done, but I think that was the case for me only, as I did not need need as much convincing as others might. Some ideas presented here could be very hard to swallow for some people because by admitting the grasp your unconscious has on you, you give up the belief in your control over yourself, quite the ego-breaking if you ask me.I also liked the author, the way Mlodinow presents information makes it easier to get around.With all the research cited in this book, credibility is at its highest, as far as my knowledge serves me that is.I suggest that you read this, find out more about yourself, have better control over it, live more of your life on your terms.A good sequel to this book would be: how to rule your unconscious mind. Although a better man would deduce that from this book."

22,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12942555-paula-cappa,4,"Are you curious about the mystery of the unconscious mind? Well, this book is about the ‘new unconscious.’ The book is quite un-Freudian—no more self-reflecting therapy to process our reality. Freud believed that our unconscious was filled with repressed lust and anger, but Leonard Mlodinow says our ‘new unconscious’ is a kinder and more gentle reality, and it’s still evolving. You have to like that, right? There’s lots of information here about the ‘fluency effect,’ that is, the influence that our unconscious has on our conscious minds. The chapter on the link of social pain (social rejections) and physical pain was fascinating and very convincing. As was the part on unconscious gender bias, political bias, racial bias, etc. The brain makes mistakes. Our thinking is skewed with ‘motivated reasoning,’ even to the point of unconscious vision and processing. You’ll find a lot of reporting of test results, fMRI data analysis, studies, and anecdotes of human and animal sensory experiences. I found this book to be more of a history of the unconscious and the current trends discovered by the newest technology. All very fascinating. But if you are looking for answers as to the mechanism of how or why our ‘unconscious feeds the conscious mind,’ you will not find any definitive answers. Maybe that part is still buried in the unconscious. I liked Carl Jung’s take on all this that our dreams arise from our unconscious instincts and that they do have a purpose. Jung is quoted in the book: ‘These subliminal aspects of everything that happens to us may seem to play very little part in our daily lives. But they are the almost invisible roots of our conscious thoughts.’ Our subliminal worlds remain hidden within ourselves and perhaps that is the beauty of the mystery."
23,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,2,"Reviewed for The Bibliophibian.This book was a bit of a disappointment. It covers basically the same ground as dozens of other books which purport to explain the irrationality of the human brain, including the same experiments discussed with more or less the same conclusions. I’m wary of the way Mlodinow decides that certain anatomical areas of the brain are solely and uncomplicatedly involved in specific emotions. For example, he identifies the “ventromedial pre-frontal cortex” as being all there is to it when it comes to preferring Coke over Pepsi because of the brand-name. This isn’t my area (alas) so I’m not going to say he’s definitively wrong, but I’ve read around enough to be cautious when someone decides that a bit of brain anatomy means x or y universally. It smacks of going for a simple, catchy answer instead of acknowledging the actual complexity of the brain.Anyway, it’s probably a good read if you haven’t read one of the dozens of other books covering the same topic, and in its favour I did find myself snorting in amusement at some of Mlodinow’s commentary. It’s nothing new, though."
24,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38245008-majed,5,"I don’t usually write long reviews but I was really fascinated by this work. It is also a good overview for those who are new to this genre. I will share some of what I found interesting about this book.The first part of the book covers the rudiments of how our unconscious mind governs our senses and perceptions which in turn translate into decisions. Unlike the general notion that our decisions are based on our conscious perspective, its actually the unconscious, or subliminal, part of the brain that rules our attitudes and decisions without us being aware of it. The book also goes over the science of sensory perception and how the unconscious mind is actively involved in shaping our memories.On the social level, it is fascinating how we subliminally adjust our nonverbal attitudes towards others depending on the social position hierarchy. This unconscious behavior points to the level of superiority in terms of social level among, not only humans, but other relative primates. This was illustrated by examples of unequivocally nonverbal cues exhibited by facial expressions (eye contacts, smiling) portraying submissiveness toward others or acceptance of superiority for those who are more accomplished on a social basis, all of which happens unconsciously. Another interesting aspect of the subliminal mind is our perceptual biases and propensity to favor those who are similar to us, or as it called in the book “group members”. We tend to treat our fellow group members differently from those outside our group without us being aware of this distinction. In fact, group social identity becomes unconsciously discriminatory even for very minute details.Many of us identify ourselves as being objective when we evaluate a certain phenomenon or ideology, but are we? At times we tend to persuade our conscious mind into believing that our judgment is not based on our personal opinions and that it is solely based on objective reasoning, but in reality this is not the case.The book follows these sort of topics and there a lot of examples of experimental tests carried out by psychologist with surprisingly fascinating results"
25,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2011817-misty,5,I'm completely fascinated by the human mind and this book does a great job explaining the science and studies that prove how in control our unconscious mind really is. See the top reviews for great point by point reviews of the content.

31,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59129824-mihai-rosca,4,"I would like to start this review with the words of another reviewer, part from laziness, part because of the fact that I agree with him:""If you are looking for a book on how the unconscious mind both benefits and deceives us, this is a good choice. Mlodinow has a sense of humor and writes complex subjects in an easy to comprehend fashion. However, if you’ve read up on the subject, you might not find much new here."" (https://berniegourley.com/2016/11/15/...)So, that being said, I give it a thumbs up, it's a good book. It left me with some cravings for stuff like diving into methods of tapping the subconscious like creating lucid dreaming or reaching that deep meditation point which goes beyond conscious mind. It's a book that makes you aware of many aspects of your daily life that you would not pay attention to otherwise. It teaches you to question some decisions and to keep your feet on the ground in many situations. And if you are anything like me and want some actionable points, here's what I extracted from the book:1. Always trusts your instincts. They are your subconscious trying to tell you something that you don't know and that you could use in that situation. 2. Don't always try to assume you know why you took a decision. Most often than not, we try to rationalize a decision that was taken by our subconscious. It's ok not to know why we do everything we do, try to live with the feeling rather than rationalize it. It would be like trying to pull nails out with a measuring tape – you would simply not be using the right tool. 3. Be at ease if you forget things. Also, do not trust your recollections too much, they are always a reconstruction and not an actual replay of the facts. 4. You take a lot of nonverbal and paraverbal hints into consideration when communicating with other people. Some of them you don't even bring into your awareness, but still, they play an important role. Try to learn more about the subject so that you will be able to be more aware of why you are influenced one way or another. And don't obsess about being an expert, your unconscious mind is endowed with a very large map of these and not even the experts know all. 5. You ARE biased. Try to understand and accept yourself that way. The beliefs and norms of the society and of various influences permeate your frame of mind and make you take decisions that are influenced at a subconscious level in ways you do not perceive. If you want however to act against that, try to get involved into the subject towards which you do not want to be prejudiced about. By having experience about a subject you will be able to reduce the subconscious bias a lot. 6. You categorize by nature. That influences you when looking at an object or a person. So for instance, you perceive the date of March 31st as being more different than that of April the 1st, but you see more likeness in March 30 and March 31 or April 1st vs April 2nd. That also influences how you share common values of a group that you are a part of. And by group, I mean from being member of the Mile high club, the KKK, or simply just by feeling associated with the guys that drink single malt as a preferred beverage. Just by association you tend to see the IN group members as a more complex bunch and are biased towards liking the members more than the OUT group (at that can even happen if you dislike them as individuals!) 7. You have what the author calls “emotional illusions.” Sometimes you make a decision because you have an emotional experience associated with the decision scenario, but being in an emotional state that is unrelated to the decision still affects the decision. Example: an experiment was done by asking subjects positioned over a high bridge meant to increase emotional arousal some questions by a female interviewer. The heightened state they were in led them to mistaken the state with sexual arousal. 8. You have a self-serving bias (attributing positive outcomes to one’s awesomeness, while blaming external forces for negative outcomes) and no, you are not as good as you think you are at many of the things you tend to evaluate yourself as being over average. But that's ok, the bias is there to ensure your success, because only by being unreasonable can you persist long enough to make sure you sometimes win.Please feel free to add yours."
32,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24914252-yuriy-stasyuk,5,"This was a tour de force of the recent findings in neuroscience and psychology research as it pertains to our subconscious mind. I picked up this book by accident and did not expect it to sweep me off my feet. My copy is filled with over a hundred highlights and reading it led me to spend hours perusing studies cited therein. The book is easy to read and manages to synthesize hundreds of clinical studies in an entertaining - and even gripping manner.Some of my favorite takeaways include:While I’ve long known about false memories, Mlodinow highlights the psychological process, namely that its our expectations and beliefs that plug holes in our memories with “false memories.” In other words, we remember what we expect, not what is true. We have unconscious social programming, for example, in one study when asking to cut in front of someone at the printer, subjects were unlikely to get their way, but if they gave a reason, irrespective of how illogical it is, those standing in line accommodated. In another study, men were able to double their chances of getting a date by lightly touching the woman’s hand before asking. I'm notorious about trying to categorize everything, Mlodinow explains this is a strategy created by evolution in order to allow for faster access to memory. But this same cognitive shortcut is hijacked to create unreliable stereotypes. Most people have an inaccurate view of their competency, this I knew, but it doesn’t end there, in fact, having an accurate assessment of ones status and abilities actually leads to depression. Having an overestimated self-esteem is healthy And finally, a lot of common sense philosophy slogans involve some derivative of ""don’t trust your feeling,"" however, there may be something to the ""gut feeling"" after all. Our subconscious processes a lot of information under the surface and provides us with data drive insights that occur as ""gut feelings."" For instance, our subconscious can tell the difference between fake smiles and genuine ones based on the involvement of involuntary muscles in someone's face (even while such subtle differences are not usually noticed by the conscious mind). Essentially, don't always trust your feelings, but sometimes, they have a very good reason - even if we don't know it."
33,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56247859-hoai-thuong,2,"The author did a good job of opening a whole new world to me - unconscious mind. This is the first time I have seriously read a book about neuroscience, and it is truly challenging. It challenges our tendency tempting to overestimate conscious mind while overlooking the hidden layer within ourselves - unconsciousness. By addressing different common realms in life such as “In-group and Out-group”, “Memories” or “Self”, the readers are forced to reflect on their prior knowledge and assumptions. Is it true that we can control our mind? What would happen if we live without the unconscious mind? By this book, the readers are invited to not only work on those question by themselves but also re-examine their past experiences and behaviors. Honestly, this book is not my favorite for some reasons. First of all, the author’s writing style failed to keep me reading enthusiastically. Rigidly, the author merely exposes readers to information without expressing too much his viewpoints or showing his own experiments and data. I felt like it is not my obligation to read lots of experiments taken decades ago without any verification. One minus point of this book is how the author assumes readers have already known how to define “conscious and unconscious mind”. He failed to get readers on the same page, which leads to confusion and uncertainty. A limitation of “Subliminal” for me is that all of the sections only touches on “normal” human’s minds. It means that the author seems to focus too much on talking about the minds of healthy people living without any mental illnesses. It would be greater if I could hear about the operation of mind of those with depression or MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder). Interestingly, I started reading “Flow” when this book nearly came to an end. While “Flow” tells us to understand how conscious mind works for “optimal experiences” and says nothing about “unconscious mind”, “Subliminal” urges us to take it into consideration. Both of them tell me to do something, but it seems hard to me as I read “Subliminal” with impatience and boredom."

It's an exploration of the impact of those unconscious insticts on what is usually considered rational behavior.Mlodinow expects to illuminate the many ways in which a person's unconscious mind serves them. He presents the new concept of unconscious as crucial to our survival as a species.It's a fascinating insight into our inner unknown self and its role in shaping the world as we know it. The book is entertaining, and informative about an interesting topic about which I did not have much knowledge. Mlodinow's style is very instructive, he writes in a highly understandable way for all kinds of audiences, and so the book is very easy to read.It gets a little repetitive with its detailed description of hundreds of experiments. It would be better with more explanations and fewer examples. I find that many highly unnecessary, since a good part of them do not contribute with anything new."

Not a seminal work, but Mlodinow, though crass at times, is charming enough and injects some compelling personal anecdotes to bring the exposition together. I've been really interested in the subconscious mind lately as an explanation for many new age ideas (not that Mlodinow goes into that with any depth). There is A LOT we don't yet understand about the inner workings of the mind and it's really exciting to watch this field unfold. Ex. The case study of the blind man (due to brain damage, not eye damage) who was able to navigate his way passed obstacles he couldn't consciously see. That's nuts! I'm especially taken with the idea that emotional pain really is physical and that a tylenol actually helps a broken heart. I will definitely be applying that bit of advice in the future... "

As someone with very little grasp of mathematics, the numbers in the other were a little overwhelming. This, however, is a fantastic book which is accessible & useful to anyone. Fascinating stories & studies in which I learnt much about psychology & sociology. Read this book to learn more about your own mind and the world you live in, from social situations to politics."

I was thinking of this book as a tough neuroscience book with a bunch of academic words and difficult examples. It turned out that I was totally wrong, this book provides us a scientific explanation for human reactions in an easy way as the book “Plato and Platypus walk into a bar” explains philosophy. this book seems to be a combination of many different articles about our unconscious mind. However, it might be a good choice for non-scientists who do not focus on neuroscience. This book helps me to come up with lots of questions and ideas to research more. it’s like an introduction of many topics which have potentials to be investigated in the future. "

I've read a handful of these pop psychology books over the years and felt this book was a bit redundant, as a few of the noted studies had been covered elsewhere (people switching places while asking for directions, drawings that trick your eyes into seeing multiple images, the Nixon/Kennedy debate). Yet there were still enough new, interesting things I learned that made me go, ""huh!"" Some of the studies are quite frightening, like how people are heavily influenced to vote just by looks. You ding dongs! In the end, this was an enjoyable enough read. Overall, I think I enjoyed The Drunkard's Walk more. "
45,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3082950-tomislav,4,"Leonard Mlodinow is a physicist and a writer of popular science, best known for The Drunkard’s Walk, about probability. I read this book because I am interested to learn psychology as science. I started on an education of engineering and science from freshman year of bachelor’s degree, neglecting social studies subjects. Later, in my career I found myself working in biomedical applications including the fMRI scanning of the human brain. This book is divided into two sections. Part 1 regards recent updates to the science of mind, in particular the relatively independent function of conscious brain and unconscious brain (I prefer the term subconscious brain). While fMRI shows both are activated during many thoughts, they do sometimes have coordinated or conflicting impact. This was the material I was most interested in. I was somewhat disappointed at the hands-off level at which fMRI was described – It is an interesting application, and I was expecting more from a physicist. Yet, the anatomy and relationship of two tiers of brain function is also a fascinating subject covered well in the book.Part 2 is more of a series of groupings of behaviors such as would be covered in psychology 101 (which I never took way back when I was young). These curiosities seem suitable for cocktail hour discussions, which is to say very light weight. Of these, I found the chapter on emotions to be the most important and interesting. It will change the way I think of my own emotions.Here are my chapter by chapter notes:1	The New Unconscious. Subconscious thought is not repressed consciousness, but structurally different and separated brain activity. The description of economic decision making reminded me of the failure of the idea that people will make financially rational choices in health care if they are made responsible for the spending.2	Senses Plus Mind Equals Reality. Most examples involve vision. blindsight is unconscious vision without conscious vision. hunches are unconscious decisions without conscious decision.3	Remembering and Forgetting - A lot of interesting cases and studies about the inaccuracies of observation, and the deterioration and mutation of memories over time. But I was disappointed that the analysis remained ""black box."" Psychologists performing creative behavioral experiments on subjects. I was looking for something more physiological, perhaps involving the two-tiered brain structure described previously.4	The importance of Being Social - Speculates that intelligence developed as a by-product of the survival benefit of social interaction, about 50,000 years ago. Until the 1990s, science was limited to the results of behavioral experiments. With use of fMRI, it's possible to observe brain function non-invasively. Offers an extremely simplified explanation of fMRI. Introduces the term Social Cognitive Neuroscience.5	Reading People - Part 2 seems to shift to more of the day-to-day impact of subliminal communication, and less anatomy/science. Three types of nonverbal language - #1 body movements (facial expression, posture), #2 paralanguage (quality/pitch of voice, use of um), #3 proxemics (use of personal space).6	Judging People By Their Covers - subtleties of voice and touch.7	Sorting People and Things - the necessity of stereotyping.8	In-Groups and Out-Groups - the impact of being in a group or out of a group. Objective distinctions not important.9	Feelings - An important chapter. Emotions come from both the subconscious and conscious minds. Freud was wrong - no amount on conscious introspection will address the reasons for emotions that are rooted in the subconscious. We retrofit socially acceptable reasons to justify them."" emotional illusions can be the result of perceiving the physiological ""results"" of an emotion in one's body, and assuming that emotion.10	Self -We practice motivated reasoning, rather than objective reasoning, but only to a limited extent. This was of survival benefit as humans evolved. Even today it is of value. The remaining 40 pages of the book are footnotes and index."
46,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867629-justin,3,"Another book about brains and neurology and really interesting scientific goodness. At first glance, this book appears to be a pop-science treatise on a hidden subconscious personality driving our decisions; the cover makes a tongue-in-cheek reference to this. However, the book turned out to be a detailed analysis on how our “unconscious mind” really works, and how it fills in the gaps in our conscious thinking and reasoning.Rather than trying to make a case for a hidden version of ourselves that can be directly appealed to, Mlodinow explains the automatic processes our brains undertake in order to make our daily lives bearable (e.g. how it fills in visual information to compensate for constant retina movement and the optical nerve blind spot). He draws a fascinating picture of how adept our brains are at dealing with hundreds of tiny details like that, every minute of every day, so that we can consciously enjoy the illusion of perfect memory and flawless logical reasoning. As one might expect, there is a downside to this high volume of unconscious data processing, which usually manifests as assumptions we make without thinking and prejudices we don’t realize we have. This is a scary thought to most of us, and yet these assumptions and prejudices have served us well since the days when food and shelter were our species’ only concerns. Mlodinow lays out a series of scientific studies that give specific examples of these potential pitfalls; some are hilarious, and others are quite sobering.The book is fairly short, and I enjoyed it overall, but it did seem to slow down a bit in the middle. The material is occasionally dry, though that won’t be an issue for those who are interested in the subject matter. The scientific studies get a bit repetitive in the way they are introduced and dissected. I suppose my biggest complaint is that there’s a feeling of disconnection throughout the book, or at least a feeling of not-quite-connection. Mlodinow is writing around a single theme, but I had trouble finding a cohesive message. That feels like an unfair criticism of a scientific nonfiction book, but I’ve recently read some very engaging nonfiction that didn’t follow a narrative, so I know it can be done. I just wanted to be engaged a little more than I was. That being said, this book reads like a gradual unboxing of the various cool and not-so-cool stuff our brain does while on autopilot, which is fascinating all on its own and worth looking at for any science nerd. Also, I recently revised upward a review I did of an earlier Mlodinow book which which I had the same problem (fascinating, but not engaging). I did this because in thinking about this book, I realized that I’m still thinking about that book, three years later. There’s a wealth of information here that could (and should) carry over into day-to-day thinking, so maybe my future self will come back to scold me for being a bit stingy in reviewing this book, too. "
47,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4235397-sarah-clement,4,"I've read quite a few books now about various aspects of our unconscious minds, but this is certainly one of my favourites. Mlodinow really has a way of writing about topics that are at times complex while maintaining levity and clarity. Although many things I had read elsewhere, like in Invisible Gorilla, Mistakes were Made, How We Decide, the Republican Brain, etc. But I still learned quite a bit reading through this book. I certainly enjoyed his discussion of motivated reasoning more than I did in the Republican Brain, which probably has a lot to do that in that section - and throughout the book - he gives pretty equal treatment to all human beings. One thing that I found quite different in this book than the others was that it was written more with an inspired tone, with an appreciation for how crucial our unconscious minds are in getting us through life, and why we evolved to be that way. He even discussed studies I had read about before, but looked at them through a new lens. I think that's one of the best things about the book. Hands down, though my favourite information was about racism and stereotypes. I found it absolutely fascinating, particularly because he's not just talking about the overt, politically incorrect stereotypes. He discusses how skilled we are at playing up differences and minimising similarities when we are motivated to do so (and how we have no idea we are doing it...which is a general theme in this book). It was only then that I understood why an Aussie can make fun of my vowels or a term that I use for something for 10 minutes, yet be incredibly offended at the suggestion that an American (gasp!) doesn't think moving to Australia was a big cultural adjustment. They think it makes me arrogant, but I am in a position where I am trying to find common ground because I am an outsider. And for them, the act of simply that admitting similarities between the two countries threatens their identities and requires processing a lot more complexity. Maybe it's just because I've read a lot of these books now, but I wasn't faced with the same existential crises as I read through the book. This was helped, of course, because he ends on a very important note: our illusions about ourselves serve many purposes, but above all one of the best things is that they can make us happy. So no, we don't have to believe we are the second coming of Jesus, but instead of being ashamed when we overestimate our abilities, we should celebrate what doing so does for us. While this was framed differently in Invisible Gorilla (illusion of confidence, I think?), I think both books make valuable points. Too much confidence can make us painful to be around and lead us to make mistakes, but it can also provide us with the resolve to keep trying, in the face of all evidence. "

49,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51945942-anais-ovanessoff,3,"I have not yet really explored reading non-fiction books, until now. I picked up this book in the store, hoping that I might find a beginning of a passion for psychology, which I knew I had already had somewhat of an interest in. 'Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior' by Leonard Mlodinow taught me a lot about the unconscious mind, which was very interesting, however there were definitely some aspects about the writing style that I found rather boring.Throughout the book, the author writes about different aspects that our unconscious mind plays a role in, and relates those to stories of his own, social experiments, and court cases. I found these parts of the book fascinating; especially the court cases that involved issues caused by actions taken/thoughts lost by the unconscious mind. These were primarily the most interesting parts of the book in my opinion, that made me want to continue reading. I also found that I was able to relate lots of the information in the book to myself and the world around me. I was able to recognize a few things that I do and think of or forget, that I have not recognized before. It also gave me insight as to how attitude affects action, and how it is extremely significant to stay positive in order to succeed.What I found I struggled with while reading this book, was being able to stay focused on the text. I found that I think I personally prefer stories, and books that have one plot. I had trouble staying focused when reading so many facts, because I found that I was not as interested. It was not as much of a 'fun' read for me. This, I think, is an amazing book for those who are solely looking for a book to learn about the details of the unconscious mind, and the psychology and medicine associated with that.I continued to read this book because I found that I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the types of situations that the unconscious mind is involved in, specifically in some of the stories given as examples. My dad also always discussed how the unconscious mind plays a role in everything and how attitude is key, so I thought that I might learn some more about what he is talking about through reading this book. All in all, the writing style and information in this book is aimed towards those who might be interested in going into a field of psychology or neuroscience. I would not recommend this for anyone looking for a 'fun' read. "
50,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23524001-sam-woodward,5,"The last few years have seen numerous books published on the scary extent to which our actions are determined by our subconscious drives, yet few are as charming & accessible as this one. Haidt compares our mind to the relationship between an elephant (the unconscious) & its rider (consciousness) - the rider struggles to steer the elephant but if it decides not to co-operate, there's little he can do except stick around for the ride. Mlodinow emphasises that this contrasts with the Freudian notion that our conscious mind directs & controls our actions, dominating our instinctive desires unless we succumb to 'temptation'.Here, Mlodinow tells us that modern-day fMRI brain scans & more sophisticated psychological experiments have overturned the Freudian view, based as it was on limited data, & provided much insight into the nature & extent of our slavery to subliminal processes. The book is littered with fascinating examples of this, such as how blind taste tests demonstrate that people cannot tell the difference between expensive & cheap wine, yet if you tell them how much it costs then the more expensive the wine, the more of their brains' pleasure centres will be activated, giving them more physical enjoyment when they drink it. It's incredibly tempting to rattle off several more of Mlodinow's anecdotes here, which I will no doubt be boring my friends with for weeks to come!While other books like The Undercover Philosopher are somewhat dour, miserably telling us how stupid our species is & how awful it is that we can never rely on our own judgement, Mlodinow approaches the subject with a charmingly light touch. Not only does this make his book a more pleasant read, it's also wholly appropriate - our innate instincts are a quirk we can only accept & be aware of; becoming depressed over them won't benefit us in any way. Thus he injects a sense of wonder reminiscent of a Derren Brown show.Mlodinow's numerous fascinating examples make this a particularly accessible & empathetic book on this fascinating subject. It covers ground covered in many other works (touching upon concepts central to Richard Wiseman's Rip It Up, for one of many examples) yet succeeds in being much more accessible & readable than most. Highly recommended."
51,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Each of us is a rational, keen-eyed, clear-headed captain who pilots the ship of self through the sea of life…right? It sounds good and has been the accepted paradigm of human existence for millennia. It’s also a fundamental assumption of many social sciences and of our own self-image. As the old saying goes, why let a few sordid facts spoil such a beautiful theory? Unfortunately, it’s an awful lot of sordid facts, and Mlodinow presents dozens of studies, all fascinating (in a perverse sort of way, of course) to try to undermine the gleaming pedestal of selfhood.The unconscious mind he talks about isn’t Freud’s or Jung’s. It’s simply the parts of the brain that manage, without conscious oversight, the thousands of things per second that need attending to for us to stay alive—heartbeat, breathing, balance, eyesight, hearing, walking, weaving through a thick forest or a sidewalk crowd, steering a car, and so on. Some of these things we can consciously control, but usually we run on autopilot. Mlodinow shows that the unconscious mind also makes many of the decisions we think we arrive at consciously and rationally: who we date, which car to buy, where we apply for a job, who to hire, when to buy or sell stocks, and so on. Although we are quite sure we consciously make these decisions on specific, known criteria, hard science proves over and over again that the decision is made before we become aware of it, and the conscious mind then comes up with a plausible explanation for the decision and, in hindsight, mistakes the entire process for rational choice.It’s humbling, but it can also be risky. Our brains evolved in prehistoric times along a path that helped early humans survive long enough to bear and raise children in that era and environment. In evolutionary terms, civilization has existed for perhaps one percent of human history, and so the unconscious mind is ill-equipped to make important decisions about modern life. And yet it does. This book can help us see the pitfalls of such decisions and perhaps avert some of our personal disasters.As usual, Mlodinow’s writing is lively and easy to follow, and the book is entertaining as well as enlightening."
52,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/700357-ladiibbug,5,"Non-FictionExcellent eye-opening book laying out information discovered by scientists and researchers on our unconscious minds, made possible by the fMRI (Functional magnetic resonance imaging) which emerged in the 1990's.The fMRI ""maps the activity of the brain's different structures by detecting the blood flow that waves and wanes, just slightly, as that activity varies"". Scientists can obtain a three dimentional picture of the working brain, inside and out.The unconscious has been proven not to be as Freud described it, such as a boy's desire to kill his father in order to marry his mom, or a woman's envy of the male sexual organ.The current view of the neuroscientists is that ""mental processes are thought to be unconscious because there are portions of the mind that are inaccessible to consciousness due to the architecture of the brain, rather than because they have been subject to motivational forces like repression.""The unsettling fact is that scientists estimate that ""we are conscious of only about 5% of our cognitive functions. The other 95% goes beyond our awareness and exerts a huge influence on our lives -- beginning with making our lives possible."" (p. 34)The information is easily understandable to the reader. Details of research studies clearly show there is something BIG at work behind our minds, as we know them.I was particularly interested in memory, how two or three different people could experience the same thing, and have totally different recall of the facts. After reading this book, now I'm not so sure that I in fact remember very clearly and correctly many experiences in my past, and that I am right, and other people's versions of events is 100% wrong.There's so much brilliant content in this book that I will buy a permanent copy. This is a book to keep close, to reread over and over, to highlight and study.If you've ever wondered ""how can she DO those things"", ""how can he NOT realize his upcoming marriage will NEVER work out"", ""why does she REFUSE to deal with facts, and hold a view that flies in the face of a truckload of facts"", or ""how could I have SAID that?"", read this book."

I like how the author Mlodinow wrote the book in a lightly humorous way where he made the content appropriate and educational while also being an entertaining experience. This made the book very easy to read. This humor was brought in from the beginning as one of my favorite parts in the book was when the author's mom's pet tortoise, Mrs. Dinnerman, in an enclosure in her backyard where the trapped turtle always tried to escape,""The tortoise is as brave as a POW"" (Mlodinow, 12). It's also interesting to learn some of the crazy things that our mind does, in terms of perception, such as seeing things when they aren't there. Also, from this book, I find it really amazing behind what our mind goes through to see such things like illusions, almost like being able to experience the impossible. This book I should say is more of a general psychology book since it hits on other topics such as motivation and behavior, yet ties those topics together and describes truly ""How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior."" The book also hits on the rock-hard science behind the process and function of our consciousness describing how, but not always why, things work. In way, this book shows how an individual's point of view affect the way one deals with conflict by proving that you don't have to even be consciously aware to problem solve. Human instinct has evolved to deal with most types of daily conflict but since the point of view of the conscious mind functions off of learned information, it can be concluded that when one realizes to trust both views at that point will then be unstoppable. I recommend this book to those whom enjoy learning, and those who don't like learning, but just want to read a good book. "
54,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18503741-jared,3,"Subliminal is a book that I picked up on a whim. (I wanted to read something besides my usual topics of history, political science, etc). This book gave me a lot of insight into how decisions are made and why we come to the conclusions that we do. You would think that people are fully aware of why they do what they do, act how they act, perceive how they perceive, judge how they do, but the truth is likely far from that being the case. In many social situations, the author contends that we somewhat adhere to a script. We follow a world view that is largely affected by our experiences, biases, fears, hopes, view of self, desired outcomes, partial information, etc.The funny thing is that we seem to do this especially when we have a lot of things going on or when we don't have a complete picture of the happenings of our lives. We partly do this out of evolutionary need to make quick decisions (""Should I run from this bear?"") or unfamiliar or incomplete information (for example, meeting new people at a party). Not surprisingly, people have an inflated sense of themselves and their skills and tend to downplay their faults.I enjoyed the author's colorful examples and explanations of various psychological concepts that I have never been exposed to before. The book is a quick read (only about 220 pages) and was enjoyable. I did not feel annoyed by the unfamiliar terms and the author does not make the reader feel dumb because he/she is not a theoretical physicist like he is.I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever unintentionally missed a turn because they are so in the habit of going to work instead of somewhere else. This book provides a lot of 'aha' moments and will make you wonder why you do what you do."

Subliminal is a tour de force of psychology research, covering theoretical, experimental and biological discoveries, outcomes and future directions. Despite the considerable academic heft that Mlodinow lends to the subject, the complexity of the topic leads to an entertaining yet ultimately unsatisfying magic 8-ball-esque answer, ""reply hazy, ask again later."" Mlodinow's primary thesis is that of motivated reasoning. Since the evolutionary mechanisms that guided the development of our gray matter were tuned for our survival rather than unfettered cognition, one of the principle roles of our mind is to make sense of the chaos and uncertainties around us by neatly employing contradictions, logical fallacies and incongruities when necessary. As a consequence, Mlodinow cites literature that postulates that nearly all of our conscious thoughts are the product of a subconscious piecing together meaning from disjointed information pouring in from our senses. Subliminal is a fascinating read that will make you rethink how you think."

It's focus is on how the brain works and what makes us act the way we act on a daily basis. Leonard Mlodinow speaks on how your unconscious mind actually has a lot more of an effect on who you are then you think. He explores many different aspects of human behavior such as social interaction and decision making. He gives an insight on what the brain is doing and why in many situations you encounter every day.As I read the book, I was intrigued with how readily useful the information I learned was. Leonard walks you through the steps that the brain takes when doing certain things and many different biases that we as humans have developed. You will learn about manipulation, dominance, and he even touches briefly on how to read people. It's just a matter of understanding the human mind and this book does so flawlessly. It's a must read if you are interested in why people do the things they do."

It is a grandiose subject and by no means I wanted to invest time reading about this subject to later discover flaws in the research or gaps in the underlying data. I'm glad I conquered those fears.This book is a serious compilation of respected research done on the inner workings of the mind. While a lot of what it covers is admittedly inconclusive, a common trait in this complex topic, the reader is left with a strong understanding about fundamental observations made on the way humans behave and its correlation to the brain ""machinery"".A good part of the conclusions are common sense, however the fact that scientific research backs them up is a welcome confirmation. The author is clear minded and the reading is fluid. Very good job.I would recommend this book to anyone looking to develop their understanding of human behavior and characteristics based on actual data."

It was very difficult to read through it and it took me a lot longer than it usually takes me to read a book. I think it just had to do with my personal preference though. I like to read fiction, and not so much nonfiction books, but I thought that I would have loved this book because I have a very huge interest in psychology. This book helped me to realize that was not the case.I did like how Leonard Mlodinow gave very many examples in his book, because the examples helped to explain what he was talking about. I also enjoyed the pictures in the book because I am a visual learner and it helped even more in explaining things."

But, of the books I picked up that day, this wasn't the first one I turned my attention to.What it is, though, is an engaging read and chock-full of anecdotes and experiments that reveal how much our brains automate our existance. This is the kind of book that you'll find yourself reporting on to spouses and friends as you read: ""Guess what I just learned in my book. . ."" or ""Did you know. . .?""I don't know how much of the material would be new to an armchair neurologist / psychologist, but if you're just an armchair student of the world, I suspect it's the book for you."

The ""casual arrow"" in human thought process constantly tends to point from belief to evidence not vice versa. It turns out, the brain is a decent scientist but an absolutely outstanding lawyer. We choose the facts that we want to believe. We also choose our friends, lovers, and spouses not because of the way we perceive them but because of the way they perceive us. Unlike phenomena in physics, in life, events can often obey one theory or another, and what actually happens can depend largely upon which theory we choose to believe. It is a gift of the human mind to be extraordinarily open to excepting the theory of ourselves that pushes us in the direction of survival, and even happiness. "

Many of the studies talked about I had already read about somewhere on the internet, and for whatever reason I was hoping a 200-page pop-psychology book would go deeper. Maybe I was lured in by the subliminal messages on the book cover (I'd say I read this because I enjoyed The Drunkard's Walk, but this book tells me that might just be me trying to reason ex post facto after my subconscious feelings to pick up the book).The message is that while we don't always consciously truly understand our actions and decisions, we evolved to be this way for a reason (survival). Everyone over-estimates their abilities, and if you don't you're a depressed loser who would have died quickly in the Stone Age. Sigh."

The author uses great examples of studies to prove his points throughout the book and really delves deep into the science behind our unconscious mind. He proves how our unconscious makes a lot more decisions in our life than we really account it for, and ways to overcome the subliminal processes that in other ways, we can't control. I think this book is a great overview of the complex tasks of our mind that most wouldn't be able to relay in simple, understandable terms. The use of explaining each scientific study really helps break down, in my opinion, such complex theories of this rather new research into the unconscious mind. "

There are a solid seven or eight truly interesting experiments described in this book, and I definitely feel I learned something.

I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in how we make decisions, or why we feel and think what we feel and think, or what's really going on in our heads when we interface with the world around us."

The central theme is that our unconscious brain receives and processes a lot of data and selectively passes a small fraction of it to the conscious. This explains our occasional unexplained but often accurate hunches, which our conscious brains find surprising. Lots of interesting scientific anecdotes are scattered through the book. Having read Koch and Sacks, I was familiar with some of the stories. Also I am surprised and mildly shocked that some of the other reviews liken this book to Malcolm Gladwell style works."

Not only are there things in here that will really change your perception of the way your mind works (the chapter on memory was my favorite), but the author is also hilarious and very good at explaining the concepts he lays out.

Interestingly enough, while supporting his argument ample evidence, statistics, and experiments, the author also reminds the ambiguous nature of the subject matter.

80,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85649072-investingbythebooks-com,5,"“Who is the boss between you and mommy?”“Who is the boss? You have to ask that? I’m the boss. Mommy is only the decision maker.” Woody Allen excels at portraying funny, pathetic and often self-delusional characters. These lines from the film Mighty Aphrodite are a case in point.After reading the book Subliminal by Leonard Mlodinow, Allen’s dialogue has taken on a symbolic meaning for me. According to Mlodinow, we are all delusional about “who” is in charge. You see, while you – that is your conscious self – are parading around calling yourself boss, all the real decision making is quietly handled by your unconscious. Your conscious mind merely gets to make up rational- sounding justifications for your choices after the fact but is happily unaware of its diminutive role.You may question why Leonoard Mlodinow should be the one to tell us how the mind works. After all, his academic specialty is theoretical physics where he has collaborated with the subject’s superstar, Stephen Hawking, for many years. But any doubts vanish when it becomes evident how thoroughly researched this book is. The science is utterly credible and is delivered with the same entertaining, exuberant style as his previous bestseller, The Drunkard’s Walk.Mlodinow has dug deeply into the burgeoning field of neuroscience as well as experimental psychology. The two combined are just now opening doors to vast new areas of information about how human decisions are formed. Modern brain-scanning equipment makes it possible to literally see what parts of the brain are doing the work. This has brought the role of the unconscious back in the limelight after decades of languishing as unfashionable leftovers from the Freudian era.Now, why should you as an investor be interested? After all, the book is almost completely devoid of any financial references. Well, for one thing, the majority of investors are trained in economics. Modern economics rely on the idea of rational choice, which according to this book is more of an aberration than a norm. The corollary is that most of our economic models need rethinking.Secondly, the book adds texture and credibility to many strands of behavioural economics. It resonates well with the notion of System 1 vs. System 2 thinking as popularised by e.g. Daniel Kahneman. A reader familiar with behavioural finance will find many passages that illuminate and add detail to its findings. With a bit of reflexion it emerges that our unconscious is the culprit behind many types of irrational investor behaviour, like overconfidence, stereotyping, framing and self-serving perception or memory.Thirdly and most importantly, the book fills a gap in the education of many investors. Most of us have spent years and years trying to learn various research techniques, valuation models, risk models and lots of other tools. And we continue to spend countless hours either perfecting those tools or cramming data into them. Yet all of these are in reality second-order tools in the investor’s toolbox. Our first and foremost tool is of course the mind we employ to try and interpret information and base decisions on it. The sad fact is that most investors never think to spend a minute on understanding the mind. As Mlodinow is keen to show us, the mind is well worth studying because with some effort, your conscious self can in fact claw back a little of that decision making from mommy."
81,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431677-tyler,5,"“The Latin root for the word ‘subliminal’ translates to ‘below threshold.’ Psychologists employ the term to mean below the threshold of consciousness. This book is about subliminal effects in that broad sense – about the processes of the unconscious mind and how they influence us.”Leonard Mlodinow (Mah-low-di-nahv) is a theoretical physicist who earned a doctorate from Berkeley. He is affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich, of which Einstein was once director, and Caltech, an institution that has produced over 30 Nobel Prize winners. His 2008 title, The Drunkard’s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives, was a New York Times notable book of the year. Along with Stephen Hawking, he’s coauthored both A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design. Of the latter, celebrated biologist Richard Dawkins has said that it helped “kick God out of physics.” As it relates to his new book, Subliminal, all of this is vital if only to assure you that the onslaught of research results on which he builds his arguments are methodologically sound, even if they seem to fly in the face of expectation.With Subliminal, as with all of his books, Mlodinow sets out to untangle the bewildering world of specialized science. Specifically, he manages to provide a brief history of the development of the relatively young field of cognitive neuroscience, and he explains how the efforts of those in the field have led to our current understanding of the incredible influence our unconscious brain has on our daily lives.An accomplished neuroscientist in his own right, Freud eventually turned his attention to psychology, where he was able to develop his notion of the subconscious. His story went something like this: there are two layers of human consciousness, only one of which is directly accessible. He thought this inability to access certain motivations resulted from repressed desires and memories, and that, through determined introspection, one may eventually come to understand these underlying directors of our behavior. This theory was soon met with rejection, as some rightly accused Freud of simply making this stuff up without any verifiable proof for the existence of a phenomenon like repression. In fact, as Mlodinow mentions, Freud’s work has influenced far more fiction than experimental research in psychology. “The current revolution in thinking about the unconscious came about because with modern instruments, we can watch as different structures and substructures in the brain generate feelings and emotions,” Mlodinow says. Perhaps the most vital of these instruments, the fMRI machine, wasn’t available to researchers until the 1990s. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is a procedure that measures brain activity by recording associated changes in blood flow. Previously, most of our knowledge of which parts of the brain were responsible for what came primarily from studying subjects with brain damage. Now, we can simply watch brain regions light up when subjects are stimulated, which can make for startling research.One study utilizing fMRI technology sought to uncover the way our brains process the monetary value of something in relation to the pleasure we report deriving from it. Experimenters gave subjects two types of wine, one priced at $10 a bottle, the other priced at $90. The trick was that the two wine samples were actually the same wine, identical in every way except their price. The resulting fMRI images showed that drinking the “more expensive” wine led to increased activity in the area of the subject’s brain called the orbitofrontal cortex, a region we know to be associated with the experience of pleasure. They all claimed to prefer the more expensive wine.The book is full of this stuff – detailed descriptions of carefully controlled studies that reveal our conscious selves to be almost totally governed by our unconscious desires and intentions. For me, the most shocking studies discussed in the book have to do with in-groups and out-groups. We’re Americans, they’re foreigners; we’re liberals, they’re conservatives; we’re from Michigan, they’re from Ohio; we’re on this team, they’re on that team. It seems this stems from our brain’s propensity to categorize, to lump things together that share some similarities and treat them as if the individual things (or people) are more alike than they actually are. Studies show that we all do this, no matter how adamantly you insist to be the exception. The power of this propensity is striking.Consider the following:A controlled study on public service announcements found that an ad that simply denounced littering was effective in inhibiting littering. However, if the same ad ran with the addition of the line, “Americans will produce more litter than ever!” this actually led to an increase in littering! How can that be? It’s because the phrase identifies a certain activity as a norm for a type of in-group, Americans. Apparently, the normal behavior of our in-groups is so influential that, even if we consciously denounce an activity as immoral or illogical, we still fall into that behavior!Apparently, simply being reminded of our particular in-groups can have measurable effects on our performance. Consider this: three groups of Asian women were given questionnaires intended to remind them of one of those in-groups (Asian or female). Keep in mind: Western stereotypes hold that Asian’s are good at math, while females are bad at math. One group was given a questionnaire full of questions meant to make them think about their racial heritage, the other group was made to answer questions relating to their gender. The third group, the control group, was asked about their cable provider. After the questionnaires had been handed in, the groups were given a math test. Those in the first group, the “Asian” group, outperformed the control group, which in turn outperformed the “Woman” group.What’s so incredibly strange about these results is that there appears to be no minimum requirement for us to feel as if we’re part of an in-group. Studies show that “It is not necessary to share any attitudes or traits or even for you to have even met the other group members. It is the simple act of knowing that you belong to a group that triggers your in-group affinity,” according to Mlodinow. While I was most fascinated with the studies related to groups, another section of the book discusses at-length the phenomenon of “emotional illusions.” I won’t bother sharing the details of more studies, but those described in the book indicate that our most “human” experiences are mostly, if not entirely, dictated by the unconscious. In the lab, it’s very easy to make someone believe they’re happy or angry when they have absolutely no reason to be. Researchers asked students of Dartmouth and Princeton to review a game (the sport escapes me) played between the two schools nearly a decade before. They asked them to evaluate the teams as it pertained to them playing fairly: the degree of malice apparent in their fouls, etc. Not surprisingly, Dartmouth students rated Princeton more malicious, and vice-versa. This led one of the researchers to conclude, “There is no such ‘thing’ as a game existing ‘out there’ in its own right which people merely ‘observe.’” This is part of what the book is about. Sure, it’s a not-so-subtle knock on free will and autonomy. But it’s also very much about the ways our brains go about receiving and interpreting data, the “mistakes” they make in the name of survival, and the strange impulse we have to pretend to know more about ourselves than we really do (even if we don’t know we’re pretending!). If you like facts, and are interested in knowing yourself better (by way of knowing well how poorly you actually know yourself), you should definitely read this book. When I wasn’t reading it, I wanted to be. Leonard Mlodinow is a great writer, and this stuff is vital. "
82,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1438068-joyce,3,"Oh this book probably deserves a 4 but it bored and annoyed me. Bored more than annoyed. Not it's fault really, as it does what it says on the tin regardless of the silly subliminal messages flashing on it. I admit I stopped reading before the last chapter finished. I said no. My urge to be complete lost to my urge to read many other books calling me. My TBR is too large and I am too old to waste time on books that annoy and bore me.The boredom comes from a repetitive scientific tone that drags at me. To be fair he has some great anecdotes, and I think I'd love to sit in a cafe or bar and chat with him about all this. But mostly the book threw a lot out there and I wanted to shout ""SO WHAT!"" if you don't do anything with it then why throw a lot of facts at me. The annoyance is less his fault and more my own. I am at a stage in my personal development where as a middle-aged educated, well-traveled woman - I am sick of the reductionist nonsense that has ruined science and led to a mind boggling level of arrogance that somehow our culture and way of doing things is superior to everything else. I am tired of it. I am tired of breaking everything down into component pieces and then stepping back and announcing ""there! see what I did"". Yes dear. I'm the mother of a boy. I know boys. They like breaking things - takin them apart, finding out what's inside. And then they are baffled and mournful when the thing doesn't work anymore. A few of them grow up and discover systems theory and there is much rejoicing. But most of them linger over the reductionism. They keep breaking things, hoping it will help them figure it out. A few of them turn it into a religious crusade, but I won't be in the same room with that lot. They are loud and boorish and typically the worst of the male half of the species if you let them rail on long enough.It's particularly awful when it's applied to psychology (I'm looking at YOU Mr. Freud) but hopefully we've gotten past all that nonsense. But still trying to fit psychology and the subconscious into little boxes by breaking it apart is going to be something they get on at over and over. Meanwhile they stand around amazed in deep arguments over whether anything non-human can qualify as having a level of consciousness because THEY determined consciousness needed a brain and spinal column. Ahhhh the arrogance of the human species. Ahhhh the arrogance of reductionist western culture. Ahh the arrogance of the modern mindset. I'm off to better things...."
83,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37175639-danny,4,"It has become all but sure, among scientists, that people are not nearly as in control of their behavior as they believe they are. This is because science has uncovered more about the inner workings of the human brain, and demonstrated that the unconscious mind has more influence over our thoughts and actions than the conscious mind. In many ways, this is an unsettling thought. In other ways, scientists have been able to aptly demonstrate that the conscious mind can, through awareness and the use of logic and human cooperation, overcome the unconscious mind in many ways. For example, shared experience has been shown to drive sympathy, which can overcome prejudices instilled by the unconscious mind as a defense mechanism. The problem, of course, is that most people simply do not care enough how their beliefs and behaviors form to really do anything to ensure that those beliefs and behaviors are more objective and functional and fair minded. So, despite evidence, people tend to twist things towards their preferred ideals and behaviors, not only to their own detriment, but to the detriment of society as a whole. In this book, Mlodnow, an experimental physicist, explores these issues, and details many studies and research initiatives which have proven the power of the unconscious mind. We are grand self-manipulators. At points, he offers suggestions for people to be more self-aware, and to take steps to ensure that the conscious mind and the unconscious mind can be made to work together. I enjoyed the book quite a bit. It might be a bit heavy on detailing experiments, and a bit light on applying the information to effective recognition, but most of the latter should be easily deduced by any thoughtful reader. The book is a real eye opener, especially for the way people perceive their own political beliefs and make political arguments; studies suggest that we almost always ignore proper logic in order to maintain our own preferred political bias. This trajectory appears to only be getting worse. It's a book I'd have every politically motivated person read, but I'm left with the frustration that most don't care enough to change the way they think. It's a depressing thought, but a good book."
84,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95724993-linh-vo,3,"This book actually gives us a clear thought about the conscious and unconscious mind play important roles in helping us making decision. It has two parts, the first is “The Two-Tired Brain”, which distinguishes the conscious from the unconscious and the factors that contribute to how we think and decide, and the second is “The Social Unconscious”, which talks about how we categorize everything in our lives and how our physical and emotional responses affect each other.The first part has four chapters that will lead readers through the distinguish between the conscious and unconscious mind, after that with some examples of real-life cases and experiments, Leonard Mlodinow guides us through how we remember and forget things. In this part I found it very interesting because little did I know that the unconscious plays a very important role in whether to remember or forget, or remember things truthfully or as what we want it to be. The fourth chapter in this part provides us with some example of being social and not being social, what are the pros and cons of each choice and how we believe in ourselves and others in our society.The second part includes six chapters, it can be seen that the second part is a more specific and categorized explanation for the first part. Leonard gave us examples and conclusion of the ways we use to read other people’s mind, “judge the book by its cover”, or the feelings we have. The last chapter has a very interesting example of the differences between the scientist, who would get to know as much as possible before coming to the conclusion, on the contrary, the lawyer makes up his/her mind first and then find evidence to proof it. It can be seen that the scientist is more prone to the conscious mind and the lawyer is more prone to the unconscious mind.The purpose of the book is not to define whether it is right or wrong, good or bad following the conscious or unconscious mind. It just gives us how the two minds go back and forth in our everyday lives without us noticing they play important roles. And since this is a pretty two-sided book, not so much conclusions are written in this book, instead of that are a lot of examples and cases, which I sometimes found a little boring just to read so many examples."
85,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57081516-yiya,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Subliminal. Or... did I? I must have, right? Otherwise, I wouldn't have already gotten to the last chapter. And can't help writing a review now. That must be a good sign, that must mean I really enjoyed it. (Take that with a grain of salt as Mlodinow, the book author suggested we could be disguising ourselves when asked to explain why we like certain things.)After reading this book, I don't know if any reasons I have behind any of the things I do stand true anymore. So I'll leave it like that.On a more serious note, Mlodinow really made me think and reexamine my motives behind everything I do. Our brains are a meaning-making machine, it's constantly making things up to fill in our tendency to seek meanings and make sense of the world. You will be surprised at how much everyday things we do and believe, the decisions we make are our unconscious thinking at work, even though we'd like to believe otherwise. Even though this book belongs to the Science category, I find it easy to digest as both a ""non-science"" person and non-native English speaker. It has a fascinating relation to everyday psychology and has lots of applications to our everyday life. Reading this book has sparked and consolidated my love for neuroscience and psychology. Did you know that we are all judgemental, prejudiced, and discriminatory at a deep, unconscious level? I certainly feel relieved to know now that ""if our mind's natural view of the world is skewed, it's skewed for a reason."" Blame evolution. ""We observe ourselves and the world and make enough sense of things to get along. Some of us, interested in knowing ourselves more deeply--perhaps to make better life decisions, perhaps to live a richer life, perhaps out of curiosity--seek to get past our intuitive ideas of us. We can. We can use our conscious minds to study, to identify, and to pierce our cognitive illusions. By broadening our perspective to take into account how our minds operate, we can achieve a more enlightened view of who we are. """
86,0307378217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7231894-chris-branch,3,"A enjoyable presentation of some of the less intuitive ways that the human mind works. It covers some of the same ground as books such as Eagleman's Incognito, Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kurzban's Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite, and plenty of Steven Pinker's writing. So while I'd read about many of the referenced studies previously, Mlodinow contributes a lively discussion and clear explanation of the topics, and I did learn of several new things I hadn't encountered before.At this point, I don't need to be convinced that we think we're being rational in many cases where we're actually behaving according to unconscious biases and self-serving motivations. Of course we all still fall prey to the behaviors and their justifications - this isn't something any of us can easily dismiss. But given knowledge, we can make small steps to address this, and beyond that it's at least intellectually satisfying to understand what's happening, even if we can't completely avoid it.Recommended as an introduction to the topic, and I'd suggest following up with the Kurzban book as well as others mentioned above for further depth."

The concept of a subconscious and conscious guiding our day to day behavior then doing a deep dive into the subject matter was a bit intense, I enjoyed the intellectual challenge of it. I would consider this a ‘heavy’ book and not a light read, but your mind will expand.The power of your subconscious can tilted in your favor, I would say by consciously putting yourself in activities that boast your self image and increase your confidence thereby you subconsciously on a day to day basis act it out consciously. In short why think poorly of yourself consciously when you can think better by having your subconscious do better for you, somehow expose yourself to material that is more inspiring and motivational for example. The book goes over how the subconscious affects us from eating a small plate rather then a large plate will help us eat less, the voice we have, our appearance, our posture and body language can all make an impact on how others view us and make decisions about us subconsciously. The effect of touching someone for example is powerful in them feeling closer to you, or by being apart of a ‘in group’ of any type you will naturally get a more favorable response. The other concept that I found interesting was that of categorization and how humans generally use it as a survival mechanism due to such an excess of information bombarding us daily, however it can also lead to lazy thinking. I would say the big takeaway from this book I took is try to be a little more objective consciously because of the effect the subconscious is possibly having on me and also guide my subconscious to help me become the best version of myself.

He begins by providing a historical background of the field of psychology and certain scientific figures that helped shape it, including the introduction of the ""New Unconscious"". The book itself is split into two parts, one part named 'The Two-Tiered Brain' over the conscious and unconscious, and the second part over the 'The Social Unconscious', which applies the first part to society. As informative as the book was, I found the writing to be meandering and without directions. Though it was an entertaining read and packaged useful information in an engaging way, there were too many anecdotes, studies cited, and random analogies that had little to no connection with one another. Often times, the author would switch mid-story to explain a concept with no segue way or proper transition for the reader to follow.  That being said, the various tidbits and details offered for a multitude of information. Each and every page could standalone, not requiring any context. It was easy for me to resume reading where I left off because I did not need to remember the previous page to continue. There are many types of sciences in the book, such as psychology and neuroscience, and many of the studies are from the social sciences. A lot of scientific phenomena such as the fluency effect, anthropomorphizing, the role of the limbic system, social pain/touch, false memory, emotional illusions, etc. It was very informative. Overall, I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys psychology and trying to understand the inner workings of the mind. But I would only recommend it to beginners in the subject. It's an engaging enough read that would entice laymen to comprehend the subject. For many of my classmates who have taken AP Psychology or classes that teach neuroscience, what the book discusses may be common knowledge."

The author presents enough historical information to orient the reader between Freud and the present day, often surprising with his description of how much has changed in the last fifty years. Where once we imagined ourselves in control of our thoughts and decisions (especially voting preferences, though Freud allowed us little control at all), now we’re presented with experiments which show that control manipulated in the simplest (scariest) ways. Which, of course, could leave readers imagining a hopeless world where only those with power and money to manipulate can succeed. But there’s more to it than that, and our weaknesses can also be our strengths.As an aspiring (dreaming) author, I found the section on how we delude ourselves, overvaluing our own skills and undervaluing others’, quite depressing. But it’s followed at once with the story of persistence rewarded—our very self-delusion keeps us going. So I’ll persist, but perhaps with a bit more knowledge than before. Even if my cynical conscious self denied the value of some of the experiments , I still really enjoyed the book and couldn’t stop talking about it. However, please don’t force me to choose which jam I prefer, because I can promise I’ll change my mind in an eyeblink.Disclosure: I didn’t see the subliminal messages on the cover. If I had, I probably wouldn’t have bought it. But it was next to a book on a similar topic on the bookshelf, so I bought them both."
