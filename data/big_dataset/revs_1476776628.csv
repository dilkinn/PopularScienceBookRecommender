0,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"I feel so disappointed. It was like being a kid and getting a half eaten chocolate Santa on Christmas as your only gift. This seems like a book half written. When I got the the end, I just sat there in completely disbelief. Some parts of this book are exceptional. For example, this is an incredibly detailed and informative history of how scientists and the public came to understand the tree of life, how our understanding changed to see it as a web, and finally, merely a starting point with no shape. In many ways, biology mimics physics in this regard. Newton gave us the laws of the universe that work very well on the larger scale, but when you dig deeper, it is clear that the very small has quantum rules all its own. A similar thing is going on with the tree of life. The tree Darwin played around with works very well for later evolved species. We can, with great success, trace our ancestry back to earlier branches. However, when we get to the earliest species on the tree, archaea and bacteria, there was so much horizontal gene transfer (bacteria and archaea swapping genes instead of handing them down through generation) that we cannot trace a universal common ancestor. This story needed to be told. The only problem is, this story really wasn't told completely! And what a shame. Parts of this story never made it onto the page. This seems to be because Quammen wanted to focus on a biography of Carl Woese. Woese was a pioneer who discovered archaea and fought for their place on the tangled tree. He went to war with giants like Lynn Margulis, George Fox, and so many others. All of that was essential to include. However, there was a shocking turn of events when Quammen wrote about visiting Bill Martin (who he refers to as William F. Martin, and not Bill, which seemed odd to begin with). It was almost as if Quammen didn't really understand the work Martin has devoted his life to. Quammen talked about endosymbiosis being a single event; so he understood that part of Martin's research. He even discussed hydrothermal vents, but not in relation to Martin's work and discussed it so very briefly and it was clear he wasn't making the connections he was supposed to. He wrote about Martin and then *immediately* discussed that Woese guess that the RNA world is the correct hypothesis of how the first cells came to assemble. Did this just not come up when he spoke with Martin? I find that almost impossible to fathom. I find Qaummen not having read Martin, Russell, or Lane's work on the origin of life almost an impossibility. But yet, it seems he really wasn't familiar with it. Quammen went so far as to say he thought Woese was probably right about the RNA world. He then said that other people disagree but didn't say *how* they disagree. He never talked about Martin, Russell, and Lane's work (among others) who accounted for the energy needed for the cells to assemble. He never quite showed an understanding of how the hydrothermal vent hypothesis (or other processes that focus on the laws of thermodynamics and can show how free energy was available for the assembly of RNA, DNA, amino acids, fats, etc) challenge the RNA world hypothesis (and for damn good reason). I kept thinking, ""Oh he must be saving Martin's objections to the RNA world for later in the book."" Later never came. There is too much missing in this extremely important story to rate this book well. How we view the tree is extremely important. So, I appreciate how much detail was included. There are incredible sections about the work of Margulis. She really got her due in this book. Quammen wrote about the things she got right and what she got wrong, but he had equal respect for her and her male peers. I don't find this is always the case and was extremely happy to see how he managed her story. His sections of horizontal gene transfer were some of the most important sections included in this book (but probably could have been done better). His depiction of the many fights people had over the tree (is it a web, 5 kingdoms, 3 domains), and if we should even call archaea bacteria (no, we should not) were great. The sections on Darwin, and even Woese hatred for Darwin, were wonderful. Jumping genes and how they created a womb were all top notch, and things the public really needs to know. Quammen even included exciting little tidbits, such as how sponges can be both a multicellular organism and yet a single cell organisms if the environment dictates (but this really lacked the wow factor that other writers have managed to capture) or the tale of wolbachia, one of my very favorite bacteria, who control the sex of the new wolbachia produced (again, told in much more captivating manner by Ed Yong, who Quammen recommends reading, as do I).But none of his spectacular writing made up for the loss of what was missing from this story. I appreciate that Quammen chose this topic at all. But, I was left feeling like I do when I read a NYT science article that picked up the ball and ran with it before it was ready. When I finished this book, I found myself wishing, so desperately, that Nick Lane had chosen to write about this subject. It would have been a much better (more complete) book. "

2,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"National Book Award Longlist for Nonfiction 2018. Wow—where to start? Probably the most ‘blow your mind’ thing is that 8% of the human genome originated in virus genomes. This is just one of the insights resulting from scientists studying molecular phylogenetics, where the study of DNA and RNA in different species allows them to discover the evolutionary relationship among them. One such retrovirus genome fragment is found in placentas and helps to transfer nutrients between the mother and child. So—this is a retrovirus genome fragment that humans have benefitted from. However, other retroviruses aren’t so benevolent—they are found in some leukemias and HIV. How did viruses get into the human genome? Through a process call horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This is a process whereby genes pass on genetic material directly and is absorbed into the new DNA and can then be passed on vertically from parents to offspring. Not surprisingly, HGT is more prevalent in simpler life forms, like bacteria. So—remember the many bacteria species found in the human GI tract? Now, what happens when an antibiotic-resistant bacteria finds its way in your small intestine? There might be some cute little viruses there too. And they help to transfer that resistance to many of the other bacteria. The result is the avalanche of bacteria species that become resistant to that antibiotic.There are some biological forms that are particularly susceptible to HGT; things like rotifers. These guys look like microscopic sucking organisms and feed on bacteria, algal cells, small protozoans and organic detritus and are probably prevalent in our rain gutters. They absorb all sorts of genome bits and they have been shown to transfer those to fruit flies.In addition, Quammen covers the discovery in 1977 by biologist Carl Woese of a third domain of living organisms, which he called Archaea. These microorganisms were once considered a form of bacteria, but its cell walls are completely different, allowing it to live in extreme environments like hot springs and salty ponds. Further, its DNA is in some ways closer to the domain Eukarya (organisms like us with cells with a nucleus), than regular bacteria (Eubacteria).Be reassured, Darwin’s 1837 Origin of the Species is not dispelled. It just got more complicated. Highly recommend."
3,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,3,"99th book for 2018. This is a captivating history of the changing ideas surrounding the evolutionary tree life, from Charles Darwin to the latest findings in computational phylogenetics. Quammen writes really well and the story and it's complications are fascinating. However, the books flowed is damaged as Quammen attempts to write a second book - a biography of Carl Woese - within the first which breaks up the flow and distracts from the central story of the book. Without all the needless additional information on Woese I would have rated the book higher (did I really need to know over many pages that in his last years he hated Darwin and thought he missed out on a Nobel? Or that he liked to host BBQs and liked to pontificate about subjects when drunk?). Somehow Woese becomes THE central figure in this book, the reasons for which Quammen never bothers to explain.Worth a read, but could definitely have used a more proactive editor.3-stars."
4,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106293767-bill,4,"Popular science writer Quammen states that ""three counterintuitive insights, three challenges to categorical thinking about aspects of life on earth"" are among the most essential points of this book.
Species: it's a collective entity but a discrete one, like a club with a fixed membership list. The lines between this species and that one don't blur.Individual: an organism is also discrete, with a unitary identity. There's a brown dog named Rufus, there's an elephant with extraordinary tusks, there's a human known as Charles Robert Darwin.Tree: inheritance flows always vertically from ancestor to descendant, always branching and diverging, never converging. So the history of life is shaped like a tree.Now we know that each of those three categoricals is wrong.
Unaware that these ideas are now considered wrong, I was interested in Quammen's review of how our understanding of evolution has been significantly revised by research on DNA, RNA and the discoveries of, among other things, archaea and horizontal gene transfer (HGT), mostly all since I took high school biology in the 1970s.The book covers the science, in a way I found pretty easy to understand, but it's essentially a group biography of the large cast of scientists who played roles in the history of evolutionary science. Given how many fascinating figures feature in this story and their many contributions, I think it was a mistake for Quammen to cast microbiologist Carl Woese in a starring role; neither his science nor his personality seem to warrant such treatment, nor did the book benefit from it.I can't give an unqualified recommendation, e.g. readers more current on developments in evolutionary science probably can pass, but it was a good read for me because I learned quite a bit."
5,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72907701-dax,4,"Really interesting stuff. Unless you are fresh off a molecular biology class, you will struggle to keep up with the terminology, but Quammen does a great job of simplifying things and clearly illustrating the implications of each new development and breakthrough. You do not need to have a strong biology background to enjoy 'The Tangled tree', but you should know going in that the scientific studies covered here focus almost entirely on bacteria and archaea, rather than plants and animals. The final chapter ties everything together and focuses on what this all means for humans. Where do we come from and where do we go from here. 'The Tangled Tree' doesn't necessarily answer these questions, but Quammen gives us a good idea of the possibilities.The good news is that you can now think of yourself as a super-organism rather than an individual. Feels kinda nice."
6,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"Not sure how radical it is, The Tangled Tree is an up-to-date account of evolution, or it is about the evolution of our scientific understanding of evolution. The principals of Darwinian evolution still stand, however, the details have been reworked. New discoveries are powered by DNA sequencing starting from mid-1970s, and mostly in the field of molecular phylogenetics. Several topics covered in the book:-- The discovery of Archaea as a separate kingdom by a group of scientists lead by Carl Woese-- The discovery of Mitochondrion and Chloroplast as captured bacteria; they may have been captured by ancient eukaryotic organisms, or co-evolved from some even more ancient life form into today's eukaryotic organisms as we know of.-- Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in natural world is much more common than scientists used to think-- HGT played and still plays a very important roles in bacteria evolution-- We human (and other animals on earth) contain ""alien"" genes too. About 8% of the human genome arrived not through traditional inheritance from directly ancestral forms, but sideways by viral infection—a type of HGT.-- A brief mention of CRISPR gene editingMostly because of HGT, life on earth is not a clear branched tree. Instead, it is a tangled 3D web.The book contains 84 chapters. Sometimes it feels repetitive. It could be better organized. The author covered a lot of scientists. It's a mini-biography of Carl Woese. Another scientist mentioned repeatedly is Lynn Margulis. The author did not spare us with the less glorious side of scientific research. You read plenty of ugly human competition and conflict in the academia world. I like the philosophic question the author brought up in the end: what are species, category and individual? How different you and the human being sitting next to you? What makes a human human?"
7,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith,0,"I guess what I really wanted was a magazine article with conclusions. This had much more biographical information than I wanted. Actually, it had much more of everything than I wanted. I assume that I am not the correct audience for this book. "
8,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8760701-jrendocrine,2,"I was very disappointed with this book. It is not what it boasts of being (book blurb ""There's no one who writes about complex science better than David Quammen""). As a biologist who was taught the usual prokaryote/eukaryote tree in college (a long time ago) I was excited that someone was setting out to explain archaea, the ""third domain"" for me --Here Quammen is mostly bent on Carl Woese, whose life was dedicated to putting archaea on the map. The author goes a bit further, but not in any cogent way, to talk about horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT is not really Woese's story at all so that was really messy! But in truth, I found the all the science superficial at best, and the relatedness of one chapter to another was sketchy. I barely have a feel for archaea after reading every one of the 400+ pages. HGT and CRISPR-cas I know much more about - and I found his coverage of it rudimentary. In truth, every chapter is 4 pages or less. This is an excuse for the author to never go into any depth - each short chapter starts with a completely irrelevant description of some peripheral scientist's career, who s/he knew, what gossip was up about them before going into a small snippet of their science. Which brings me to my conclusion that Quamman is mostly interested in gossip. How people looked, who knew who, what was scientifically explosive. He could have walked into any lab to see a bacteria, but he had to fly to some restricted facility to see some special bacteria (I can't remember what it was) which I'm sure looked exactly the same in a frozen plug in liquid nitrogen as any e coli in a zillion labs. This flight/story/bacteria had no point. The book jumped the shark for me when he went into a description of what a pike was - in describing a very peripheral scientist's character as pike-like (or something). Quamman tries to make Woese out to be some mythical guru - but I sure wasn't convinced. He did things in his biological career to colleagues that were frankly ungenerous and cruel. His hatred of Darwin - who fergodssakes is dead - was pathological (like Trump yelling about McCain). The absence of his wife in the story suggests either Quannum just didn't bother, or there was something even more terrible afoot. Frankly I see very little to admire in Woese, or his career - at least as related by this author.Why did I keep reading? I was waiting for the archaea - I'd paid for the hardback - I thought maybe i'd learn something about HGT. I didn't. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone interested in science. I'm surprised that that it's gotten such high praise. "

Also https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... Both 2 star reviews, and Tony has been a reliable source for me in the past.OK, and my two previous tries of Quammen books were duds, too.

10,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"The “tree of life” is an ancient metaphor. Even Aristotle wrote about a scala naturae or “natural ladder of ascent,” a hierarchical depiction of the relationships between the objects of the world. In his notes Darwin sketched a tree-like diagram, an early speculation about all living things connected by diverging lineages, the basis for his theory of evolution.Quammen neatly folds this historical context into a narrative that links research at the cellular and molecular level to a startling new understanding of evolutionary process, an understanding that could no longer be depicted by a tree. The familiar model of evolutionary process is of course that of natural selection. Random genetic mutations nudge changes that favor some new characteristics over others in sync with gradually changing environmental conditions.Old species lines die out; new ones flourish. The idea of new species was in itself revolutionary. In the past, species were considered unchanging entities. That viewpoint was endorsed by centuries of theology. Darwin, Mendel and Linnaeus. Those are the three big names I learned in grade school. But back in the 17th century, Leeuwenhoek had observed single-celled life forms. Were these the primordial basis of all life? A closer look revealed some fascinating problems. Microbes come in all sorts of shapes and structures. They inhabit even the most hostile environments. Some microbes, bacteria, even lacked a nucleus. This was also the case for blue-green algae now known as cyanoalgae. Were cyanoalgae plants or animals? In 1956 microsomal particles called ribosomes were observed via the electron microscope. Protein blueprints were transmitted from DNA via messenger RNA. In a cellular organelle called the ribosome, the message was decoded. Those decoded instructions directed the construction of a specific protein. A researcher named Carl Woese was curious. Could comparisons of the composition of RNA indicate the lineal relationships between various bacteria? He made this study his life's work. His lab developed a technique for identifying the proteins comprising tiny fragments of structural RNA. On examining the structural RNA fragments of methanogens, microbes that oxidized hydrogen and carbon dioxide, he found unique RNA sequences that did not resemble either microbes with nuclei (eukaryotes) or bacteria (microbes lacking nuclei (prokaryotes)). He proposed a 3rd “Kingdom”: archaea. Other physiological anomalies supported this construct. Archaea had a unique lipid chemistry and cell wall construction. The revolution was just beginning! The second major contribution that overturned conventional wisdom came from the research of Lynn Margulies. In 1970 she published “The Origin of Eukaryotic Cells.” Other cell organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts. How did they come into being? Margulies proposed that a cell could absorb but only partially break down a bacterial cell. The bacteria's genetic material could be repurposed in a process called endosymbiosis. More questions. How often could this happen? Which organelles could this process account for? Were these bacterial remnants the genetic material found floating in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus? Was this the process that produced bacteria from Woese's archaea? In addition to the “3rd Kingdom,” HGT (Horizontal gene transfer) became part of the lexicon of evolution theory. Quammen details the painstaking experiments conducted to prove these hypotheses. He adds biographical details gathered not only from research papers but from interviews with researchers' colleagues. Those details add an element of drama to his narrative. He succinctly summarizes in memorable prose the key accomplishment of a number of scientists. Robert Whittaker, a plant ecologists,  “began to challenge a canonical principle in his branch of science: the idea that plant communities are stable, highly integrated associations, with consistent species compositions, clear boundaries, and hard reality as units, almost as though they were living organisms....He showed that plant communities are loose associations, not integrated units, with blurry boundaries and a 'low degree of reality.'” (p.187) Lynn Margulies:  “'The evolutionary pattern is a web –the branches fuse, like when algae and slugs come together.'” (p.158) James Brown and Ford Doolittle compared 66 proteins and showed how they evolved within different lineages. “The logical conclusion was that genes have their individual lineages of descent, not necessarily matching the lineage of the organism in which they are found.” (p.281) Nigel Goldenfeld and Carl Woese boldly asserted:  “'Among microbes, HGT is pervasive and powerful....The available studies strongly indicate that microbes absorb and discard genes as needed, in response to their environment.' Because of that genetic fluidity, the two men argued, the concept of 'species' is useless among bacteria and archaea.” (p.330)All too often scientific discovery is condensed into lists of researchers, dates and so-called breakthroughs. Quammen captures the dynamic quality of scientific research. He is even able to insert some elements of humor into these endeavors. Quammen conveys a sense of excitement, prompting the reader with new questions that arose after each seemingly definitive experiment. These questions give his narrative momentum. At the same time, he keeps each chapter brief as if knowing his reader needed to catch a breath before moving forward."
11,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,5,"A large part of the book was about Carl Woese, a character who was odd, but about whom I really could not care. He used early, difficult sequencing techniques to identify the Archaea, an entirely separate form of life, different from bacteria, plants, and animals. But since this was already old news when I had Bio 101 in 1990-91, I already knew about the Archaea, and the details of its discovery and identification just weren't that riveting the way they're presented here.More interesting -- although, again, already known to me, and not that interesting in the details of its discovery, was the realization (in 1944) that it was DNA that could transform a benign bacterium into a virulent one, through ""infective heredity."" (225). The interesting part of that was how early this was known, how early we knew how difficult it would be to keep ahead of bacteria in the resistance area.But then things get interesting. I didn't know the overall phrase ""horizontal gene transfer."" Transformation, in the above sense, was one (transfer of genetic material from a dead bacterium to a live one). A second was conjugation, a sort of ""sex"" between bacteria. The other involves viruses carrying foreign DNA into the cells they infect, called transduction (227).Evidence of bacteria that were resistant to various antibiotics *before* the human populations in which they were found were exposed to those abx -- because they are derived from plant compounds in the first placeMaurice Panisset, in _A New Bacteriology-, made ""the case that all bacteria on Earth constitute a single interconnected entity, a single species - no, wait, maybe even a single _individual_ creature -- through which genes from all the variously named 'species' flow relatively freely, by horizontal gene transfer, fo ruse where needed"" (252) (a ""superorganism"" idea related in spirit, but not particulars, to Margulis's Gaia hypothesis and the idea that mitochondria had once been free-living bacteria"" (253)And when they started looking, scientists found horizontal transfer *everywhere* -- bacterial genes in fish and plants (255). Sea urchins one to another, though their lineages had been separate for 65 million years. E. coli to a fungus, brewer's yeast. (some microbes are eukaryotic -- so they come in three flavors, since there are also bacteria and archaea). Bdelloids (which have only females, having gone without sex for 25M years), scientists have ""found all sorts of craziness that shouldn't have been there. More specifically, they found at least twenty-two genes"" from bacteria, fungi, and plants. A few were still functional. 8% of bdelloid genes had been acquired from bacteria ""or other dissimilar creatures"" (258).One parasitic bacteria infects the germline (eggs) of insects, and has managed to get itself included in the host's genome -- one fruit fly has incorporated *the entire Wolbachia genome* into its own DNA (262). The same researcher found that bacterial DNA can be found in normal human genomes, but they are ""210 times more common in tumor cells than in healthy cells"" (263). ""In leukemia cell genomes, they found stretches resembling the DNA of Acinetobacter bacteria, a group that includes infectious forms often picked up in hospitals. In the stomach tumor genomes, they found pieces suggesting Pseudomonas . . . "" The genome of one cabbage-related plant is 18% bacterial. A fungus contains 850 genes from bacteria and archaea. The human genome contains 263,000 letters of bacterial DNA transferred from our mitochondria (endosymbiotic gene transfer) (294).And there's more: in one study, researchers looked at the genomes of 2,235 complete bacterial genomes, half o fthem closely associated with humans, along with their ecological (where on/in the body) and geographic (where in the world) provenance. They looked for close matches in the genes, which would ""signal a relatively recent horizontal transfer event for that gene"" (325). They found 10,770 incidents. What predicted transfer? ""The shared ecology of the human gut, or the vagina, or the nasal passages, or the skin, was most conducive to horizontal transfer. The shared phylogeny of membership in the same bacterial lineage came second. The shared geography of the same continent was a weak third."" (326)Dunning HOtopp's research faced ""adamant resistance among a few influential biologists, including some Nobel Prize winners, to her and her colleagues' discoveries of HGT in the animal kingdom. 'No, it's got to be an artifact. You have to be able to explain it some other way.' Animals don't experience horizontal gene transfer, period. Humans, certainly not.""'Do you ever say to them, ""Is that a faith-based statement?"" I asked. What I meant was: it seemed almost as though the Weismann barrier had become a theological dogma.""She mused about that for a moment and allowed that some scientists did appear to be more religious about science than about religion. A touch of faith-based genomics? 'I think it is,' she said."" (264).Jim Brown and Ford Doolittle looked at 66 different proteins ""that are essential to all forms of life, and at the different variatns of those proteins as reflected in more than 1,200 different gene sequences, from a wide variety o fbacateria, archaea, and eukaryotes. They constructed an indvidiual tree for each of the sixty six proteins, showing how it had evolved into distinct variants within different lineages of creatures. Brown and Doolittle compared the variants, constructing an independent tree of descent for each. This exercise yielded a telling point: the trees didn't match. The logical conclusion was that genes have their individual lineages of descent, not necessarily matchin gthe lineage of the organism in which they are presently found. [As] Robert Feldman [said], ""each gene has its own history."" (281)And so the tree of life has been redrawn, more as a weird, tangled shrub or ""reticulated tree"" (285)"

Genes don't move just vertically. They can also pass laterally across species boundaries, across wider gaps, even between different kingdoms of life, and some have come sideways into our own lineage—the primate lineage—from unsuspected nonprimate sources.""

With genes flowing sideways, information moving across boundaries, and energy flowing upward from cells through communities and environments, the concept of an organism—an isolated creature, a discrete individual—seemed less valid too."" ""Among such simpler microbial creatures...horizontal gene transfer is far more important, in quantity and consequences, than imagined previously. Its impacts could be understood in four ways. First, new genes received by sideways transfer, from a different lineage or species, may allow a population of microbes (the recipient bug and its offspring) to colonize an entirely new ecological niche. Second it may allow organisms to acquire a new sort of adaptation abruptly, without passing through the dangerous stage of being only half adapted to one situation or another. Third, this transformation happens fast compared with incremental mutation, which proceeds slowly. Fourth, HGT is a 'font of innovation', bringing drastically new genetic possibilities, new supplies of variation, on which natural selection can act. All four kinds of impact are interrelated and represent overlapping perspectives on the same phenomenon."" ""Linnaeus also gave a half column to what he called Paradoxa: a wild-card assemblage of mythic chimeras and befuddling but real creatures, including the unicorn, the satyr, the phoenix, dragon...""

15,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,4,"This is a book at war with itself, trying to be many things at the same time. It is a well-written examination of evolution, the inadequacy of the standard tree metaphor for it, and the messiness of gene transfer. Quammen explores horizontal gene transfer and the uncertainty in what a species actually is, what an individual is (with all the little cells that live in us but don't share DNA). This is timely and fascinating stuff.It is also a biography of, and tribute to, Carl Woese. I hadn't known of Dr. Woese before reading the book (I'm not a biologist), but he's the one who first expanded the types of life beyond the original two, to include archea. He was a pioneer in genomic evolution, i.e. studying how closely related organisms are by looking at their DNA. His story fits into what I otherwise see as Quammen's main point because his work and discovery complicated the idea of the tree of evolution and helped people to see the connections between very different forms of life. But Quammen spent a lot of time researching Woese, talking to people who knew him, trying to get the essence of the man, to the point that this becomes half a Worse biography and it takes away from his main point. The second half of the book is stronger than the first, because we get closer to modern history and the astounding discoveries made in the last 30 years or so, but with every new topic, Quammen returned to Woese, checking in to see what he thought of it. And, well, in most cases, Woese was a crotchety old man working to protect his legacy and feuding with anyone who disagreed with him. So yes, I very much feel like this weakened the book.Whole chapters about Woese could be removed and the book could be improved and shortened. But I still give it 4 stars because of how well they key chapters on gene transfer are written. I learned some things, and that's always a good thing. He also spends quite a bit of time introducing us to biologists working in these fields, and that's well done as well. He keeps returning to the tree metaphor, and that results in a couple rather amusing interludes regarding imaginative topiary hobbyists. His final chapter is the best, I think, and I wish it were the introduction. Maybe I would suggest reading it first. He says that he has worked to show us that three fundamentals of biology -- species, individuals, and the tree of evolution -- are misleading at best. He spends most of the time in the book on species, then on the tree, and least on individuals (although he recommends I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life for more detail on that subject, and I can't agree more). And for that, I highly recommend the book. But it will help if you're either intrinsically interested in Woese or maybe skim over his biographical sections.I got a copy to review from Net Galley."
16,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12162514-graeme-newell,4,"New advances in genetic research are facilitating a massive rewrite of the story of life. Peeking inside DNA and RNA is changing our understanding of how life developed.We’ve always been taught that bacteria came first, then plants arose, and finally animals. The new evidence is scrambling this traditional view. Research suggests that animals came before plants. These animals then on-boarded a chloroplast and thus could generate their own energy supply. The big realization is that bacteria, archaea, viruses, animals and plants have all been swapping huge amounts of genetic code throughout time. As a matter of fact, the entire “tree of life” metaphor is proving to be a misnomer. 8% of human genetic code comes from viruses. How did it get there? Sneaky viruses found a back door into our genome using a process called horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Genes don’t need to be transferred from parent to offspring. Other life forms have regularly commandeered our ancestor’s DNA and melded their abilities with our own.We might think this is a really bad thing. Viruses like HIV that modify host DNA can bring on fatal consequences. Most of the time this scrambling of the genetic code had benign or detrimental effects on the host. However this merging also facilitated the development of some wickedly handy human traits. Retroviruses that attacked our distant ancestors found a way to assure their survival by modifying the host’s DNA. This assured the invading virus would not be attacked by the host’s immune system. Well it turns out the same viral DNA fragments found their way into human placentas and assured that a mother’s immune system didn’t attack a developing fetus as an external invader. Thank you retroviruses for facilitating the evolution of live birth.Another surprising thing I learned was that our ancestors were also mightily shaped by symbiosis. For example, a cell would ingest or be invaded by an outside organism. The two organisms would discover they were a stronger pair if they teamed up. For example, one creature might be good at energy conversion; the other might be great at locomotion. The previously individual organisms would then meld into a single entity.Quammen takes us through all sorts of strange organisms that defy classification such as a tiny organism that finds oxygen toxic, breathes hydrogen and exhales methane. A snail exists that uses photosynthesis to produce energy - a creature that’s part plant, part animal.Finally, one of the most interesting things that I learned was the mechanics of DNA extraction. After a lifetime of watching news footage of lab technicians using those long glass syringes to inject strange liquids into gelatin, I finally understand how that whole procedure works.  Quammen is a very skilled writer with a limber vocabulary. He made an intimidating topic like biochemistry approachable for non-scientists like myself."

If more science books were so rich with stories of the scientists, more students might be riveted to classes in genetics and evolutionary biology.I cannot imagine the years of research that must have gone into the writing of this book. Interviews with authors living or then-living, now-dead, bring to life the drama and controversies and obstacles that beset even a rational scientist. Never mind scientific objectivity; emotions, and ambitions, fly high in humans of every field of endeavor.I have hundreds, literally hundreds, of passages in my Kindle, highlighted, waiting for me to share, but there is that disclaimer about not sharing an ARC because this isn't the final version. So let me just say Karl Woese. O Karl!I wanted to understand the sideways evolution thing. I wanted to be a doctor, back in the day; then a coroner, at least; but my fascination for science was never paired with a mind capable of grasping the mathematical intricacies. Which reminds me of Karl Woese, turning to a mathematician, not a biologist, to help prove a theory he had been working on forever.Later, I might take the time to pull passages and rave, rave, rave over the details. If you find them too much, you can always skim past some of the biographical information and cut to the chase, the science, but then you may not find enough science left over. I'm thinking I need to find a Genetics for Dummies book that sticks to the science, skims past the personalities, and helps me tell someone what the heck I just read. Sadly, I am not able to sum it up off the top of my head. Books like this, I have to revisit, repeatedly, before it sinks in.Oh, I know people who can read a chapter once, never give it a second glance, and score 100% on a test over the chapter. I am not one of those people. (Dr. Mat Weekly, can you copy some of your brain cells and do a genetic transfer over to mine?)Yes, I'm thinking of getting him a copy of this book, but I'm not sure I want to hear how elementary and ""easy"" it is for people who really have the brains to fathom the stuff I love reading about.This is a great book. I need to kee re-reading it, and I may need to find an easier book to explain it all, but this is still great! The narrative tone reminds me of Sam Kean (no relation to Carol Kean). Now, Sam writes in a way that doesn't overwhelm me, and he tends to keep his books a wee bit shorter and to the point.But, again, if this one offers too much, skim past the bonus material and hone in on the meat and marrow."

They can make amazing accessible magic from the deep knowledge without completely losing the essence of it. Most cannot. And then they end up with a very detailed or technical book, or with an extremely flat book that is mainly populistic. Astrophysics for People in a Hurry by Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the books that in my opinion loses the science on the way to popularity. This book had the opposite problem. The author does not want to lose anything, and instead loses any interest that could be found in the book or in the topic.For strong people that really want all the details it might be great. I found myself skimming and not interested. 2 stars for me.Here are two rare cases that are magical:The The Gene: An Intimate History by Siddhartha Mukherjee did a really good job and I highly enjoyed It.

21,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"There is no one correct way of dividing a world, identity is fleeting and reification leads to oversimplification. All of that is within this book as the author looks at where the incredibly interesting world of microbiology stands today and what it means for understanding our current understanding of the world we find ourselves in. I have read many stimulating books on the early 20th century development of quantum physics and gravitational theory and this book has that feel to it and lays out the recent and just as exciting history of why micro and molecular biology’s recent discoveries about whom we are and where we came from is just as exciting.I have to expand on my first sentence above because it might not be obvious how this book embraces that sentence in such a succinct way. First, ‘no correct way of dividing the world’, Darwin’s greatest realization was that there is no absolute ‘nature of things’ in and of themselves (i.e. ‘a unique world structure’ or an unique ontological foundation), essences are human imposed order on to the world, and for his theory to work ‘species’ needed a fluid nuanced definition and its own inherent truth was a myth (‘essences’ and species are not things they are human constructs). Even though Darwin titles his book ‘On the Origin of Species’ he dances around the meaning of the word ‘species’ because without fluidity he can’t get to evolution by way of natural selection. Second ‘identity is fleeting’, the individual under consideration might not always be as obvious as common sense dictates. The author gave the example by asking is it the ant, the colony or all of the colonies that make the entity worthy of consideration, and the author made note of the ship of Theseus and its paradox as related to self identity of the individual. In other words, if we were to analyze every single oyster would we understand the oyster? Or as Nietzsche once mockingly said by way of criticizing philosophy ‘would we be any nearer to the truth of understanding women by asking every woman what they want’. Or, moreover, are bacteria best thought of as individuals or can they be thought of in their totality as one? Descartes takes the world away from us with his cogito by literally assuming it away, but Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Heidegger think we are not separate from the world and the world needs to be considered in order to understand our Being. The third item from my opening sentence is on ‘reification’. Is the map actually the thing? Or in the case for this book is the ‘tree of life’ such as nature demands it, or do we as humans make nature fit our model, the tree of life. I love Darwin and I love his book and I love when people say that they accept ‘evolution by way of natural selection’ as the best description to explain how life developed over the eons, but in reality the truth is more nuanced and especially for the first 3 billion years of life on earth and even in our more recent history (check out what the author tells the reader about the placenta and what we think we know about it!). The power plant that produces the universal currency of life by creating ATP (little battery like energy sources) by way of the cells mitochondria and are within all living creatures that have complexity with structure and that are more complicated than bacteria or archaea or fungi or blue-green algae and which are not plants (i.e. get their energy directly from the sun through chloroplast) for each and every eukaryote that has ever lived (humans are eukaryotes since we are made up of cells that usually have a nucleolus and organelles and mitochondria) or are alive today that original event of endobiosis happened only once in the history of the world (endobiosis is a big theme within this book and will be explained in great detail for the observant reader). The fact that event only happened once as stated in this book always floors me and anyone who thinks that the galaxy or the universe is teeming with complex intelligent life first needs to explain why that event only happened once on earth as far as we know today. The chapters on Lynn Margulis were fascinating and illustrated why this book was so very fun to read. First, I had no idea she was Carl Sagan’s first wife. She latched on to a concept that was only on the fringes of microbiology and made it mainstream. Scientists in general hate nothing more than to have their paradigms be overturned while an individual scientist likes nothing more than to challenge the status quo and overthrow a paradigm. Science knows itself by correcting itself. Lynn Margulis took what was known within footnotes and mostly obscure corners (including, most probably, a Russian pedophile) and popularized HGT (horizontal gene transfer) and gave it a pedigree that was lacking. Margulis is a scientist worth knowing and remembering, and oddly, she couldn’t help herself in later days by goofingly thinking 9/11 was an inside job or thinking HIV did not cause Aids (fringe thinking also, but wrongheaded). I had previously read Margulis’ book ‘The Five Kingdoms’, and therefore I have a bias towards how she sees the world and it explains why I think archaea are different from bacteria and prokaryote is the wrong label for them. I would recommend that book not to read but to look at the beautiful pictures of single cell life, and one day when you happen to be in a used book store do yourself a favor and pick it up at least to glance through. Overall this book doesn’t make a definitive statement on how many life kingdoms there are and how the tree of life should be designed. That’s a feature not a bug with this book because in the end there aren’t absolutely correct ways of categorizing the world or if there are we don’t know it when we get it right. I don’t want to give away the punch line in this book, but the very last sentence of this book made me laugh out loud, and will make you laugh too. "
22,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112117-christina-dudley,5,"Wow. A lot has changed since I took AP Biology in 1985-6! Back then it was classic Darwin and prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and the reason some bacteria were antibiotic resistant was because they were descended from the few survivors with some random mutation that gave them resistance. ALL WRONG. ALL CHANGED.This book was absolutely fascinating (if you like history of science) and biology and thinking about how we come to be where we are, biologically speaking. If you've never heard of molecular phylogeny or horizontal gene transfer, as I hadn't, the book provides clear and compelling explanations. I did ask my 17YO son if he'd been taught these things last year in his own AP Bio class, and I'm happy to report he was. Knowledge marches onward, though author Quammen is very clear that science is a messy, egotistical business, as are all endeavors involving human beings."
23,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"""Science itself, however precise and objective, is a human activity. It's a way of wondering as well as a way of knowing. It's a process, not a body of facts or laws. Like music, like poetry, like baseball, like grandmaster chess, it's something gloriously imperfect that people do. The smudgy fingerprints of our humanness are all over it."" - David Quammen in The Tangled TreeIn The Tangled Tree, popular science writer David Quammen gives us the history of a field of study called ""molecular phylogenetics."" Have I lost you already? Well, hang with me a bit longer; this is actually pretty interesting.In the late 1970s, a research team at the University of Illinois announced that they had identified a ""third domain"" of life. This ""domain"" was made up of single-cell microbes which they called archaea. They were genetically distinct from what were then the only two recognized lineages of life: prokaryotes, which include bacteria, and eukaryotes, which include plants and animals. This team was headed by Carl Woese, who Quammen calls ""the most important biologist of the 20th century you've never heard of."" (Even more interestingly for me, the team included as his chief assistant George Edward Fox, then a post-doctoral researcher and soon to be a researcher in biochemistry at the University of Houston, where he still serves.) Quammen spends a lot of time describing the life's work of Woese, who, in his telling at least, was the guiding force behind the discovery. Woese was undoubtedly a major contributor to the science of molecular phylogenetics, which essentially describes how evolution occurs at a molecular level and is not just vertical between parents and children but can also be horizontal (between species) through something called ""horizontal gene transfer"" (HGT). Unfortunately, late in life Woese turned into a bit of a crank who harbored resentments over slights - for example, the fact that he was overlooked for the Nobel Prize.Science is a human activity and humans are notably imperfect.One of the most intriguing offshoots of this new science for me is what it does to the old concepts (at least since Darwin) of species, individuals, and the evolutionary tree of life.First of all species: We think of species as being discrete, separate, identifiable. In reality, each ""species"" is a mosaic of species. Each living being is not so much a species as a community of species which live together in symbiotic relationships.Which brings us to the individual: Humans, for example. By the estimate of one research group, each human body contains 37 trillion human cells and 100 trillion bacterial cells! (Another study puts the ratio closer to 1/1.) We are host to other fellow travelers as well - nonbacterial microbes like virus particles, fungal cells, archaea, and other teeny bits of life. And all of these play their role in helping us to function. In helping us be human. These ""others"" that are a part of us make up an estimated 1% - 3% of our body mass.And about that tree: As Darwin drew it, it has distinct branches and twigs, but this isn't really how evolution works. In fact, the branches and twigs are all tangled and grown together, so that one species - human, for example - may be composed of more than 10,000 actual species living in our guts, our hair, our mucus membranes, our skin...Have I blown your mind now?This is truly an amazing story and Quammen does a commendable job of telling it in a way that can be (at least partially) understood by a reader with scant scientific training. He also gives us the personalities of the scientists who pioneered the new field, but one could argue that he is too gentle with them at times. Woese did turn quite paranoid late in life and grew to hate Charles Darwin, feeling that Darwin was hogging all the acclaim that he (Woese) deserved. And then there was Lynn Margulis, one of the women researchers who featured prominently in the book. She made important contributions early on, but she, too, turned quite dark at the end of her life, becoming a 9/11 truther. Quammen tends to present these as sort of lovable quirks of personality.Still, a fascinating book, divided into mercifully short chapters which make it easier to absorb. Moreover, each chapter ends in something of a cliffhanger that makes you want to keep turning those pages. And so I did and was surprised when it ended at 65% on my Kindle. The rest is all acknowledgements, notes, and bibliography. "
24,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,2,"It’s fine, I guess. It’s a nice summary of evolution and the ancestral trees of organisms, but I’m just not sure it delivers on the premise its title promises. What about this perfectly adequate “history of life” is at all “new” or “radical”? The information contained here will be familiar to the modern reader, though Quammen goes into a little more detail than the average reader has on hand. If it had presented itself as just another overview of Mendel and Darwin, I’d say it had done its job. I was expecting more new research, something I had never heard of. Quammen's book Spillover was much better. And also, eminently more relevant in the pandemic. "
25,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,0,"I enjoyed the other three books by Quammen that I've read, but had difficulty getting into this one. Seemed like a really hard slog and too focused on material of little interest to me. Bailed after fifty pages or so."
26,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,3,"Summary: Fascinating material presented in an approachable way, but overall organization was lacking.Many of you who enjoy natural history will have read about Charles Darwin. You may already know that he originated the tree of life as a way of visualizing the process of evolution. This story starts with that tree and covers several major discoveries that have caused to review our view of that tree. In particular, the author covers horizontal gene transfer (transfer of genetic material between individuals in ways that aren't from parent to child) and the discovery of a new taxonomic group, the Archaea.This might sound like a dense topic, but the author actually writes in an extremely approachable way. He occasionally made fun of his own scientific jargon. While I wish he had explained the value of such jargon for concise, precise communication, he still made me laugh out loud. Short chapters didn't hurt the readability either. The author also did a great job explaining why we should care about all this. He draws you into his sense of curiosity about the origins of life and what it means to be human. He also brought to life the human side of the scientific endeavor. He conveyed the day-to-day experience of doing research. He showed how personality clashes can shape scientific discourse. He did a pretty good job covering a controversial female scientist fairly. And as a scientist, I found the depiction of doing genetics in the 60s and 70s delightfully quaint. Researchers spent decades doing work you could now do in hours! Programming in fortran! On punch cards! It was fun.On a less positive note, I found the organization disjointed. My understanding of the author's focus, based on the intro, was on the two discoveries I described above - horizontal gene transfer and the Archaea - and how they impact the tree of life. Each of the topics I mentioned did get a section - the history of the tree concept; horizontal gene transfer; and the discovery of the Archaea. However, two later sections jumped back in time to the history of the tree concept in a way that jolted me out of the story. I would have preferred to get all of the history of these trees together, chronologically. There were also two sections on other types of DNA transfer where I could see a connection to the author's discussion of trees, but he didn't make that connection clearly or well. Finally, the last section was really only connected to itself or the rest of the book by a focus on Carl Woese, the scientist who discovered horizontal gene transfer. It seems possible the author should have explicitly structured the story around him, because in retrospect, he was the through line.I'm not surprised this book made it onto the National Book Award longlist with this readable take on important scientific updates. I'm also not surprised it didn't make the shortlist though, as the organization let it down.This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"
27,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,4,"Many supposedly clear-cut concepts can become ambiguous upon closer studies. The history of science is full of such examples. Darwin himself was unnerved when he realized that some of his thinking would “undermine the stability of species”. This book tells the stories about how the concept of evolution is being revised. The Darwinian concept of evolution is through mutation during procreations and natural selection. Life may have a common ancestor, and diverge into a tree over generations. That’s a pretty darn good hypothesis, but a hypothesis nonetheless. In the 20th century’s, we figured out the mechanism of inheritance and mutations. In the later part of the century, biologists started to suspect that things are a bit different than previously thought. The major caveat is that genes in an organism are not limited to being inherited vertically. They can come from a totally alien entity such as a virus. This is dubbed horizontal gene transfer (or HGT). In fact, in the early stage of life, HGT is the main source of evolution. When HGT is taken into account the tree of evolution is no longer a classical tree but more mesh like. Also the notion of ancestral lineage is less black and white: About 8% of human genes are thought to be from viruses. The book provides this update to the Darwinian understanding of evolution together with the individual stories about the discovery of various puzzle pieces. This latter can be a bit digressive, especially when the story goes down to the level of personal relationships between scientists and anecdotes of paper rejection or publication."
28,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," Darwin's tree of life gets a major revision as genetic inheritance does not only pass down to descendants but horizontal by having genetic information introduced from contemporary individuals and species. This gene sharing it was found goes on all the time between single-cell creatures but surprise surprise it can happen to multicellular creatures. Whether talking about the introduction of Mitochondria, chloroplasts and other organelles from single cells absorbing other single-cell creatures and forming a symbiotic bond with their residents inside them. Also, DNA jumps cells and species. Much of our own DNA is of such foreign origin. This complicates or overthrows Darwin's Tree of life which now has connections between branches due to the horizontal exchange of genes. This is the tangled Tree in the title of the book. Interesting history of this rather recent revision."
29,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It was primarily a history of the science of evolutionary microbiology (evolution from the viewpoint of microbes), including small biographies of many of the primary players in the field. However, the author kept coming back to one scientist, Carl Woese, who discovered the existence of archaea, a third ""kingdom"" of creatures, in the late 70s. The writing is very relaxed and accessible, even when he's explaining some of the more arcane theories about this rather complicated topic. I am a non-scientist and had very little trouble following the developments described -- until he got to CRISPR, which in fairness was only discussed very briefly. I would recommend this book to anyone at all interested in evolution generally."

31,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26573870-feisty-harriet,4,"4.5 stars; this was delightfully fascinating and I learned so much about micro phylogenetics, which--weirdly--is not a topic I knew much about but am SO FASCINATED BY! Phylogenetics is basically what happened with DNA and genetics PRIOR to what we know as ""evolution""...meaning, the species of the world originating from a common ancient ancestor. And also, why does our DNA look the way it does, and HOW!? Well, it's not all natural selection / inherited genetics that are shaped by survival of the fittest....a good chunk of our genetic make-up was never part of an ancestor, it ""hopped"" over from other strands of DNA or bacteria or viruses...horizontal gene transfer (HGT) vs heredity transfer via sperm/egg, or replication via bacteria division. So, the idea that bits of what makes us humans and what makes you YOU are actually tiny little parasitic viruses that are now so embedded into our makeup that we struggle to separate them from our actual DNA. (Or, you know, the DNA of plants or other animals.) Where this gets really interesting is the idea that HGT is a major contributor to antibiotic resistant diseases, those bugs don't necessarily become resistant over generations due to evolution, sometimes they appropriate a string of errant ""parasitic"" DNA that is resistant, and within a generation or two (very fast for germs) the entire strain is resistant to that antibiotic and able to wreak so much havoc in the living world. Dah, I loved this! Now I need to read more about HGT and phylogenetics! "
32,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,4,"A good science book is a wonderful thing, and this is a really good science book. Quammen weaves his story between people and science, following ideas and personalities, discoveries and molecular phylogenetics in a careful balance intended to keep a relatively ignorant audience afloat. I am that audience, coming in with a pretty good grasp on Darwin and natural selection, Lamarck and evolution etc, but with nothing post-1980s high-school regarding archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes and prokaryotes. (It was amusing to me, actually, to realise part of the reason none of this made much sense to me is that the categories were changing between teachers, something I honestly never realised at the time).Quammen steps us through the 20th and 21st-century histories of molecular life, and what they have taught us about evolution, framed through the changing understanding of a tree-like diagram of life. Carl Woese is the centre of the book, more because Quammen finds him an enigma perhaps than because his work is qualitatively more significant, but Quammen covers many other scientists, and most importantly, the differing mechanisms of gene transfer, along the way. The focus on personalities grew a little tiresome, but only a little.Quammen makes a determined effort to cover the contributions of female scientists with respect and equality, breaking from a past which did not always do so - especially in terms of symbiosis proponent Lynn Margulis. It, therefore, feels churlish to admit I was irritated by the slightly old-fashioned language he occasionally applies to women sometimes - Margulis is referred to variously as a ""forceful young woman"" and a ""determined young woman"" while another molecular biologist is a ""lively wife"" - as well as by his multiple references to researcher Linda Bonen (who transfers labs taking her rare expertise with her) as a gift exchange between the male scientists. But I am a grumpy old feminist and irritated I was.Where Quammen shines is in his capacity to explain the ideas, and their significance (often in the reverse order, which was an interesting and successful technique). By breaking down the varying methods by which genes end up in other organisms, he traces through how this changes our understanding of natural selection as the motor force of life. This is most significant, obviously, in dealing with the origins of complex life, but as we understand more and more about the significance of the viral components of our own DNA, the image of mammals as mostly evolving through natural selection is also challenged.IN particular, HGT is a rapid form of evolution, challenging the gradualism that has been triumphant for the last period. I couldn't help thinking of Stephen J. Gould here, and his punctuated equilibrium arguments with Dawkins, which included an argument that evolution could be quite rapid. It feels as if he would be pleased by this (despite aspects of the Selfish Gene finding validation in HGT. The picture is more diverse and complex is a modern motto for science.Some of the End of Darwin still feels overstated to me. Forms of selection work on various forms of introduced variety - that is, horizontal gene transfer introduces variety into the genome, but what becomes permanent and what is discarded is still related to ongoing selection surely, including natural selection, but for the complexity being revealed here is an important cross-check on overly reductionist versions of evolution. We have a mosaic of forces engaging in driving evolution forward, and a synthesis theory seems not so far off. All of it is wondrous, how much we can now understand and as we do, how much more we realise what we don't. The book manages to bring this sense with it, making it an exciting as well as educational read."
33,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"Often, we learn about science via dense textbooks. They seem definitive. There are illustrations and graphs and chemical reactions and mathematical notations. we often forget that the knowledge therein is provisional. Sure, it's often trivial stuff. Like there being only 8 plantets now, unlike th e9 printed in every textbook printed before 2006 when it was degraded to staeroid status.But some things are not so trivial. And David Quammen's THE TANGLED TREE tackles a decidedly non-trivial topic: how the genetic and biochemical revoultions inform, and change, contemporary evolutionary biologists views on the ""tree of life.""Ever since Darwin, we've thought about evolution more or less like this:[image error]Scientists have thought that parents pass on traits in a relatively straight-line. They assumed that everything you need to survive was passed on this way. When it turns out that a lot of this thinking is wrong, espeically in bacteria, who partake in Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). In HGT, differing strains of bacteria pass on their learned responses to environmental hazards, whehter a toxin or intruder, via plasmids that other bacteria can ingest and use. What's even stranger, for a person like me whose last biology class in the 1980's taught at strict version of genetic heredity, is that they can pass those adaptations on to bacteria OF OTHER SPECIES!That would be like me getting chickenpox. Developing the resistance. And being able to pass that along to not only other humans, but to a chicken. It's bizzare, but it happens.Now this does NOT invalidate Darwin, or the idea of evolution by natural selection. Like other popular works based on legitimate science (not creationist/ inelligent design psuedoscientific crap) that illuminate places where was off or has been misrepresented (like 2017's wonderful EVOLUTION OF BEAUTY by Richard Prum) Quammen illuminates how much broader and more complex the picture is than that textbook world. As expected, nature is messy. And not contained in those neat pictures that illustrate our biology texbooks.Along the way, Quamman introcuces you to a series of brillaint biological researchers. Like biochemist Carl Woese, whose analysis of bacterial cultures takes in extreme conditions, like near deep sea volcanic vents, unearthed a new type of life that was neither prokaryote (lacking membranes around the DNA, like bacteria) nor eukartote (life with DNA cordoned off fro mthe main cell via the nucleus's membrane). Instead, Woese called this life archaea. And based his classification 100% on RNA and other biochemical markers.We meet others, too. Among the more insteresting is Woese's life-long foil, Lynn Margulis. Carl Sagan's first wife, Margulis was a brilliant evolutionary biologist with a bit of a ""crank"" in her -- she was a 9/11 ""Truther."" But she also argued for 5 main domains of life (as opposed to Woese's 3), but based on more ecological considerations. And she was also among the first contemporary biologist to understand how inportant HGT was... and to appreciate how difficult it made life.A very satisfying look at the contemporary evolutionary biology. It's geared towards a general audience, but it does take some time to read. It's like an extneded Scientific American article. Which is high praise. Four-stars. "

I am at the 3rd chapter and its only been an hour. This book is about biology and evolution and both are my favorite subjects.The story of the evolution of evolution. Sorry 😛 Couldn't`t help myself to put it that way. Its actually the history of the development of evolutionary understanding of origins of all beings, genetics, philogenetics, epigenetics, genetic engineering and the future of our existence. It was a long read, but an enjoyable one."
35,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34824535-joe,2,"I dont want to be unfair to the author, since I'm not his target audience, but the title should be 'the tangled tree: a boring history of petty scientists arguing about bacterial taxonomy to satisfy their own egos; interspersed with some interesting science every 20 pages'.I did learn some interesting facts, but it was a total slog. Not recommended unless you really want to know the behind-the-scenes drama between scientists without hearing much about the implications."
36,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22244123-taylor-ahlstrom,4,"The Tangled Tree is a rich, fascinating tale—not just of the history of evolutionary biology—but of the people behind the discoveries. While the book is primarily focused on Carl Woese and his immense contributions to the field, it weaves in and out of those he worked with, those who influenced him, those he despised, and those who lived long before his time. In that way, the book mirrors the tangled tree it is attempting to elucidate. The title of the book, while apt to describe the science being covered, is somewhat of a misnomer when considering how strongly focused the book is on Woese and his career. While his research into 16s-rRNA was revolutionary, and his findings groundbreaking, the average reader may not be aware that perhaps half of the book is devoted to personal stories and backgrounds of the scientists involved. Quammen relays seemingly every detail he learned of the lives of the scientists, their offices, demeanors, accomplishments, and shortcomings. For historical figures like Darwin, he delves deep into their notebooks, sketches, family histories, and anything else that is known about them. The Russian who first suggested endosymbiosis in mitochondria for instance, Merezhkowsky, was also an accused pedophile many times over. In the more recent history, you read of squabbles between coworkers, petty vendettas, and much of the minutiae of life in the lab and the politics of academia. While some may find these details endlessly fascinating and illuminating to the greater topic at hand, others may be looking for a more purely scientific approach to the material. Regardless, Quammen is a gifted writer and his descriptions of people, places, and events are careful, artful, and compelling. He spent countless hours interviewing those who either knew Woese personally or were somehow connected to the science, and it shows. While Woese is the central character and the unlikely protagonist of the story, he ends up taking a back seat to the much more miraculous story of the impact of the science he was producing, and how that science eventually overshadowed his own accomplishments. Though mentioned only briefly in the key takeaways, much of the book is devoted to Woese’s personal struggle with his lack of recognition in the face of his own achievements. He believed himself to be underappreciated and spent the later years of his life bitter and resentful. When horizontal gene transfer began to threaten his big tree theory, he refused to accept the new information as valid—one of the cardinal sins of any great scientist. He wanted desperately to be admitted to the National Academy of Sciences, but the honor wasn’t bestowed on him until his late 60s, a snub of its own. He never received the Nobel Prize he so coveted, and as new science continued to blur the validity of his theories, he only dug his heels in deeper. He began to hate Darwin, to trumpet about how he was smarter than Darwin was, and could never understand why anyone respected the original evolutionary biologist—an obviously petty outlook on the father of evolution, even if some of what he theorized turned out to be wrong. Perhaps as Woese saw his seminal theories being challenged, he saw more of himself in Darwin than he wanted to admit.  Ultimately, this book is the story of the history of molecular evolutionary biology and phylogenics told through the lens of Woese’s life and career. The impact he made on the field is undeniable. According to many microbiologists, he has had more impact than even Darwin himself. His methods of protein taxonomy through rRNA changed the face of phylogeny. His discovery of the third domain, archaea, changed the entire structure of Darwin’s original tree. His theory on the early progenote and HGT’s role in its rapid development shed light onto what was once a dark question mark in the history of all life on earth. Dozens of scientists besides Woese are chronicled in the book, along with their methods, discoveries, and their relevance towards “unraveling,” or perhaps further raveling, the tangled tree. The science Quammen does explain is detailed, easy to understand, and rich with analogy to help the lay reader. If you work in the field, you likely won’t learn anything new—this book isn’t meant as a complete update to the state of molecular evolutionary biology—but you may learn some rich detail about the people behind the progress, and what may come next after Darwin, Woese, and many others irrevocably shook the tree of life."
37,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"David Quammen has written a great book, wrapped in a pretty good one. I rarely give 5-star reviews, and from me a 3-star review actually means ""I liked it"", just like the goodreads scale advises. Nonetheless, I have given Quammen's books 5 stars on more than one occasion, and never less than 4. Until now.Keep in mind, 3 stars from me means ""I liked it"", and I did like it. In fact, there was a 5 star book inside this one, a book about the ways in which a metaphor as old as the idea of evolution itself (or older) has been laid low in the last couple decades. That idea, is the metaphor of the ""tree of life""; the idea that species split from common ancestors like the branches of a tree go from trunk to branch to twig.One of the things I liked about ""The Tangled Tree"" is that Quammen shows us the actual visuals, from pre-evolutionary thinkers like Edward Hitchcock (Quammen describes his drawing of the ""tree of life"" as being ""like a windbreak of tightly placed Lombardy poplars"") to Darwin himself (his tree the only visual of any kind in ""The Origin of Species"") to Ernst Haeckel's ""great oak"" in the late 19th century. You can see the idea being developed, as each thinker looked at the illustrations of the ones before them and said, ""I think it should be a bit more like...""Then, we enter the 20th century, and midway through things take an abrupt turn into a more complicated theory. In some ways, it's like when you realize that the relatively simple, 3- or 4-generations back ""family tree"" cannot possibly continue back to the beginning. After 30 generations, you would have over a billion ancestors, yet the entire earth's human population did not reach that level until the early 19th century. The simple idea of a ""tree"" works for a while, but because your great-great-great-grandmother might also be your great-great-great-great-grandmother on another line, eventually, as you work your way back it becomes more of a web than a tree.There were a few early radical thinkers who floated the idea of blurry lines between one species' DNA and another's, but the one who by all accounts really pushed the idea into the mainstream of biological thought was Lynn Margulis. Quammen gives her a fair portion of the middle book, even including a picture of himself and Lynn Margulis. Margulis championed the idea that things like mitochondria and chloroplasts, which we now call ""organelles"" inside the cells of animals and plants, were once independently living cells. One living thing entered another, neither as parasite nor as food, and both lived, and their descendants were fused as well. This idea was challenging, not least because it is hard to see how it would be possible to draw a ""tree of life"", when two branches turn into one, instead of the other way around. Margulis is not the person who ends up hijacking the book, though, and now we come to the problem.Carl Woese was a researcher who worked at the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign, which coincidentally is where I studied Electrical Engineering in the late 1980's. In fact, I suppose he was doing some of his most important work not long before I got there, although I knew nothing of it. He was one of the early researchers to get down to the detailed work of sequencing RNA from a variety of different ""bacteria"" (as they were all called then), and use that data to try to piece together what was more closely related to what.It so turned out that the ribosomal RNA that Woese had chosen to focus on, in order to piece together the tree of life, were almost uniquely well suited to the task, but by that some token poorly suited for showing the limitations of the ""tree"" metaphor. Some parts of our genetic code can be tinkered with, and they do nothing observable (these used to be called ""junk"" DNA). Other parts are more important, but still there are many ways to get the job done, and a modification to one is unlikely to be fatal. Ribosomes, though, are pretty crucial, and if you mess with those then there is a good chance you would die an early death (perhaps before you are even born). Thus, there is little chance of surviving if, say, a random virus comes and inserts different DNA in that spot.Because, it turns out, that happens. Woese helped the world to achieve an earlier revolution in understanding, that there are multiple urkingdoms (""domains"") of bacteria. It was a further confirmation that our cells are composed of a fusion of different types of (not closely related) cells, so different that the term ""bacteria"" cannot be used for both of them (we call the other one ""archaea"" now).This is an important part of the story Quammen is there to tell us, but he just can't let Woese go. He does move on, to the next generation of scientists who discovered ""horizontal gene transfer"", that process where a virus enables a piece of DNA to move from one species into another. But, he cannot refrain from repeatedly circling back to Woese, even though by this point in the story he is mostly carping from the sidelines.The fact is that Quammen has set himself a difficult task, here, to tell us a story of how ideas change over time in a scientific field which has, in recent decades, become increasingly technical and difficult to explain. I understand that the tragic flaw of Woese, the revolutionary caught in a second revolution that goes too far for him to follow, adds a human element that Quammen wanted to use to spike our interest. But, the reality is, there is far too much Woese in this book.Because of this, the latter part of the book takes on a gloomy, somewhat depressing cast, as we approach the end of Woese's life. The reality is that the research into horizontal gene transfer, and how to replace a ""tree of life"" with a ""web of life"", is in an enormously exciting phase right now. The data is coming faster and faster, and the ability to sort through it is being developed alongside, and we are practically guaranteed to have our understanding of how life evolved, and how it continues to evolve, changed in the near future. The end of this book, should not have been gloomy, it should have been bursting with excitement.Nonetheless, Quammen does a good job of taking us through a host of technical topics, in a way that makes it readable and enjoyable. If the technical explanation is that halophiles lack the normal peptidoglycan walls, he will tell us, ""we get technical again, but I'll keep it simple: weird lipids"". He uses diagrams freely, and he is able to give us the simplest essence of a topic in a way that allows one to follow the plot, when it would be all to easy to get lost in twenty-syllable jawbreakers. Quammen is, in fact, very good at his job.Maybe just ignore some of the later anecdotes of an exasperated Woese growling at the kids to get off his lawn."
38,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,4,"I picked this book up eagerly because of my past experience with this author. David Quammen has written about science in ways that animate my decidedly non-scientific mind. I especially liked Spillover, about zoonotic diseases like AIDS and Ebola, which originated in animals and were passed to humans. I hit more than a few brick walls with The Tangled Tree, however; my courses in Biology a zillion years ago did not suffice for me to truly grab on to the book. And the ideas are more arcane than in Spillover; the complexities of genetics are not as visible and recognizable as an epidemic.Nevertheless, Quammen’s persistently good writing held me to the end for a variety of reasons. Perhaps I was just determined to finish because I knew this was pretty interesting stuff.The Tangled Tree traces the discovery of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and tells the story of numerous scientists who contributed to this discovery. The idea is basically this: “Roughly 8 percent of the human genome consists of the remnants of retroviruses that have invaded our lineage – invaded the DNA, not just the bodies, of our ancestors – and stayed.” Possibly the most important gene to have come from a retrovirus gave us the human placenta. In other words, not everything is passed on in linear fashion via a “tree of life.” Those branches are a little tangled. What was missing for me was some reflection on the implications of this new knowledge.That’s about all the science I will attempt, but I want to comment on the writing. The lovely thing is how Quammen follows the story, tracking the discovery as it unfolded over the course of fifty years or so. Though Biologist Carl Woese is most prominent, the full cast of characters is huge, because scientific progress is like that. One person moves the needle, and eight time zones away, another person notices and moves the needle a bit more. Quammen manages to convey the excitement of that organic growth.Quammen structures the narrative in short chapters, often with cliff hangers, to add up to the history of an idea. He conveys science as a process, and it is a fine thing to behold."
39,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5923433-susan-o,4,"I enjoyed the book with its mixture of history of science and biology. It might not be for everyone though. While I think Quammen does and excellent job explaining concepts for the lay person, if you don't have a decent understanding of high school biology there might be too many new concepts for comfort. "
40,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26864122-karen,0,"I found parts of this book frustrating. In particular, there was extensive discussion on how the Woese lab performed a significant amount of RNA sequencing using Sanger-sequencing. He even wrote out examples including uracil. However, this is misleading. We sequence the DNA, not RNA with Sanger. And while this may have been done to simplify the conversation, it was a pretty big jump to make without explanation. It seemed like Quammen was trying to do too much. I wish he would stick to the main topic, horizontal gene transfer, which was what made me pick up the book. He covers every major topic in Microbiology, each covered in a mere one paragraph. And they are so simplified that they serve no purpose. From reading these small snippets, I cannot tell if he simplified for the purposes of a popular science book or because he didn’t know what he was talking about. The author resides (at least part time) in a college town with strong microbiology department. It did not come across to me that he consulted this resource when writing this book. I was actually offended two times so far when reading this book. One time, Quammen quoted van Niel: “During those periods I would go home after a day in the lab and wish that I might be employed somewhere as a high-school teacher…it would give me some assurances that was I was doing was considered worthwhile.” Quammen concludes this must have indicated that van Niel was bipolar or knew bacterial taxonomy very well. I find these conclusions confusing and can from experience say that the majority of my PhD student peers have made statements such as, “If this doesn’t work out, I’m going to be a baker…or open my open restaurant…. or be a bookseller…. etc.” This in no way indicates that each PhD student in the sciences in are bipolar. It reflects on the difficult nature of the work, infused with humor, self-deprecation and stress. I did not finish this book. I really wanted to, however I could not bring myself to pick the book up again. In the future if I decide to read further, I will update my review."
41,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502678-gail,5,"Let’s start here: Mind. Blown. Few books I’ve read in my long life have had such a walloping impact. This deserves the National Book Award for non-fiction. It’s that good. Do you wonder about the origin of life? Evolution? The “whats” and the “hows” more than the “whys”? This is the story of what we’ve learned about how living organisms emerged and grew into the endless variety we have today. It’s a story in which bacteria and a group of living things called archaea became the focus of evolutionary genomics. That Tree of Life that we grew up with? Well, maybe it’s not a tree at all. And maybe humans aren’t ... human in the way we think they are. Maybe we aren’t unique. Genetics has turned almost everything we thought we knew about biology upside down. It started with a man I’d never heard of: Carl Woese. He was a physicist, not a biologist. A man of exquisitely inquisitive mind who wanted to know the ancient origins of life. He cared little about modern life-forms and was utterly intolerant of science that made “engineering” solutions the goal. Rather, he cared immensely about how we all emerged into the separate “kingdoms” and “species” that were defined when his work first began. Laboriously, he took genetic fingerprints of bacteria to establish the genetic relationships between the more primitive life forms. That work led to his contention that there were three kingdoms of life... one of which wasn’t identified until he undertook his groundbreaking work. And thus the story begins. Is Woese right? Is he a crackpot? Does his work confirm the story that Darwin set out about how life evolves or is there more to the story that Darwin didn’t understand? The author is a renowned science writer and I’m loathe to admit that I’d never heard of him. I read an article that was adapted from this book, which set me on a path to finding and reading it. Quammen has a sense of humor and the ability to take indescribably complex information and make it accessible to lay people. As a result, I was dumbstruck by what’s been happening in evolutionary biology and how so many things I’d learned about how biology works are now in serious question. Understanding the material presented here is crucial to recognizing the implications of antibiotic resistance (via HGT- Horizontal Gene Transfer), emerging viruses that threaten all living things, and even why gene editing via CRISPR is possible. The scope of this work is breathtaking. We meet scientists from around the world and explore those who came before them (like Darwin), all leading to the new field of phylogenomics. If you love the history of science, ponder what it means (at least biologically) to be human, are curious about how life evolved, appreciate a great story, or want to know where science might be taking us, then this book is essential reading. Twice. Maybe more. Highly recommend. Ten stars if I could give them. "
42,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261100-emily-sessa,3,"Really hard to rate this one. On the surface it should have all of my boxes ticked: phylogenetics, science history, some philosophy, insider insights into how various famous scientists' labs worked, etc. But this just never came together for me the way many of Quammen's other books have. I read it over the course of the semester with my lab, and I think we mostly concurred about its major flaws.1) We were never able to figure out who the audience was meant to be. On the surface, it's us, surely - a bunch of scientists who do phylogenetics every day of our lives. But even for us, the details of the story got bogged down and boring far too easily. And this is also such a niche subject, it seems odd to actually be pitched at us as the audience; but if we couldn't get fully into and enjoy it, it's hard to imagine a non-professional being captivated by it. 2) It was likewise never really clear what the main point of the book was. A biography of Carl Woese and his accomplishments? A history of 20th century developments in systematics? A philosophical discussion of whether a tree is the best way of thinking about the relationships among living things? A thriller about a radical new concept that has upended a long-held scientific tenet (more on this one in #3, below...)? All of these elements were there, and one or the other would take over for a chapter or two only to disappear when one of the other threads picked up. I ultimately didn't find any of the components well-crafted enough to carry the whole book, and the lack of a real central theme was frustrating.3) He way oversold the whole ""Darwin was wrong"" idea. The thriller element mentioned above focuses on the concept of horizontal gene transfer, which Quammen treats as a shocking and novel concept that totally upends everything we know about phylogenetic relationships. That's nonsense. Yes, we now acknowledge that the ""tree of life"" really isn't strictly tree-like, and that phenomena like horizontal gene transfer, hybridization, introgression, etc. happen constantly and result in many genetic elements being shuffled about. But practicing systematists have adapted our methods to account for these occurrences - we've taken it in stride, essentially, and evolved our approaches, because that's how science works. It makes our questions, and their answers, more nuanced and challenging, but Darwin wasn't ""wrong"", and for many purposes a tree does remain the best device for conceptualizing and communicating about relationships. I was very disappointed that Quammen tried to go for some ""shock"" value here that really misrepresents the actual impact of HGT and related processes for day-to-day scientists who work on this stuff.4) Rampant casual sexism. This was the most disappointing of the disappointing elements for me because it changes my opinion of Quammen himself. There are very, very few women in this book. Quammen can't be entirely faulted for this, because most of the main scientists involved were men due to the extreme sexism and exclusion of the times. But we know women were around - women were lab technicians and played behind-the-scenes roles in many of these scientific enterprises, and if one bothers to try and find them, one will. Quammen did not bother. And when he talks about women at all, every element of his language changes - the tone of his descriptions of women is different than when he describes men (down to which details of their appearance he chooses to focus on). He'll refer to men as brilliant, etc. and in the next section describe only the work that was done by a female assistant or student. The women were NEVER described as brilliant or talented or gifted or any of the other approbations he heaped on the men. A male-female husband-wife team who coauthored a paper: she was described as his coauthor (implying he was the primary), and not the other way around, when in fact they were equals. There's a particularly insulting and unnecessary bit about whether someone's mother in Indiana would really care or understand what her son was up to - because a mother in Indiana obviously has the intellect of a waffle iron and would have been incapable of understanding what her kid was up to. Totally infuriating. I will think twice before I read another of his books, I'm sorry to say. "
43,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9650117-dennis,4,"This book provides an extremely interesting, enjoyable, and readable overview of the history of the theory of evolution, from Darwin and before, up to the most current ideas. The central figure in the book is Carl Woese, who discovered Archaea, and there are also many engaging mini-biographies of other important figures (Charles Darwin, of course, but also Ernst Haeckel, Lynn Margulis, Ford Doolittle, and several others), and explanations of their contributions to the science.The author explains a lot about biology, and cellular biology in particular, in support of the author’s central thesis; that different forms of life are far more interrelated that we realized just a few decades ago (hence the name of the book). This greater degree of interrelation arises because of Horizontal Gene Transfer (“HGT”), by which means living organisms can transfer their genes to organisms in other species or even other kingdoms or domains. The transplanted genes might not have any impact on the new host, or they might be harmful, or they might be beneficial. An example of the latter category is the gene that enables mammals to develop placentas.The author also explains a great deal about how scientists painstakingly figured out how cells work, from the first observations of bacteria in the 1600s, to the functions of ribosomes and DNA, to Carl Woese’s discovery of archaea, and, ultimately, to the importance of Horizontal Gene Transfer in both evolution and medicine.In addition to the science, the book goes into conflicts between scientists with different points of view, or scientists who agree on the science but disagree about who should get credit, and the importance of getting credit for grant applications and tenure awards. As an outsider, I found this insight into the human side of the scientific community fascinating. I come at the subject of evolution from the Intelligent Design point of view (though I am a Christian, I don’t believe that science supports a literal interpretation of the book of Genesis). One of the things I found refreshing about this book is that it didn’t contain attacks on people like me who believe that evolution could only make sense if it was intelligently guided. I won’t lie about the science; at times, it got pretty dense. But the author does a good job of explaining the science in an understandable way, and I was able to get the important concepts, though I have no science background.I purchased and listened to the audiobook. The narrator did a fantastic job – his pacing and enunciation were terrific, and his voice was very pleasant. This book is highly recommended."
44,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394552-keith-akers,4,"This is a great book, though a bit tough to get through, exploring the current science relating to the evolution of life. The science in this book almost lost me about 1/3 of the way through. I was ready to quit and say, ""smart guy, but I couldn't figure out what he was talking about."" The thing that kept me going was the discussion of the people involved in this research. I couldn't quite follow the science, but I could follow how the scientists were getting along with each other (or not). The science emerges from a community of scientists. Another item of interest was the relative gender equality here; a number of the people involved were women. At some point (I can't recall precisely where), by the time some more key concepts were introduced, the science started becoming coherent as well.The main scientific impact of this book is that genes can be transmitted other than through lineal descent, a process called ""horizontal gene transfer."" These genes, that is, are not acquired from one's ancestors, but in effect sideways, from completely alien beings of a different species. It's like GMOs (genetically modified organisms), but happens NATURALLY, not with somebody trying to inserting genes to develop pesticide-resistant crops.So, this book was news to me. (view spoiler)[The whole evolution of mammals, evidently, was due to horizontal gene transfer, which made the evolution of a placenta (and thus live birth) possible; and the placenta and a live birth in turn had some evolutionary advantages, so here we are today! So HGT (horizontal gene transfer) is a big deal, not just among bacteria, but even in the big multi-cellular creatures we see all around us. If you try to depict the evolution of life as a ""tree,"" which each branch showing how ancestors passed their genes down to their descendants, we'd be descended not just from our ancestors but also from some totally unrelated species that came out of left field millions of years ago. It doesn't falsify Darwin's theory of evolution (genes still get passed on, and the fittest still survive), but it does modify it substantially. Thus, the title of the book, ""the tangled tree."" The other surprise was that we humans didn't ""evolve"" (even with HGT) from bacteria. Rather, we came from archaea, a third form of life that was completely unknown until 1977. (It's like bacteria in that they are ""very small,"" but with a completely different DNA.) But where did archaea come from? Bacteria, maybe, through some process yet unidentified? (hide spoiler)] The book doesn't have a conclusion, because science is ongoing, but we know quite a bit more than we did just a generation ago about evolution."
45,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18282715-june,4,"I maybe more easily pleased by the subject matter. No discovery as a first encounter to surprise me, but the elucidation exhilarated me with many hypotheses (potential si-fi?).All the breakthroughs and prospects in evolutionary biology since pre-Darwinian are compiled in such a fascinating and well structured (not tangled) volume. Imagine it to be a most rewarding read for the curious mind at least, without the need of a biology course beyond high school.As a bonus, Carl Woese’s (quasi) biography, running parallel (essential mostly, but maybe distractive to some readers) with the progress of evolution theory, illuminates how good scientists propel the evolution of real science, beyond the limit of human knowledge.I hope the essence of the book can be mustered by more life science professionals, to forgo profit making and improve the outlook of human health, as well as by laypeople to transcend the understanding of an individual living being."
46,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70001227-aram,5,"An excellent book. Especially if you want to know about the emergence of the science behind classifying living organisms based on molecular informations such as the making of phylogenetic trees. Or if you want to understand the implications following the discovery of another form of life (Archaea), and discovery of horizontal gene transfer processes between living organisms. If this is so, then it is an excellent and perfect book choice for you.For a biology or medicine major you will learn much information about the history of molecular biology and the race of understanding the origin and history of life and a bunch of more details about molecular informations. Besides these, you’ll gain many insights about the academic life of many great scientists and realize how they make discoveries and do research.  As for the author, this is his second book that I’ve read (after The Reluctant Mr. Darwin) and I’ve decided that he’s one of the best scientific writers in the world as he purely exploits the message of popular writing and explains science in a story-like manner."
47,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58745517-emma-bec,5,"This was a wonderful book. It explains the advances in biology over the last century or so and how these have fundamentally changed how we view life and evolution. It explained the science really well and brought it to life with the stories of the scientists who worked on it. I really enjoyed the biography of Carl Woese, though I think at times it meant that other scientists were not covered as well as they should be - but a book can't do everything. Overall it paints a really clear picture of how life is not just made up of separate species but that horizontal gene transfer and symbiosis have contributed greatly to evolution."

Pretty important, but none nearly as significant or historically momentous as the invaders described in David Quammen's The Tangled Tree: A Radical New History of Life, an engrossing tale of invasions over time and inside the cells of all living things. If you doubt biology can be fascinating, this book may change your mind. David Quammen, an award-winning science writer, has written about Darwin before. Now he turns to scientific discoveries in just the past forty years that constitute a revolutionary revision of Darwin’s “tree” of life (although not, importantly, a repudiation of it). Because of both the electron microscope and the development of methods to sequence genes and compare genomes, we have become aware of aspects of life Darwin couldn’t even dream about. Much of this new knowledge is thanks in part to the seminal thinking of Dr. Carl Richard Woese, whose life and work forms the scaffolding upon which Quammen unfolds the story. It was Woese who upended theories relating to the definitions of a species, an individual, and whether the history of life does or does not resemble a tree.As most people know, Darwin postulated that evolution occurs as traits descend from parents to offspring and are very gradually modified based on mutations favorable for survival. The process resembled a tree, to Darwin's thinking.But now we understand that, as Quammen explained on NPR, “innovation in genomes doesn't always come gradually. Sometimes it comes suddenly, in an instant, by horizontal gene transfer. And that represents the convergence, not the divergence, of lineages.” This discovery means all the domains of life are much more interrelated than we thought.In fact, we didn’t even know about the existence of one of the main domains of life, the archaea, until recently! (Scientists now divide all life into three domains: bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. Bacteria you are probably familiar with. Eukarya are organisms that have cells with a nucleus, and include plants and animals and human beings. Awareness of archaea, discovered by Carl Woese, is the first of the three big developments highlighted by Quammen, and will be expanded upon below.)The discovery of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT, also called Lateral Gene Transfer or LGT) as a pathway to heredity, and its importance in the process of evolution, is an astounding development. This means cells can acquire genes from other cells around them, “horizontally” rather than only vertically from a previous generation. In fact, gene sequencers have been astonished at just how much HGT has been going on. This does not mean gradual evolution through previous generations did not and does not occur, but rather, that over time evolutionary change takes the shape of a tangled web more than a stereotypical looking tree.More specifically, HGT has been responsible for some of the biggest developments in plants and animals. Both mitochondria and chloroplasts, those organelles helping animals and plants harness and process energy critical for cell survival, originated as bacterial cells that migrated across species to live inside primitive hosts. How do we know? Mitochondria and chloroplasts resemble bacterial cells more than cells of animals and plants. They even have separate DNA! They use their own DNA, not that of their hosts, to produce the proteins and enzymes they need to carry out their energy-producing functions. Cells without these organelles lack the nuclear genes to encode all of the proteins they need to survive. The organelles replicate their own DNA, as bacteria do, and are each surrounded by a double membrane, further emphasizing their difference and separation.We are all, that is to say, “composite creatures” - “mosaics” made up of all possible domains of life. When Walt Whitman said “we contain multitudes,” little did he know we in fact contain multitudes - of bacteria, archaea, and viruses that are an integral part of us. What “human” means involves different organisms that have formed symbiotic associations inside us, and can be passed on to our progeny. [Wait, you may be thinking: to which domain do viruses belong? A tricky question! Whereas all of the three main domains of life replicate by cell division, viruses do not. Believe it or not, viruses are considered non-living, or at least, in a gray area somewhere between living and non-living, since they cannot reproduce on their own. Viruses are basically ultramicroscopic intracellular parasites. They can replicate only within other cells. Nevertheless, they play a large role in living organisms, especially through the mechanism of retroviruses, a whole area of research beyond the scope of this review. But suffice it to point out that it is thanks to retroviruses that animals have workable placentas to protect fetuses.]Back to the living domains, the archaea are very odd but interesting. Like bacteria, they are microbial species (living things too small to see with the naked eye). But archaea and bacteria are made up of very different genetic material. Archaea tend to live in extreme environments, whether super hot, acidic, alkaline, deep in the ocean, or super cold. [Oh yes, and in the human colon, but if that’s not extreme, what is?] The reason archaea are exciting is that their ability to function in extreme environments gives us a glimpse of what earliest life on the earth was probably like, as well as what life on other planets might be like. Here’s another strange thing: archaea possess both DNA and RNA that work much more similarly to that of eukaryotes (i.e., us) than bacteria. As Jennifer Frazer in ""Scientific American"" writes: ""These compelling similarities . . . between archaeal and eukaryotic cells has led some to suggest that in addition to the bacterial engulfment/symbiosis that created mitochondria and chloroplasts, some other more mysterious symbiosis or chimerism may have occurred between an ancient archaeon and bacterium to produce the first proto-eukaryotic cell. Or it may suggest that eukaryotes, in fact, evolved from archaea.”You can read more about our possible ancestry from archaea here, in an article asking whether archaea are best viewed as our ""sisters"" or our ""mothers.""There is a lot more just waiting to be discovered in the field of molecular phylogenetics, which is the study of evolutionary relationships among biological entities by analyzing data at the molecular level. Quammen not only provides adequate background for you to follow along (at least at the “popular science” level) but to get you excited enough to do so. He will have you pondering, along with scientists, how we can possibly define an ""individual"" given what we now know? Among other ideas, he will introduce you to ""zooids,"" or as writers of science fiction say, ""hive beings."" Zooids are multicellular beings that exist only in reference to their group. Think of bees: they form a colony of organisms each of which has a specialized function, and whose members cannot survive independently. Another familiar zooid is the quaking Aspen tree. This species of tree lives in forests of clonal trees that all belong to a single root system and thus are physiologically characterized as belonging to one single individual. Quammen also sets you up with enough background to understand the current debate about CRISPR, a section of the genome that can be used for “editing” genetic codes. The days of heritable diseases could be ending, if the use of editing is found to be safe, effective, and ethical. (You can read about how CRISPR works, here.)I had only one criticism. Quammen very briefly raised the complexity theory topic of emergent phenomena as a possible explanation for DNA, but then dropped it. Although the book already covered so much, I wanted to hear more about those theories. [You can read an excellent short article on this subject in ""Nature Magazine,"" here. Among other things, the article explains: ""Life itself is an example of an emergent property. For instance, a single-celled bacterium is alive, but if you separate the macromolecules that combined to create the bacterium, these units are not alive. Based on our knowledge of macromolecules, we would not have been able to predict that they could combine to form a living organism, nor could we have predicted all of the characteristics of the resulting bacterium.""]Evaluation: Overall, I loved this book. Quammen is an excellent storyteller. In addition, it’s so full of exciting information that I felt compared to share with everyone I met while listening to it!Rating: 4.5/5Note: Longlisted for the National Book Award for Nonfiction and A New York Times Notable Book of 2018"
50,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"I've read a few too many science communication books by scientists about their own work lately, and as interesting as the material can be, I was desperate for somebody who can actually write well too. I knew Quammen would fit the bill just by his reputation, and I can't say this book disappointed on that front. It's nothing particularly special--it doesn't make an interesting point, the prose isn't exceptionally eloquent, and the material it covers is broadly familiar and it doesn't carry the story far beyond those broad strokes. It just tells a lot of interesting stories about the history of biology, in a compelling and entertaining way, alongside clear explanations of the ideas and some of their implications.The story is largely structured as an intellectual biography of Carl Woese, though the content is arguably broken into three distinct ideas (Archaea, endosymbiosis, and horizontal gene transfer), which have progressively less to do with Woese as time goes on. This was an extra little perk for me, having done my grad research in part in both of the two buildings at UIUC this story touches. The stories about Woese personally (as opposed to the science) were more interesting to me because they often gave new insights into things I saw all the time as a student (like the fact that Woese hated those giant glob scultures so much that he used a different entrance to IGB to avoid seeing them). But despite all of the bits about his relationships with other scientists, and his feelings about fame and recognition, I still didn't come away from the book feeling like I had a particularly strong impression of what Woese was actually like. The same is even more true for all the other scientists in the book. Quammen dutifully provides biographical notes and descriptions of various traits of personality and appearance for his subjects, like any good journalist, but they still mostly blend together into a mush of boring, contemporary academics. The biological discoveries themselves, and their historical context, were a lot more interesting. A couple of new details stood out in particular – that Darwin inherited a major part of his idea from his grandfather, and that horizontal gene transfer in bacteria was discovered before the role of DNA as the molecule of heredity. In other places, though, I felt like Quammen was defining his brief too narrowly? He never takes it as his place to expound on the implications of the discoveries he describes, to synthesize them into a picture the audience might not be familiar with. So he fails to address at all what seem like obvious questions raised by the cumulative thrust of the book: if HGT is so common, why are species stable enough to be discernible at all? In other places, he just sticks so close to the material that he leaves interesting stuff on the table. Why is it interesting to know that Archaea are a separate domain? What do they do differently, and what does it tell us to know that Eukarya derive from them? These are the sorts of questions a book like Ed Yong's We Contain Multitudes was more interested in; Tangled Tree is much more a story about scientists and the process of discovery. But I'm not really sure why that is. I like it as a history of science, and I'm glad to see that aspect given so much attention. It just seems like the title and subtitle put a lot of focus on the biology, and that's the sort of thing that most books like this would do as well. And if I'm honest, the history of science here isn't actually especially interesting, and the biology is extremely interesting. It's just a sort of strange choice."
51,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632471-carl,5,"The Tangled Tree refers to the Tree of Life, the biologists’ semi-official metaphor for the development of life on Earth. The Tree of Life starts out at the bottom with some sort of beginning life, and then branches out with more complex forms that are descended from the original forms.The overriding scientific message of the book is that the Tree of Life used to be a lot simpler.Children organisms were assumed to inherit all of their qualities from their parents (or parent in the case of bacteria). But around 1970 or so, as the result of various earlier researches, the thinking changed: there is a lot of mixture of different components between species that has nothing to do with classical Darwinian evolution. For one thing, it is now accepted that the cells in our bodies contain bacteria that entered the ancestors of our cells hundreds of millions of years ago and are absolutely necessary for the operation of our cells. Viruses can also carry foreign DNA into cells, and this DNA is inherited. Bacteria also share their DNA so widely that some people wonder if it makes sense to think about bacterial species. (Perhaps there is only one bacterium in the world.)The book contains a history of the changing ideas about the Tree of Life. There are fifteen (if I counted them correctly) different pictures of the Tree of Life, ranging from Darwin’s first 1837 sketch in his notebook to a 1999 “reticulated tree”, which looks like a complete mess – supposedly correctly modeling the real world.The second scientific message of the book is that until late in the twentieth century we did not know of the existence of a major and important part of the Tree of Life: a form of microbe called Archaea. Current thinking is that there are three main divisions, called “domains” of life: the Archaea, the Bacteria, and a domain containing all the rest -- palm trees, whales, humans, etc.But besides the scientific half of the book, there is a human interest half (or the National Examiner magazine half). This is made up of biographical sketches of many of the scientists who worked on the Tree of Life, along with the stories of their struggles and adventures in the real world and the academic world. For example, the book tells about an early naturalist, who like Darwin, married his cousin. Then there was the Russian child molester.Two figures have especially large roles in the book: Lynn Margulis (married unhappily for a while with Carl Sagan) and Carl Woese. Both of these people had new ideas that were rejected for years by the academic establishment before they became accepted and then as gospel went into text books. Many think that Woese deserved a Nobel for his work, but was mostly dismissed as a bitter crank who gave boring talks.A (comical?) side note: Woese’s lab, that played a major role in the discovery of the Archaea domain in the 70’s would never be allowed today. There were explosive liquids, high voltages, radioactive phosphorus, and at least one form of pathogenic bacteria.The best quote in the book (to me) is from Carl Woese. In describing the search down the abyss of time for how the first living cells came from some sort of “progenote”, he said “The progenote is today the end of the evolutionary trail that starts with fact, progresses through inference, and fades into fancy.”"
52,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5567347-craig-werner,5,"Semi-spoiler:The tree of life--the one imaged in the familiar branching diagram pretty much all of us learned as we started to study science--isn't really a tree. It's reticulated, a web with crosses and blurrings at pretty much every level. Check out the images on pages 285 and 299 for ways of imaging the more complicated reality.It's pretty cool.And it requires us to revise what we mean by minor terms such as ""species"" and ""individual,"" neither one of which has any clear reality. It's an idea that I first encountered in Lewis Thomas's Lives of a Cell, which posits that people (and the bacterial swarms that inhabit us and without which we can't survive three minutes) are better viewed as committees than individuals. It's an idea that echoes through recent science books on forests and cephalopods---an aspen grove is more ""individual"" than group of distinct trees. As a card-carrying multiculturalist who's somewhat prone to overdoing the metaphorical resonances of science I love all of this. Fluidity, connection, interaction.Back to the science--and Quammen never loses track of what he's writing about as I did in the previous paragraph--The Tangled Tree is a spectacularly successful survey of the evolution of evolutionary thought. When Quammen concludes that in some sense Darwin was wrong about some pretty basic notions--he's the source of the tree metaphor, but understood it as a hypothesis not an established ""fact""--everything that happened later happens in an intellectual world he played a key role in creating. Quammen provides memorable sketches of many of the scientists who destabilized the ""two kingdom"" model of life, especially Carl Woese who was instrumental in establishing the reality of the Archaea, and Lyn Margulis, whose championing of the idea of endosymbiosis (the merging of bacteria and prokaryotic cells into the nucleated eukaryotic cell) met fierce resistance but ultimately carried the day. The Tangled Tree is technical enough to avoid the trap of simplification (as best I can judge) but clear enough to speak to any reader with a serious interest in the complications of cutting edge research.In short I love the book. My only minor criticism is that toward the end Quammen turns the story into more of a biography of Woese than the central story requires. It's clear he developed a deep affection for the cranky brilliant egotistical, but also winning, innovator and I'm okay with that."
53,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11277078-evin-ashley,5,"I really waffled on whether to give this book a 4 or 5 - basically, it could have started from chapter 49. The preceding chapters helped to flesh out the phenomenal journey - developing central characters such as Carl Woese, who made the discovery of a third form of life - but it was lengthy. But, I reiterate, how phenomenal this journey is. It should be required reading for biology/philosophy/history students. My mind was buzzing with new information and new dots to connect to other information, which I very much enjoyed.One interesting tidbit which connected dots: extreme halophiles can survive in extremes; extreme environments feeding off only salt, fat, acid or heat. That is the very title of a popular (human) cookbook (""Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking""), which seems not to be a coincidence. Just as bacteria do, archaea - the third form, or ""branch"" of ""The Tangled Tree"" - live within us and affect us.This story really is rooted in a beautiful marriage between philosophy and science. I loved contemplating the key to life being rooted in ""complexity and flexibility"" - that is to say, complexity and flexibility are inherent in the most resilient forms of life. Yet at the the same time, taking a step back to see the bigger picture: simplicity binds us together - ""we"" are all connected, whatever we are and wherever we came from.Also, can't help but mention the movie Annihilation (2018) with Natalie Portman. Though it is a thriller/sci fi/horror/indie drama, the main point it tries to make is: we are not destroyed as individuals, but we are changed by one another. That can be terrifying to some, to our self image. Where the ""other"" and the ""individual"" intersect is always blurry, which is also what this book so aptly articulates.So I guess going back, I'd have to give this book a 5. I hope people read it and have their minds blown."
54,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78089723-joe-flynn,4,"A book filled with detailed and fascinating history of science, that seems a little confused as to what it is. Ostensibly, the book is about how our idea of evolution and the tree of life as imagined by Darwin and others is not completely correct. How in many ways it is radically different, and more of a tangled web. Due in part to horizontal gene transfer that can take place even between kingdoms of life. The story of how we came to think of evolution, and trees, is carefully sketched out including many interesting biographical details of the key scientists. Wow watch out for the Russian pedophile!Later we are introduced to the various teams and people that would revolutionise the field during the latter parts of the last century. Though it is here we encounter the main issue with the book. There is a huge focus on a single scientist - so much so that this reads like an actual biography of Carl Woese in many parts. I see no reason why he takes so much of the page space, important though his techniques and discoveries clearly were. Later chapters consider some mind blowing current science. Explaining major portions of our genome come from, or via, viral or bacterial sources - as well as some of their essential uses! Shorter sections explore what this may mean going forwards. The writing is excellent, and aimed at people with some scientific understanding, but he is humorous when confronted with many of the crimes against natural language science commits and clear with simplified explanations. A final point I would like to make, the constant references to Nobel prizes won or not won. Not only this authors fault, but they should not be viewed as the be all and end all of science (or writing). Unbelievably overstated prize in many people's minds. We should have better ones!"
55,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9970207-kj,1,"I really wanted to like this book. I've listened to a great deal of science books on audio, and this one had a great premise and seemed like it was cutting edge. But who edited this book??? because lord almighty....Every other chapter was an insertion into Carl Woese and how tremendous of a character he was in the entire realm of molecular biology, except he wasn't so great and he wasn't a biologist. A practical scientist yes. But he was also a super jerk, who made a lot of crude jokes, and was affronted about literally everything... all of this described in detail which had VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH HGT. Quammen passes off Woese as a godlike figure in biophysics with male bonding every third chapter. I was about ready to throw the entire thing out towards the end, but I had invested so much TIME, you see, I needed to see it through. As a woman reader, I found some parts in and around chapter 80 to be obnoxious and eye rolling, especially the part about Woese being affronted yet again about a room and writing a scoffing letter to the perpetrator about ""gang-lathering his sister"". Chapters and chapters devoted one scientist out of many, and his many indignities.I thought the book was supposed to be a really solid piece of scientific discovery in and around horizontal gene transfer, and it could be in parts.... but the exciting information bits were one chapter out of 5-10 before going back to the saga of how male colleagues are entranced by one another. The entire book had such an obtuse point, that when we FINALLY got to it, I justdidn't care anymore. Super disappointed."
56,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"This book reviews the ideas of the Tree of Life from it's origin with early thinkers, primarily Darwin, through the understanding that the Bacteria and Archaea form separate domains. The book also has a number of secondary themes. The life of Carl Woese, who was largely responsible for the discovery of the Archaea as a distinct domain, is covered in detail (and notably in the concluding chapters). The discovery of horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) is a major theme in the second half of the book. HGT has been found to be the major mechanism for gene exchange in the lower animals, but also appears to occur in the eukaryotes. The book examines the various scientists in detail, providing short biographies, anecdotes and often interviews for each, and describing their personalities and interactions with other scientists. The downside of this book is that Quammen includes so much biographic, journalistic, and cutesy material that the book is difficult to follow. Sentences and entire paragraphs stand out as material that could have been excluded to improve the readability of the book.In the end, one is left with the question of how does HGT affect the tree of life - how much does HGT contribute to evolution versus the sexual selection process that was detailed by Darwin. It is clear that the effect of HGT is great at the base of the tree and within the Bacteria and Archaea. This has lead some, including Ford Doolittle to suggest that the tree of life is wrong - but sexual selection appears to be important in the Eukaryotes. Quammen provides little insight on these issues."
57,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72817347-gracie,4,"This was a very fascinating read, very well written. The science was presented at a level that I think non-science people could understand, but that also doesn't dumb down the science too much (a problem I have with a lot of pop-science books). I wasn't well versed on the history of horizontal gene transfer, and the experiments highlighted in this book really helped clarify the mechanisms and implications of HGT. I give this book only 4 stars (maybe 3.5) for two reasons: 1) The beginning of Part III was particularly fascinating, as it really got into HGT. However, it focused an inordinate about of pages on Carl Woese. Quammen pains Woese as a beloved grump, a complicated hero of evolutionary genetics. It was so difficult for me to understand why this particular man took up so much space in the book, particularly when that space was more about his personal feud with the scientific establishment and his quirky personality, and had very little to do with his actual contributions to the field. Woese is often written about as a lover of crude jokes and even a vindictive personality - his male colleges seem to brush this off or laugh along with him. Only one woman was interviewed on her opinion on Woese. 2) Quammen has a very irritating way of introducing men and women scientists differently in his writing. Men are usually given a physical description that includes something of the deep, wise, eccentric scientist trope, while the women are usually introduced as wives of these men, who happen to be ""scientists in their own right"", with little to no more attention given to them. When women were larger characters in the story, they were usually loyal and hardworking lab techs who receive cursory praise for their work, or their family lives were explained in much more detail than any of the men scientists. "
58,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56798095-rachael-birri,2,"Usually I love popularized science books, but this one wasn't for me. Mainly because I need to remember I don't like reading books written by men, so that one's on me. Also, there are many ways people are able to make science accessible to the general public:- take the reader on your research journey (Mary Roach, The Secret Life of Henrietta Lacks)- make the implications broad and beautiful (I Contain Multitudes, Braiding Sweetgrass, the best of popular science quite frankly)- tell the stories of the great white guys that brought us these discoveries (The Tangled Tree, The Silver Spoon)The science within this is sound and interesting, but given my previous biology classes, it didn't do much for my understanding of genes, their functions, their replication, etc. This book also focused on big mechanical discoveries and rarely put it in the context of application. I feel like the ""portrait of a scientist as an old man"" is done. We need to be done, or y'all need to put disclaimers. It's done because I'm reading a book about horizontal gene transfer because I think HGT is dope... so let it stand for itself. Science writers need to accept that the science is interesting on its own and let that be what drives the story. Instead sooo many popular science books opt instead to try to craft a narrative entirely outside of the science that they can pepper the science into. That's how you end up with 400+ page books that leave you with no deeper understanding of HGT but a lot of insight into the psychological struggles of Carl Woese."
59,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6293808-elizabeth,3,"The subtitle of this book is misleading. Perhaps because I was introduced to the 3+ kingdoms of life approach in high school and college, the book's claim seemed anticlimactic to me. I grant that it cleared up some misconceptions that I had from those classes, such as the fact that there should not be a prokaryote domain, as you have single-celled organisms without nuclei that are more different from each other than a daffodil and an elephant. I did learn some neat facts about the horizontal gene transfer, though -- as much as 8% of human DNA comes from viral DNA that was introduced to our genome at some point during our history. Because of the introduction of a certain kind of viral DNA, mammals acquired the ability to form placentas. (**This idea of characteristics acquired, which is so Lamarckian, and then those characteristics getting integrated into the genome, was very fascinating**)It was also a fascinating history of the persons responsible, and I have new figures in the realm of biology to think about (Carl Woese, Lynn Margulis, Ford Doolittle, Constantin Merezhkowsky -- especially Carl Woese).One note: I listened to the audiobook. It was a pleasant and well-performed listen, except when the narrator encountered quotes by non-native English-speaking scientists. He would say the quote in a poor accent from that country. It was bad. I cringed."
60,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9352033-john-wood,4,"Just how was life created and how does it change and evolve? This book delves into the history of human exploration of these questions, the discoveries, the discoverers, the theories, the theorists, opposing viewpoints, opposers, the collaborations, the collaborators... The road is winding and full of potholes, on ramps, off ramps, definitely not a straight shot to the ultimate answers. We often think of science as relatively straight-forward but this book really illustrates the disagreements, infighting, jealousies, and egos. With new insights such as HGT (horizontal gene transfer), older ideas are often questioned and even revised or refuted. Though definitely informative, thought-provoking, and well researched with extensive notes, bibliography, and index it can get confusing and a bit difficult keeping it all straight. It could use a glossary and short biographies to help clarify. My own thinking has definitely changed, perhaps even ""evolved"" after reading this. Another informative book on this subject is ""She Has Her Mother's Laugh: the Powers, Perversions, and Potentials of Heredity"" by Carl Zimmer"
61,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32565175-cinnamonwolf,4,"The tree of life is not a tree. It's a chimeral monster that eats identities and order for breakfast. Anyone more complex than a stretch of RNA is unlikely to be just itself.David Quammen takes us on a wild journey starting a little before Darwin through crazy Russian pedophiles to Nobel Prize laureates and back again. The book is filled with fascinating details and vivid portraits of people that in some way or other helped us realize how complex life on Earth is. Every 50-100 pages I found myself wondering: what else is there to say on the topic? And I found that there was plenty. Though, I have to admit that some repetitions were annoying and, especially in the second half of the book, some information was irrelevant at best. For example, I could've lived with less information on Woese's crankiness, weed and bush adventures, and ego. But oh well, The Tangled Tree was entertaining and informative. While not many concepts were new to me it was nice to be reminded and have it all so neatly arranged.P.S. Octavia E. Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy is a good read to follow The Tangled Tree. Just saying."
62,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5282589-barksdale-penick,5,"David Quammen's The Song of the Dodo remains one of my favorite books, and The Tangled Tree was recently recommended to me. It starts from the observation that as humans have tried to classify the world's organisms, the most common metaphor was a tree. Darwin included an illustration of a tree in his Origins of Species, and he was hardly the first or the last. But over the past 40 years it has become clear that species don't neatly evolve from their forbearers, principally because genes are transferred between organisms other than from parent to child. This is how bacteria morph to anti-biotic resistance so quickly, because DNA and therefore attributes can transfer between living organisms. So any tree has to show branches and growth and connections in all directions, although many lead to dead ends through extinction.Quammen has a particular style of explicating difficult scientific topics, paying great attention to the people involved. Many chapters end with a statement such as ""Having heard that Professor ZZZ was doing important work in Milan, I hopped a plane to Italy to see what I could learn."" And while I sometimes felt there was a little bit too much of this ""up close and personal"" approach, I suppose it really is more effective than just telling us what Professor ZZZ uncovered. I do disagree with one of Quammen's basic observations, that the course of science is greatly influenced by the personalities involved. That may well be true at a micro level, but the larger path of human learning is far larger than any individual and looks more like the ""organism"" of an ant colony, with the colony moving forward without regard to any particular ant's contribution. Where it all leads, of course, is unknowable, but I learned much from this book and will forever remember that my body has far more bacterial cells than human cells and that my DNA has lots of strands from bacteria and viruses."
63,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821272-batsheva,2,"I have some mixed feelings about this book. First, the science writing is great and explains some pretty complicated concepts clearly. (I really liked the chapter on gene transfer between bacteria.) However, this book is more about the history of science, of how we classify organisms, so it also involves long, meandering tales of this scientist and that scientist worked together in a lab once - then scientist b worked with scientist c, etc, etc. It's like having coffee with a nostalgic relative who has long twisted narratives about Aunt Lynn and Uncle Carl (and what seem to be about 1000 other characters). Lynn was a hoot (9/11 truther, but a great cook!) Carl was cranky, those grad students were messing around with radioactive substances and everyone was mad at each other the rest of the time. It does emphasize that science is a process, undertaken by humans, with all their human foibles and victories. The process of science, like reading this book, can take a long time and is often frustrating. It is indeed a tangled path, so merely casual readers beware. "

Fascinating. Enjoyable. And, of course, educational.From rather primitive to currently advanced techniques, this book is about the how of cell evolvement through the study of the genetic structure. And the big discovery -- a challenge to Darwin -- is Horizontal Gene Transfer. We now know that cells do not only evolve through division and offspring, slowly adapting through mutations -- (the basics in what we were taught about evolution) -- but by the sharing of genes among organisms. This is a major reason that bacteria quickly become resistant to antibiotics. But this 'sideways' gene transfer happens among all life forms, even hominids. And it didn't just happen in the early stages of life development. It continues today. Well-written -- a great read."

I saw it again and saw the word ""Archaea"" which sounded interesting. Not recalling that I'd tried reading before, I found only the audio version available at the library to download. And that made a big difference. Listening while doing chores or exercise pushed me past whatever it was that hindered me before. I suppose that might be the great level of detail about the characters in the story. The book gives the biology and also the story of the scientists. I would say that it centers around Carl Woese, a name I had not known. I took a lot of biological science in school, but I finished in 1971. This book caught me up and it was fascinating, as in like a religious experience. All these people involved in finding pieces of a puzzle. It's the story of evolution on steroids. It is a slow methodical telling and audio makes that better with the vocal inflections of the narrator making it have more life than the print may have.

The title and the ""we'll get there, but I need to tell you some backstory"" aspect of the book makes it seem like the main idea is that Darwin's conception of evolution is deeply flawed. I'm not sure Quammen really makes that point particularly clear. It feels like this book is purposely slanted as seeing more of a challenge to Darwin to draw more attention and shock value, even though Quammen really wanted to write about Woese and the other scientists who were involved with his work. I'm sure challenging Darwin sells more books than a scientist's biography."

Ultimately, I was challenged to really think about: (1) whether or not the currently understood categorical thinking about aspects of life on earth is wrong; (2) what (if anything) does this mean to Darwin’s foundational principle: evolution by natural selection; (3) are we actually “individuals”?"

Also a lot of disagreements about what the major groupings of life are. (Personally I’m happy to go with plants, animals, and little one-called creatures.) I think the book focused a little too much on a scientist named Woese who was brilliant but also evidently unpleasant and egotistical. Also, it went on a little too much about how the discovery of horizontal gene-transfer invalidates the tree metaphor, but that’s mostly true just for the one-called creatures - the tree concept for plants and animals seems more or less pretty intact as far as I can see.

The author explains the history of the science of evolution focusing mostly on the recent history of the research that has upended some of what we were all taught: that there is a tree of life with evolution bringing about slow changes. Newer research over the past decades has found that there are tiny cells inside cells that have their own genes and transfer those genes. And that there is horizontal gene transfer between organisms. Fascinating stuff and the author explains it all very clearly. He also describes the scientists who have discovered these things. I highly recommend this book.

While I could have done with fewer personal details about Woese, that didn't distract too much from how enjoyable it can be to take in the massive amount of mind-boggling information."
90,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9352033-john-wood,4,"Just how was life created and how does it change and evolve? This book delves into the history of human exploration of these questions, the discoveries, the discoverers, the theories, the theorists, opposing viewpoints, opposers, the collaborations, the collaborators... The road is winding and full of potholes, on ramps, off ramps, definitely not a straight shot to the ultimate answers. We often think of science as relatively straight-forward but this book really illustrates the disagreements, infighting, jealousies, and egos. With new insights such as HGT (horizontal gene transfer), older ideas are often questioned and even revised or refuted. Though definitely informative, thought-provoking, and well researched with extensive notes, bibliography, and index it can get confusing and a bit difficult keeping it all straight. It could use a glossary and short biographies to help clarify. My own thinking has definitely changed, perhaps even ""evolved"" after reading this. Another informative book on this subject is ""She Has Her Mother's Laugh: the Powers, Perversions, and Potentials of Heredity"" by Carl Zimmer"
91,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32565175-cinnamonwolf,4,"The tree of life is not a tree. It's a chimeral monster that eats identities and order for breakfast. Anyone more complex than a stretch of RNA is unlikely to be just itself.David Quammen takes us on a wild journey starting a little before Darwin through crazy Russian pedophiles to Nobel Prize laureates and back again. The book is filled with fascinating details and vivid portraits of people that in some way or other helped us realize how complex life on Earth is. Every 50-100 pages I found myself wondering: what else is there to say on the topic? And I found that there was plenty. Though, I have to admit that some repetitions were annoying and, especially in the second half of the book, some information was irrelevant at best. For example, I could've lived with less information on Woese's crankiness, weed and bush adventures, and ego. But oh well, The Tangled Tree was entertaining and informative. While not many concepts were new to me it was nice to be reminded and have it all so neatly arranged.P.S. Octavia E. Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy is a good read to follow The Tangled Tree. Just saying."
92,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5282589-barksdale-penick,5,"David Quammen's The Song of the Dodo remains one of my favorite books, and The Tangled Tree was recently recommended to me. It starts from the observation that as humans have tried to classify the world's organisms, the most common metaphor was a tree. Darwin included an illustration of a tree in his Origins of Species, and he was hardly the first or the last. But over the past 40 years it has become clear that species don't neatly evolve from their forbearers, principally because genes are transferred between organisms other than from parent to child. This is how bacteria morph to anti-biotic resistance so quickly, because DNA and therefore attributes can transfer between living organisms. So any tree has to show branches and growth and connections in all directions, although many lead to dead ends through extinction.Quammen has a particular style of explicating difficult scientific topics, paying great attention to the people involved. Many chapters end with a statement such as ""Having heard that Professor ZZZ was doing important work in Milan, I hopped a plane to Italy to see what I could learn."" And while I sometimes felt there was a little bit too much of this ""up close and personal"" approach, I suppose it really is more effective than just telling us what Professor ZZZ uncovered. I do disagree with one of Quammen's basic observations, that the course of science is greatly influenced by the personalities involved. That may well be true at a micro level, but the larger path of human learning is far larger than any individual and looks more like the ""organism"" of an ant colony, with the colony moving forward without regard to any particular ant's contribution. Where it all leads, of course, is unknowable, but I learned much from this book and will forever remember that my body has far more bacterial cells than human cells and that my DNA has lots of strands from bacteria and viruses."

I was a bit annoyed with the organization of the book, especially toward the end - the author seemingly couldn't decide if he wanted to write a straightforward, thematic review or a biography of Carl Woese. While I could have done with fewer personal details about Woese, that didn't distract too much from how enjoyable it can be to take in the massive amount of mind-boggling information."
120,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9352033-john-wood,4,"Just how was life created and how does it change and evolve? This book delves into the history of human exploration of these questions, the discoveries, the discoverers, the theories, the theorists, opposing viewpoints, opposers, the collaborations, the collaborators... The road is winding and full of potholes, on ramps, off ramps, definitely not a straight shot to the ultimate answers. We often think of science as relatively straight-forward but this book really illustrates the disagreements, infighting, jealousies, and egos. With new insights such as HGT (horizontal gene transfer), older ideas are often questioned and even revised or refuted. Though definitely informative, thought-provoking, and well researched with extensive notes, bibliography, and index it can get confusing and a bit difficult keeping it all straight. It could use a glossary and short biographies to help clarify. My own thinking has definitely changed, perhaps even ""evolved"" after reading this. Another informative book on this subject is ""She Has Her Mother's Laugh: the Powers, Perversions, and Potentials of Heredity"" by Carl Zimmer"
121,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32565175-cinnamonwolf,4,"The tree of life is not a tree. It's a chimeral monster that eats identities and order for breakfast. Anyone more complex than a stretch of RNA is unlikely to be just itself.David Quammen takes us on a wild journey starting a little before Darwin through crazy Russian pedophiles to Nobel Prize laureates and back again. The book is filled with fascinating details and vivid portraits of people that in some way or other helped us realize how complex life on Earth is. Every 50-100 pages I found myself wondering: what else is there to say on the topic? And I found that there was plenty. Though, I have to admit that some repetitions were annoying and, especially in the second half of the book, some information was irrelevant at best. For example, I could've lived with less information on Woese's crankiness, weed and bush adventures, and ego. But oh well, The Tangled Tree was entertaining and informative. While not many concepts were new to me it was nice to be reminded and have it all so neatly arranged.P.S. Octavia E. Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy is a good read to follow The Tangled Tree. Just saying."
122,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5282589-barksdale-penick,5,"David Quammen's The Song of the Dodo remains one of my favorite books, and The Tangled Tree was recently recommended to me. It starts from the observation that as humans have tried to classify the world's organisms, the most common metaphor was a tree. Darwin included an illustration of a tree in his Origins of Species, and he was hardly the first or the last. But over the past 40 years it has become clear that species don't neatly evolve from their forbearers, principally because genes are transferred between organisms other than from parent to child. This is how bacteria morph to anti-biotic resistance so quickly, because DNA and therefore attributes can transfer between living organisms. So any tree has to show branches and growth and connections in all directions, although many lead to dead ends through extinction.Quammen has a particular style of explicating difficult scientific topics, paying great attention to the people involved. Many chapters end with a statement such as ""Having heard that Professor ZZZ was doing important work in Milan, I hopped a plane to Italy to see what I could learn."" And while I sometimes felt there was a little bit too much of this ""up close and personal"" approach, I suppose it really is more effective than just telling us what Professor ZZZ uncovered. I do disagree with one of Quammen's basic observations, that the course of science is greatly influenced by the personalities involved. That may well be true at a micro level, but the larger path of human learning is far larger than any individual and looks more like the ""organism"" of an ant colony, with the colony moving forward without regard to any particular ant's contribution. Where it all leads, of course, is unknowable, but I learned much from this book and will forever remember that my body has far more bacterial cells than human cells and that my DNA has lots of strands from bacteria and viruses."
123,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821272-batsheva,2,"I have some mixed feelings about this book. First, the science writing is great and explains some pretty complicated concepts clearly. (I really liked the chapter on gene transfer between bacteria.) However, this book is more about the history of science, of how we classify organisms, so it also involves long, meandering tales of this scientist and that scientist worked together in a lab once - then scientist b worked with scientist c, etc, etc. It's like having coffee with a nostalgic relative who has long twisted narratives about Aunt Lynn and Uncle Carl (and what seem to be about 1000 other characters). Lynn was a hoot (9/11 truther, but a great cook!) Carl was cranky, those grad students were messing around with radioactive substances and everyone was mad at each other the rest of the time. It does emphasize that science is a process, undertaken by humans, with all their human foibles and victories. The process of science, like reading this book, can take a long time and is often frustrating. It is indeed a tangled path, so merely casual readers beware. "
124,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2442186-susan-m,5,"Excellent book.Not only does it describe very well the discoveries in evolution over the past half century, but it also serves as a very readable history of science. Fascinating. Enjoyable. And, of course, educational.From rather primitive to currently advanced techniques, this book is about the how of cell evolvement through the study of the genetic structure. And the big discovery -- a challenge to Darwin -- is Horizontal Gene Transfer. We now know that cells do not only evolve through division and offspring, slowly adapting through mutations -- (the basics in what we were taught about evolution) -- but by the sharing of genes among organisms. This is a major reason that bacteria quickly become resistant to antibiotics. But this 'sideways' gene transfer happens among all life forms, even hominids. And it didn't just happen in the early stages of life development. It continues today. Well-written -- a great read."
125,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4424614-anita,5,"I tried reading this book a couple years ago and made it through only 3 chapters before I decided that I was not interested or didn't understand what I was reading. I saw it again and saw the word ""Archaea"" which sounded interesting. Not recalling that I'd tried reading before, I found only the audio version available at the library to download. And that made a big difference. Listening while doing chores or exercise pushed me past whatever it was that hindered me before. I suppose that might be the great level of detail about the characters in the story. The book gives the biology and also the story of the scientists. I would say that it centers around Carl Woese, a name I had not known. I took a lot of biological science in school, but I finished in 1971. This book caught me up and it was fascinating, as in like a religious experience. All these people involved in finding pieces of a puzzle. It's the story of evolution on steroids. It is a slow methodical telling and audio makes that better with the vocal inflections of the narrator making it have more life than the print may have. And you pretty much have to see it all the way through to really get that light burst, but there are quite a few high points along the way. "
126,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1233641-tomomi-landsman,2,"I received this book from my brother-in-law as I studied evolutionary biology in grad school.It's been seven years since I was in the world of evolutionary biology, and while reading popular science books about the topic is a fun way to still connect to that world, I don't think I would enjoy rereading this book to do so.It feels to me like this book is falsely advertised. The title and the ""we'll get there, but I need to tell you some backstory"" aspect of the book makes it seem like the main idea is that Darwin's conception of evolution is deeply flawed. I'm not sure Quammen really makes that point particularly clear. It feels like this book is purposely slanted as seeing more of a challenge to Darwin to draw more attention and shock value, even though Quammen really wanted to write about Woese and the other scientists who were involved with his work. I'm sure challenging Darwin sells more books than a scientist's biography."
127,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49749380-rob-barry,4,"I was fascinated by the idea that the scientific understanding of “human individuality” continues to evolve; that the meaning of “individual” in biological terms is hard to define. Further, I came to a greater appreciation of how complicated “our species” is - particularly when confronted by science that indicates that the “homo sapien” genome: (1) contains three percent Neanderthal DNA; (2) looks more chimp than human; (3) is 1/12th viral. Ultimately, I was challenged to really think about: (1) whether or not the currently understood categorical thinking about aspects of life on earth is wrong; (2) what (if anything) does this mean to Darwin’s foundational principle: evolution by natural selection; (3) are we actually “individuals”?"
128,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83858566-devon-deraad,5,"As a budding scientist, it is an invaluable opportunity to read not just the scientific details of a field, but to also have every colorful, human quirk of the field laid out masterfully before you. This book illuminates the rise of molecular phylogenetics and it’s utility in resolving the ‘tree of life’ as we know it. But it goes far beyond that and illuminates the lives and scientific processes of the key players in the field, making the entire story come alive. This book reveals what it means to question, to think like a scientist, and to be driven by a burning desire to know what we truly are."
129,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,4,"Very good book about the notion of an evolutionary tree of life and how reality is much more complex than the simple tree diagrams show. Also a lot of disagreements about what the major groupings of life are. (Personally I’m happy to go with plants, animals, and little one-called creatures.) I think the book focused a little too much on a scientist named Woese who was brilliant but also evidently unpleasant and egotistical. Also, it went on a little too much about how the discovery of horizontal gene-transfer invalidates the tree metaphor, but that’s mostly true just for the one-called creatures - the tree concept for plants and animals seems more or less pretty intact as far as I can see. "
130,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536612-susan-beecher,5,This book is amazing! The author explains the history of the science of evolution focusing mostly on the recent history of the research that has upended some of what we were all taught: that there is a tree of life with evolution bringing about slow changes. Newer research over the past decades has found that there are tiny cells inside cells that have their own genes and transfer those genes. And that there is horizontal gene transfer between organisms. Fascinating stuff and the author explains it all very clearly. He also describes the scientists who have discovered these things. I highly recommend this book.
131,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2454952-riley,4,Excellent review of the scientific dramas around our understanding of the tree of life. What struck me most was how often a dogma would get upset. Every major advance involved some scientist convincing all the others that what they thought impossible had happened. To me it says that we should hold onto scientific fact as lightly as we can so we don’t get left behind when the next enlightenment comes.
132,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/349903-claudia,5,"Science writing at its best.

Although I was interested in the history of the subject and its scientific evolution, there was way too much emphasis on the petty drama amongst scientists and throwaway chapters about tangential topics. I was hoping for something more like ""The Gene: An Intimate History"", but I guess I'll just avoid Quammen's books."
137,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7791513-dominika,4,quite an awesome read for a layman with some vague background knowledge on genetics. decent balance between hard knowledge and storytelling.

The book takes us throughout the history of evolutional genetics, starting from Darwin and up to the latest thoughts in the field. It is a truly profound deep dive into science that covers the most prominent names in genetic research and development, and brings fresh views onto such concepts as horizontal gene transfer, microbiology and evolution.

This book reads in a similar flow to The Gene, Starting from pre-darwinian ideas of the tree of life, Quammen examines the important figures and ideas related to HGT. Personally the information itself was very interesting, some tidbits like knowing the human genome is 8% viral stunned me. That being said the way the book was written did not do much for me. There was attempts made to add the authors personality and a bit of humor in but most felt forced to me. This aspect did not take away from the quality of the information but the book as a whole came across a little dry. "

The road is winding and full of potholes, on ramps, off ramps, definitely not a straight shot to the ultimate answers. We often think of science as relatively straight-forward but this book really illustrates the disagreements, infighting, jealousies, and egos. With new insights such as HGT (horizontal gene transfer), older ideas are often questioned and even revised or refuted. Though definitely informative, thought-provoking, and well researched with extensive notes, bibliography, and index it can get confusing and a bit difficult keeping it all straight.

181,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32565175-cinnamonwolf,4,"The tree of life is not a tree. It's a chimeral monster that eats identities and order for breakfast. Anyone more complex than a stretch of RNA is unlikely to be just itself.David Quammen takes us on a wild journey starting a little before Darwin through crazy Russian pedophiles to Nobel Prize laureates and back again. The book is filled with fascinating details and vivid portraits of people that in some way or other helped us realize how complex life on Earth is. Every 50-100 pages I found myself wondering: what else is there to say on the topic? And I found that there was plenty. Though, I have to admit that some repetitions were annoying and, especially in the second half of the book, some information was irrelevant at best. For example, I could've lived with less information on Woese's crankiness, weed and bush adventures, and ego. But oh well, The Tangled Tree was entertaining and informative. While not many concepts were new to me it was nice to be reminded and have it all so neatly arranged.P.S. Octavia E. Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy is a good read to follow The Tangled Tree. Just saying."
182,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5282589-barksdale-penick,5,"David Quammen's The Song of the Dodo remains one of my favorite books, and The Tangled Tree was recently recommended to me. It starts from the observation that as humans have tried to classify the world's organisms, the most common metaphor was a tree. Darwin included an illustration of a tree in his Origins of Species, and he was hardly the first or the last. But over the past 40 years it has become clear that species don't neatly evolve from their forbearers, principally because genes are transferred between organisms other than from parent to child. This is how bacteria morph to anti-biotic resistance so quickly, because DNA and therefore attributes can transfer between living organisms. So any tree has to show branches and growth and connections in all directions, although many lead to dead ends through extinction.Quammen has a particular style of explicating difficult scientific topics, paying great attention to the people involved. Many chapters end with a statement such as ""Having heard that Professor ZZZ was doing important work in Milan, I hopped a plane to Italy to see what I could learn."" And while I sometimes felt there was a little bit too much of this ""up close and personal"" approach, I suppose it really is more effective than just telling us what Professor ZZZ uncovered. I do disagree with one of Quammen's basic observations, that the course of science is greatly influenced by the personalities involved. That may well be true at a micro level, but the larger path of human learning is far larger than any individual and looks more like the ""organism"" of an ant colony, with the colony moving forward without regard to any particular ant's contribution. Where it all leads, of course, is unknowable, but I learned much from this book and will forever remember that my body has far more bacterial cells than human cells and that my DNA has lots of strands from bacteria and viruses."
183,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821272-batsheva,2,"I have some mixed feelings about this book. First, the science writing is great and explains some pretty complicated concepts clearly. (I really liked the chapter on gene transfer between bacteria.) However, this book is more about the history of science, of how we classify organisms, so it also involves long, meandering tales of this scientist and that scientist worked together in a lab once - then scientist b worked with scientist c, etc, etc. It's like having coffee with a nostalgic relative who has long twisted narratives about Aunt Lynn and Uncle Carl (and what seem to be about 1000 other characters). Lynn was a hoot (9/11 truther, but a great cook!) Carl was cranky, those grad students were messing around with radioactive substances and everyone was mad at each other the rest of the time. It does emphasize that science is a process, undertaken by humans, with all their human foibles and victories. The process of science, like reading this book, can take a long time and is often frustrating. It is indeed a tangled path, so merely casual readers beware. "
184,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2442186-susan-m,5,"Excellent book.Not only does it describe very well the discoveries in evolution over the past half century, but it also serves as a very readable history of science. Fascinating. Enjoyable. And, of course, educational.From rather primitive to currently advanced techniques, this book is about the how of cell evolvement through the study of the genetic structure. And the big discovery -- a challenge to Darwin -- is Horizontal Gene Transfer. We now know that cells do not only evolve through division and offspring, slowly adapting through mutations -- (the basics in what we were taught about evolution) -- but by the sharing of genes among organisms. This is a major reason that bacteria quickly become resistant to antibiotics. But this 'sideways' gene transfer happens among all life forms, even hominids. And it didn't just happen in the early stages of life development. It continues today. Well-written -- a great read."
185,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4424614-anita,5,"I tried reading this book a couple years ago and made it through only 3 chapters before I decided that I was not interested or didn't understand what I was reading. I saw it again and saw the word ""Archaea"" which sounded interesting. Not recalling that I'd tried reading before, I found only the audio version available at the library to download. And that made a big difference. Listening while doing chores or exercise pushed me past whatever it was that hindered me before. I suppose that might be the great level of detail about the characters in the story. The book gives the biology and also the story of the scientists. I would say that it centers around Carl Woese, a name I had not known. I took a lot of biological science in school, but I finished in 1971. This book caught me up and it was fascinating, as in like a religious experience. All these people involved in finding pieces of a puzzle. It's the story of evolution on steroids. It is a slow methodical telling and audio makes that better with the vocal inflections of the narrator making it have more life than the print may have. And you pretty much have to see it all the way through to really get that light burst, but there are quite a few high points along the way. "
186,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1233641-tomomi-landsman,2,"I received this book from my brother-in-law as I studied evolutionary biology in grad school.It's been seven years since I was in the world of evolutionary biology, and while reading popular science books about the topic is a fun way to still connect to that world, I don't think I would enjoy rereading this book to do so.It feels to me like this book is falsely advertised. The title and the ""we'll get there, but I need to tell you some backstory"" aspect of the book makes it seem like the main idea is that Darwin's conception of evolution is deeply flawed. I'm not sure Quammen really makes that point particularly clear. It feels like this book is purposely slanted as seeing more of a challenge to Darwin to draw more attention and shock value, even though Quammen really wanted to write about Woese and the other scientists who were involved with his work. I'm sure challenging Darwin sells more books than a scientist's biography."
187,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49749380-rob-barry,4,"I was fascinated by the idea that the scientific understanding of “human individuality” continues to evolve; that the meaning of “individual” in biological terms is hard to define. Further, I came to a greater appreciation of how complicated “our species” is - particularly when confronted by science that indicates that the “homo sapien” genome: (1) contains three percent Neanderthal DNA; (2) looks more chimp than human; (3) is 1/12th viral. Ultimately, I was challenged to really think about: (1) whether or not the currently understood categorical thinking about aspects of life on earth is wrong; (2) what (if anything) does this mean to Darwin’s foundational principle: evolution by natural selection; (3) are we actually “individuals”?"
188,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83858566-devon-deraad,5,"As a budding scientist, it is an invaluable opportunity to read not just the scientific details of a field, but to also have every colorful, human quirk of the field laid out masterfully before you. This book illuminates the rise of molecular phylogenetics and it’s utility in resolving the ‘tree of life’ as we know it. But it goes far beyond that and illuminates the lives and scientific processes of the key players in the field, making the entire story come alive. This book reveals what it means to question, to think like a scientist, and to be driven by a burning desire to know what we truly are."
189,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,4,"Very good book about the notion of an evolutionary tree of life and how reality is much more complex than the simple tree diagrams show. Also a lot of disagreements about what the major groupings of life are. (Personally I’m happy to go with plants, animals, and little one-called creatures.) I think the book focused a little too much on a scientist named Woese who was brilliant but also evidently unpleasant and egotistical. Also, it went on a little too much about how the discovery of horizontal gene-transfer invalidates the tree metaphor, but that’s mostly true just for the one-called creatures - the tree concept for plants and animals seems more or less pretty intact as far as I can see. "
190,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536612-susan-beecher,5,This book is amazing! The author explains the history of the science of evolution focusing mostly on the recent history of the research that has upended some of what we were all taught: that there is a tree of life with evolution bringing about slow changes. Newer research over the past decades has found that there are tiny cells inside cells that have their own genes and transfer those genes. And that there is horizontal gene transfer between organisms. Fascinating stuff and the author explains it all very clearly. He also describes the scientists who have discovered these things. I highly recommend this book.
191,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2454952-riley,4,Excellent review of the scientific dramas around our understanding of the tree of life. What struck me most was how often a dogma would get upset. Every major advance involved some scientist convincing all the others that what they thought impossible had happened. To me it says that we should hold onto scientific fact as lightly as we can so we don’t get left behind when the next enlightenment comes.

216,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1233641-tomomi-landsman,2,"I received this book from my brother-in-law as I studied evolutionary biology in grad school.It's been seven years since I was in the world of evolutionary biology, and while reading popular science books about the topic is a fun way to still connect to that world, I don't think I would enjoy rereading this book to do so.It feels to me like this book is falsely advertised. The title and the ""we'll get there, but I need to tell you some backstory"" aspect of the book makes it seem like the main idea is that Darwin's conception of evolution is deeply flawed. I'm not sure Quammen really makes that point particularly clear. It feels like this book is purposely slanted as seeing more of a challenge to Darwin to draw more attention and shock value, even though Quammen really wanted to write about Woese and the other scientists who were involved with his work. I'm sure challenging Darwin sells more books than a scientist's biography."
217,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49749380-rob-barry,4,"I was fascinated by the idea that the scientific understanding of “human individuality” continues to evolve; that the meaning of “individual” in biological terms is hard to define. Further, I came to a greater appreciation of how complicated “our species” is - particularly when confronted by science that indicates that the “homo sapien” genome: (1) contains three percent Neanderthal DNA; (2) looks more chimp than human; (3) is 1/12th viral. Ultimately, I was challenged to really think about: (1) whether or not the currently understood categorical thinking about aspects of life on earth is wrong; (2) what (if anything) does this mean to Darwin’s foundational principle: evolution by natural selection; (3) are we actually “individuals”?"

This book illuminates the rise of molecular phylogenetics and it’s utility in resolving the ‘tree of life’ as we know it. But it goes far beyond that and illuminates the lives and scientific processes of the key players in the field, making the entire story come alive.

Also a lot of disagreements about what the major groupings of life are. (Personally I’m happy to go with plants, animals, and little one-called creatures.) I think the book focused a little too much on a scientist named Woese who was brilliant but also evidently unpleasant and egotistical. Also, it went on a little too much about how the discovery of horizontal gene-transfer invalidates the tree metaphor, but that’s mostly true just for the one-called creatures - the tree concept for plants and animals seems more or less pretty intact as far as I can see.

220,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536612-susan-beecher,5,This book is amazing! The author explains the history of the science of evolution focusing mostly on the recent history of the research that has upended some of what we were all taught: that there is a tree of life with evolution bringing about slow changes. Newer research over the past decades has found that there are tiny cells inside cells that have their own genes and transfer those genes. And that there is horizontal gene transfer between organisms. Fascinating stuff and the author explains it all very clearly. He also describes the scientists who have discovered these things. I highly recommend this book.

241,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32565175-cinnamonwolf,4,"The tree of life is not a tree. It's a chimeral monster that eats identities and order for breakfast. Anyone more complex than a stretch of RNA is unlikely to be just itself.David Quammen takes us on a wild journey starting a little before Darwin through crazy Russian pedophiles to Nobel Prize laureates and back again. The book is filled with fascinating details and vivid portraits of people that in some way or other helped us realize how complex life on Earth is. Every 50-100 pages I found myself wondering: what else is there to say on the topic? And I found that there was plenty. Though, I have to admit that some repetitions were annoying and, especially in the second half of the book, some information was irrelevant at best. For example, I could've lived with less information on Woese's crankiness, weed and bush adventures, and ego. But oh well, The Tangled Tree was entertaining and informative. While not many concepts were new to me it was nice to be reminded and have it all so neatly arranged.P.S. Octavia E. Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy is a good read to follow The Tangled Tree. Just saying."
242,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5282589-barksdale-penick,5,"David Quammen's The Song of the Dodo remains one of my favorite books, and The Tangled Tree was recently recommended to me. It starts from the observation that as humans have tried to classify the world's organisms, the most common metaphor was a tree. Darwin included an illustration of a tree in his Origins of Species, and he was hardly the first or the last. But over the past 40 years it has become clear that species don't neatly evolve from their forbearers, principally because genes are transferred between organisms other than from parent to child. This is how bacteria morph to anti-biotic resistance so quickly, because DNA and therefore attributes can transfer between living organisms. So any tree has to show branches and growth and connections in all directions, although many lead to dead ends through extinction.Quammen has a particular style of explicating difficult scientific topics, paying great attention to the people involved. Many chapters end with a statement such as ""Having heard that Professor ZZZ was doing important work in Milan, I hopped a plane to Italy to see what I could learn."" And while I sometimes felt there was a little bit too much of this ""up close and personal"" approach, I suppose it really is more effective than just telling us what Professor ZZZ uncovered. I do disagree with one of Quammen's basic observations, that the course of science is greatly influenced by the personalities involved. That may well be true at a micro level, but the larger path of human learning is far larger than any individual and looks more like the ""organism"" of an ant colony, with the colony moving forward without regard to any particular ant's contribution. Where it all leads, of course, is unknowable, but I learned much from this book and will forever remember that my body has far more bacterial cells than human cells and that my DNA has lots of strands from bacteria and viruses."
243,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821272-batsheva,2,"I have some mixed feelings about this book. First, the science writing is great and explains some pretty complicated concepts clearly. (I really liked the chapter on gene transfer between bacteria.) However, this book is more about the history of science, of how we classify organisms, so it also involves long, meandering tales of this scientist and that scientist worked together in a lab once - then scientist b worked with scientist c, etc, etc. It's like having coffee with a nostalgic relative who has long twisted narratives about Aunt Lynn and Uncle Carl (and what seem to be about 1000 other characters). Lynn was a hoot (9/11 truther, but a great cook!) Carl was cranky, those grad students were messing around with radioactive substances and everyone was mad at each other the rest of the time. It does emphasize that science is a process, undertaken by humans, with all their human foibles and victories. The process of science, like reading this book, can take a long time and is often frustrating. It is indeed a tangled path, so merely casual readers beware. "
244,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2442186-susan-m,5,"Excellent book.Not only does it describe very well the discoveries in evolution over the past half century, but it also serves as a very readable history of science. Fascinating. Enjoyable. And, of course, educational.From rather primitive to currently advanced techniques, this book is about the how of cell evolvement through the study of the genetic structure. And the big discovery -- a challenge to Darwin -- is Horizontal Gene Transfer. We now know that cells do not only evolve through division and offspring, slowly adapting through mutations -- (the basics in what we were taught about evolution) -- but by the sharing of genes among organisms. This is a major reason that bacteria quickly become resistant to antibiotics. But this 'sideways' gene transfer happens among all life forms, even hominids. And it didn't just happen in the early stages of life development. It continues today. Well-written -- a great read."
245,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4424614-anita,5,"I tried reading this book a couple years ago and made it through only 3 chapters before I decided that I was not interested or didn't understand what I was reading. I saw it again and saw the word ""Archaea"" which sounded interesting. Not recalling that I'd tried reading before, I found only the audio version available at the library to download. And that made a big difference. Listening while doing chores or exercise pushed me past whatever it was that hindered me before. I suppose that might be the great level of detail about the characters in the story. The book gives the biology and also the story of the scientists. I would say that it centers around Carl Woese, a name I had not known. I took a lot of biological science in school, but I finished in 1971. This book caught me up and it was fascinating, as in like a religious experience. All these people involved in finding pieces of a puzzle. It's the story of evolution on steroids. It is a slow methodical telling and audio makes that better with the vocal inflections of the narrator making it have more life than the print may have.

272,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5282589-barksdale-penick,5,"David Quammen's The Song of the Dodo remains one of my favorite books, and The Tangled Tree was recently recommended to me. It starts from the observation that as humans have tried to classify the world's organisms, the most common metaphor was a tree. Darwin included an illustration of a tree in his Origins of Species, and he was hardly the first or the last. But over the past 40 years it has become clear that species don't neatly evolve from their forbearers, principally because genes are transferred between organisms other than from parent to child. This is how bacteria morph to anti-biotic resistance so quickly, because DNA and therefore attributes can transfer between living organisms. So any tree has to show branches and growth and connections in all directions, although many lead to dead ends through extinction.Quammen has a particular style of explicating difficult scientific topics, paying great attention to the people involved. Many chapters end with a statement such as ""Having heard that Professor ZZZ was doing important work in Milan, I hopped a plane to Italy to see what I could learn."" And while I sometimes felt there was a little bit too much of this ""up close and personal"" approach, I suppose it really is more effective than just telling us what Professor ZZZ uncovered. I do disagree with one of Quammen's basic observations, that the course of science is greatly influenced by the personalities involved. That may well be true at a micro level, but the larger path of human learning is far larger than any individual and looks more like the ""organism"" of an ant colony, with the colony moving forward without regard to any particular ant's contribution. Where it all leads, of course, is unknowable, but I learned much from this book and will forever remember that my body has far more bacterial cells than human cells and that my DNA has lots of strands from bacteria and viruses."
273,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821272-batsheva,2,"I have some mixed feelings about this book. First, the science writing is great and explains some pretty complicated concepts clearly. (I really liked the chapter on gene transfer between bacteria.) However, this book is more about the history of science, of how we classify organisms, so it also involves long, meandering tales of this scientist and that scientist worked together in a lab once - then scientist b worked with scientist c, etc, etc. It's like having coffee with a nostalgic relative who has long twisted narratives about Aunt Lynn and Uncle Carl (and what seem to be about 1000 other characters). Lynn was a hoot (9/11 truther, but a great cook!) Carl was cranky, those grad students were messing around with radioactive substances and everyone was mad at each other the rest of the time. It does emphasize that science is a process, undertaken by humans, with all their human foibles and victories. The process of science, like reading this book, can take a long time and is often frustrating. It is indeed a tangled path, so merely casual readers beware. "
274,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2442186-susan-m,5,"Excellent book.Not only does it describe very well the discoveries in evolution over the past half century, but it also serves as a very readable history of science. Fascinating. Enjoyable. And, of course, educational.From rather primitive to currently advanced techniques, this book is about the how of cell evolvement through the study of the genetic structure. And the big discovery -- a challenge to Darwin -- is Horizontal Gene Transfer. We now know that cells do not only evolve through division and offspring, slowly adapting through mutations -- (the basics in what we were taught about evolution) -- but by the sharing of genes among organisms. This is a major reason that bacteria quickly become resistant to antibiotics. But this 'sideways' gene transfer happens among all life forms, even hominids. And it didn't just happen in the early stages of life development. It continues today. Well-written -- a great read."
275,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4424614-anita,5,"I tried reading this book a couple years ago and made it through only 3 chapters before I decided that I was not interested or didn't understand what I was reading. I saw it again and saw the word ""Archaea"" which sounded interesting. Not recalling that I'd tried reading before, I found only the audio version available at the library to download. And that made a big difference. Listening while doing chores or exercise pushed me past whatever it was that hindered me before. I suppose that might be the great level of detail about the characters in the story. The book gives the biology and also the story of the scientists. I would say that it centers around Carl Woese, a name I had not known. I took a lot of biological science in school, but I finished in 1971. This book caught me up and it was fascinating, as in like a religious experience. All these people involved in finding pieces of a puzzle. It's the story of evolution on steroids. It is a slow methodical telling and audio makes that better with the vocal inflections of the narrator making it have more life than the print may have. And you pretty much have to see it all the way through to really get that light burst, but there are quite a few high points along the way. "
276,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1233641-tomomi-landsman,2,"I received this book from my brother-in-law as I studied evolutionary biology in grad school.It's been seven years since I was in the world of evolutionary biology, and while reading popular science books about the topic is a fun way to still connect to that world, I don't think I would enjoy rereading this book to do so.It feels to me like this book is falsely advertised. The title and the ""we'll get there, but I need to tell you some backstory"" aspect of the book makes it seem like the main idea is that Darwin's conception of evolution is deeply flawed. I'm not sure Quammen really makes that point particularly clear. It feels like this book is purposely slanted as seeing more of a challenge to Darwin to draw more attention and shock value, even though Quammen really wanted to write about Woese and the other scientists who were involved with his work. I'm sure challenging Darwin sells more books than a scientist's biography."
277,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49749380-rob-barry,4,"I was fascinated by the idea that the scientific understanding of “human individuality” continues to evolve; that the meaning of “individual” in biological terms is hard to define. Further, I came to a greater appreciation of how complicated “our species” is - particularly when confronted by science that indicates that the “homo sapien” genome: (1) contains three percent Neanderthal DNA; (2) looks more chimp than human; (3) is 1/12th viral. Ultimately, I was challenged to really think about: (1) whether or not the currently understood categorical thinking about aspects of life on earth is wrong; (2) what (if anything) does this mean to Darwin’s foundational principle: evolution by natural selection; (3) are we actually “individuals”?"
278,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83858566-devon-deraad,5,"As a budding scientist, it is an invaluable opportunity to read not just the scientific details of a field, but to also have every colorful, human quirk of the field laid out masterfully before you. This book illuminates the rise of molecular phylogenetics and it’s utility in resolving the ‘tree of life’ as we know it. But it goes far beyond that and illuminates the lives and scientific processes of the key players in the field, making the entire story come alive. This book reveals what it means to question, to think like a scientist, and to be driven by a burning desire to know what we truly are."
279,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,4,"Very good book about the notion of an evolutionary tree of life and how reality is much more complex than the simple tree diagrams show. Also a lot of disagreements about what the major groupings of life are. (Personally I’m happy to go with plants, animals, and little one-called creatures.) I think the book focused a little too much on a scientist named Woese who was brilliant but also evidently unpleasant and egotistical. Also, it went on a little too much about how the discovery of horizontal gene-transfer invalidates the tree metaphor, but that’s mostly true just for the one-called creatures - the tree concept for plants and animals seems more or less pretty intact as far as I can see. "
280,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536612-susan-beecher,5,This book is amazing! The author explains the history of the science of evolution focusing mostly on the recent history of the research that has upended some of what we were all taught: that there is a tree of life with evolution bringing about slow changes. Newer research over the past decades has found that there are tiny cells inside cells that have their own genes and transfer those genes. And that there is horizontal gene transfer between organisms. Fascinating stuff and the author explains it all very clearly. He also describes the scientists who have discovered these things. I highly recommend this book.
281,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2454952-riley,4,Excellent review of the scientific dramas around our understanding of the tree of life. What struck me most was how often a dogma would get upset. Every major advance involved some scientist convincing all the others that what they thought impossible had happened. To me it says that we should hold onto scientific fact as lightly as we can so we don’t get left behind when the next enlightenment comes.
282,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/349903-claudia,5,"Science writing at its best. The explanations of a complicated subject are clear and the depth of the author's research on the work and personalities of the scientists involved in these paradigm changing discoveries is remarkable.Also, I find the topic fascinating!"
283,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/910657-ariane,3,"Very interesting, but even with my science background I found it to be quite technical and challenging to grasp at times. The information within is fascinating however. Definitely the type of book you should read at least twice! "
284,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/179111-zach,4,"It's not Mr Quammen's fault that my science education was pitiful. But even with all his heavy lifting, I was still 83% confused for 65% of this book."

286,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821815-shirin,3,"Kinda wish I'd just read a review of the book summarizing its main points. Although I was interested in the history of the subject and its scientific evolution, there was way too much emphasis on the petty drama amongst scientists and throwaway chapters about tangential topics. I was hoping for something more like ""The Gene: An Intimate History"", but I guess I'll just avoid Quammen's books."
287,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7791513-dominika,4,quite an awesome read for a layman with some vague background knowledge on genetics. decent balance between hard knowledge and storytelling.
288,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4147839-monty,4,An interesting narrative of what has been learned about evolutionary and molecular biology. It tells the story of the people as well as the science.
289,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17731082-vinayak-joshi,4,Interesting book about evolution and molecular biology. It had a few mindblowing ideas that I came to know about for the first time - like horizontal transfer of genes. Is a little long and too detailed in places. But overall a good read if you like science.

The book takes us throughout the history of evolutional genetics, starting from Darwin and up to the latest thoughts in the field. It is a truly profound deep dive into science that covers the most prominent names in genetic research and development, and brings fresh views onto such concepts as horizontal gene transfer, microbiology and evolution. "
296,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92668416-live-forever-or-die-trying,3,"3/5 stars for the book being just... good.This book is a in-depth look into HGT, or, horizontal gene transfer. This book reads in a similar flow to The Gene, Starting from pre-darwinian ideas of the tree of life, Quammen examines the important figures and ideas related to HGT. Personally the information itself was very interesting, some tidbits like knowing the human genome is 8% viral stunned me. That being said the way the book was written did not do much for me. There was attempts made to add the authors personality and a bit of humor in but most felt forced to me. This aspect did not take away from the quality of the information but the book as a whole came across a little dry. "
297,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36230480-kathy,3,Would have given higher rating but this was a very tedious book to read though it was informative. Too many details about other scientists and it can be challenging to read content wise.
298,1476776628,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24765047-emmanuel-ayeni,5,This book is a detailed book on the subject of biological evolution for anyone who is into science or subject of evolution.

I was a bit annoyed with the organization of the book, especially toward the end - the author seemingly couldn't decide if he wanted to write a straightforward, thematic review or a biography of Carl Woese. While I could have done with fewer personal details about Woese, that didn't distract too much from how enjoyable it can be to take in the massive amount of mind-boggling information."
