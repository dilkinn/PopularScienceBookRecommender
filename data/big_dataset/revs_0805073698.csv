I was familiar with a lot of stuff covered in the book but I still really enjoyed reading through it. Personally feel like he's a very good science communicator and makes things digestible in a way that's accessible for everyone without really losing much of the nuance. I really don't know what else to write, usually when I write long reviews its because I have a lot of pent up irritation to vent but when I love things I'm just like guys this is good totally would recommend. I do think I enjoyed Behave a lot more though because it covers a lot more biology/plus I learnt a lot of new things from it. Also really appreciate him providing context on the limitations of what one can really do to cope with inequity especially when I see so much pop psychology being about just trying to make everyone have grit or whatever."
1,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,4,"Non-Fiction. Twelve chapters on how stress is going to kill you, followed by six chapters on why stress is stressful, when it's not, and what we can do about it.If you're a worrier, this may not be the book for you. I won't lie, it upset me in the beginning. There are so many ways that stress can affect your health, your memory, the way you age, how you deal with stressors, and even how your children deal with stressors. The book can become a source of stress itself, one that far outweighs the few methods it gives for dealing with stress. But it addresses a lot of important issues, like the economics of stress and the way poverty and pay inequality have life-long health ramifications. It's not just about stress on a personal level, but a social, cultural, and political one. It also looks at the role stress plays in mental illness, pain, infertility, and addiction.The science can be quite dense at times, but Sapolsky is good at walking you through it and recalling topics he introduced earlier so you never have to feel like you're studying for something. He makes this easy to read, even if the subject is a difficult one. He's a great writer with a sense of humor, an obvious love of science, and respect for views that aren't his own. He offers multiple approaches for any given problem and points out questions we don't have answers for yet.Four stars. Good science writing that challenges assumptions and doesn't take itself too seriously. Also includes extensive end notes and an index. If you read this, get the third edition; it's revised and updated."

Incandenza.“It could be your glucocorticoids.” - Year of the Ectopic Heartbeat Dubstep Frequency Crowd Dispersal Device (?) Sex Panther Entertainment Unlimited/X-Ray and Infrared Photography by Marvin McGroin’s Medicinal Anthrax Soft Shell Tacos Incorporated, Amarillo, TX. The Ultimate Warrior (John Brian “Jim” Hellwig), Robert Sapolsky (Bill Sapolsky), Jennifer (Jen), Jim (Jim Cornette), George “The Animal” Steele (The Animal Himself), Lucious Malfoy (Jason Isaacs). Listed by some archivists as completed the following year, Y.T.-S.D.B. UNRELEASEDFilm begins silent. A naked man (George “The Animal” Steele) is sitting in a nondescript room, stress eating Toblerones. Weeping. His body visibility wracked with anguish as tributaries of warm nougat and honey stochastically traverse the lumpy topology of his hirsute torso. Twisting and bifurcating. His chest and stomach tattooed with a network of lines the color of Swiss mocha, all converging inexorably on the tenebrous vortex of his navel, where their flavors may be lost forever, beyond the event horizon, or else re-congealed into a perfect orb of Toblerone, sans almonds, and shot into another dimension. Adjacent, a dog-eared copy of Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers and several disemboweled turnbuckles. Robert Sapolsky (Bill Sapolsky) breaks the silence with susurrus of a glucocorticoidical nature, causing the tremulous bulk of the seated figure (George “The Animal” Steele) to quake with continued sobs.""Primates are super smart and organized just enough to devote their free time to being miserable to each other and stressing each other out. But if you get chronically, psycho-socially stressed, you're going to compromise your health. So, essentially, we've evolved to be smart enough to make ourselves sick.""Scene transitions to ringside view with Jen (Yours truly) and Jim (Jim Cornette) commentating on the arrival of the main event; The Ultimate Warrior (John Brian “Jim” Hellwig) vs. Robert Sapolsky (Bill Sapolsky). In a flourish of flash-bang pyrotechnics, The Ultimate Warrior (James Brian “Jim” Hellwig) emerges from backstage like a shaved mule with rainbow plumage fastened and KISS makeup applied. A creature built for carnage. Canines bared in atavistic rage. Nostrils flared to pump Cretaceous levels of oxygen into his swollen musculature.“Here he comes, Jen”“Implacable. Like a force of nature, Jim.”“A goddamn man mountain, Jen”“A veritable mountain of man, Jim.""“Right you are, Jen.""“A being like unto all that was glorious about the era of Hair Metal, processed and packed into a latex baggie like a summer sausage, Jim.""“Would you just look at that sausage, Jen.”“An ultra thin condom glistening with obscene amounts of spermicide and stuffed to bursting with walnuts, Jim.”“Get a load of the vascularity, Jen”“It’s almost sickening, Jim.”“I’m a little sick, Jen.”“I may throw up right here.

Lucious Malfoy, (Jason Isaacs) resplendent in anti-muggle apparel, is heard to sneer: “Your mother has chronically elevated glucocorticoids.”“He’s got him by the robes, Jim.”“By the balls too, Jen.”“I can confirm that a massive hand is firmly on the hog, Jim.”“Just look at those hands, Jen.”“There he goes, Jim!”“Good God! Would you just look at that parabola, Jen!”“Like a comet of white hair trailing popcorn and Chardonnay, Jim”In the center of the ring, Robert Sapolsky (Robert Maurice Sapolsky, the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor of Biological Sciences, and Professor of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, and by courtesy, Neurosurgery, at Stanford University. In addition, research associate at the National Museums of Kenya.) Takes up a mic and continues:""The stress response is incredibly ancient evolutionarily. Fish, birds and reptiles secrete the same stress hormones we do, yet their metabolism doesn't get messed up the way it does in people and other primates. Just look at the dichotomy between what your body does during real stress—for example, something is intent on eating you and you're running for your life—versus what your body does when you're turning on the same stress response for months on end for purely psycho-social reasons. You mobilize energy in your thigh muscles, you increase your blood pressure and you turn off everything that's not essential to surviving, such as digestion, growth and reproduction. You think more clearly, and certain aspects of learning and memory are enhanced. All of that is spectacularly adapted if you're dealing with an acute physical stressor—a real one.""The Ultimate Warrior (John Brian “Jim” Hellwig) grabs hold of the ropes and shakes them violently.“Would you just look at that intensity, Jen.”“It’s as if he’s grabbed hold of a live wire, Jim.”“Strong current flowing through that man, Jen.”“A mesmerizing vibrational frequency of fixed amplitude is emerging, Jim”“It’s enough to deter a slop-hound from mounting a gut-wagon, Jen.”“Well said. Any further attempts to waller in viscera will be met with extreme electrification, Jim.“That's quite a shock, Jen.”“He’s got the mic, Jim!”“I came here for one reason — to attack and keep coming. Not to ask but just to give, not to want but just to sing, sing the power of the Warrior, because this freak of nature right here is just beginning to swell, and when I get big enough, brother, there ain’t gonna be room for anybody else but me and all the Warriors floating through the veins.”""If you turn on the stress response chronically for purely psychological reasons,” Sapolsky admonishes. “You increase your risk of adult onset diabetes and high blood pressure. If you're chronically shutting down the digestive system, there's a bunch of gastrointestinal disorders you're more at risk for as well.""“I WAS SENT IN A CAPSULE FROM A PLACE NOT FROM HERE AND I CAME HERE FOR ONE REASON: TO ATTACK AND KEEP COMIN'. NOT TO ASK, BUT JUST TO GIVE. NOT TO WANT, BUT JUST TO SEND!”""Furthermore,” Sapolsky counters. “If you're chronically stressed, all sorts of aspects of brain function are impaired, including, at an extreme, making it harder for some neurons to survive neurological insults. Also, neurons in the parts of the brain relating to learning, memory and judgment don't function as well under stress. That particular piece is what my lab has spent the last 20 years on. If you plan to get stressed like a normal mammal, you had better turn on the stress response or else you're dead. But if you get chronically, psycho-socially stressed, like a Westernized human, then you are more at risk for heart disease and some of the other leading causes of death in Westernized life."" The Warrior, having it up to here with relentless mumbo-jumbo, explodes, drawing himself up and towering over his opponent, pectorals dancing in rhythmic electrochemical spasms.""LODGED IN MY SKULL ... WAS A PIECE OF THE CRYSTAL OF YOUR KINGDOM! YOUR MADNESS! THEY SAID, ""BUT WARRIOR, IT'S LODGED INSIDE YOUR SKULL,"" AND I SAID, ""SEW IT IN! LEAVE IT WHERE IT LAYS!""""We are capable of social supports that no other primate can even dream of,"" Sapolsky says. ""For example, I might say, 'This job, where I'm a lowly mail-room clerk, really doesn't matter. What really matters is that I'm the captain of my softball team or deacon of my church'—that sort of thing. It's not just somebody sitting here, grooming you with their own hands. We can actually feel comfort from the discovery that somebody on the other side of the planet is going through the same experience we are and feel, I'm not alone. We can even take comfort reading about a fictional character, and there's no primate out there that can feel better in life just by listening to Beethoven. So the range of supports that we're capable of is extraordinary.""“I look up to the gods, and when you fall below the skeletons of the Warriors past, the power of the Warriors will become the eighth wonder of the woooorrrrrldddd!!! Normal people, the people that walk the streets every day, we cannot understand. The family that I live for only breathes the air that smells of combat. With or without the face-paint I am the Ultimate Warrioooooorrrr!!! How must I prepare, you must ask yourself. Should I jump off the tallest building in the world? Should I lay on the lawn and let them run over me with lawn-mowers? Should I go to Africa and let them trample me with raging elephants? In my final meeting with the gods from the heavens above, they spoke to me and hit me with the power of the Ultimate Warrior. They told me: action stage left, action stage right. There is no place to run, all the fuses in the exit signs have burnt out. Aaaaarrgghhh, you can feel it dude! You can feel it! Full of the juice that carries the spaceship as far as it wants to go! Because when the moon is blood red the heavens have opened up from above and the Warriors have spoken. You’ve got the power to make the skies rumble and the earth shake. In the sheets of the wind, then I will survive. Load the spaceship with the rocket fuel, load it with the Warriors. With the command of my voice I raise the level of the Warriors to one that can’t be reproduced. Dig your claws into my organs, scratch into my tendons, bury your anchors into my bones, for the power of the Warrior will always prevaaaaaiiiiiilllll. By now all the little Warriors know that the power of the Ultimate Warrior is something that you want to feel, that you want to taste. It’s something that when you turn on that TV screen or when you buy a ticket to the Arenas you know that it’s going to be exciting and it might even be a little bit frightening. Now you must deal with the creation of all the un-pleasantries of the entire universe as I feel the injection from the gods above. I only know that the Ultimate Warrior is totally out of controoooooooolllll. Come on in where nightmares are the best part of my daaaaaaaayyyyyy. I live for anger and frustration.

3,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,0,"A very interesting book, but probably not one to read during a pandemic. Yeah, I know; you would think it would help. But somehow, talking about stress response, cortisol and anxiety during a time of world-wide physical and psychological stress response is actually a bit stressful. It's somewhat technical, but readable. It walks the reader through different aspects of the body and normal physiological response. Although he relies on the extreme examples (""ancestors confronting lions""), the information contained is valid. I suppose that's one of the troubles with science-translation.It's been updated twice since original publication. I feel like most of what it is saying isn't surprising, but I last intensively looked at stress response in the late 90s, so I'm wondering what more current thinking is."
4,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2095677-john-kaess,2,"The author spends 22 chapters beating us to death with hundreds of studies about how and why stress is bad for us. He focuses strongly on the chemistry and physiology of stress in animals and humans. He then spends 1 chapter on things we can do about it. Basically: don't be born poor, don't have a bad marriage, exercise and be religious. There. Now you don't have to read the book."
5,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373261-john,5,"I encountered a link to a speech by Sapolsky on Pharyngula, I think, and was immediately engaged by his speaking style. His books, or this one at least, is similarly easy to get into, and manages to discuss topics of fair complexity in an incredibly approachable way. He's clearly aware that his book might be read by a wide range of audiences, and strives to provide something for everyone. I'll definitely be working my way through the rest of his catalog.The book is fascinating, too, although as he notes many times, thinking about and addressing stress is difficult, because trying to act to reduce stress can itself be stressful. As he elucidates what's currently known about the links between stress and disease, a lot of interesting things emerge, some of which are essentially throwaway trivia, like the idea that anti-depressant medication takes a while to work on people that are clinically depressed because of the physiological nature of depression; he doesn't really spell it out, but the obvious corollary is that is someone takes AD medication and instantly feels better, they're probably not actually depressed. This insight was immensely powerful to me in this over-prescribed age of ours."

7,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60097-susan,5,"This is hands down the best medical book I have ever read. In a series of memorable and highly amusing stories and anecdotes Sapolsky explains the complex biology behind why well known principles of psychology, religion, new age philosophy and even voodoo curses work. The central story of the book is how the fight or flight response – the most powerful force that has shaped vertebrate evolution for hundreds of millions of years - is now being turned against modern humans through chronic stress and anxiety. He outlines how modern stress triggers that have nothing to do with immediate survival - whether brought on from traffic, bad bosses, bad relationships - can be linked to exacerbating the development of almost every modern epidemic from cancer to colitis, depression to dwarfism, diabetes to diarrhea, heart disease to infertility to immune disorders. The book concludes with some stories about coping with stress, and the unique psychological profiles of the people who avoid the development of stress-related diseases and experience health improvements with aging in a process he calls “successful aging.” "
8,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7328346-chung-chin,3,"This is a book packed full of information on how stress can cause our body to go haywire. You will find explanation for how stress affects your weight, sleep, and health in general.Although there are still lots of jargon and terms in the book that you will find alien, the explanation is given in the most simple way possible, making it an accessible material in general.However, after reading through all the chapters on how stress can wreak havoc to our body, you don't actually get a lot of materials on how you can counter them.So, this is a book on how stress can cause damage to your body. If you're looking for a solid book on recommendations to deal with stress, this might not be it.To the author's credit, he is trying to be as accurate as possible, and therefore I believe he is trying his best to recommend the most scientifically accurate practice to deal with stress; and sadly, there may not be many, although there is a few practical one such as exercise and meditation."

“The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.” – Paradise Lost, John Milton

I have always loved this quote from Paradise Lost. I have it written down in several notebooks, typed out on a sticky note on my laptop that I frequently scroll over, and even had it framed on the wall of my room when I lived with my parents. From the time I first read it, back in second year university, it became a sort of mantra for me, providing me with comfort and reassurance that even if times seemed particularly bad and I felt incredibly stressed, my mind was strong enough to control those feelings and to get me through whatever stressors I encountered.But, what I have learned in the last year is that (sometimes…often) the mind isn’t enough. Robert M. Sapolsky has a similar quote in his book Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers: “To a certain extent, our perceptions and interpretations of events can determine whether the same external circumstances constitute heaven or hell…” The crux of Sapolsky’s text, though, is that the mind isn’t always strong enough to overcome external circumstances and put them in perspective and, what’s more, sometimes the mind isn’t even capable of doing this sort of heavy lifting if there is a disorder or disease (such as depression or anxiety) that prevents it from doing so. To believe that the mind can persevere in all instances and actually change one’s perspective on reality 100% of the time is foolhardy and naive, and probably was incredibly detrimental to me back in university and had adverse effects on how I would learn to cope with stress as an adult. The point being that understanding stress and the science behind it is no simple task and certainly can’t be reduced to the belief that the mind, if persistent enough, can get a person through anything.I don’t often read non-fiction books. In fact, I rarely read them, if ever. However, it seems that this year I have done a lot of reading of non-fiction and the main reason for this is that I have felt empowered and motivated recently to finally try to understand my anxiety. When it became evident, towards the end of my third trimester of pregnancy back this past March, that my anxiety was going to be made much more severe by my pregnant condition, I knew (partly because my doctors were telling me) that something had to give and that I needed to get a better handle on my anxious condition once and for all. Not only for my baby’s health, but also for my present and future well-being and overall happiness. Part of this process has involved seeing a psychiatrist and learning about meditation and mindfulness techniques. Part of it has been about exercising as often as possible and forcing myself to go out and interact with my friends and family members even when I don’t feel up for it. But, I have always been an avid learner, a true student at heart from the moment I entered my grade one classroom, and so I felt that I wanted to supplement my doctor’s appointments and daily activities with reading material that would allow me to come to grips with feelings I have had for my entire life. I never have put in the effort to truly understand my anxiety in this way, and I immediately picked up the self-help book Let That Sh*t Go by Kate Petriw and Nina Purewal hoping that it would be a quick and easy read that would at least help me feel a little bit better. It certainly did and it was good, but it wasn’t anything truly groundbreaking or earth-shattering and it didn’t by any means fundamentally change my perspective on anxiety. I next delved into a book recommended by my psychiatrist, Mind Over Mood, and this was of course a huge eye-opener to me in that it taught me the basics of cognitive behavioural therapy and worked wonders to help me reframe my insecurities and fears and better manage my heightened emotions. What I felt these two books lacked, though, was an explanation of what was going on in my brain, of the chemical, biological and physical mechanisms that were clearly contributing to my anxious state and probably had been since my birth. It was a desire to get to the bottom of these internal processes that led me to pick up Sapolsky’s book.Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers is easily one of the best books I have ever read, of any genre or category. (That’s right, I’m putting it right up there with Jane Eyre although it is, naturally, a very different text!) I was utterly blown away by Sapolsky’s work, and as someone who has never studied psychology and who only studied science up until the end of high school, I was thoroughly impressed by how accessible and relatable he made the scientific explanations in this book. This type of text could easily become overwhelming, but Sapolsky is very careful to keep things manageable for his reader, and he even infuses dry humour, jokes and wit into the text (especially in his often unexpectedly hilarious footnotes, which are a must-read in themselves). He of course uses terminology like “glucocorticoids” and names of “catecholamines” like “epinephrine” and “norepinephrine” often, but he uses them so frequently and explains them so thoroughly that the reader gets the sense, by the end of the book, that these concepts aren’t all that incomprehensible. I also made a conscious effort to take my time while reading this book, not because it felt dense at all, but because it did feel heavy. I admit, it was an emotional read for me because I could so easily and fundamentally relate to the findings that Sapolsky examined; I became one of the test subjects he discussed because I recognized how my experiences fit into the results and conclusions. On the one hand, it was nice to know that there is a scientific explanation for why I feel a certain way, but it was also jarring and terrifying to be confronted with so much evidence and research to explain something that I have kind of taken for granted for my entire life. It made my anxiety feel that much more real and that much more difficult to ignore.Chapter 15, thus, became an incredibly meaningful chapter for me as it investigated anxiety disorders and the personality types that lend themselves to these sorts of disorders. Needless to say, I checked pretty much every box, and that was, as I mentioned, both liberating and scary. There was this sense, as I read, that Sapolsky just understood ME, on a fundamental level, and again, while it was nice to know that I am not alone in any of my feelings, it was also emotional. It made me even more moved when Sapolsky began to call anxiety a “disease” and distinguished it from chronic stress as being rooted in “a cognitive distortion”. Sapolsky posits that, whereas chronic stress is normally a response to an actually perceived external stressor (whether physiological or psychological), anxiety can arise due to stressors that are entirely imagined. This is definitely in-line with my own personal experiences, and while I appreciated the understanding Sapolsky’s description provided to me, no one ever wants to hear that they suffer from a disease. That’s not an easy pill to swallow, and I found myself realizing that I even exhibited anxious tendencies and behaviours as a young child (such as obsessive thinking and phobias) and becoming a bit saddened and melancholy about this. With my increased knowledge certainly came a better understanding of myself, but this wasn’t always a pleasant experience to be sure.What I did gain, most definitely, was a better comprehension of the biology of anxiety and a greater appreciation of the fact that it is a physical, scientific condition rooted in the brain. I’ve always known deep down that my anxiety is not something I have very much (if any) control over, but it is easy to believe, when something is a mental struggle, that if you can just be stronger, you can get past it. That is, after all, what Milton suggests and that quote from Paradise Lost is still one of my favourites. What is important to remember, however, is that mental illnesses are in fact just as physical as clearly physical ones, and although I always had an inkling of that, Sapolsky’s book solidified it for me. It made it clear to me that I shouldn’t be hard on myself, that I might not be able to conquer this all on my own, and that is okay. It made me realize that, just as I would seek help for a broken leg, there is nothing at all embarrassing or shameful about seeking help for a troubled mind. On the contrary, it is actually quite important and necessary.I’d like to close my review with a few quotes that particularly spoke to me from Sapolsky’s text. I will never be able to explain myself the concepts he espouses (he is a scientist, after all, and I don’t claim to be), but hopefully these quotes will give you a sense for how he writes and what value can be derived from picking up this book. It is one that has undoubtedly changed my life in so many ways and I would not hesitate to recommend it to those who wish to get to the root of what their brains might be undergoing on a daily basis.Quotes That Particularly Resonated with Me:“Anxiety is about dread and foreboding and your imagination running away with you.”“the distorted belief that stressors are everywhere and perpetual, and that the only hope for safety is constant mobilization of coping responses. Life consists of the concrete, agitated present of solving a problem that someone else might not even consider exists.”“most things that make us anxious are learned…we’ve generalized them based on their similarity to something associated with a trauma.”“For all anxious people, life is full of menacing stressors that demand vigilant coping responses.”***********“Find ways to view even the most stressful of situations as holding the promise of improvement but do not deny the possibility that things will not improve…Hope for the best and let that dominate most of your emotions, but at the same time let one small piece of you prepare for the worst.”“Find that outlet for your frustrations and do it regularly.”“Have the wisdom to pick your battles. And once you have, the flexibility and resiliency of strategies to use in those battles…”“Sometimes, coping with stress consists of blowing down walls. But sometimes it consists of being a blade of grass, buffeted and bent by the wind but still standing when the wind is long gone.”"

11,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22409011-brendan-monroe,5,"I'm a major stresser. I stress over big things, over little things, over all things. Because I'm a stresser, I'm all too often a stressor (i.e. a person or thing that causes stress) for the people around me. It sucks, really. I don't like stressing, something that all those who are constantly telling me to ""calm down,"" ""chill out,"" ""relax!"" just don't seem to get.It's not like I can just flip a switch here. If only!It worries me, because of course, along with stressing, I'm also anxious. Yes, anxiety is a constant companion. I worry all the time that I don't have enough time, so I spend all my time worrying. Time, money, people ... these are the main things that cause me stress and anxiety, but they certainly aren't the only ones. I worry because I stress. Mainly because, if I get so stressed going to the grocery story (and I very much do), how will I handle something truly monumental? Like, say, the death of a loved one, or bad health news? (I have, for now, been incredibly fortunate to not to have had to deal with either.)My stress sometimes starts off over small things, not emailing a friend who emailed me a month ago, say, forgetting to pick up toothpaste, and then spirals into greater stresses, what I call ""tomorrow stresses"" (though my stress is happening very much in the present moment). I don't have health insurance, so what if something happens to me and I need to go the doctor? What if I can't pay my rent? What if I am forced forced to work in an office again? (god forbid!)I very much have tried/am trying to get my anxiety/stress under control. No, I won't take anxiety medication. I flat out refuse to even consider the prospect of anti-depressants or the like (I'm not really depressed anyway ... I don't think). I've always viewed pills as the worst sort of coping mechanism (well, aside from harder drugs like alcohol or heroin, that is). Always having to constantly up the dosage to maintain the same feeling of ... numbness. No thanks.No disrespect intended to anyone who takes prescription meds, by the way. Whatever you need to get you through the day. I just know that it's not something I can envision for myself ...So I've tried other things.I've downloaded a meditation app and one of these days — tomorrow, let's say, as I do every day — I will actually start it. I bought and read this book, which I otherwise wouldn't have done.It's a very good book. I liked it a lot and I'm glad I read it. Boiling down stress to various chemical elements, leading to an over abundance of glucocorticoids, leading to umm, bad things, helps ... I think. It takes the emotional component out of it, makes it feel more mechanical, like a broken chain on a bicycle that can, maybe, be fixed.Some might complain that of the 18 chapters that make up ""Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers,"" only the final one, ""Managing Stress,"" actually tells you how to, uh, manage stress. But those 17 former chapters are equally as important. For one thing, they give you a better idea of the effects of stressing out (spoiler: they're not good), which was, yes, stressful to learn about. But for another, the cumulative effect of all the various stressors, of learning the hows and the whys of it all, is oddly comforting. Many would likely consider a book about stress a particularly timely read, in light of, well, the times. Which is a funny thing, because I've found — pathologically? — that I'm possibly less stressed now than I was before. In some way, it again goes back to the idea of time, of missing out on life, on things. Misery does love company, and the fact that so many people are, sadly, miserable at the current moment — isolated in their homes, unable to attend any sort of gatherings or events as they've all been canceled — comforts me as I know that 1. I'm not alone and 2. I'm not missing out on anything.Yes, maybe I'm a villain ripped straight from a comic book. At least credit me for my honesty.And that's the one aspect I wish Robert Sapolsky — who I feel I'd very much like as a person — had covered, albeit my edition (the third, released in 2004) may have been slightly too old for that, Millennial that I am.Which is whether there is any truth to the idea that anxiety and stress may be not just individual, but generational as well. You often hear, or at least I do, that Millennials are more prone to stress, more anxious, than their generational predecessors. There are, of course, many very reasonable explanations for this.Student debt. Gross inequality. Global warming. Helicopter parenting. Stricter moral upbringings. Growing up in the age of global terrorism. General disenchantment with modern politics. Untempered capitalism. Doubts as to whether one can truly make a difference, etc etc etc, ad infinitum. Because when I talk to my Millennial counterparts, I don't feel unique in my anxiety, in my stress over how to survive, how to make a living, in 2020. Nobody seems to have the answers, and the general advice from our elders seems to be ""don't worry so much"" when indeed there seems to be so much to worry about. It's an anxiety stemming not from a fear of nonexistence, of our mortality, but of existence itself, of reconciling with the fact that a human existence bears no more meaning than an animal one, because we are, after all, just animals. We struggle to reconcile with this fact, to cope with the reality that there is no meaning to any of it. The only answer, then, is to make our own meaning. To find it in books, in relationships, in writing, in forms of expression that will outlast ourselves. You may even find it here."
12,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20989544-laura,5,"A brilliant and incredibly well-written book.Every time I read something by Sapolsky I get amazed with how prodigious he is. No matter what he's talking about, everything he says is interesting and engaging. That summarises my feelings with this book. I don't find the stress subject very interesting, just because I often suffer from it, therefore I prefer to act like it doesn't exist, but unexpectedly, this helped me realize that I've been doing the entirely wrong thing (want to know why? read this book). However, don't come to this book expecting to get advice for your stress problems. This book will teach you about how your body reacts to stress, why it happens, the biology and chemistry behind it and also, how it could end up killing you. Just in the last chapter, Sapolsky will specifically talk about what could you do about it, though repetively saying that it's an entirely subjective thing. This summarizes it:By now, if you are not depressed by all the bad news in the preceding chapters, you probably have only been skimming. Stress can wreak havoc with your metabolism, raise your blood pressure, burst your white blood cells, make you flatulent, ruin your sex life and if that's not enough, possibly damage your brain. Why don't we throw in the towel right now?One of the greatest things about Sapolsky's books, it's that though some things are difficult to get, he will continually repeat what you have learned and how everything it's connected. Some topics may be hard, but he will do everything to make it clear for you."
13,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,5,"Dr. Sapolsky is everything you could want from an author on a serious topic like stress: a world-class leader in the field of research, a clear and perceptive writer, and equal parts hilarious and profound. Learning about the physiology and psychology of stress would be interesting either way, but learning about it through his book is at least doubly so. Highly recommended."
14,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/205426-nick-weeks,3,"Well researched book. Sapolsky, who I am a big fan of, explains why certain types of stresses like long work days end up having more serious negative effects on your physiology than do other types of stress such as a lion chasing after you. Sure the lion stresses you out then and there but a week from now your bodily functions won't still be affected by it. My one beef with this book is that it doesn't give you much in the way of how to handle stress. I felt somewhat more stressed after reading reading this book because I finally had a good understanding of all of its negative effects but still didn't know what to do about it...."
15,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"I've been wanting to read this ever since I saw a documentary on stress that included Sapolsky's research.In the meantime, I've also become fairly interested in the human microbiome. So, this kinda played right into all of that... so as far as books, this was pretty much my introduction to the field of stress research, as well as how human digestion works and where hormones and neurotransmitters come from and what they can do, etc... that said, I did this one as an audiobook, which might not have been entirely appropriate to the level of detail contained. Maybe I should come back to it someday."
16,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11056171-jahed,5,"Should be compulsory reading for every high school biology student. A thorough dismantling of the reductionist cell biology mindset of the 20th century, Sapolsky shows you how very complex and intricate the interaction is between organism and environment, and how 'genes' may be overrated in a lot of ways."
17,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19538101-kristina,5,This manifestation of stress is going to my 'books to give friends as a gift' list. The topic is morbid but written in a way that makes it a must read for anyone interested in managing their own well being and avoiding brain shrinkage. 
18,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/157265-chris-herdt,4,"This book is a good introduction to stress and its effects on physiology and psychology (Nicola's area of expertise). Although it is written for a lay audience, I often got the feeling it was written for a lay audience of primarily MDs.By the end of the book, you will feel like you and epinephrine, norepinephrine, and glucocorticoids are all old friends--but in spite of the terminology, it is really an easy read and full of good humor and interesting anecdotes (e.g. hyenas are very peculiar).Here is a quote, taken out of context, that I enjoyed:""Every child cannot grow up to be president; it turned out that merely by holding hands and singing folk songs we couldn't end all war, and hunger does not disappear just by visualizing a world without it....Would that it were so. And shame on those who would sell this view.""You may not like all of his opinions. Sapolsky is an unapologetic atheist, but appears to have a high opinion of many religious people. He also speaks frankly about sex. He also believes in animal testing, although he thinks that some past tests went too far."
19,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7700-kyle,5,"First off, Sapolsky is a delightful writer. For a rather depressing book on all the scientifically understood harmful effects of stress, this book is often laugh out loud funny. But beyond that, Sapolsky is brilliant. He makes complex topics seem simple, but doesn't simplify to the point of losing the complexity. Quite a feat. If you are ever curious about examining what stress really is, and what effect it has on your body, this book is a must-read (especially useful I think for yoga teachers)."
20,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26517939-bouke,5,"This book is fantastic and I’ve been telling everyone who listens about it. It explains the mechanics of how stress works on a biological level, not holding back on naming names when it comes to hormones and glands and all that. The author managed to make the book accessible while simultaneously being in-depth, which I really appreciate. I recommend it for anyone who’s ever stressed (which is everyone) and wants to understand why this happens and what is going on in your body. "
21,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9351312-asim,3,"I enjoyed this book but think for most people this book will not be more than a 3.5* hence the rating. My bias is simply that I and am a big fan of Dr Sapolsky after attending his course on Human Behavioral Biology. He covers the driest of things with humor and charm. I would recommend the first four lectures to everyone. Our body is designed to respond to stressful situations. We are, just like the zebra, wired to temporarily alter our physiology when a lion shows up during our leisurely afternoon stroll. The difference is the zebra goes back to regular life after, but humans seem to treat a myriad of situations as if the lion is back and the stress-response that the body goes through takes a toll on our bodies.Take the cardiovascular system. When you see the lion (or have an important presentation or an impending difficult conversation), your body starts prepping and marshaling all the resources in the body to get the hell out of there. Your digestive tract shuts down, breathing rate skyrockets, the heart beats faster and your blood pressure goes up. This entire routine saves you from being lunch but is expensive in the long run. For example, as part of the response, the blood pounds through your veins and returns with deafening force to the heart. Now, if this happens very often, the walls of the heart will be forced to thicken to accommodate this regular flood and cause ventricular hypertrophy. In addition, if you chronically increase the force with which blood is coursing through the vessels they have to work harder, it needs more muscle, this thick layer of muscle makes it more rigid and more resistant to flow hence persistent high blood pressure.As he describes it, your heart is basically a pump with hoses. Subject it to this treatment too often and it will wear out. He then goes on to cover ulcers, aging, sleep, metabolism etc.The bottom line is this : Chill out and don’t kill yourself. If you want the details read the book, otherwise just remember that most of the stressors in your life are not really life-threatening so leave the panic for when you do meet the lion."
22,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8982990-paul-barnes,3,"I read this on the recommendation of an Ezra Klein podcast.Unlike zebras, we get stressed because we're constantly worrying about the future.Takeaways included: sleep is really valuable and waking up for hours in the middle of the night is a classic symptom of depression; prolonged depression elevates risk of heart disease three- to four-fold; abusive parenting lifts the risk of adult depression; the role of learned helplessness; feeling chronically time-pressured is a function of a chronic need to prove oneself due to feeling insecure.There are no silver bullets. Only to strive for more of a sense of control, more predictability, more outlets and more social affiliation."
23,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1798996-valerie,0,"To summarize: Adrenaline is a DEATH drug. It's designed to keep you alive for the next 15 seconds, or to ease your death. As such, it's necessarily thriftless. If you can survive to the 16th second only by losing a limb, it's worthwhile to sacrifice the limb. Otherwise, it's wasteful and disabling.Zebras don't get ulcers because they (mostly) only release stress hormones 'in the event of an actual emergency'. Humans deliberately evoke stress on an everyday basis, and the reckless decisions the body makes under the influence of stress hormones, too often, results in the loss of limbs, supression of the immune system, etc.Recommendation: don't pull the fire alarm unless there's a real fire."
24,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This book is simply exquisite. Sapolsky is a fantastic scientist as well as a wonderful writer. In this book, he will help you understand the evolutionary purpose of the stress response and elucidate why we differ so much from other animals. We humans have a useful stress response but use it in very unuseful ways. If you read this book, you will be treated to the wonderful and unexpected story of J.M. Barrie, author of Peter Pan. What does his life have to do with the neuroscience of stress? Read and find out! You will not be disappointed. "
25,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22929435-m,4,"I finished it at last! I did like it but the journey was such a pain. It was the first science-y book I read and the beginning was tough. But I do think I’ve learnt a lot, and hopefully it will stick for my exam haha. "
26,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74483112-alexandra-ricu,5,An amazing science communicator. Just read it. Reviews are boring. 
27,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26634995-doris-jean,5,"This is an excellent book, I don't know why I had such a hard time beginning it, I kept starting and stopping it for several years. Maybe this was because the writer has a somewhat rambling and loose style. Finally, I forced myself to get through the first few pages and the book got better and better once I relaxed into the writer's way of thinking.It's an unusual book because it explains deep medical concepts for everyone, and it is a relaxed read considering the subject matter. It's a good review for doctors. The graphs are good. There are about fifty-five cartoons sprinkled throughout. There is an excellent section of Notes (almost a hundred pages) and a fairly skimpy index (he left out FOADS, lordosis, etc.). If you plan to read this book, do a quick overview study of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids (cortisol, etc.) are powerful steroid hormones and are released from the adrenal cortex and are players in all body functions. Stress of every kind can release them. Zebras don't get ulcers because they don't use their brains to think stressfully and worry as humans do. When survival is threatened, zebras instinctively react to flee or fight and that's the end of it. Humans have survival thoughts which are often imaginary, as in anxiety and panic attacks. Humans worry and stress themselves unnecessarily. That's my conclusion from the book, but there was much more information, especially about hormones and the nervous system and how behavior and body chemistry is influenced by thought. This book also reinforced for me a conclusion that joy and happiness and pleasure are probably more important than anything else for good health.When we merely think, we stimulate the hypothalamus and pituitary and adrenal glands (the ""HPA axis"") to release various extremely powerful physiological chemicals such as cortisol and adrenalin. Stress and negative thoughts can cause illness when our thoughts and feelings are too negative and and stress can release an imbalance of these powerful substances which can actually damage the brain with atrophy of the hypothalamus and loss of brain volume. There are chapters dealing with heart disease, ulcers, bowel dysfunctions, sex, auto-immune diseases, AIDS/HIV, pain, addictions, diabetes, inflammation, sleep, depression, aging, memory, dwarfism, fetal touch and more – you name it. More and more, there seems to be a major psychological factor in most disease. Disease can start with thoughts.My least favorite chapter was on ""Cancer and Miracles"" where the author calls Bernard Seigel's book ""Love, Medicine and Miracles"" gibberish and worse. Saporsky says ""...inflamed me when first reading this book"" and he spends three pages telling how horrible Seigel's book is. Saporsky is soundly against New Age spirituality. I have not read Seigel's book and I have not studied New Age thinking, but I thought much of Saporsky's book seems to support love, medicine and miracles, especially where he describes how important fetal touch is and how actual dwarfism can develop from lack of maternal love. His example is the author of ""Peter Pan"", J. M. Barrie who was only five feet tall from lack of love.Pregnant women should think happy thoughts because it's been shown that thoughts of the mother can physically affect the fetal brain. FOAD (the fetal origin of adult disease) shows dramatic metabolic imprinting from the mother. This imprinting includes the early programming of the fetal brain with lifetime imprinting of the cortisol axis. So it's not enough to keep stress out of your own life, you need to have had a happy, contented pregnant mother when you were a fetus."
28,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"A hugely informative book that served as a refresher of all my Biopsych courses, only harder and more complicated. Sapolsky missed his calling as a comedian. He's genuinely likeable, and there really aren't that many physiology books currently on the market that can be described as ""laugh out loud funny"".But I did. I LOL'd. Unabashed.The take-home (or punchline, as Sapolsky was fond of referring to every thought that wasn't a quip -- but after 560 pages of the guy, I can say with a fair degree of authority that the irony was deliberate) is a continual state of stress ramps up your glucocorticoids which, essentially, burns you out. Diverts power from the thrusters, eats holes in your stomach, gives your immune system blind spots -- pretty much anything that sucks. I liked his fond remembrances of his time among the baboons, stress within primate hierarchies, and any other lapses into evolutionary psych he made. But then, I tend to. I also liked how, after writing a book about stress, he strongly implied that meditation does nothing to help aside from in the moments when you're actively (inactively?) meditating, and religiousness/spirituality doesn't make you healthier, or prone to faster recovery, or anything except less stressed if your child has cancer.Crowning achievement of the book was the Classic Coke anecdote. Genius.Honorable mention to the warpath he went on regarding Dr. Siegel, the loon M.D. who initially perpetuated the flagrantly erroneous belief that you can just shrug off cancer if you keep a positive attitude and powerful faith in God. And I quote:""This is relatively benign gibberish, and history buffs may even feel comforted by those among us who live the belief system of medieval peasants.""Savage.I was also a big fan of his stress-avoidance recommendations. ""Don't be born poor"" most of all. Huh. Good idea. The whole SES section was fascinating, if deeply disheartening and vaguely socialistic. But, hey! Can't argue with math. I was intrigued by rich people experiencing more stress in higher income-inequality countries, but I don't think ""cuz they're always on guard to keep poor people out of their sweet mansion"" is the actual reason. That was a stretch. Li'l more research needed on that front, I reckon.If nothing else, I walked away from this book with intimate knowledge of a hormone I didn't know existed, and a whole lexicon of new medical jargon with which to alienate friends and loved ones. "
29,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56943009-joshua-r-taylor,3,"This is a great book (with a shed load of references to boot) about what stress is, how it works and how it's caused. Others have complained that this book has a relatively short section on ""Managing Stress"" for a book that claims to be a ""Guide to Stress"". I believe that decent understanding of the condition effecting me is the best step I can take towards self healing, and as such I find this book extremely useful and brimming with knowledge I can apply in my own stressful life. This may not be the case for everyone so take my praise with a grain of salt.The writing style is very academic, it's written to inform and is structured so it's easy to skim and find the content that's relevant to you. Most of the book can be skimmed, I'd suggest looking at topic sentences and reading a paragraph only if the topic seems surprising or interesting—reading this cover-to-cover would be a bore unless you had an existing interest in biology, psychology and neurology all at once.How stress interacts with existing mental conditions, such as depression and anxiety, is also covered in great detail giving a very down-to-earth explain-like-I'm-five description of how they're triggered in the brain. Requires you to remeber a few complex chemical names like 'glucocorticoids' and 'beta-endorphins' but is pretty accessible once you grasp the meanings of these.Recommended for anyone who wants to understand more about their mental health, why they get so stressed all the time and why stress need to be seriously dealt with."
30,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1978321-bob-klein,2,"Sapolsky is an amazing writer and Primate's Memoir ranks as one of my favorite books. That said, the title, cover, and prior experience with Primate's Memoir led me to have unrealistic expectations of this book. It is thorough and well-written, but approaches the topic of stress from a phsyiological perspective that doesn't spare any of the details. As such, it often calmed my stress by putting me to sleep. The subtitle's promise of a section on ""coping"" with stress didn't pan out, and amounted to a few pages of an attempt at the end of the book. If you're looking for a tutorial on the physiology of stress and its relationship to a wide variety of human ailments and conditions (sickness, age, gender, etc.) then you might like this more than I did."
31,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3183576-cheri,4,"Fascinating info! Not only is Sapolsky a renowned scholar, he's a wonderful story teller. Even his explanations of complicated physiological cascades are easy to follow. The book is about the stress response, in animals and in humans, and the basic take-home lesson is that stress is a double edged sword. This is not a self-help book (do this and feel better), but a book to clarify something that we all experience (stress) and discuss how it affects us, and what the science says might help or harm, maybe, in particular circumstances. The book is worth it for Chapter 17 alone, in which Sapolsky examines the devastating effects of poverty, especially the perception of poverty in the midst of plenty, and its multi-generational biological effects."

Essentially, I have learned that every stressful event causes me to lose days off my life, which caused me to stress out, which shortened my life, which stressed me out... you get the point.I glazed over a bunch of the scientific stuff... which actually says something because I took these classes in college on purpose. I think that's what it was... I felt like I was back in school. There were a few very interesting snippets, which is why I bumped this to 2 stars. That's it... no more to say... time to move on.."

It reads as if it wasn't written, but dictated, by someone who loves the sound of his own voice -- Gilderoy Lockhart teaching a sophomore psych seminar.

For example: “This is how gratification postponement works—the core of goal-directed behavior is expectation. Soon we’re forgoing immediate pleasure in order to get good grades in order to get into a good college in order to get a good job in order to get into the nursing home of our choice.”Big Ideas:+ Acute and chronic stress are different, as are physiological and psychological stress. Humans have a unique capacity to stress about perceived future dangers and to ruminate on past stressors- “It is not so much that the stress-response runs out, but rather, with sufficient activation, that the stress-response can become more damaging than the stressor itself, especially when the stress is purely psychological. This is a critical concept, because it underlies the emergence of much stress-related disease. That the stress-response itself can become harmful makes a certain sense when you examine the things that occur in reaction to stress. They are generally shortsighted, inefficient, and penny-wise and dollar-foolish, but they are the sorts of costly things your body has to do to respond effectively in an emergency. And if you experience every day as an emergency, you will pay the price. If you constantly mobilize energy at the cost of energy storage, you will never store any surplus energy. You will fatigue more rapidly, and your risk of developing a form of diabetes will even increase. The consequences of chronically activating your cardiovascular system are similarly damaging: if your blood pressure rises to 180/100 when you are sprinting away from a lion, you are being adaptive, but if it is 180/100 every time you see the mess in your teenager’s bedroom, you could be heading for a cardiovascular disaster. If you constantly turn off long-term building projects, nothing is ever repaired”- “If stress enhances some function under one circumstance and disrupts it under another, think time course, think 30-second sprints across the savanna versus decades of grinding worry. Short-term stressors of mild to moderate severity enhance cognition, while major or prolonged stressors are disruptive”- “One of the themes of this book is the goal of contrasts. Physical stressor, you want to activate a stress-response; psychological stressor, you don’t. Basal conditions, as little glucocorticoid secretion as possible; real stressor, as much as possible. Onset of stress, rapid activation; end of stress, rapid recovery”+ As with so many situations in life (so far this is the theme of 2019), when it comes to coping with stress, CONTEXT MATTERS!- “Sometimes, coping with stress consists of blowing down walls. But sometimes it consists of being a blade of grass, buffeted and bent by the wind but still standing when the wind is long gone”- Not everything is purely psychological, especially once we have a disease. We can’t psychologically heal ourselves from cancer and it’s dangerous to imply that we can. = “Stress is not everywhere. Every twinge of dysfunction in our bodies is not a manifestation of stress-related disease. It is true that the real world is full of bad things that we can finesse away by altering our outlook and psychological makeup, but it is also full of awful things that cannot be eliminated by a change in attitude, no matter how heroically, fervently, complexly, or ritualistically we may wish”= Yet, “there remains a whole realm of health and disease that is sensitive to the quality of our minds—our thoughts and emotions and behaviors. And sometimes whether or not we become sick with the diseases that frighten us at two in the morning will reflect this realm of the mind. It is here that we must turn from the physicians and their ability to clean up the mess afterward and recognize our own capacity to prevent some of these problems beforehand in the small steps with which we live our everyday lives”- Socioeconomic status impacts which coping methods are most effective. Internal locus of control is more effective for higher SES individuals. When we really can’t control a situation, it’s important to acknowledge that= “Certain techniques for reducing stress work differently depending on where you dwell in your society’s hierarchy”= “Always attributing events in life to your own efforts (an internal locus of control) is highly predictive of lifelong health among that population of individuals who are the epitome of the privileged stratum of society—Vaillant’s cohort of Harvard graduates. However, in a world of people born into poverty, of limited educational or occupational opportunities, of prejudice and racism, it can be a disaster to be a John Henry, to decide that those insurmountable odds could have been surmounted, if only, if only, you worked even harder—John Henryism is associated with a marked risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease”+ Some potentially universal principles of stress management- “I would apply the 80/20 rule to stress management: 80 percent of the stress reduction is accomplished with the first 20 percent of effort”- “This business about the calm amid the arousal isn’t just another way of talking about ‘good stress’ (a stimulating challenge, as opposed to a threat). Even when the stressor is bad and your heart is racing in crisis, the goal should be to somehow make the fraction of a second between each heartbeat into an instant that expands in time and allows you to regroup. There, I have no idea what I’m talking about, but I think there might be something important lurking there. Enough said”Other Ideas:+ The placebo effect is important and real. It operates in some areas but not others and involves endorphins- “Believing you’ve received an effective medical treatment when you actually have not has no beneficial effects for epilepsy, elevated cholesterol levels, infertility, a bacterial infection, Alzheimer’s disease, anemia, or schizophrenia… [And there is] a clear indication that placebo effects are highly effective against pain”- “[Placebos] work by releasing endogenous opioids. As but one example of the evidence for that, block opiate receptors with naloxone, and placebos no longer work”+ Hostility, rather than “type A personality,” increases the risk of disease. This may be due to underlying time-pressuredness and insecurity that lead to hostility - “More recent studies have shown that hostility is associated with a significant overall increase in mortality across all diseases, not just those of the heart. Friedman and colleagues stuck with an alternative view. They suggested that at the core of the hostility is a sense of ‘time-pressuredness’... and that the core of being time-pressured is rampant insecurity. There’s no time to savor anything you’ve accomplished, let alone enjoy anything that anyone else has done, because you must rush off to prove yourself all over again, and try to hide from the world for another day what a fraud you are. Their work suggested that a persistent sense of insecurity is, in fact, a better predictor of cardiovascular profiles than is hostility”- “The 'executive stress syndrome' is mostly a myth—people at the top give ulcers, rather than get them. Most studies have shown that it is middle management that succumbs to the stress-related diseases. This is thought to reflect the killer combination that these folks are often burdened with, namely, high work demands but little autonomy—responsibility without control”+ Trying to avoid our emotions may actually amplify them physiologically- “Repressing the expression of strong emotions appears to exaggerate the intensity of the physiology that goes along with them”- “A lesson of repressive personality types and their invisible burdens is that, sometimes, it can be enormously stressful to construct a world without stressors”+ Male erections don’t always signal sexual arousal. This is especially important information for male victims of sexual assault who had an erection during the incident- “Among many social mammals, males have erections during competitive situations as a sign of dominance. If you are having a dominance display with another male, you get an erection and wave it around in his face to show what a tough guy you are. Social primates do this all the time”Potent Quotables:“In the face of strong winds, let me be a blade of grass. In the face of strong walls, let me be a gale of wind.” Quaker sayingAs a physiologist who has studied stress for many years, I clearly see that the physiology of the system is often no more decisive than the psychology… [There are] things we all find stressful—traffic jams, money worries, overwork, the anxieties of relationships. Few of them are “real” in the sense that a zebra or lion would understand. In our privileged lives, we are uniquely smart enough to have invented these stressors and uniquely foolish enough to have let them, too often, dominate our lives. Surely we have the potential to be uniquely wise enough to banish their stressful hold."

It’s not as repetitious as this may sound though. Having read Behave, this book reveals an earlier stage in Sapolskys writing. Almost as witty, just as dense and thorough. I like how science is being explained in a way that doesn’t make you feel like a novice (which I definitely am by the way) Sapolsky stays away from assumptions, challenges status quo but also challenges science itself and in the process doesn’t take himself too seriously. Yes, the book is dense but never boring.Even though the book is really good, it’s a bit too one sided though and therefore doesn’t reach the level Behave absolutely did reach. No regrets on reading it though and still worth four well deserved stars."
43,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4012281-dani-the-pluviophile-writer,4,"A science book with footnotes you'll actually want to read!4/5 stars.Paperback,560 pages.Read from March 27, 2019 to April 24, 2019.Review at The Pluviophile Writer: https://bit.ly/2WwA3NNWhen this book was recommended to me I thought it was a self-help book for whatever reason. It's not. Not really. And for that, I'm grateful as it's one the most clever, accessible, and engaging science reads I've come across.Sapolsky is a professor of biological sciences, neurology and neurological sciences and based on his candid writing style, is exactly the kind of prof you would go out of your way to take a class with. He writes about the science he is passionate about and includes funny personal anecdotes and relevant studies to his work. If you don't read the footnotes in this book you're really going to miss out as it was one of my favourite aspects of this book. Seriously, hilarious.Sapolsky's book opens with some biology basics that is a nice refresher on high school content. It may feel technical at first, but as Sapolsky points out, he uses the lingo so much through the book and explains it in such simple terms that it's easy to progress through the chapters. He takes you through how stress affects every single aspect of our body. It's actually deeply unnerving to read and, dare I say it, stressful! The funny footnotes and candid comments that Sapolsky makes throughout the book are necessary to counterbalance the anxiety-inducing facts he is laying on you about prolonged stress and disease. Sapolsky also discusses why our stress response is different than that of all the other species in the worlds and how our modern world doesn't do our stress responses any favours. The also talks about why our stress response is essential, despite some of its faults.In a way, what Sapolsky is stating isn't anything we didn't really already know it's just nice (scary) to have the science behind it. He also explores the social and political aspects of stress as well and how it plays in with the science of stress. For example, being poor gives you a higher chance of having stress-related diseases. Of course, this makes sense when you have trouble meeting your basic needs which are the number one cause of major stress in any species. Additionally, he also explores how relationships and religion can play a part in easing or exasperating stress and stress-related diseases. “Medicine is a social science, and politics nothing but medicine on a large scale.” The book concludes with a short chapter on what you can do to help combat prolonged stress to reduce your chances of getting a stress-related disease. I was actually hoping there would be more in this chapter after all the anxiety-inducing stress facts Sapolsky loads you with, especially considering some major stress factors are from uncontrollable circumstances. I genuinely enjoyed reading this book and I think it would be a good read for anyone interested in an engaging science read on our modern lifestyles. However, this book may not be the best book for excessive worriers or hypochondriacs, probably best to stick to self-help books on stress if you consider yourself one of these types.

44,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Sapolsky’s book examines why stress and stress-related illnesses are rampant in humans. As the title suggests, prey on the Serengeti Plain, animals that are chased by fierce and fast predators, aren’t nearly so likely to suffer the ill effects of stress—despite living in a harsher world than most of humanity. To oversimplify, this has a lot to do with the fact that one downside of our big brains is an ability to obsess about what has happened and what might happen, and our sympathetic nervous system (i.e. the fight or flight mechanism) can be triggered even when there is no immediate threat in reality. In short, humans can uniquely worry themselves to death. Sapolsky gets into much great detail and lets the reader know what is known and what remains to be uncovered with respect to stress.In almost 600 pages, arranged into 18 chapters, Sapolsky covers human stress in fine detail. While it’s a book written for a lay audience, it’s not a quick and easy read. The book discusses topics like the action of neurotransmitters and hormones, and, while it assumes no particular science background, it does assume a broadly educated and curious reader. The chapters begin by looking at the stress mechanism from a physiological perspective. It then considers stress with respect to specific illnesses, the relationship between stress and various other topics in human being (e.g. sleep, pain, and memory.) The final chapter offers insight into how one can reduce one’s bad stress and one’s risk of stress-related illness. Among the most interesting topics are what personalities are particularly prone to stress-related illness and why psychological stress (as opposed to stress based in immediate real world stressors) is stressful. Sapolsky has a sense of humor and knows how to convey information to a non-expert audience, but this isn’t the simplest book on the subject. It’s an investment of time and energy to complete reading this book, but it’s worth it if one’s interest in the subject is extensive enough. One of the strengths of the book is that it stays firmly in the realm of science. Because stress has been wrongly considered a fluff subject, many of the works on the topic—even those by individuals with MD or PhD after their names—have been new-agey or pseudo-scientific. This book stays firmly in the realm of science. Sapolsky explains what the studies have shown, and he tells the reader clearly when there is a dearth of evidence or contradictory findings. If the reader has a deep interest in stress-related health problems, I’d highly recommend this book. "
45,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12536207-anjan,5,"The title and cover can be misleading, but don't judge this book by the cover. This is a book about Neuro endocrinology that doesn't talk down to the reader. The book gets five stars because it gave me a window into how the researchers thinker. The first half of this book is lay introduction to some (but def not all) the functions of ephedrine, norephedrine, and glococotoids in the human body. It includes discussion of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. More importantly, he walks through the historical dialogue on the research. The second half the book provides analysis of recent literature connecting psychology/ neurochemisty / and therapy. Not a lot about zebras here, but helpful comparisons between human and baboon societies. A lot of time going through the nuances of studies and their methodologies about anxiety, depression, addiction, religion, etc, and their links to biochem and culture.It get's five stars because it is filled with information about how your body works and is written with humor and honest by an emphatic author. He makes sure to bracket the tentative conclusions, his feelings, and biases. For example, he points out he grew up religious, is now an atheist, but still thinks religion is special in a way he can't articulate. I believe he is honest about his confusion because of the earnest tone imbued in the rest of the book.Perhaps you can read the second half before the first."
46,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2783328-meg,5,"Everyone should read this book! A highly readable (and very funny) exploration of how stress affects human health. The book is a little long (as it covers a lot of ground) but it reads quickly, and the science descriptions were extremely lucid and easy to follow. I appreciated that the author repeated frequently that the mind-body connection can never be reduced to either ""It's all genes"" or ""It's all in your mind"", and refused to buy into either extreme. I felt he had a very sane approach to this.I wanted more from the last chapter (which dealt with ""How do you decrease stress?"") and kind of wished that suggestions had been integrated into the end of each topic chapter. I felt the recommendations didn't include enough in the way of somatic or mind-body interventions - e.g., yoga, working with the felt sense, using visualization/ imagery, etc. He didn't even address whether any of those things have been shown to be helpful with stress. For me, it's important to know: once stress has affected your health, are there mind-body interventions that will help to improve your health or at least maintain it?I wasn't 100% sure if the science is fully accurate/ up to date. There have been several editions of this book; the latest is from 2004, so there has certainly been more research done since then."
47,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445487-terence,4,"I like to throw a little nonfiction onto my night stand every now and then to help broaden my horizons and to learn a little more about new subject areas. And this was the perfect book for just that. The author writes in a lucid style infused with a sense of personal familiarty and playfulness that helps ameliorate some of the denser concepts. And though I didn't take notes as I was reading there is a little part of me that regrets that I didn't. Even so I come away from this with a much great appreciation for our biological systems in general and more specifically with the integrated roll stress impacts and imparts on the physiological and pyschological, and vice versa. For those with general science interests, curious about the topic area, or just wanting to gain new insight into the human condition, then this is one you'll want to explore further. And as to how I came across it, I happened upon the YouTube/Stanford University collaboration where various classes were filmed. One series took place in Sapolsky's classroom, and I was immediately struck by his teaching style and the subject area. A few quick searches, and here I was. And I'm glad of it. This was a read I won't soon forget and that will no doubt help inform my thinking moving forward."
48,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24914252-yuriy-stasyuk,5,"This book is a tour de force of the physiological processes that drive or are derived from human nature, decisions, and reactions as they related to stress related diseases. Its not so much a healthcare book as it is an scientific explanation for the existential malaises that so dauntingly ravage the human mind. Its nearly over-detailed explanations of the chemical processes that mediate our anxities and depressions drive home each point with incredible precision. If the book has any weaknesses it would be that the section on dealing with stress is rather brief, but the 17 chapters beforehand (95% of the book) suggest ways of biofeedback and coping by showing us themes, rather than giving us overt instructions. And honestly, thats what I prefer, the science of ""why"" as opposed to a set of simple rules. Sometimes the best way to affect ones mind is to explain their situation rather than urge them to leave it. Sometimes, the power comes from knowing, and Sapolsky is the wizard of empowering through knowledge."
49,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42782354-guilherme-zeitounlian,5,"This is an amazing book with a fairly simple idea: we need acute, infrequent stressors (such as zebras get when fleeing from a lion) instead of chronic, permanent stressors (such as worrying about the future, fighting with the boss, and having an abusive relationship).That's why zebras don't get ulcers - and worriers do.But it goes much deeper than that, with chapters about glucocorticoids, depression, control and predictability, and much more.The animal studies are fascinating (lots of rats and baboons) and make good reading. And, although I get the feeling that the results would not transfer as readily for humans, the implications are fun to think about.I don't think most people would like or even benefit from this book (it can get kind of dense), but for those interested and physiology and psychology (and any intersection those areas might have) that's a great read. 5/5"
50,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,5,"A brilliantly written analysis of stress. The basics are simple and well understood, but Sapolsky gets into the details and they are fascinating. For example, if a child suffers extreme stress, he/she can simply stop growing. In a Victorian example, a family with two sons suffered the death of the older child from one of those dread Victorian diseases. The mother took to her bed and refused to recognize the younger son for the rest of her life, instead greeting him as the ghost of her dead son whenever he came into her bedroom. He stopped growing, and as an adult was barely five feet tall. His name was Barrie, and he went on to write Peter Pan and other stories about children who never grow up. Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers is probably the best science book I've ever read. "
51,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/417915-kevin,5,"Years ago I read A Primate's Memoir and was enthralled at Sapolsky's style of writing, sense of humor, and ability to communicate complex scientific ideas into fully graspable concepts for non-scientists. This last year, I've been battling stress related illness, and I was recommended this book by health professionals. This book is no exception to Sapolsky's brilliance, style, humor, politically nuanced lessons, outstandingly easy to understand explanations of complex neuropharmacology processes, etc! Absolutely AWESOME. This is a MUST READ for anyone dealing with stress related issues ranging from gastrointestinal function to clinical depression."
52,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60405-katie,3,"This is a pretty good book on stress, in animals as well as humans. I like his scientific style (though as with most academics, his prose style could be improved). He has a straight-forward way of presenting complex information without dumbing it down too much (I've been comparing it to an actual endocrinology textbook). The end of the book also provides a much-needed element of perspective on what it really means to be poor in America, discussing why universal health care won't make a huge difference to the health of the poor, for example. "
53,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/164149-sarah-evan,5,"I really appreciated this Stanford academic's take on stress - he involved his exceptional understanding of human biology as it relates to stress to real-life scenarios. Additionally, the chapters were well separated so the reader can bounce around to what interests her. I highly recommend the whole book for anyone who is interested in the topic of stress (reduction), but also if you suffer from one of the chapter headings (e.g. depression or weight issues) the single chapter can help you get a handle on why that ailment is such a struggle esp. under stress. "
54,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121974-jason-quest,1,"I can't comment on the factual accuracy of the bulk of this book, because it's outside my field of expertise, but the material about J. M. Barrie ranges from carelessly inaccurate to outright fictitious. Sapolsky claims to have researched the writer's life, but gets many basic facts wrong, and appears to have invented things (e.g. sadomasochistic writings, a history of child sexual abuse) which no biographer has ever mentioned. See http://neverpedia.com/pan/Why_Zebras_... for details."
55,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105475763-phil-kariuki,5,"I may be a bit biased. I really like Robert Sapolsky. I've taken his human biology course online, and he's very kind when you email him. The book is a thorough examination of stress in the contemporary context, and there's a tonne of scientific jargon in some parts of the book. You can, however, get through it but I recommend you spend a bit of extra time and effort to actually understand what he's trying to convey. In general, Stress is bad for you. Like really bad, and do whatever you can in your current environment to get rid of it. "
56,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37614490-bailey-marissa,3,"While it can get a bit boring due to the science-focused explanations, it is very informative and anyone who has taken a physiological psychology class, or anyone who wants to know how stress can affect you physically, will appreciate this book. PLEASE NOTE: Part of physiological psychology and stress is talking about sex. This walks the line between blunt and graphic but does it due to how the body works together, so it is for a purpose. Recommended 16+ for all of the science, the adult part in chapter 2, discussions of sex, and topics that younger readers may not understand."
57,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4253114-tyler,4,"Let's be clear this is not light-reading. It is funny fairly often but it is long and fairly tough going. This is not because the author is a bad writer, he is a great writer. I wouldn't want to read this by any other author. This is not a medical textbook but this is not your normal pop-science book. You will learn a ton about your body and how it functions. I still need to re-read the chapters explaining immune system functioning, heart disease and a few others to really get those. "
58,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38563844-mike-difilippo,0,"So much to learn about how the body works! This guy has spent a lifetime studying primates and in particular how their brains work - memory, emotion, inherited and learned behaviors, etc... The author admits that the surface has just been scratched or rather pierced but he's got so many fascinating stories to tell about what he's learned. I may only understand parts of what he discusses but that's enough for a great, scientific read. "
59,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85987-ivi,4,"Really neat book about stress. The author has a lot of expertise on the subject and a great sense of humor, so even what would normally be hard to understand biology, is very easy to read. I partuclarly enjoyed the second half of the book where stress is contexualized in terms of social factors (e.g. income inequality)and psychological ones. "
60,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266448-lucas,5,"Very good book about the physiology of stress. It goes in depth about what stress is, how it affects various aspects of health, mood and cognition, what causes stress (physical and psychological), and has a tacked-on chapter about stress-avoidance techniques. I highly recommend it to anyone who as struggled with stress, pain, depression, etc."

This is an excellent book if you like *explanations* for why things happen (stress, i.e.) and its (multitudinous) effects on the body. If you're looking for ways to mitigate stress, this probably isn't the book for you. Overall, a useful framework for the physiological effects of stress."

For some reason I thought that a book that had been out for over a decade would be outdated - I was wrong. Not only has the book been updated for the latest release, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers is thorough, detailed, funny and full of fascinating information on how stress affects us even before birth. Highly recommended. "
63,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51505682-jeff,4,"This book explains much of the scientific knowledge of how health is influenced by factors such as genetics, environment, mental outlook, and socio-economic status.

Note that acute stress response is highly adaptive as we pool bodily resources for immediate use and ""pause"" long term functions: accelerated heart/lung action, inhibition of digestion, increased blood flow to muscles, dilation of pupils, suppression of immune system...Let's run away from the lion first, then digest our food later. In the modern, westernized world however, our stress response activates mostly psychologically, and its this ""chronic stress"" that kills us, slowly.Sapolsky then discusses the (mostly deleterious) effects of (chronic) stress on physiological health: metabolism, cardiovascular health, digestion, cancer, memory formation, sleep, sexual performance...with detailed notes of the interplay between our nervous-immune-endocrine systems. The next part of the book deals with psychological factors: biology of depression, addiction, personality, temperaments and social hierarchies. There's one chapter at the end on tips on how to deal with stress.Main story is: we are all different in how we respond to stressors: some of us cope better to certain things than others. Because we can't pick our parents genes, dealing with stress mostly comes to exercise, meditation, having a supportive social circle, having outlets of frustration and most importantly: having the cognitive flexibility to tend to our emotional needs. Sometimes having an internal locus of control helps, sometimes outright denial and ""blaming it on the cosmos"" helps. The physiological consequences of chronic stress are mostly inevitable, it's up to us to figure out how to manage stress in the long term."

IMO, Peter Berkrot's narration fit Sapolsky's style well: at least they've now both managed to surprise and induce laughter in a similar manner. Some combination of the book's structure and its narration caused me to conclude that it's a bit too entertaining for five stars. This is a great and humorous introduction to stress and coping, but for further study, I think I'd prefer learning and understanding stress mechanisms in a more clear if drier format. But no worries; this (audio)book is a blast of contents+style and probably the funniest I've found as well.ContentsSapolsky RM (1994) (17:17) Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers - The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping01.

Amazing. And now for a few random factoids that I just had to mark:* Your circulatory is so well bifurcated (blood vessels branching out to capillaries) that no cell in your body is more than 5 cells away from a blood vessel, yet the circulatory system takes up only 3% of your body mass.* Birth weights in the lowest 25% (adjusted for length, I believe) vs. the highest 25% - the former have a 50% higher rate of death from heart disease due to metabolic imprinting on the fetus (this whole section on fetal imprinting was craaaazy)* Throughout hominid history, if you're running 26 miles a day, you're either very intent on eating someone or someone's very intent on eating you. (Sapolosky warning against the pitfalls of extreme exercising; though regular, moderate exercise is definitely a good thing as it helps your body prepare for stressful situations by reducing the novelty and lessening the harmful effects)* Conflicting reports on stress and the course of cancer (stress CANNOT cause you to get cancer, for the record). However some of this attributed to the changing culture of cancer. In 1961, 90% of American physicians said they did not typically reveal a cancer diagnosis to their patients (!!!). By 1981, it was down to 3%.* Stress-induced analgesia - during times of stress, the perception of pain is lower. The extremes range from a badly wounded soldier in battle not realizing he's been shot until several minutes later to the positive benefits of moderate exercise. With regards to stress-induced analgesia, for men it is activated in competitive situations (from sports to video game playing. Seriously.). For women, exercise induces the same effect. * Endorphins is science slang for endogenous morphine* Neurogenesis (the formation of new cells) is especially active in the olfactory area of the brain during pregnancy and is perhaps the cause of extreme sensitivity to smells and frequent nausea. * Glucocorticoids like steroids in clinical use is bad news for neurological diseases that involve a precarious hippocampus (ie a stroke) as GCs are known to kill hippocampal cells if there is too much GCs in the body.* Some species (ie mallards) sleep with one eye and the half of the brain that responds to it awake to watch for predators. Dolphins can swim while sleeping and some birds can fly.* There is LOTS of brain activity during REM sleep; some regions are even more metabolically active than when you're awake. * During REM sleep, metabolism in the frontal cortex plummets, disinhibiting the limbic system (the limbic system is also the part of the brain to mature last and is one reason childreen and teens have tend to not make the wisest decisions). This is why dreams have such a strange quality and why random stuff sometimes happens. * The brain is 3% of your body weight but uses 25% of the energy. Sleep allows these energy stores to be built up.* The Type A personality type was discovered when an upholsterer absent-mindedly commented that he replaced the upholstery on the chairs of cardiologists' waiting room chairs far more often than any other setting. The patients were literally sitting on the edge of their seats and wearing down the upholstery in that spot and on the arms really quickly. Type As, especially those with hostile personalities, are very prone to all sorts of illnesses, especially heart-related ones. * The technical term (per Sapolsky) for an adrenaline junkie is a transiently and moderately increased levels of GCs junkies* Socioeconomic status (SES) accounts for a very large portion of your health outlook. Unsurprisingly, the poor have the worst outlook while the affluent have the best. There is a 5 - 10 year difference in life expectancy in some countries when comparing the poorest and the wealthiest. * A 1967 study showed that the poorer you are judged to be (based on the neighborhood you live in, your home, your appearance) the less likely paramedics are to try to revive you on the way to the hospital. In more recent studies, your perceived SES influenced the quality of care after a stroke (liklihood of receiving add'l therapies such as speech, physical, etc. and length of time to undergo surgery to repair the damaged blood vessel that caused the stroke.* Private affluence vs. public squalory"
76,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76740103-jed,4,This book is full of science about the human brain and hormones. It is very helpful for understanding how we work and why we do what we do. I liked the very brief end part about how to improve health. I wish the author would write more about that. The science in this book was fascinating but sometimes hard to follow. 
77,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4121833-bea-elwood,4,Published in '98 this book spends a good amount of time dedicated to explaining how stress causes diseases - well written examples and explanations you might still enjoy reading. I would like to see more pages like the last chapter that deal with how to reduce the stress; but still enough material here to get you thinking even after 22 years.
78,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48451466-max,4,"Great book about stress in a medical sense. It describes the mechanism of stress following from different causes. Quite informative and nicely written, though a little medical knowledge is needed to understand all of it. I missed a part on how you can bring your body into stress by eating/drinking or using drugs. That would have been an interesting addition!"

Anxiety is about dread and foreboding and your imagination running away with you. Much as with depression, anxiety is rooted in a cognitive distortion. In this case, people prone toward anxiety overestimate risks and the likelihood of a bad outcome.""""It takes surprisingly little in terms of uncontrollable unpleasantness to make humans give up and become helpless in a generalized way."""
87,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39706251-lyuboslava-pampulova,4,A lot of things were repeated along the book. The topic is intresting though.

The author presents scientific data in an accessible manner, with lots of examples, has good humour and never polarises the discussion by taking definitive sides – hence underlining how complex his field of work and study is, there are no definite binaries (A isn't always followed by B, etc.)."
90,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266448-lucas,5,"Very good book about the physiology of stress. It goes in depth about what stress is, how it affects various aspects of health, mood and cognition, what causes stress (physical and psychological), and has a tacked-on chapter about stress-avoidance techniques. I highly recommend it to anyone who as struggled with stress, pain, depression, etc."
91,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036930-alex-linschoten,4,"More like 3.5. This is an excellent book if you like *explanations* for why things happen (stress, i.e.) and its (multitudinous) effects on the body. If you're looking for ways to mitigate stress, this probably isn't the book for you. Overall, a useful framework for the physiological effects of stress."

For some reason I thought that a book that had been out for over a decade would be outdated - I was wrong. Not only has the book been updated for the latest release, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers is thorough, detailed, funny and full of fascinating information on how stress affects us even before birth. Highly recommended. "
93,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51505682-jeff,4,"This book explains much of the scientific knowledge of how health is influenced by factors such as genetics, environment, mental outlook, and socio-economic status. It is fascinating how your body responds to various events. Long ago, these responses helped to ensure survival. Now they often lead to various health issues."
94,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79746213-harlin-stuart,5,"Robert Sapolsky has an extensive background in neuroscience, and in this book it shows. WZDGU is clearly written and accessible, and great overview of the hazards of stress and how to cope. I read this as part of a class curriculum and would recommend it as a leisure read for those interested in stress, scientist and non-scientist alike. "
95,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3901371-rob,1,A list of qualifications as long as your arm but in the one section I bothered to read he sounded like a charlatan. He still maintains that stress causes when we know that a bacteria does. He even describes how this amazing discovery came about but he still goes down the stress path.
96,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67022591-osman-t-may,3,"The subject matter is not for the faint of heart; this is definitely not the scientific work for the layman.

97,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12604188-cyrus-molavi,3,"I liked it and learned a bit about stress, but it dragged. There are about four too many chapters and each topic gets a bit too much depth in terms of research methodology and physiological mechanisms. Still, it was interesting and entertaining at times."
98,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29015027-sarah-mansour,4,"Magnificent book about the consequences of stress physiologically on all different aspects of health disease and conditions like immunity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, depression.. etc. With a minute touch on how to deal with stress."
99,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22839142-ana,5,Well written and really funny. This all sums up for a really easy read even with all those scientific terms.

102,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75618360-tien-manh,5,"Approachable, filled with research, examples and light-hearted anecdotes book on the detrimental effects of (chronic) stress.The book starts off with a quick intro on the physiology of stress: the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic, parasympathetic), the fight-or-flight response and the neurotransmitters/hormones involved. Note that acute stress response is highly adaptive as we pool bodily resources for immediate use and ""pause"" long term functions: accelerated heart/lung action, inhibition of digestion, increased blood flow to muscles, dilation of pupils, suppression of immune system...Let's run away from the lion first, then digest our food later. In the modern, westernized world however, our stress response activates mostly psychologically, and its this ""chronic stress"" that kills us, slowly.Sapolsky then discusses the (mostly deleterious) effects of (chronic) stress on physiological health: metabolism, cardiovascular health, digestion, cancer, memory formation, sleep, sexual performance...with detailed notes of the interplay between our nervous-immune-endocrine systems. The next part of the book deals with psychological factors: biology of depression, addiction, personality, temperaments and social hierarchies. There's one chapter at the end on tips on how to deal with stress.Main story is: we are all different in how we respond to stressors: some of us cope better to certain things than others. Because we can't pick our parents genes, dealing with stress mostly comes to exercise, meditation, having a supportive social circle, having outlets of frustration and most importantly: having the cognitive flexibility to tend to our emotional needs. Sometimes having an internal locus of control helps, sometimes outright denial and ""blaming it on the cosmos"" helps. The physiological consequences of chronic stress are mostly inevitable, it's up to us to figure out how to manage stress in the long term."

IMO, Peter Berkrot's narration fit Sapolsky's style well: at least they've now both managed to surprise and induce laughter in a similar manner. Some combination of the book's structure and its narration caused me to conclude that it's a bit too entertaining for five stars. This is a great and humorous introduction to stress and coping, but for further study, I think I'd prefer learning and understanding stress mechanisms in a more clear if drier format. But no worries; this (audio)book is a blast of contents+style and probably the funniest I've found as well.ContentsSapolsky RM (1994) (17:17) Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers - The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping01.

The author presents scientific data in an accessible manner, with lots of examples, has good humour and never polarises the discussion by taking definitive sides – hence underlining how complex his field of work and study is, there are no definite binaries (A isn't always followed by B, etc.)."
120,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266448-lucas,5,"Very good book about the physiology of stress. It goes in depth about what stress is, how it affects various aspects of health, mood and cognition, what causes stress (physical and psychological), and has a tacked-on chapter about stress-avoidance techniques.

Note that acute stress response is highly adaptive as we pool bodily resources for immediate use and ""pause"" long term functions: accelerated heart/lung action, inhibition of digestion, increased blood flow to muscles, dilation of pupils, suppression of immune system...Let's run away from the lion first, then digest our food later. In the modern, westernized world however, our stress response activates mostly psychologically, and its this ""chronic stress"" that kills us, slowly.Sapolsky then discusses the (mostly deleterious) effects of (chronic) stress on physiological health: metabolism, cardiovascular health, digestion, cancer, memory formation, sleep, sexual performance...with detailed notes of the interplay between our nervous-immune-endocrine systems. The next part of the book deals with psychological factors: biology of depression, addiction, personality, temperaments and social hierarchies. There's one chapter at the end on tips on how to deal with stress.Main story is: we are all different in how we respond to stressors: some of us cope better to certain things than others. Because we can't pick our parents genes, dealing with stress mostly comes to exercise, meditation, having a supportive social circle, having outlets of frustration and most importantly: having the cognitive flexibility to tend to our emotional needs. Sometimes having an internal locus of control helps, sometimes outright denial and ""blaming it on the cosmos"" helps. The physiological consequences of chronic stress are mostly inevitable, it's up to us to figure out how to manage stress in the long term."

IMO, Peter Berkrot's narration fit Sapolsky's style well: at least they've now both managed to surprise and induce laughter in a similar manner. Some combination of the book's structure and its narration caused me to conclude that it's a bit too entertaining for five stars. This is a great and humorous introduction to stress and coping, but for further study, I think I'd prefer learning and understanding stress mechanisms in a more clear if drier format. But no worries; this (audio)book is a blast of contents+style and probably the funniest I've found as well.ContentsSapolsky RM (1994) (17:17) Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers - The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping01.

134,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51271722-wendy,4,"The definitive guide on how chronic stress will mess you up and finally kill you.Sapolsky is immensely brilliant, funny and measured. He provides all the up to date research studies, the current scientific data, and chemistry of stress along with the consequences on our bodies, minds, and emotions.In his final chapter, he provides all the ""possible"" ways to manage stress, but even then warns us that one size does not fit all. He refuses to offer a panacea of hope; he remains cautious and balanced. Some people deal better than others. Religion works for some, not for others. Exercise works for a few hours after the exercise but then not. Meditation works while you are meditating and only if you have been practicing for a long time. He gives us caveats to every solution, and I appreciated this honesty.It comes down to, as I understand it, each individual being PROACTIVE, in creating a management plan to deal with the stressors in our lives.His down to earth humour makes this book a winner. It makes the scientific data, although voluminous, extremely accessible. For example, when he offered some new theory scientists are exploring, making an ""energized calm"" a proactive choice during stressful situations, he expounds on the work being done in the area. At the end he says:""There, I have no idea what I am talking about, but I think there might be something important lurking there. Enough said.""Enough said, indeed.The subject of the book is that stress is killing us and the book is encyclopedic in its scope. At times I felt ""hammered"" by all the information and all the ways in which our well-being is compromised.Glad I read it, but feel like I want to get into bed under the doona and hibernate for a while."
135,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1587865-ashley,5,"Major props to Sapolsky for taking such a complex, technical issue and simultaneously making it readable and not painful. He keeps a light tone throughout, cracking some not unfunny jokes along the way (and multiple references to The Onion - what else could you ask for?). And this man knows his stuff - the notes alone take up almost 100 pages and are definitely worth a skim for some extra tidbits he throws in there. Sapolsky thoroughly and methodically walks the reader through how stress affects every aspect of your body from memory to reproduction to illness. Replete with examples, diagrams, and easy-to-follow (honest!) explanations I learned so much from this book. The main theorem is two-fold: A) wild animals are only stressed when they're about to be eaten. Humans, have the ""luxury"" of psychological stress. That is, we spend inordinate amounts of time worrying about traffic, money, relationships, work, etc. We're smart enough to bring these stressors upon ourselves, but not quite smart enough to keep them from threatening to overake us. Hence the title of the book. B) Stress is not, in and of itself bad. There's an ideal amount of stress that will balance a person between complete boredom and frantic scrambling. However, the effects of stress on the body read like a laundry list of WebMD ailments and are, frankly, scary. Fortunately, after scaring the pants off the reader (albeit in a very nice and humorous way - seriously, his writing style was amazing) - Sapolsky begins to talk about the upside. Coping strategies (denial vs. acceptance and how they can be alternately wonderful and horrible depending on the situation), outlets, social support, etc. The physiological explanations behind how the body reacts in a nanosecond by nanosecond play-by-play were my favorite parts. Stress is a common enough occurence that you know the obvious physical signs; that Sapolsky was able to explain what my body is actually doing when under stress was fascinating. The interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the release of CRH by the hypothalmus that cause the release of ACTH by the pituitary, and the way ACTH signals the the adrenals to dump glucocorticoids (this word is ALL over this book, so I hope you like it as much as I do - they are the key to everything stress-related). Amazing. And now for a few random factoids that I just had to mark:* Your circulatory is so well bifurcated (blood vessels branching out to capillaries) that no cell in your body is more than 5 cells away from a blood vessel, yet the circulatory system takes up only 3% of your body mass.* Birth weights in the lowest 25% (adjusted for length, I believe) vs. the highest 25% - the former have a 50% higher rate of death from heart disease due to metabolic imprinting on the fetus (this whole section on fetal imprinting was craaaazy)* Throughout hominid history, if you're running 26 miles a day, you're either very intent on eating someone or someone's very intent on eating you. (Sapolosky warning against the pitfalls of extreme exercising; though regular, moderate exercise is definitely a good thing as it helps your body prepare for stressful situations by reducing the novelty and lessening the harmful effects)* Conflicting reports on stress and the course of cancer (stress CANNOT cause you to get cancer, for the record). However some of this attributed to the changing culture of cancer. In 1961, 90% of American physicians said they did not typically reveal a cancer diagnosis to their patients (!!!). By 1981, it was down to 3%.* Stress-induced analgesia - during times of stress, the perception of pain is lower. The extremes range from a badly wounded soldier in battle not realizing he's been shot until several minutes later to the positive benefits of moderate exercise. With regards to stress-induced analgesia, for men it is activated in competitive situations (from sports to video game playing. Seriously.). For women, exercise induces the same effect. * Endorphins is science slang for endogenous morphine* Neurogenesis (the formation of new cells) is especially active in the olfactory area of the brain during pregnancy and is perhaps the cause of extreme sensitivity to smells and frequent nausea. * Glucocorticoids like steroids in clinical use is bad news for neurological diseases that involve a precarious hippocampus (ie a stroke) as GCs are known to kill hippocampal cells if there is too much GCs in the body.* Some species (ie mallards) sleep with one eye and the half of the brain that responds to it awake to watch for predators.

Note that acute stress response is highly adaptive as we pool bodily resources for immediate use and ""pause"" long term functions: accelerated heart/lung action, inhibition of digestion, increased blood flow to muscles, dilation of pupils, suppression of immune system...Let's run away from the lion first, then digest our food later. In the modern, westernized world however, our stress response activates mostly psychologically, and its this ""chronic stress"" that kills us, slowly.Sapolsky then discusses the (mostly deleterious) effects of (chronic) stress on physiological health: metabolism, cardiovascular health, digestion, cancer, memory formation, sleep, sexual performance...with detailed notes of the interplay between our nervous-immune-endocrine systems. The next part of the book deals with psychological factors: biology of depression, addiction, personality, temperaments and social hierarchies. There's one chapter at the end on tips on how to deal with stress.Main story is: we are all different in how we respond to stressors: some of us cope better to certain things than others. Because we can't pick our parents genes, dealing with stress mostly comes to exercise, meditation, having a supportive social circle, having outlets of frustration and most importantly: having the cognitive flexibility to tend to our emotional needs. Sometimes having an internal locus of control helps, sometimes outright denial and ""blaming it on the cosmos"" helps. The physiological consequences of chronic stress are mostly inevitable, it's up to us to figure out how to manage stress in the long term."

IMO, Peter Berkrot's narration fit Sapolsky's style well: at least they've now both managed to surprise and induce laughter in a similar manner. Some combination of the book's structure and its narration caused me to conclude that it's a bit too entertaining for five stars. This is a great and humorous introduction to stress and coping, but for further study, I think I'd prefer learning and understanding stress mechanisms in a more clear if drier format. But no worries; this (audio)book is a blast of contents+style and probably the funniest I've found as well.ContentsSapolsky RM (1994) (17:17) Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers - The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping01.

164,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51271722-wendy,4,"The definitive guide on how chronic stress will mess you up and finally kill you.Sapolsky is immensely brilliant, funny and measured. He provides all the up to date research studies, the current scientific data, and chemistry of stress along with the consequences on our bodies, minds, and emotions.In his final chapter, he provides all the ""possible"" ways to manage stress, but even then warns us that one size does not fit all. He refuses to offer a panacea of hope; he remains cautious and balanced. Some people deal better than others. Religion works for some, not for others. Exercise works for a few hours after the exercise but then not. Meditation works while you are meditating and only if you have been practicing for a long time. He gives us caveats to every solution, and I appreciated this honesty.It comes down to, as I understand it, each individual being PROACTIVE, in creating a management plan to deal with the stressors in our lives.His down to earth humour makes this book a winner. It makes the scientific data, although voluminous, extremely accessible. For example, when he offered some new theory scientists are exploring, making an ""energized calm"" a proactive choice during stressful situations, he expounds on the work being done in the area. At the end he says:""There, I have no idea what I am talking about, but I think there might be something important lurking there. Enough said.""Enough said, indeed.The subject of the book is that stress is killing us and the book is encyclopedic in its scope. At times I felt ""hammered"" by all the information and all the ways in which our well-being is compromised.Glad I read it, but feel like I want to get into bed under the doona and hibernate for a while."
165,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1587865-ashley,5,"Major props to Sapolsky for taking such a complex, technical issue and simultaneously making it readable and not painful. He keeps a light tone throughout, cracking some not unfunny jokes along the way (and multiple references to The Onion - what else could you ask for?). And this man knows his stuff - the notes alone take up almost 100 pages and are definitely worth a skim for some extra tidbits he throws in there. Sapolsky thoroughly and methodically walks the reader through how stress affects every aspect of your body from memory to reproduction to illness. Replete with examples, diagrams, and easy-to-follow (honest!) explanations I learned so much from this book. The main theorem is two-fold: A) wild animals are only stressed when they're about to be eaten. Humans, have the ""luxury"" of psychological stress. That is, we spend inordinate amounts of time worrying about traffic, money, relationships, work, etc. We're smart enough to bring these stressors upon ourselves, but not quite smart enough to keep them from threatening to overake us. Hence the title of the book. B) Stress is not, in and of itself bad. There's an ideal amount of stress that will balance a person between complete boredom and frantic scrambling. However, the effects of stress on the body read like a laundry list of WebMD ailments and are, frankly, scary. Fortunately, after scaring the pants off the reader (albeit in a very nice and humorous way - seriously, his writing style was amazing) - Sapolsky begins to talk about the upside. Coping strategies (denial vs. acceptance and how they can be alternately wonderful and horrible depending on the situation), outlets, social support, etc. The physiological explanations behind how the body reacts in a nanosecond by nanosecond play-by-play were my favorite parts. Stress is a common enough occurence that you know the obvious physical signs; that Sapolsky was able to explain what my body is actually doing when under stress was fascinating. The interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the release of CRH by the hypothalmus that cause the release of ACTH by the pituitary, and the way ACTH signals the the adrenals to dump glucocorticoids (this word is ALL over this book, so I hope you like it as much as I do - they are the key to everything stress-related). Amazing. And now for a few random factoids that I just had to mark:* Your circulatory is so well bifurcated (blood vessels branching out to capillaries) that no cell in your body is more than 5 cells away from a blood vessel, yet the circulatory system takes up only 3% of your body mass.* Birth weights in the lowest 25% (adjusted for length, I believe) vs. the highest 25% - the former have a 50% higher rate of death from heart disease due to metabolic imprinting on the fetus (this whole section on fetal imprinting was craaaazy)* Throughout hominid history, if you're running 26 miles a day, you're either very intent on eating someone or someone's very intent on eating you. (Sapolosky warning against the pitfalls of extreme exercising; though regular, moderate exercise is definitely a good thing as it helps your body prepare for stressful situations by reducing the novelty and lessening the harmful effects)* Conflicting reports on stress and the course of cancer (stress CANNOT cause you to get cancer, for the record). However some of this attributed to the changing culture of cancer. In 1961, 90% of American physicians said they did not typically reveal a cancer diagnosis to their patients (!!!). By 1981, it was down to 3%.* Stress-induced analgesia - during times of stress, the perception of pain is lower. The extremes range from a badly wounded soldier in battle not realizing he's been shot until several minutes later to the positive benefits of moderate exercise. With regards to stress-induced analgesia, for men it is activated in competitive situations (from sports to video game playing. Seriously.). For women, exercise induces the same effect. * Endorphins is science slang for endogenous morphine* Neurogenesis (the formation of new cells) is especially active in the olfactory area of the brain during pregnancy and is perhaps the cause of extreme sensitivity to smells and frequent nausea. * Glucocorticoids like steroids in clinical use is bad news for neurological diseases that involve a precarious hippocampus (ie a stroke) as GCs are known to kill hippocampal cells if there is too much GCs in the body.* Some species (ie mallards) sleep with one eye and the half of the brain that responds to it awake to watch for predators. Dolphins can swim while sleeping and some birds can fly.* There is LOTS of brain activity during REM sleep; some regions are even more metabolically active than when you're awake. * During REM sleep, metabolism in the frontal cortex plummets, disinhibiting the limbic system (the limbic system is also the part of the brain to mature last and is one reason childreen and teens have tend to not make the wisest decisions). This is why dreams have such a strange quality and why random stuff sometimes happens. * The brain is 3% of your body weight but uses 25% of the energy. Sleep allows these energy stores to be built up.* The Type A personality type was discovered when an upholsterer absent-mindedly commented that he replaced the upholstery on the chairs of cardiologists' waiting room chairs far more often than any other setting. The patients were literally sitting on the edge of their seats and wearing down the upholstery in that spot and on the arms really quickly. Type As, especially those with hostile personalities, are very prone to all sorts of illnesses, especially heart-related ones. * The technical term (per Sapolsky) for an adrenaline junkie is a transiently and moderately increased levels of GCs junkies* Socioeconomic status (SES) accounts for a very large portion of your health outlook. Unsurprisingly, the poor have the worst outlook while the affluent have the best. There is a 5 - 10 year difference in life expectancy in some countries when comparing the poorest and the wealthiest. * A 1967 study showed that the poorer you are judged to be (based on the neighborhood you live in, your home, your appearance) the less likely paramedics are to try to revive you on the way to the hospital. In more recent studies, your perceived SES influenced the quality of care after a stroke (liklihood of receiving add'l therapies such as speech, physical, etc. and length of time to undergo surgery to repair the damaged blood vessel that caused the stroke.* Private affluence vs. public squalory"

Some combination of the book's structure and its narration caused me to conclude that it's a bit too entertaining for five stars.

194,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51271722-wendy,4,"The definitive guide on how chronic stress will mess you up and finally kill you.Sapolsky is immensely brilliant, funny and measured. He provides all the up to date research studies, the current scientific data, and chemistry of stress along with the consequences on our bodies, minds, and emotions.In his final chapter, he provides all the ""possible"" ways to manage stress, but even then warns us that one size does not fit all. He refuses to offer a panacea of hope; he remains cautious and balanced. Some people deal better than others. Religion works for some, not for others. Exercise works for a few hours after the exercise but then not. Meditation works while you are meditating and only if you have been practicing for a long time. He gives us caveats to every solution, and I appreciated this honesty.It comes down to, as I understand it, each individual being PROACTIVE, in creating a management plan to deal with the stressors in our lives.His down to earth humour makes this book a winner. It makes the scientific data, although voluminous, extremely accessible. For example, when he offered some new theory scientists are exploring, making an ""energized calm"" a proactive choice during stressful situations, he expounds on the work being done in the area. At the end he says:""There, I have no idea what I am talking about, but I think there might be something important lurking there. Enough said.""Enough said, indeed.The subject of the book is that stress is killing us and the book is encyclopedic in its scope. At times I felt ""hammered"" by all the information and all the ways in which our well-being is compromised.Glad I read it, but feel like I want to get into bed under the doona and hibernate for a while."
195,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1587865-ashley,5,"Major props to Sapolsky for taking such a complex, technical issue and simultaneously making it readable and not painful. He keeps a light tone throughout, cracking some not unfunny jokes along the way (and multiple references to The Onion - what else could you ask for?). And this man knows his stuff - the notes alone take up almost 100 pages and are definitely worth a skim for some extra tidbits he throws in there. Sapolsky thoroughly and methodically walks the reader through how stress affects every aspect of your body from memory to reproduction to illness. Replete with examples, diagrams, and easy-to-follow (honest!) explanations I learned so much from this book. The main theorem is two-fold: A) wild animals are only stressed when they're about to be eaten. Humans, have the ""luxury"" of psychological stress. That is, we spend inordinate amounts of time worrying about traffic, money, relationships, work, etc. We're smart enough to bring these stressors upon ourselves, but not quite smart enough to keep them from threatening to overake us. Hence the title of the book. B) Stress is not, in and of itself bad. There's an ideal amount of stress that will balance a person between complete boredom and frantic scrambling. However, the effects of stress on the body read like a laundry list of WebMD ailments and are, frankly, scary. Fortunately, after scaring the pants off the reader (albeit in a very nice and humorous way - seriously, his writing style was amazing) - Sapolsky begins to talk about the upside. Coping strategies (denial vs. acceptance and how they can be alternately wonderful and horrible depending on the situation), outlets, social support, etc. The physiological explanations behind how the body reacts in a nanosecond by nanosecond play-by-play were my favorite parts. Stress is a common enough occurence that you know the obvious physical signs; that Sapolsky was able to explain what my body is actually doing when under stress was fascinating. The interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the release of CRH by the hypothalmus that cause the release of ACTH by the pituitary, and the way ACTH signals the the adrenals to dump glucocorticoids (this word is ALL over this book, so I hope you like it as much as I do - they are the key to everything stress-related). Amazing. And now for a few random factoids that I just had to mark:* Your circulatory is so well bifurcated (blood vessels branching out to capillaries) that no cell in your body is more than 5 cells away from a blood vessel, yet the circulatory system takes up only 3% of your body mass.* Birth weights in the lowest 25% (adjusted for length, I believe) vs. the highest 25% - the former have a 50% higher rate of death from heart disease due to metabolic imprinting on the fetus (this whole section on fetal imprinting was craaaazy)* Throughout hominid history, if you're running 26 miles a day, you're either very intent on eating someone or someone's very intent on eating you. (Sapolosky warning against the pitfalls of extreme exercising; though regular, moderate exercise is definitely a good thing as it helps your body prepare for stressful situations by reducing the novelty and lessening the harmful effects)* Conflicting reports on stress and the course of cancer (stress CANNOT cause you to get cancer, for the record). However some of this attributed to the changing culture of cancer. In 1961, 90% of American physicians said they did not typically reveal a cancer diagnosis to their patients (!!!). By 1981, it was down to 3%.* Stress-induced analgesia - during times of stress, the perception of pain is lower. The extremes range from a badly wounded soldier in battle not realizing he's been shot until several minutes later to the positive benefits of moderate exercise. With regards to stress-induced analgesia, for men it is activated in competitive situations (from sports to video game playing. Seriously.). For women, exercise induces the same effect. * Endorphins is science slang for endogenous morphine* Neurogenesis (the formation of new cells) is especially active in the olfactory area of the brain during pregnancy and is perhaps the cause of extreme sensitivity to smells and frequent nausea. * Glucocorticoids like steroids in clinical use is bad news for neurological diseases that involve a precarious hippocampus (ie a stroke) as GCs are known to kill hippocampal cells if there is too much GCs in the body.* Some species (ie mallards) sleep with one eye and the half of the brain that responds to it awake to watch for predators. Dolphins can swim while sleeping and some birds can fly.* There is LOTS of brain activity during REM sleep; some regions are even more metabolically active than when you're awake. * During REM sleep, metabolism in the frontal cortex plummets, disinhibiting the limbic system (the limbic system is also the part of the brain to mature last and is one reason childreen and teens have tend to not make the wisest decisions). This is why dreams have such a strange quality and why random stuff sometimes happens. * The brain is 3% of your body weight but uses 25% of the energy. Sleep allows these energy stores to be built up.* The Type A personality type was discovered when an upholsterer absent-mindedly commented that he replaced the upholstery on the chairs of cardiologists' waiting room chairs far more often than any other setting. The patients were literally sitting on the edge of their seats and wearing down the upholstery in that spot and on the arms really quickly. Type As, especially those with hostile personalities, are very prone to all sorts of illnesses, especially heart-related ones. * The technical term (per Sapolsky) for an adrenaline junkie is a transiently and moderately increased levels of GCs junkies* Socioeconomic status (SES) accounts for a very large portion of your health outlook. Unsurprisingly, the poor have the worst outlook while the affluent have the best. There is a 5 - 10 year difference in life expectancy in some countries when comparing the poorest and the wealthiest. * A 1967 study showed that the poorer you are judged to be (based on the neighborhood you live in, your home, your appearance) the less likely paramedics are to try to revive you on the way to the hospital. In more recent studies, your perceived SES influenced the quality of care after a stroke (liklihood of receiving add'l therapies such as speech, physical, etc. and length of time to undergo surgery to repair the damaged blood vessel that caused the stroke.* Private affluence vs. public squalory"
196,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76740103-jed,4,This book is full of science about the human brain and hormones. It is very helpful for understanding how we work and why we do what we do. I liked the very brief end part about how to improve health. I wish the author would write more about that. The science in this book was fascinating but sometimes hard to follow. 
197,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4121833-bea-elwood,4,Published in '98 this book spends a good amount of time dedicated to explaining how stress causes diseases - well written examples and explanations you might still enjoy reading. I would like to see more pages like the last chapter that deal with how to reduce the stress; but still enough material here to get you thinking even after 22 years.
198,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48451466-max,4,"Great book about stress in a medical sense. It describes the mechanism of stress following from different causes. Quite informative and nicely written, though a little medical knowledge is needed to understand all of it. I missed a part on how you can bring your body into stress by eating/drinking or using drugs. That would have been an interesting addition!"
199,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52843-ken,5,Excellent story-telling as always with SapolskyGood to have both the physiological and the psychosocial perspective nicely blended in one neat package!
200,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1175701-mary,4,I started reading this before COVID 19 but it turned out to be very timely!

202,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7523469-brian-lueck,4,"It is very technical, but readable and understandable, and very informative."

204,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70632050-robin-tobin-on-the-back-porch-reading,4,"Interesting data to think about... A tad academic focused and blah,blah,blah... but still interesting."
205,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53376722-amy-tasukada,5,I learned so much. One of the books you have to pay attention to as you read. Good... I even wanted to read the notes
206,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1559217-mark-mulvey,4,"""...when doing science (or perhaps when doing anything at all in a society as judgmental as our own), be very careful and very certain before pronouncing something to be a norm - because at that instant, you have made it supremely difficult to ever again look objectively at an exception to that supposed norm.""""Fear is the vigilance and the need to escape from something real. Anxiety is about dread and foreboding and your imagination running away with you. Much as with depression, anxiety is rooted in a cognitive distortion. In this case, people prone toward anxiety overestimate risks and the likelihood of a bad outcome.""""It takes surprisingly little in terms of uncontrollable unpleasantness to make humans give up and become helpless in a generalized way."""
207,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39706251-lyuboslava-pampulova,4,A lot of things were repeated along the book. The topic is intresting though.
208,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8866539-joell,4,I loved all the physiology. Sapolsky writes about science with charm and grace.
209,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48432434-nathaniel,5,"This was an incredibly in-depth, erudite and detailed book about stress and many things besides (e.g. history of medicine, psychology, ethics, etc.). The author presents scientific data in an accessible manner, with lots of examples, has good humour and never polarises the discussion by taking definitive sides – hence underlining how complex his field of work and study is, there are no definite binaries (A isn't always followed by B, etc.)."
210,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266448-lucas,5,"Very good book about the physiology of stress. It goes in depth about what stress is, how it affects various aspects of health, mood and cognition, what causes stress (physical and psychological), and has a tacked-on chapter about stress-avoidance techniques. I highly recommend it to anyone who as struggled with stress, pain, depression, etc."
211,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036930-alex-linschoten,4,"More like 3.5. This is an excellent book if you like *explanations* for why things happen (stress, i.e.) and its (multitudinous) effects on the body. If you're looking for ways to mitigate stress, this probably isn't the book for you. Overall, a useful framework for the physiological effects of stress."
212,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8778400-rebekka-steg,4,"I listened to the audiobook, can't believe I waited for so long. For some reason I thought that a book that had been out for over a decade would be outdated - I was wrong. Not only has the book been updated for the latest release, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers is thorough, detailed, funny and full of fascinating information on how stress affects us even before birth. Highly recommended. "
213,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51505682-jeff,4,"This book explains much of the scientific knowledge of how health is influenced by factors such as genetics, environment, mental outlook, and socio-economic status. It is fascinating how your body responds to various events. Long ago, these responses helped to ensure survival. Now they often lead to various health issues."
214,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79746213-harlin-stuart,5,"Robert Sapolsky has an extensive background in neuroscience, and in this book it shows. WZDGU is clearly written and accessible, and great overview of the hazards of stress and how to cope. I read this as part of a class curriculum and would recommend it as a leisure read for those interested in stress, scientist and non-scientist alike. "
215,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3901371-rob,1,A list of qualifications as long as your arm but in the one section I bothered to read he sounded like a charlatan. He still maintains that stress causes when we know that a bacteria does. He even describes how this amazing discovery came about but he still goes down the stress path.
216,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67022591-osman-t-may,3,"The subject matter is not for the faint of heart; this is definitely not the scientific work for the layman. Although it is full of interesting facts and wittily told, it fails to prove that depression is a biological affair, not a psychological one."
217,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12604188-cyrus-molavi,3,"I liked it and learned a bit about stress, but it dragged. There are about four too many chapters and each topic gets a bit too much depth in terms of research methodology and physiological mechanisms. Still, it was interesting and entertaining at times."
218,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29015027-sarah-mansour,4,"Magnificent book about the consequences of stress physiologically on all different aspects of health disease and conditions like immunity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, depression.. etc. With a minute touch on how to deal with stress."
219,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22839142-ana,5,Well written and really funny. This all sums up for a really easy read even with all those scientific terms.

Amazing. And now for a few random factoids that I just had to mark:* Your circulatory is so well bifurcated (blood vessels branching out to capillaries) that no cell in your body is more than 5 cells away from a blood vessel, yet the circulatory system takes up only 3% of your body mass.* Birth weights in the lowest 25% (adjusted for length, I believe) vs. the highest 25% - the former have a 50% higher rate of death from heart disease due to metabolic imprinting on the fetus (this whole section on fetal imprinting was craaaazy)* Throughout hominid history, if you're running 26 miles a day, you're either very intent on eating someone or someone's very intent on eating you. (Sapolosky warning against the pitfalls of extreme exercising; though regular, moderate exercise is definitely a good thing as it helps your body prepare for stressful situations by reducing the novelty and lessening the harmful effects)* Conflicting reports on stress and the course of cancer (stress CANNOT cause you to get cancer, for the record). However some of this attributed to the changing culture of cancer. In 1961, 90% of American physicians said they did not typically reveal a cancer diagnosis to their patients (!!!). By 1981, it was down to 3%.* Stress-induced analgesia - during times of stress, the perception of pain is lower. The extremes range from a badly wounded soldier in battle not realizing he's been shot until several minutes later to the positive benefits of moderate exercise. With regards to stress-induced analgesia, for men it is activated in competitive situations (from sports to video game playing. Seriously.). For women, exercise induces the same effect. * Endorphins is science slang for endogenous morphine* Neurogenesis (the formation of new cells) is especially active in the olfactory area of the brain during pregnancy and is perhaps the cause of extreme sensitivity to smells and frequent nausea. * Glucocorticoids like steroids in clinical use is bad news for neurological diseases that involve a precarious hippocampus (ie a stroke) as GCs are known to kill hippocampal cells if there is too much GCs in the body.* Some species (ie mallards) sleep with one eye and the half of the brain that responds to it awake to watch for predators. Dolphins can swim while sleeping and some birds can fly.* There is LOTS of brain activity during REM sleep; some regions are even more metabolically active than when you're awake. * During REM sleep, metabolism in the frontal cortex plummets, disinhibiting the limbic system (the limbic system is also the part of the brain to mature last and is one reason childreen and teens have tend to not make the wisest decisions). This is why dreams have such a strange quality and why random stuff sometimes happens. * The brain is 3% of your body weight but uses 25% of the energy. Sleep allows these energy stores to be built up.* The Type A personality type was discovered when an upholsterer absent-mindedly commented that he replaced the upholstery on the chairs of cardiologists' waiting room chairs far more often than any other setting. The patients were literally sitting on the edge of their seats and wearing down the upholstery in that spot and on the arms really quickly. Type As, especially those with hostile personalities, are very prone to all sorts of illnesses, especially heart-related ones. * The technical term (per Sapolsky) for an adrenaline junkie is a transiently and moderately increased levels of GCs junkies* Socioeconomic status (SES) accounts for a very large portion of your health outlook. Unsurprisingly, the poor have the worst outlook while the affluent have the best. There is a 5 - 10 year difference in life expectancy in some countries when comparing the poorest and the wealthiest. * A 1967 study showed that the poorer you are judged to be (based on the neighborhood you live in, your home, your appearance) the less likely paramedics are to try to revive you on the way to the hospital. In more recent studies, your perceived SES influenced the quality of care after a stroke (liklihood of receiving add'l therapies such as speech, physical, etc. and length of time to undergo surgery to repair the damaged blood vessel that caused the stroke.* Private affluence vs. public squalory"
226,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76740103-jed,4,This book is full of science about the human brain and hormones. It is very helpful for understanding how we work and why we do what we do. I liked the very brief end part about how to improve health. I wish the author would write more about that. The science in this book was fascinating but sometimes hard to follow. 
227,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4121833-bea-elwood,4,Published in '98 this book spends a good amount of time dedicated to explaining how stress causes diseases - well written examples and explanations you might still enjoy reading. I would like to see more pages like the last chapter that deal with how to reduce the stress; but still enough material here to get you thinking even after 22 years.
228,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48451466-max,4,"Great book about stress in a medical sense. It describes the mechanism of stress following from different causes. Quite informative and nicely written, though a little medical knowledge is needed to understand all of it. I missed a part on how you can bring your body into stress by eating/drinking or using drugs. That would have been an interesting addition!"
229,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52843-ken,5,Excellent story-telling as always with SapolskyGood to have both the physiological and the psychosocial perspective nicely blended in one neat package!

Anxiety is about dread and foreboding and your imagination running away with you. Much as with depression, anxiety is rooted in a cognitive distortion. In this case, people prone toward anxiety overestimate risks and the likelihood of a bad outcome.""""It takes surprisingly little in terms of uncontrollable unpleasantness to make humans give up and become helpless in a generalized way."""
237,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39706251-lyuboslava-pampulova,4,A lot of things were repeated along the book. The topic is intresting though.

The author presents scientific data in an accessible manner, with lots of examples, has good humour and never polarises the discussion by taking definitive sides – hence underlining how complex his field of work and study is, there are no definite binaries (A isn't always followed by B, etc.)."
240,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266448-lucas,5,"Very good book about the physiology of stress. It goes in depth about what stress is, how it affects various aspects of health, mood and cognition, what causes stress (physical and psychological), and has a tacked-on chapter about stress-avoidance techniques. I highly recommend it to anyone who as struggled with stress, pain, depression, etc."
241,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036930-alex-linschoten,4,"More like 3.5. This is an excellent book if you like *explanations* for why things happen (stress, i.e.) and its (multitudinous) effects on the body. If you're looking for ways to mitigate stress, this probably isn't the book for you. Overall, a useful framework for the physiological effects of stress."

For some reason I thought that a book that had been out for over a decade would be outdated - I was wrong. Not only has the book been updated for the latest release, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers is thorough, detailed, funny and full of fascinating information on how stress affects us even before birth. Highly recommended. "
243,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51505682-jeff,4,"This book explains much of the scientific knowledge of how health is influenced by factors such as genetics, environment, mental outlook, and socio-economic status. It is fascinating how your body responds to various events. Long ago, these responses helped to ensure survival. Now they often lead to various health issues."
244,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79746213-harlin-stuart,5,"Robert Sapolsky has an extensive background in neuroscience, and in this book it shows. WZDGU is clearly written and accessible, and great overview of the hazards of stress and how to cope. I read this as part of a class curriculum and would recommend it as a leisure read for those interested in stress, scientist and non-scientist alike. "
245,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3901371-rob,1,A list of qualifications as long as your arm but in the one section I bothered to read he sounded like a charlatan. He still maintains that stress causes when we know that a bacteria does. He even describes how this amazing discovery came about but he still goes down the stress path.
246,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67022591-osman-t-may,3,"The subject matter is not for the faint of heart; this is definitely not the scientific work for the layman.

247,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12604188-cyrus-molavi,3,"I liked it and learned a bit about stress, but it dragged. There are about four too many chapters and each topic gets a bit too much depth in terms of research methodology and physiological mechanisms. Still, it was interesting and entertaining at times."
248,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29015027-sarah-mansour,4,"Magnificent book about the consequences of stress physiologically on all different aspects of health disease and conditions like immunity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, depression.. etc. With a minute touch on how to deal with stress."
249,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22839142-ana,5,Well written and really funny. This all sums up for a really easy read even with all those scientific terms.

252,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75618360-tien-manh,5,"Approachable, filled with research, examples and light-hearted anecdotes book on the detrimental effects of (chronic) stress.The book starts off with a quick intro on the physiology of stress: the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic, parasympathetic), the fight-or-flight response and the neurotransmitters/hormones involved. Note that acute stress response is highly adaptive as we pool bodily resources for immediate use and ""pause"" long term functions: accelerated heart/lung action, inhibition of digestion, increased blood flow to muscles, dilation of pupils, suppression of immune system...Let's run away from the lion first, then digest our food later. In the modern, westernized world however, our stress response activates mostly psychologically, and its this ""chronic stress"" that kills us, slowly.Sapolsky then discusses the (mostly deleterious) effects of (chronic) stress on physiological health: metabolism, cardiovascular health, digestion, cancer, memory formation, sleep, sexual performance...with detailed notes of the interplay between our nervous-immune-endocrine systems. The next part of the book deals with psychological factors: biology of depression, addiction, personality, temperaments and social hierarchies. There's one chapter at the end on tips on how to deal with stress.Main story is: we are all different in how we respond to stressors: some of us cope better to certain things than others. Because we can't pick our parents genes, dealing with stress mostly comes to exercise, meditation, having a supportive social circle, having outlets of frustration and most importantly: having the cognitive flexibility to tend to our emotional needs. Sometimes having an internal locus of control helps, sometimes outright denial and ""blaming it on the cosmos"" helps. The physiological consequences of chronic stress are mostly inevitable, it's up to us to figure out how to manage stress in the long term."

IMO, Peter Berkrot's narration fit Sapolsky's style well: at least they've now both managed to surprise and induce laughter in a similar manner. Some combination of the book's structure and its narration caused me to conclude that it's a bit too entertaining for five stars. This is a great and humorous introduction to stress and coping, but for further study, I think I'd prefer learning and understanding stress mechanisms in a more clear if drier format. But no worries; this (audio)book is a blast of contents+style and probably the funniest I've found as well.ContentsSapolsky RM (1994) (17:17) Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers - The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping01.

The author presents scientific data in an accessible manner, with lots of examples, has good humour and never polarises the discussion by taking definitive sides – hence underlining how complex his field of work and study is, there are no definite binaries (A isn't always followed by B, etc.)."
270,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266448-lucas,5,"Very good book about the physiology of stress. It goes in depth about what stress is, how it affects various aspects of health, mood and cognition, what causes stress (physical and psychological), and has a tacked-on chapter about stress-avoidance techniques.

Note that acute stress response is highly adaptive as we pool bodily resources for immediate use and ""pause"" long term functions: accelerated heart/lung action, inhibition of digestion, increased blood flow to muscles, dilation of pupils, suppression of immune system...Let's run away from the lion first, then digest our food later. In the modern, westernized world however, our stress response activates mostly psychologically, and its this ""chronic stress"" that kills us, slowly.Sapolsky then discusses the (mostly deleterious) effects of (chronic) stress on physiological health: metabolism, cardiovascular health, digestion, cancer, memory formation, sleep, sexual performance...with detailed notes of the interplay between our nervous-immune-endocrine systems. The next part of the book deals with psychological factors: biology of depression, addiction, personality, temperaments and social hierarchies. There's one chapter at the end on tips on how to deal with stress.Main story is: we are all different in how we respond to stressors: some of us cope better to certain things than others. Because we can't pick our parents genes, dealing with stress mostly comes to exercise, meditation, having a supportive social circle, having outlets of frustration and most importantly: having the cognitive flexibility to tend to our emotional needs. Sometimes having an internal locus of control helps, sometimes outright denial and ""blaming it on the cosmos"" helps. The physiological consequences of chronic stress are mostly inevitable, it's up to us to figure out how to manage stress in the long term."

IMO, Peter Berkrot's narration fit Sapolsky's style well: at least they've now both managed to surprise and induce laughter in a similar manner. Some combination of the book's structure and its narration caused me to conclude that it's a bit too entertaining for five stars. This is a great and humorous introduction to stress and coping, but for further study, I think I'd prefer learning and understanding stress mechanisms in a more clear if drier format. But no worries; this (audio)book is a blast of contents+style and probably the funniest I've found as well.ContentsSapolsky RM (1994) (17:17) Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers - The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping01.

284,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51271722-wendy,4,"The definitive guide on how chronic stress will mess you up and finally kill you.Sapolsky is immensely brilliant, funny and measured. He provides all the up to date research studies, the current scientific data, and chemistry of stress along with the consequences on our bodies, minds, and emotions.In his final chapter, he provides all the ""possible"" ways to manage stress, but even then warns us that one size does not fit all. He refuses to offer a panacea of hope; he remains cautious and balanced. Some people deal better than others. Religion works for some, not for others. Exercise works for a few hours after the exercise but then not. Meditation works while you are meditating and only if you have been practicing for a long time. He gives us caveats to every solution, and I appreciated this honesty.It comes down to, as I understand it, each individual being PROACTIVE, in creating a management plan to deal with the stressors in our lives.His down to earth humour makes this book a winner. It makes the scientific data, although voluminous, extremely accessible. For example, when he offered some new theory scientists are exploring, making an ""energized calm"" a proactive choice during stressful situations, he expounds on the work being done in the area. At the end he says:""There, I have no idea what I am talking about, but I think there might be something important lurking there. Enough said.""Enough said, indeed.The subject of the book is that stress is killing us and the book is encyclopedic in its scope. At times I felt ""hammered"" by all the information and all the ways in which our well-being is compromised.Glad I read it, but feel like I want to get into bed under the doona and hibernate for a while."
285,0805073698,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1587865-ashley,5,"Major props to Sapolsky for taking such a complex, technical issue and simultaneously making it readable and not painful. He keeps a light tone throughout, cracking some not unfunny jokes along the way (and multiple references to The Onion - what else could you ask for?). And this man knows his stuff - the notes alone take up almost 100 pages and are definitely worth a skim for some extra tidbits he throws in there. Sapolsky thoroughly and methodically walks the reader through how stress affects every aspect of your body from memory to reproduction to illness. Replete with examples, diagrams, and easy-to-follow (honest!) explanations I learned so much from this book. The main theorem is two-fold: A) wild animals are only stressed when they're about to be eaten. Humans, have the ""luxury"" of psychological stress. That is, we spend inordinate amounts of time worrying about traffic, money, relationships, work, etc. We're smart enough to bring these stressors upon ourselves, but not quite smart enough to keep them from threatening to overake us. Hence the title of the book. B) Stress is not, in and of itself bad. There's an ideal amount of stress that will balance a person between complete boredom and frantic scrambling. However, the effects of stress on the body read like a laundry list of WebMD ailments and are, frankly, scary. Fortunately, after scaring the pants off the reader (albeit in a very nice and humorous way - seriously, his writing style was amazing) - Sapolsky begins to talk about the upside. Coping strategies (denial vs. acceptance and how they can be alternately wonderful and horrible depending on the situation), outlets, social support, etc. The physiological explanations behind how the body reacts in a nanosecond by nanosecond play-by-play were my favorite parts. Stress is a common enough occurence that you know the obvious physical signs; that Sapolsky was able to explain what my body is actually doing when under stress was fascinating. The interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the release of CRH by the hypothalmus that cause the release of ACTH by the pituitary, and the way ACTH signals the the adrenals to dump glucocorticoids (this word is ALL over this book, so I hope you like it as much as I do - they are the key to everything stress-related).
